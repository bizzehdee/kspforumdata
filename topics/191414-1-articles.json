It was fun to have two sister ships. One entirely crew focused, and one entirely automated and surface base oriented. I\u0027d land all my surface base units, then the crew, and then spend some time gaining life support resources for the journey to continue. Anything to make that venture easier would make me want to do it again. Along with random failures mods, it was the most fun I\u0027ve had in KSP. Equipment had to be well designed, and last for decades against random and cumulative failures.

Sensor readings are just plain data that can be transferred between vessels without extra vehicular activities, they also can be transmitted back directly. Samples however require the delicate handling by kerbals, and cannot be transmitted but have to be recovered instead. They also can be analyzed in a lab, which converts it to data that can be transmitted. Analyzing takes a long time, happens transparently to loaded and unloaded vessels alike, and can\u0027t be cheated to create science out of thin air. An interesting method is used to bridge existing stock and third-party experiments to the new science system, that works for most experiments without requiring ad-hoc support.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#24292e;font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\nTransmission rates are realistic, and scale with distance to the point that it may take a long time to transmit data from the outer solar system.

Science experiments taking time is something that definitely should be a thing, along with life support. Maybe make certain experiments only complete-able by certain vessels, like a landed base with qualifications. So your petri dish experiment must be done on Duna, at a landed base, having at least a level x scientist in a lab, and takes x time, all the while your scientist is burning air/water/food. Then make the result fully transmit-able.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of the convoluted things about my science currently is I have research stations around 4 bodies at the moment, and I have to load and check each to transmit after each significant timewarp. I\u0027d love just a simple UI (even a mod for current KSP), which takes stock of my science generated by my stations, and transmits it without loading anything in. All it would have to do is look at science rates, generate the science value, let me hit a button to transmit, then take that science away on next vessel load.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like how there\u0027s storage for data in actual KB. The Jesus science box I constantly use having limitless experiment storage is sort of amusing. I\u0027d love to see digital data storage in proper values for KSP2 (EVA to remove a hard drive from a returned probe? :D). Maybe also requiring a network capable of transmitting at a required speed or gain to accurately receive that data, meaning I\u0027d have more incentives to try to return my probes to Kerbin at least early on, rather than having them scream past Moho at 8km/s, 500m above the surface, then transmit my science, and then proceed to not care where that probe is or is going for the rest of my game... unless it\u0027s like that one time that Moho probe then somehow found itself 100m/s from encountering Jool... Still dunno how that happened but I\u0027ll take the free science.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI haven\u0027t done anything with the Breaking Ground DLC science EVA thingies. I\u0027m actually going to check them out right now, as I\u0027m at a point in my save where it\u0027s gonna be several hundred days till my probes get where they\u0027re going (Duna/Jool/Moho probes are on their way :D). Playing with life support means excessive timewarp has me carting life support cans around my stations over and over. My Minmus and Mun ground bases don\u0027t have proper life support generation yet, though they finally do have recyclers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. I already really enjoy RemoteTech. The feeling of triumph when my probe receives its orders to turn \u0026amp; burn at exactly the time it reaches the point it needs to, billions of miles away, is a lot of fun. Transmission time delays are another thing I\u0027d like in KSP2, perhaps only in higher difficulties. Maybe a slider from realistic to instant. Already in a savegame I like to get a SCANSAT probe going on the mun and minmus super early, as well as Duna / Laythe whenever I can realistically do it, just so that when I finally get to going there for real, I have the data to set down somewhere actually useful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223736503\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022191414\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221580874740\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022100102\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Clockwork13\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 2/4/2020 at 10:52 PM, Clockwork13 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA proper API for modders.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve never created a mod, but as someone who uses over a hundred of them, and really can\u0027t live without some of them, I wholeheartedly agree.

I\u0027m completely willing to install the whole thing again. The simple scripting and the radiation zones around stuff has me quite intrigued. Problem is, I have about ten space stations with crew currently using TAC parts. Most of them are modular, so I _can_ replace the life support modules. The bases not so much, of which I have two (Minmus, Mun). Switching from TAC to Kerbalism is going to be not so fun. Going to have to crew shuttle everyone home, then try and get my bases and stations to a no-life-support status, then swap mods over. But I\u0027ll give it a go. Sigh.

So my monthly budget keeps going up as I expand out, and I take contracts for reputation only to further public decision that space is indeed the thing we want to do in life. So, just more options to prevent constraining my gameplay to \u0022you do this thing right now or you\u0027re broke\u0022, and more of my preferred gameplay of \u0022hey that planet looks neat, let\u0027s put a nuclear powered blimp on it, because the full might of Kerbal-kind says why the hell not?\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-- I\u0027d also reaaaaaaaally like some far future stuff.

Windows Movie Maker (insert gut-wrenching here). I\u0027m trying to get him on Adobe Premiere, and he loves the added controls, but finds it daunting. He loves the power the 8320 has for video stuff though. He finally has a system that can comfortably run modern creation software and\u00A0it\u0027s a massive upgrade to him.

Think I\u0027ll overclock it and watercool it at some point.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-02-08T17:28:23Z\u0022 title=\u002202/08/2020 05:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 8, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Immashift\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ETypos, adding stuffs.
