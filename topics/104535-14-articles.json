Stacking rotatrons... Never thought of that! Unfortunately, I\u0027d need 6 rotatrons on each prop, thing could get messy. I guess I\u0027m going to have to resort to kOS.\n\nThank you both for your help!"},{"CreatedByName":"Xilis","CreatedById":117133,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T12:23:08Z","Content":"Finally got some images\n\nthis is the issue in the home position\n\n![p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=]()\n\nAnd this is the same probe from a different launch that is working fine\n\n![\u003Ca  href=]()![%7Boption%7D](%7Boption%7D)http://i288.photobucket.com/albums/ll174/XilisC/2015-06-17\\_00005\\_zpsszuwgrio.jpg\u0027 alt=\u00272015-06-17\\_00005\\_zpsszuwgrio.jpg\u0027\u003E\n\nI\u0027ve used this probe 6 times the ones around Kebin Mun Minmus, and Eve are fine but the ones for Duna and the one heading to Jool are messed up. I shut down and restarted the game and the Jool probe went back to normal but the Duna was still messed and the Eve started acting up. could this be a Memory thing? I\u0027m below the 3.5G mark but The game is having a lot of page faults when its running Because I only have 4G of ram witch is shared with my Video"},{"CreatedByName":"*Aqua*","CreatedById":103926,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T13:08:52Z","Content":"The difference I see is that the faulty satellite is still attached to the rocket and the working sat isn\u0027t. Try testing if it is caused by the lifter rocket.\n\nAlso page faults... are you sure you really mean page faults? Those only happen when drivers don\u0027t work correctly or the hardware is damaged. Do you mean swapping?"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T13:14:51Z","Content":"Could you upload the craft?
