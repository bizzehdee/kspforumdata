The use of the ESC key to leave the scene. In other words, I would like to use the ESC key to leave any screen like SPH, VAB, etc. I know we can click the little orange icon on the right upper corner but sometimes we just want to \u0022leave\u0022! \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do not know if this can be achieved with a mod. If it is a matter of using a small plugin, I do use mods, to make my game harder and more real (at least for my kind of feeling what should be real) but to be honest, I think this is a very small implementation to the stock game and probably easy to do. I do not know if it is easy to implement in the base code, I am not a programmer. I leave it to you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you for your consideration and keep up the \u003Cs\u003Egood,\u003C/s\u003E excellent and amazing work that you guys are doing with KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-19T21:48:03Z\u0022 title=\u002201/19/2016 09:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 19, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Kar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-19T22:43:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInterestingly, it \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Edoes\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E do that for the tracking station... just not for the other KSC buildings.\u00A0 Seems like it ought to be hooked up.\u00A0 And not just for leaving the scene-- it should be tied to the \u0022cancel\u0022 buttons in the UI.\u00A0 For example, if I\u0027m in the VAB, and I click on the \u0022load\u0022 button, it brings up a craft browser dialog with \u0022load\u0022 and \u0022cancel\u0022 buttons.\u00A0 Pressing ESC should dismiss the dialog, same as if I\u0027d pressed \u0022cancel\u0022; but it does nothing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat said:\u00A0 1.1 is coming out very soon.\u00A0 One of the things they\u0027ve mentioned is that they\u0027re completely redoing the UI, as in \u0022pretty much rebuilding from scratch\u0022 (they kinda have to, since they\u0027re moving to a new engine).\u00A0 I wouldn\u0027t be at all surprised if this sort of fit-and-finish stuff gets better, because they\u0027re writing all new UI from scratch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I\u0027m inclined to take a wait-and-see attitude until 1.1 hits.\u00A0 Then I\u0027m sure there will be \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eplenty\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E of user suggestions on the UX.\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-20T16:02:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWould be great if the custom action groups could be activated in the VAB/SPH.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe current 1 to 4 keys could just as easy be move the F1 to F4 instead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tantalus","CreatedById":118982,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-22T17:03:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d prefer to have a key to cancel a two-step action, for examle setting a strut.
