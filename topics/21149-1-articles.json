I first saw the program on Youtube videos, and myself being a major Space geek, i was like, \u0022i am so downloading this!\u0022 The only issue that i am worried about is currently, my arrow keys don\u0027t work, and some of the instructions require arrow keys. I just hope there not major instructions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy goal is to visit all the plannet\u0027s in the game at least once, by next October. Yesterday i tried getting the \u0022Kerbal X\u0022 rocket into orbit around Kerbin, but on my first attempt, it took off, then tilted and landed in the Ocean, all three Kerbalnauts died. The second attempt i got higher, but then lost control, and one of my Kerbalnauts got the \u0022Genius\u0022 idea of doing a EVA, well about five minutes later, he face-planted into Kerbin and died, The fate of the rest of his crew is unknown at this time. I was feeling down, but then i remembered, \u0022NASA\u0027s early attempts at Spaceflight were just like this, and now look at them, they haven\u0027t lost a crew since 2003!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-02T20:13:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi PolarBearsOnASpaceship (copypasted that, no way am I typing that much) Welcome to the community \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrow keys?
