Once you can find any licensing info with the art, and that license allows free use, with or without merely crediting the artist, you\u0027re good to go. If the license is restrictive, see if the open is there to ask the artist or if you\u0027re allowed to buy it then use it as you wish, simply buy it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nIn short, try your best to find any license with the art you like.
