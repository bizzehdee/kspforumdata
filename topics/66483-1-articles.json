Not the Janeway one, although I like her too, but Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 are missions that I have followed my entire (conscious) life. Voyager 2 is STILL doing science! I saw the launch of New Horizons on Nasa TV with some other space geeks, and I\u0027m super excited for the \u0022Fastest Thing Ever\u0022 to shoot past Pluto into the kuiper belt and towards the fascinating scattered disc, perhaps glimpsing some other transneptunian objects. However, New Horizons will never overtake Voyager, due to the latters\u0027 gravity assists around the giants.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhen will we go further and faster?

Solar isn\u0027t an option, obviously. The orbital infrastructure for beamed power isn\u0027t likely to get it\u0027s budget approved; I think it will be an autonomous mission. Probably ion engines. Solar sails are unproven, magnetohydrodynamic propulsion as well-- developing those techs is prohibitively expensive, given that it needs to happen (and likely fail a few times) in deep space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I\u0027m thinking, a conventional chemical rocket assembled and launched from LEO as a transfer stage to escape velocity and an extended cruise phase with ion engines. I doubt it will really be designed to actually reach anything, but to study the interstellar medium some ways away from the heliosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI believe the JAXA are the ones who will do it, based on their willingness to do amazing stuff (the quirks of the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayabusa\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003EHayabusa\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/a\u003E missions come to mind) and their growing expertise with ion engines. Also, they describe what they are doing as \u0022pawa uppu ion engines\u0022 -- they\u0027re applying power-ups to their ion engines.

Ion engines, while possessing high specific impulse, have little in the thrust department. Chemical rockets need enormous fuel tanks for an interstellar mission, even for small probes; Voyager 1 \u0026amp; 2 took multiple gravity assists in order to get where they are now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy bet for an interstellar mission would be when the first NTR took flight. It had been studied extensively in the NERVA program, and deemed ready for integration into current spacecraft designs. If the political climate and public fears on anything nuclear were nonexistent, an NTR spacecraft could be launched in the short term.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf not NTR, photon sails could also do the job. It works by capturing light pressure, either from the Sun or a laser facility, and use it to propel the spacecraft. It needs neither propellant nor electricity from the spacecraft itself, and it works indefinitely, until the laser is turned off or the Sun died. The caveat is that it produces very small amounts of thrust; on the orders of micronewtons to millinewtons. It would take decades to make significant maneuvers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SSR Kermit","CreatedById":82781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-22T17:37:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022shynung\u0022 data-cite=\u0022shynung\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFurther, maybe, but not faster.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn space, kind of the same thing, no?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy bet for an interstellar mission would be when the first NTR took flight.

For this, things such as asteroid mining and moon mining must be feasible and relatively safe. Other than that, space manufacturing and storage facilities might also be highly profitable. A kilogram of water, while almost worthless in many parts of the world, carry premium prices in orbit because of the expense to lift them off from the surface. Same goes for various metals and elements found in moons and asteroids.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
