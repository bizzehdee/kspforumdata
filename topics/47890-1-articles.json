A lot of people manage to make not only wings with wing pieces, but sort of skins for their craft for aerodynamics and/or aesthetics. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/hH2caas.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EThis one\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E is a simpler example, but even more elaborate fuselages made entirely out of wing pieces have been made to completely encase the guts of the ship. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have tried for a while now, and I just can\u0027t get the parts to work like I want them to. I always end up wildly guessing at what the WASDQE keys will do to a piece, yet if I finally figure something out, adjusting its position only minutely on a structural element might totally throw it off. Is there a method to the madness, or is it something you just have to tinker with until you can work some magic?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"briansun1","CreatedById":67451,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-10T03:31:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eit\u0027s really just press the buttons until they do what you want. though 2 things that can help snap to angle(the c key) and holding shift while pressing wasdqe(fine movement mode) hope this helps. also you can check out the wiki for all of the keybindings als might want to get the edtools mod\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"robogungt8","CreatedById":81071,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-10T03:42:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETwo words:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eno-clip mode\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RSwordsman","CreatedById":78678,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-10T03:47:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022briansun1\u0022 data-cite=\u0022briansun1\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eit\u0027s really just press the buttons until they do what you want. though 2 things that can help snap to angle(the c key) and holding shift while pressing wasdqe(fine movement mode) hope this helps. also you can check out the wiki for all of the keybindings als might want to get the edtools mod\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know about shift already, but I haven\u0027t tried using c.

This is the same thing you see when building rockets and attaching things radially. As you move around the surface of the cylinder, the angle at which things attach changes in a stepped manner.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor cylinders attaching to cylinders, this is pretty intuitive, but it can be a real pain when attaching wings to fuselages.
