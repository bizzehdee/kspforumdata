In 24-hour days, it\u0027s usually about 70 to get there, 90 waiting there for the window home, and about 50 for the return trip, or about 210x 24-hour days, which means 420 Snacks per Kerbal, and you\u0027ll need some extras so call it an even 500. As there are no separate Snack parts in this mod, the only Snacks are those in pods/cans and a Hitchhiker only holds 800, enough for 1 but not enough for 2. Essentially, just for a round trip to Duna, you need a ratio of 2 Hitchhikers per 3 Kerbals on the crew, and it gets worse for longer trips. This quickly turns any major expedition into a ridiculous ship of dozens of Hitchhikers just for the supplies, without any mission equipment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOTOH, you can use TAC Life Support instead and do extremely long-duration missions with large crews with way less mass/volume of supplies, allowing the ship to actually do something besides carry Kerbals and their food. TAC-LS is complex and IMHO utterly unrealistic in applying human biology to alien Kerbals, but at least it lets you go to Jool and stay there a while.

In terms of Snacks/ton, the US system is about 30% more efficient but costs 50% more, although ultimately the Hitchhiker\u0027s greater mass has to be paid for in a bigger rocket. The main problem with US therefore is the sheer number of parts. 18 parts per Kerbal just for a short trip to Duna quickly adds up with both increased crew and increased mission duration, to the point of being prohibitive. And the root cause of all this is the high consumption rate of Snacks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo put the mass of Snacks and their rate of consumption in perspective, 1 Snack weighs 1 kg and a Kerbal eats 2 per (Earth) day. That\u0027s about 5 pounds of food per Kerbal per (Earth) day! Egad. Kerbals are about 1/2 human size and spend most of their lives sitting in chairs not getting any exercise at all. With that much food going in, you\u0027d think they\u0027d get so fat just going to Minmus they wouldn\u0027t be able to get out the crew hatch on arrival.

In 24-hour days, it\u0027s usually about 70 to get there, 90 waiting there for the window home, and about 50 for the return trip, or about 210x 24-hour days, which means 420 Snacks per Kerbal, and you\u0027ll need some extras so call it an even 500. As there are no separate Snack parts in this mod, the only Snacks are those in pods/cans and a Hitchhiker only holds 800, enough for 1 but not enough for 2. Essentially, just for a round trip to Duna, you need a ratio of 2 Hitchhikers per 3 Kerbals on the crew, and it gets worse for longer trips. This quickly turns any major expedition into a ridiculous ship of dozens of Hitchhikers just for the supplies, without any mission equipment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOTOH, you can use TAC Life Support instead and do extremely long-duration missions with large crews with way less mass/volume of supplies, allowing the ship to actually do something besides carry Kerbals and their food. TAC-LS is complex and IMHO utterly unrealistic in applying human biology to alien Kerbals, but at least it lets you go to Jool and stay there a while. I like Snacks because 1) it\u0027s simple and 2) I consider it more realistic than TAC-LS, but it seems geared to going no further away than Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI note that there are other mods that have Snack storage boxes and even the ability to make your own Snacks, but these haven\u0027t been updated to 0.25 and their threads seem rather dead so no telling when/if they\u0027ll get updated.

So I guess I\u0027m going back to TAC-LS despite my problems with it.

I was aware of the fact that anything beyond Duna would be pretty much impossible currently.
