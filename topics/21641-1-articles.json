If your orbit is or near-equatorial, you can get away with burning North or South on the navbal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you were to draw a line from your current orbit point through the center of the object you\u0027re orbiting TGhat\u0027s the line that your orbit will rotate around. Burn in the direction that you want the part of your orbit that\u0027s ahead of that line to pivot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to /match orbital planes/ with another target, you\u0027ll need to wait until you reach one of the two points on your orbit that go through the plane of the other object (often called orbital nodes). To find those points without Mechjeb, you\u0027ll need to go to the map screen, hit tab until the view is centered on the body both you and the other object are orbiting, and swing the view around until you find the angle where both your orbit and your target\u0027s orbit appear to reduce to straight lines. When you cross that intersection, that\u0027s where you\u0027ll need to do your inclination-change burn if you hope to put your eventual orbit into the same plane as your target\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Maddmatts","CreatedById":21071,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-08T01:34:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s kind of like a gyroscope.
