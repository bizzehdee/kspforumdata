Their absence is not an issue, although launcher.exe is in the ksp-win-1-0-4.zip along with KSP.exe\n\nSoooo - there are several versions of 1.0.4 you *could* have downloaded, depending on OS, etc. Care to specify which you have?"},{"CreatedByName":"NiccoHel","CreatedById":137742,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-11T01:03:45Z","Content":"Hi, not the original poster, but similar issue. I deleted what I had (Win 1.0.4) and tried a fresh download. Don\u0027t know why, but the exe file wasn\u0027t there, again, so I rinsed and repeated. I guess third times the charm, eh? \n\nStill having problems though, because KSP will start, but then freezes on the load screen. For the sake of experimentation, I deleted the part file that it was hung up on (one of the Squad engines, but I don\u0027t recall now), and tried loading again. Loaded past that point, then froze on some other random part file. I figure the download was corrupted or something, so I\u0027m currently installing again. \n\nCrossing my fingers."}]}
