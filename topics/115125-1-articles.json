I deleted what I had (Win 1.0.4) and tried a fresh download. Don\u0027t know why, but the exe file wasn\u0027t there, again, so I rinsed and repeated.

For the sake of experimentation, I deleted the part file that it was hung up on (one of the Squad engines, but I don\u0027t recall now), and tried loading again. Loaded past that point, then froze on some other random part file.
