I\u0027m playing a hard career I started after the 1.0.2 release.\n\nThe launch window to Duna nearly caught me by surprise, as I was doing some tourist runs (Kerbin-\u003EMun-\u003EMinmus-\u003EKerbin, Up to 4 tourists, I tried to fill up remaining space with Kerbals to be rescued around Mun and Minmus). Those missions took a lot of time, so here it is, the Duna launch window.\n\nAs the launch windows take quite some time to reappear, everything has to be perfect. Another mission (landing a 5 Kerbal outpost on Duna) will start shortly after the Ike launch, but my scientists are still on the way to Mun, to get a two star rating.\n\nAbout the Ike mission:\n\nAll science gathered (Temperature, Pressure, Seismic, Mystery Goo, Materials lab) from Duna High Space, Ike High Space, Ike Low Space and Ike Surface will be brought back and landed on Kerbin.\n\nHere are some pictures from the launch. As the mission is still in cruise, pictures of the arrival at Ike will come later.\n\nLaunch:\n\n![50B9895E9AA16659C19AD5505A75BEAF300313C4](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/528388899088423578/50B9895E9AA16659C19AD5505A75BEAF300313C4/)\n\nSeparation of first stage:\n\n![73B1990666A62954A80EC32618CE591249BA0FFD](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/528388899088423810/73B1990666A62954A80EC32618CE591249BA0FFD/)\n\nSeparation of second stage:\n\n![27F7163D116158CFCE1133DA5EE743A1E90E223F](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/528388899088423999/27F7163D116158CFCE1133DA5EE743A1E90E223F/)\n\nClimbing through the atmosphere:\n\n![894787096CB90E048B268FB78A6D979FF6E48F78](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/528388899088424126/894787096CB90E048B268FB78A6D979FF6E48F78/)\n\nCruise stage with jettisoned fairings.

Heat shouldn\u0027t be a problem on Duna, due to the low orbital speed (I think it was about 1000m/s) when I burn into a low orbit, instead of a direct (re)entry \n\nHmm, maybe some aerodynamic controls, in order to have more precision about the landing site?\n\nThe upper half will detach after touchdown and fly away, but not before my scientists got the experiments ou of them and reexecuted them for surface data.\n\nAnd I\u0027m also gonna try to put a rover onto the same rocket, to make sure it will land at a nearby spot (with its own parachute, detached short before landing)\n\nIf I don\u0027t find a way, the rover, as well as an orbital science station and a return vehicle, has to wait for the next launch window.\n\nNow it\u0027s time to put a rocket under it and test it on Kerbin.\n\n![B078876E357F85377BDB28ECDED970AC60A56BD9](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/528388899089142008/B078876E357F85377BDB28ECDED970AC60A56BD9/)"},{"CreatedByName":"Zucal","CreatedById":139764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T04:34:54Z","Content":"Looks nice, but I would still be concerned about the verticality of it.

The center engine is fed from the outer tanks (Asparagus staging).\n\nThe upper part consists of three \u0022Poodle\u0022 engines, the outer ones are fed by the orange center tank, and are ignited, as soon as the skipper engines are decoupled. At that time the \u0022Poodle\u0022 engines already have an ISP of 320s and by this already a better efficiency than the \u0022Mainsail\u0022 engine. After decoupling the \u0022Mainsail\u0022 engine, the center \u0022Poodle\u0022 engine is fed by the outer tanks first.\n\nI was planning to achieve a 100km orbit with the full upper center tank, a dv of 2000m/s. I ended up swith 1975m/s when I got the orbit. (If the outer tanks hadn\u0027t been empty at that time, I would have decoupled them anyway, in order to avoid debris around Kerbin.\n\nAnd as we have a science lab and to scientists on board, we\u0027re gonna use the cruise to do some science.\n\nThe rocket prior to launch:\n\n![AABD5F165F6D5E9409F545FAC575928A649DC6A6](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/528388899089461001/AABD5F165F6D5E9409F545FAC575928A649DC6A6/)\n\nThe final cruise stage with decoupled fairings:\n\n![512A37B05AF88A03EA1BBAC3A2BB3493DA89C1B6](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/528388899089461802/512A37B05AF88A03EA1BBAC3A2BB3493DA89C1B6/)"},{"CreatedByName":"MarkusF","CreatedById":142152,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T18:07:05Z","Content":"The \u0022Ike Explorer\u0022 has arrived at the Duna system, the \u0022Duna Outpost\u0022 will arrive about 43 days later:\n\n![26401163F2628C73C8D137D10E369D4B826CA8C9](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/528388899091285321/26401163F2628C73C8D137D10E369D4B826CA8C9/)"},{"CreatedByName":"MarkusF","CreatedById":142152,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T18:37:11Z","Content":"Decoupling the lander from the cruise stage in Ike orbit:\n\n![754478B3DE5D37374FE0A6E6E149E6F3DFEC874A](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/528388899091359007/754478B3DE5D37374FE0A6E6E149E6F3DFEC874A/)\n\nApproaching the surface:\n\n![D17236CE3A77CC1925F2C5991BE29C1D78D1312E](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/528388899091359257/D17236CE3A77CC1925F2C5991BE29C1D78D1312E/)\n\nTouchdown with a nice view, Duna centered on the horizon:\n\n![7EB1B008560D88ECD3AA69E042AE7F1F2312C667](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/528388899091359452/7EB1B008560D88ECD3AA69E042AE7F1F2312C667/)\n\nPlease don\u0027t ask me why I attached the parachute for the Kerbin reentry to the Ike lander and not to the reentry part of the cruise stage.
