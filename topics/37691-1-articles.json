Essentially, it is a tube partially or completely devoid of air, with a MagLev train inside. Theoretically, this could allow for speeds of 350 - 4000 MPH (563 - 6400 KMH), or about mach 5, allowing a trip from Beijing to New York City in 2 hours. While as of yet unbuilt, this seems like a promising form of transportation to me, as we already have the technology to do it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://images.dailytech.com/nimage/16023_large_ETT_Train.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002216023_large_ETT_Train.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy only concern is how it could you could run it through (or over) an ocean.
