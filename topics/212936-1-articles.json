However, one thing I find very...messy and even amateurish-looking, the way that the game simply does a random screencap of the actual viewscreen at the moment of saving a craft file/workshop area. This leads to many unflattering angles and frankly extremely messy UI screengrabs that can make it nearly impossible to discern exactly what vehicle(s) are being saved. Instead, I\u0027d like if the game could pull the craft file(s) and arrange them in some standardized fashion and create an image of the craft file in that standardized fashion, ideally I imagine from a dorsal (top-down) view of an aircraft, or a silhouette view of a rocket, not unlike how it all was in the original KSP. As it stands I can barely tell my craft files apart by appearance alone when half of the screen is taken up by the parts-picker and/or part-manager or similar, to say nothing of random unflattering angles you often get of the craft itself with this technique even when you have a relatively \u0022clean\u0022 workshop space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs an example this is the kind of clutter I\u0027m seeing in my craft files with every save. The way things are just looks messy and entirely unprofessional.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220230224140049_1.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022166.67\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1078752787128668241/1078753715420405770/20230224140049_1.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n"}]}
