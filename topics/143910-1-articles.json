No.\u00A0 The only real reason to be concerned about number of stages in a stack is for cost effectiveness (by means of fuel efficiency).\u00A0 Really you can use any combination of number of stages on a stack, but with carefully selected engines, you can tailor the fuel efficiency for the altitude your stage is at.\u00A0 For that reason, you really only need 2 stages in a stack, which can be augmented with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s radially if you need a bit more thrust at sea level.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy only two?\u00A0 Because we are really limited to 2 classifications of engines.\u00A0 Those that work well at low altitudes (Reliant, Swivel, Mainsail, etc.), and those that work well at high altitudes/space (Spark, Terrier, Poodle, etc).\u00A0 Adding a 3rd stage would mean adding an engine that duplicates of one of those two functions, if you are going to do that, just add more fuel to that stage and save the funding that way.\u00A0 Some engines do work pretty well in either position.\u00A0 For example the Skipper can be used on Stage 1 and paired with a Poodle, or used on Stage 2 and paired with a Mainsail depending on your payload mass.\u00A0 Keep in mind, this 2 engine strategy is only for getting to space.\u00A0 Once you get there you can of course have more engines on your payload.\u00A0 If\u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalx.com/Raptor9/EV-2A-Runabout-Titan-5-LV-1A\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E this is the craft you were referring\u003C/a\u003E, he is using that same strategy, a 2 stage stack to space with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, a command module and a lander.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat about mass?\u00A0 Yes, dropping mass and making your rocket smaller improves fuel efficiency, but the bulk of the mass is from the engine, so that tank has a small impact once empty, but not significant enough to warrant the cost of the engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat about Asparagus/Onion Staging?
