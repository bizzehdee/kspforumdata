Since he attempted to be polite and continues to be polite, and even to draw some of the umplelsenatness away from main mega threads for the mods involved. Secondly the lock out by the mod makers is not exactly a purpose of the mod, but rather a denial of service, for a particular platform. Senshi is simply removing that denial of service in a way, that, to me at least, should keep the headache from coming back to the mod maker. If that works, I am not really sure why there should be an objection to that. Is his fork in competition to the original?
