To speed things up don\u0027t bother with turning around mid air, instead just taxi off the runway until you\u0027re pointing west, and take off from there. Once you get up in the air, be sure to quicksave so you can quickly come back if you crash. make sure you have steering enabled on the front wheel, and reverse it if necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/8bdxTP2\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8bdxTP2.png\u0022 alt=\u00228bdxTP2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 2. Picking a landing site.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor your landing site you want to find an area that is not that steep. However more important that slope is consistency, a very bumpy site that is flat overall is going to be harder to land on than something with a slope, but is consistent. Also never touch down going directly up a hill, the ground sloping up has the same effect as increasing your sink rate, making touchdowns invariably harder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tluP1Xb.png\u0022 alt=\u0022tluP1Xb.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI picked the area just to the left of the group of hills that was directly in front of me. I did not choose a very good time to land, ideally you want the sun lower in the sky so that the terrain forms shadows with which you can judge the size of hills more easily.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 3. Approach\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you get aligned with your landing zone, you should start your descent. Be sure to carefully watch your speed when as you come down. when you are 500 m above the surface you should be going at around 170 m/s, by the time you get down to 100m you should be going at 140 m/s. When you get to 100m turn on the airbrakes permanently (click the brake light) quicksave at 400m up in case you mess up the landing\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 4. Pre touchdown.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the most critical step. As you get closer and closer to the ground, make sure you are steadily decreasing your speed. When you are 60m up start watching your vertical speed in kerbal engineer, it needs to be lower than 10m/s when you touch down. Watch the slope of the ground, if it is too steep, don\u0027t be afraid to light up your engines and keep going until you get to a flatter area. Right before your wheels hit the ground, if necessary, roll so that you match the sideways slope. When you are 10m above the ground you should be going around 100 m/s (preferably lower). maintain your vertical speed until your wheels hit the ground. If you have drouge chutes, now is the time to deploy them\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/NqXKuj1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NqXKuj1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022NqXKuj1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 5. Slowing down\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe brakes should already be on from the previous step. As you are rolling over the ground, the most important thing to watch is your side slip, or how far to the side you are from prograde. If this increases too much you will flip over. Remember when I told you to enable steering? this is where that will come in. The wheels in Adjustable landing gear adjust their steering coefficients with speed, so the faster you are going the less they will steer. This means it is safe to have steering on during landing. As you slow down keep pointing towards prograde. If you come over the crest of a hill, try to land on your back wheels, especially at higher speeds, at lower speeds it does not really matter if you land on your front wheel as long as you point prograde.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/YC5izdc\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YC5izdc.png\u0022 alt=\u0022YC5izdc.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 6: Profit!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/RkpAqeQ\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RkpAqeQ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022RkpAqeQ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/zHGZFiK6XsM?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease post feedback below, this is my first tutorial so tell me how I did.\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-22T08:45:11Z\u0022 title=\u002208/22/2015 08:45  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by peachoftree\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdded RealChute\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"damerell","CreatedById":123074,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T22:35:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis was not very surprising, but an interesting read.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Dilsby","CreatedById":232743,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-01T21:04:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESticky!
