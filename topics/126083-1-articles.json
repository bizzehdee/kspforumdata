I really like the look of it and wondered if there\u0027s any basis in reality, so I tried it:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.aerionsupersonic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Technology-Overview.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Technology-Overview.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.aerionsupersonic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/technical-specs-image1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022technical-specs-image1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://jscript.ca/ksp-images/Aerion/Screen%20Shot%202015-11-21%20at%2012.29.10%20AM.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Screen%20Shot%202015-11-21%20at%2012.29.\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://jscript.ca/ksp-images/Aerion/Screen%20Shot%202015-11-21%20at%2012.29.17%20AM.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Screen%20Shot%202015-11-21%20at%2012.29.\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://jscript.ca/ksp-images/Aerion/Screen%20Shot%202015-11-21%20at%2012.29.24%20AM.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Screen%20Shot%202015-11-21%20at%2012.29.\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://jscript.ca/ksp-images/Aerion/Aerion%20AS4.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ECraft file is here\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027ve only flown it twice but both times made it to a circularized orbit, albeit with hardly any fuel to spare. Once in space it handles quite goofy because of the CoT misaligned with CoM, don\u0027t use throttle more than 30%. To get to orbit I just pitched up ~20% the entire way until it was time to switch engine modes (the \u00270\u0027 button). I have not tried landing it after orbit but imagine it will be difficult as the CoM will have shifted; you\u0027ll see the fuel tanks are all mostly behind CoM so its flight characteristics will most likely be bad. But, it was a fun couple hours getting it to the point where it is. Not perfect, the tail is not right but I had to compromise to get everything balanced enough to fly.
