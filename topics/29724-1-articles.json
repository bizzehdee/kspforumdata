Its dead simple! Lets take my example. I\u0027m constructing a lightweight, Mun capable CSM. STOP. Is it going to go on its own or not (look for * for answer) For this, lets say its going with a LM. It needs to have enough fuel for the trip there and back. Its also got a dead weight on its front (most likely ( the LM) You don\u0027t need a massive fuel margin, this only slows you down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EHow many Crew\u003C/span\u003E who\u0027s going?

Lets say were coming as close to Apollo mock-up as possible and were sending three kerbals there. Attach the RCS to the Capsule itself. Then put decoupler. Unless your either taking a remote rover, or your delibrately putting on a probe to use electricity (for the harder people out there) you don\u0027t need electricity (for now) Take advanced SAS only.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 2 B: The engines - Engines recommended\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELV- 45 (TV) - Efficient, Powerful - downside, large, craft wobbles on launch\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELV- 30 (NTV) Not so efficient, very powerful - downside ^^\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELV- N - Do not use\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELV 90 - (TV) Either get ready to wait or use in clusters\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 3: The LM - The LM is the lightest part of the rocket.

However, its dead easy to have one without leaving behind a bunch of fuel. Add a decoupler underneath your LM capsule and add RCS and RCS thrusters.

F2 disables the HUD while in flight for more cinematic shots.

The LM is a bit more difficult in authenticity as you can see. Fitting appropriate amounts of fuel in small areas is nigh impossible in KSP due to the clipping restrictions (I don\u0027t like to use part clipping, it feels like cheating). I\u0027m sure with some work I could come up with something better, but it would probably be a little heavier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is why I want super thin 3m fuel tanks.
