Yesterday there was a bit of an incident. Some idiot in a shuttle was flying up to dock, and got too close to the solar panels. He didn\u0027t actually hit them, but later, when I happened to glance at the flight log, I noticed there were about a hundred entries, each saying \u0022solar panel was damaged by engine exhaust\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEvidently our hotshot pilot was blowing thruster exhaust on the solar panels while trying to dock.

But if you can throttle up fully and the solar panel stay there, then yes...30 seconds...six years, it\u0027s all the same. If the engine is strong enough and close enough, then it will break the panel. There is no \u0022partial damage\u0022 though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn often run-into problem is that a solar panel can, in fact, block the thrust from an engine completely. This has led to many posts asking why an interstellar craft doesn\u0027t actually accelerate, or why it might randomly turn off to the side (if one of the solar panels that was blocking an engine breaks off).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
