However, when using it with mechjeb it fails to get into orbit correctly. The first stage (liquid stage) works fine with the ascent guidance however when I decouple and start the second stage (Castor 30A solid rocket) it says thrust percentage off 200% or 100% it\u0027s different every time. It won\u0027t control the craft anymore and just lets it go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
