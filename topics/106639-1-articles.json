It\u0027s not supposed to do that, the fairing is not supposed to decouple ever. It kind of ruins the immersion if the not separating fairing separates.

I\u0027m going to guess this is how the interstage shielding bug was fixed.

I have a retrieval module that uses fairings as a heat shield and the fairing releases itself when I decouple the docking port from my space plane.
