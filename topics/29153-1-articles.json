By now I\u0027m no stranger to the program, I\u0027ve sunk over 110 hours into it... curse you steam for tracking how much of my life I\u0027ve given you... Anyway I hope to see you around the boards, here\u0027s a little picture of me at the Mun Arch.

Also the wheels I used are the largest in the default set, and they seem to have some pretty good suspension... well, some suspension anyway. I have not checked to see if the suspension mod has been updated for .20 yet, I imagine that would help you absorb the shock of the landing. I\u0027ve also used regular landing legs attached to the sides of rovers and deployed them before detaching from the delivery system. Then just pulled up the legs and drive off. But Wade here landed on all six wheels. Like I said, very gently.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-26T03:56:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have to agree -- landing a rover that size must have been quite challenging!
