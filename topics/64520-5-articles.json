On the subject of additional capability modules I keep having this vision as i fall asleep of the Pteron mounted on a winged rear stage that has ram jets to boost The Pteron and a LFO tank with integral boost motor up to about 25000m at which point the Pteron\u002Bmotor combination detaches from the winged carrier and continues into orbit.
