Once I get into the lower atmosphere with the craft I posted, it goes into an uncontrollable tumble, I suspect because the canards behind the forward RCS tanks lift the nose more than the rear wings can lift the back of the plane. Any way to fix that without completely redesigning?\n\nIf it were just canards, ASAS could have handled it. Something else is up. On my Albatruss MkIV-KS, I fixed the issue by removing a pair of swept wings from the nose of the craft and adding two pairs of such wings to the tail. You might also simply be lacking sufficient control surfaces, especially in the back.\nBy the way, does the concept of a cargo-delivering craft disqualify it from this challenge?

It also absolutely needs them to take off. Even if it didn\\\u0027t need them for takeoff, being able to fly vertically upwards on kerosene is a reward in itself. Instead of burning rocket fuel all the way up, you only start burning it at 10km in the air, and already doing 200m/s. That\\\u0027s why I could get away with just sixteen rocket fuel tanks, instead of twenty-six as on Albatruss MkII, which has to burn it from takeoff. Even if it\\\u0027s just a minute of extra burn time, six LFEs will use up *five full tanks of fuel* during that minute, that\\\u0027s five tanks extra you\\\u0027ll have to pack along, and then lug around with you.\nIf I remember right offhand, the takeoff mass of my craft is something around 110 tons. Nine turbojets give a total theoretical thrust of 1350, so if I remove two engines I won\\\u0027t be able to efficiently ascend. If I use two LFEs to compensate, that\\\u0027s almost two tanks of fuel for ascent. So all in all, having the extra engines is better, even if you don\\\u0027t need them all the time."},{"CreatedByName":"_Aramchek_","CreatedById":12588,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-24T05:18:05Z","Content":"Hello, here is my first successful spaceplane, it fits all the requirements so I thought I\\\u0027d post it.\n\nIt\\\u0027s one stage, very stable in level or vertical flight, and it is easily capable of hitting 70k meters and returning to Kerbin.

Weight distribution changes as fuel is used, initially the center of mass is nearer the middle and engines are typically at the back. At the end of the flight the center of mass moves back towards the engines, if you have too much lift too far forwards at this point in the flight the craft flips back to front. So you need to keep the wings over the engines, but then you need a little extra lift / attitude control in front of the center of mass on lift off to get the nose up because the wings are behind the center of mass at that point, so the mass tends to change the attitude of the craft so it points towards the ground. You can make craft with engines and wings in the middle and they dont tend to need canards if they have a good tail plane for attitude control.

I noticed you are already on the guest list due to the [previous mission](http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=12837.msg215096#msg215096) you did. \n\nThanks for posting the videos \\_Aramcheck\\_, well done on your successful flight with your new design, consider yourself on the guest list. I hope I got the craft name right, hard to read the vid, FFu3 ?\n\nSaaur and Cascade Aerospace, that is a neat little ship, grats on completing the mission successfully and efficiently, thanks for your illustrated report. Your invitation to the Dog \u0026 Booster backstage event is confirmed.\n\nInspired by some of the elegant craft on display in this thread and with an eye on the [Orion III](https://www.google.co.uk/#hl=en\u0026output=search\u0026sclient=psy-ab\u0026q=orion%20iii%20spaceplane\u0026oq=Orion%20III%20\u0026aq=1\u0026aqi=g3g-K1\u0026aql=\u0026gs_l=hp.11.1.0l3j0i30.3040540.3042818.0.3044246.10.10.0.0.0.0.131.778.9j1.10.0...0.0.okyR934Bi0U\u0026pbx=1\u0026qscrl=1\u0026bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.,cf.osb\u0026fp=4e9e80732daa8d93\u0026biw=1104\u0026bih=697\u0026pf=p\u0026pdl=300) spaceplane from 2001 A Space Odyssey, I have been working on another design and taking it for a spin to make rendezvous with a space station.
