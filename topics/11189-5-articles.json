Weight distribution changes as fuel is used, initially the center of mass is nearer the middle and engines are typically at the back. At the end of the flight the center of mass moves back towards the engines, if you have too much lift too far forwards at this point in the flight the craft flips back to front. So you need to keep the wings over the engines, but then you need a little extra lift / attitude control in front of the center of mass on lift off to get the nose up because the wings are behind the center of mass at that point, so the mass tends to change the attitude of the craft so it points towards the ground. You can make craft with engines and wings in the middle and they dont tend to need canards if they have a good tail plane for attitude control.
