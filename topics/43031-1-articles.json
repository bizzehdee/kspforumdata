I\u0027m an experienced rocket and spacecraft pilot and have made it all the way to Eeloo (but have only made one successful landing so far). I have used the forums mainly for downloading ships off of the spacecraft exchange, but finally decided to make an account. I am encountering a bit of problems with things like uploading a forum avatar and adding a signature. Not sure what I\u0027m doing wrong or if it\u0027s the forum\u0027s fault, but I simply CANNOT FIND THE OPTIONS! I know how to get to settings, then I look under \u0022Edit Profile\u0022 and any other thing under the left menu of options and things, but nothing there is allowing me to do anything about a forum avatar or a sig. If anyone could help me, thanks.
