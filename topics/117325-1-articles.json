I love physics to the point I am seriously thinking to go to college again and study physics because I could not do it in the first time...\n\nI am dreaming to plant the science love seed in my sons once they start to understand and they start to learn... and I hope to produce 2 scientists or more ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)... (it will be up to them to decide what they want to be eventually, but I\u0027ll do what I can)\n\nMaybe the reason I love math and physics is because my mom has a masters in math, and my uncle has a doctorate in some sort of something in physics (which I always forget what is it, but it is not nuclear physics or rocket science ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) )\n\nKSP, Space Engineers both come in absolute joy for me because all of the fun, learning I get in them...\n\nI also play EVE Online, Anno series, Minecraft, StarCraft II, S.T.A.L.K.E.R series... there are others but those what came to my mind now ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nI speak Arabic as native language, then English (obviously ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)), and \u0022Estoy estudiano la lengua espanola\u0022... ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nSorry for the text wall ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-31T20:27:03Z\u0022 title=\u002207/31/2015 08:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SalehRam**"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T16:29:52Z","Content":"Dude!
