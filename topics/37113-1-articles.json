Aach time a mapsat passes over a hexagon, it\u0027ll tell you whether or not there\u0027s kethane there. Kethane veins are typically quite large so if you find some, you can just land your miner in the general vicinity and start pulling kethane out of the ground. The more kethane, the bigger the vein.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sapphire","CreatedById":67918,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-15T02:14:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to Kethane, I\u0027d recommend taking a look at B9 Aerospace if you like spaceplanes and such.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/25241-0-20-2-B9-Aerospace-Pack-R3-2-New-pods-IVAs-engines-fuselages-structures\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/25241-0-20-2-B9-Aerospace-Pack-R3-2-New-pods-IVAs-engines-fuselages-structures\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Grindcore","CreatedById":74309,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-15T02:34:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sapphire\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sapphire\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIn addition to Kethane, I\u0027d recommend taking a look at B9 Aerospace if you like spaceplanes and such.\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/25241-0-20-2-B9-Aerospace-Pack-R3-2-New-pods-IVAs-engines-fuselages-structures\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/25241-0-20-2-B9-Aerospace-Pack-R3-2-New-pods-IVAs-engines-fuselages-structures\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIm having issues installing this one, im not sure whats going were. like the source folder, whats all that about?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlexanderB","CreatedById":17544,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-15T02:35:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou could also get:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- ISA Mapsat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Kerbal Engineering Redux, to get more detailed information on your rockets, so you can make them better and more optimised.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Mechjeb: same as above \u002B it has some neat autopilot tricks, though I use those mostly for Ion powered probes, so I don\u0027t have to hold it on the node for an hour\u002B\u002B by hand, or bring a heavy ASAS module..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Damned Robotics *was* very cool, but doesn\u0027t work anymore in 0.20.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sapphire","CreatedById":67918,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-15T02:44:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Grindcore\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Grindcore\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIm having issues installing this one, im not sure whats going were. like the source folder, whats all that about?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t install the source folder, you don\u0027t need it.
