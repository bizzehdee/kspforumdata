So I wanted to dock to this giant a kethane mining lander.I tried lot of designs, from plane to rover, big 3.75m lander to 1.25m little fly, but no one was working so well that it could deorbit himself, go mine some kethane and then go back and dock to the main ship with enough fuel to do that loop only a few times to refuel my ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo does someone knows an efficient kethane mining lander?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
