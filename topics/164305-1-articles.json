Memory is continuously allocated and deallocated by software as needed, it\u0027s a continuous process. The only possibly relevant limitation I can think of would be the addressing limit of a single 32-bit thread, which is on the order of gigabytes, but KSP is released with a 64-bit build so it\u0027s not relevant.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf memory usage were going up and up continuously until you ran out, more than it should, that would be a memory leak, a lack of deallocation, which still wouldn\u0027t be a problem until you ran *out* of memory... that is, after all of it is already allocated. But you imply that you have memory to spare, room to allocate, so this isn\u0027t the case.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe operating system imposes no arbitrary limitations on how much memory a program can allocate. Computer resources are there for the taking, for every single thing running on it. Maybe this will help you to understand why your question doesn\u0027t make sense? Only the program allocates memory, and by extension the programmer, it\u0027s not even a thing for end users.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"monstah","CreatedById":95210,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-11T15:02:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou could to to a computer hardware store and pay them to allocate more RAM to your computer, I guess.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DrLicor","CreatedById":165712,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-11T15:42:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re below 8GB of RAM, it would be wise to upgrade it indeed.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut by running the game in \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/76031-less-memory-usage-by-using-opengl/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Eopen-gl\u003C/a\u003E or \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/95837-forcing-directx11-40-memory-reduction/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Edx11\u003C/a\u003E mode, it will use a lot less RAM.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf you\u0027re already running in one of those 2 methods, I would suggest to buy an extra ramstrip (RAM is quitte cheap these day).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRAM is also quite easy to install.
