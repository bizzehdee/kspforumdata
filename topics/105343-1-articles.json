Unity wheels are not even round, in physics terms, they are an infinitely narrow vertical rod/ray. As for ride height, I\u0027m less certain, but I don\u0027t think that\u0027s something supported by Unity either. Suspension is the only thing you\u0027ve mentioned which can be done relatively easily. Rolling and ride height could certainly be implemented, but it would probably require re-inventing the wheel (i.e. either abandoning the use of Unity wheels, for a completely custom implementation, or a significant custom extension to the standard implementation).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have to admit that I\u0027ve yet to properly evaluate them in-game, but both GameData/Squad/Parts/Wheel/LandingGear/GearMedium.cfg and GameData/Squad/Parts/Wheel/LandingGear/GearLarge.cfg appear to have suspension defined. From an extended period of experimentation with wheel physics parameters a while ago, trying to make the B9 wheels behave sanely (before B9 5.x matured), my memory is that Unity\u0027s suspension and friction modelling is fairly crap overall. If the suspension parameters are perfectly matched to the specific vehicle, it will work well, otherwise it will stay permanently at the top or bottom of travel, depending on whether the weight is lower or higher than the weight the parameters are optimised for. With KSP, that is a HUGE problem, as the modularity means that it\u0027s almost guaranteed that the suspension parameters will not be appropriate for the vehicle they are being used on.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
