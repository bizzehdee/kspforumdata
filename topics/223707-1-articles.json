I have an orbiter lander pair around Vall. The small lander was attached the entire ride but the second i detach it, it lose comms and control. The orbiter has a communotron 88-88 and a RA-2 relay antenna while the lander has a communotron\u00A0 16. My understanding was that with 88-88 would providing connection to Kerbin the RA-2 relay would be able to communicate with the Lander and give it connection to Kerbin. Do I need a relay on the lander or do I need a relay antenna powerful enough to reach Kerbin on its own?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-02-15T16:16:14Z\u0022 title=\u002202/15/2024 04:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Feb 15\u0022\u003EFebruary 15\u003C/time\u003E by TeaRex\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Edidnt finish text\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aelfhe1m","CreatedById":142910,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-02-16T16:17:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe lander can use a direct antenna, but the orbiter needs to have a strong enough relay antenna to bounce that signal to Kerbin. And with a single orbiter it will only be able to transmit when the orbiter can see both Kerbin and the lander. If either is in radio shadow then no connection can be made.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome useful resources:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u0022128643\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed2399929360\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/149099-commnet-signal-strength-calculator-antenna-selector/?do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:194px;max-width:500px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u0022129964\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed7119286544\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/188294-112x-antenna-helper-adopted-math-your-antenna-range-and-signal-strength/?do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:217px;max-width:500px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-02-28T13:00:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u2019re misunderstanding what direct and relay antennae do.
