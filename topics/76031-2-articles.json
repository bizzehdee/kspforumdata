Especially integrated systems with iGPUs, like the latest Intel (Ivy?) Sandy bridge CPUs that can actually be used to play most games now. Not all graphics cards support OpenGL too. AND I also know that on some games, using OpenGL instead of DirectX (or Direct3D) actually REDUCES framerate. I know that this is the case with several games I own, with the most notorious being Minecraft. All-in-all, although OpenGL may reduce your RAM footprint, it is not supported on all system, and MAY reduce framerate. I\u0027m not saying it will with KSP, but it MIGHT. I haven\u0027t done any testing, so I can\u0027t prove it.
