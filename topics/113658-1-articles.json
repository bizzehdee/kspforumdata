Because I start up at 2.341 GB, but then as I click on the VAB, the memory usage spikes up to 2.7 GB. Does anybody know of a fix? Because I have had 2.8 GB usage in previous versions (.90 beta), but the leakages weren\u0027t as drastic."},{"CreatedByName":"mythbusters844","CreatedById":72313,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T02:03:13Z","Content":"If I recall correctly, that is a confirmed memory leak.

The only time the game used to crash on me is when I pushed the memory limit with mods. \n\nTo reduce the effect my game playing time I stated forcing opengl.\n\nI love this game but I really think for a released game there are way too many memory leaks. Squad seems to be very slow at or incapable of fixing them.\n\nI am assuming it will not be fixed at least until the port to Unity 5."}]}
