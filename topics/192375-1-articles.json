If you have a slow processor or not much memory, you may have a problem with too many mods, but there are some players who routinely run more than 100 mods and have no trouble.\u00A0 Usually, the major problem with running many mods is that they sometimes try to make different changes to the same things, and that causes a conflict.\u00A0 The second most common problem with running a lot of mods is that you can\u0027t update very quickly when Squad releases a new version of KSP\u00A0because you have to wait for all of the mods to update, too.\u00A0 Sometimes, mods are abandoned, and then

realism (and a suite of mods collectively called Realism Overhaul that is built to that purpose).\u00A0 There are mods to\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Edecrease\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0realism (Toy Solar System mods do this), and mods to completely replace the solar system with something else for new and different challenges (Galileo\u0027s Planet Pack does this).\u00A0 There are weapons mods for epic space battles if you want to have them.\u00A0\u00A0There are mods to increase the difficulty if you find the game too easy, or to extend it if you finish your tech tree too early or find that there are not enough planets for your liking.\u00A0 There are mods to tell you when you have upcoming manoeuvres for your rocket\u00A0(such as Kerbal Alarm Clock), mods to increase the available information about\u00A0your rocket as it flies (Kerbal Engineer), mods to make it fly more realistically through atmospheres (Ferram Aerospace Research), mods to fly it for you in case\u00A0you want an autopilot (MechJeb), and even a mod for you to write your own autopilot in computer code and\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ethen\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0have it fly the rocket for you (kOS).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn all of that variety, you should decide what you want to do in KSP that you can\u0027t do in stock and then see whether there is a mod for that (I\u0027ll tell you in advance that there probably is).\u00A0 If you want a logistical and planning challenge for your Kerbals, then you should consider mods for life support.\u00A0 If you want a logistical and planning challenge for your rockets, then you should consider mods that modify the construction of rockets, or possibly a part failures mod.\u00A0 If you like gathering science, then you should consider a mods that extends that capability with new experiments and situations.\u00A0 If you like bases and resource management, then you should consider a colony mod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of the large mod repositories is\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://spacedock.info/kerbal-space-program\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESpaceDock\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0(I\u00A0included a link).\u00A0 It has a number of different categories of mods, including lists of popular mods that you can browse.\u00A0 Not every mod is on SpaceDock, but many of the very good ones are.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/forum/34-add-on-releases/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EAdd-on Releases\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0forum also has a library of mods; it\u0027s a sticky post near the top and also \u003Ca

list of what is available, but it does not sort by popularity because there is no way to track the number of downloads.\u00A0 You should look at the forum to see what the most active mods are right now and see whether anything piques your interest.\u00A0 The first three or four pages will tell you most of the most popular mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, there are, at current count, 140\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Epages\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0of mod threads in the Add-on Releases forum.\u00A0 Some of these are repeats of old mods under new managers, and many are abandoned mods (for many different reasons; Fine Print, for example, was incorporated into the stock contract system, so it technically stopped being a\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Emod\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0in the purest sense of the term), but there are simply too many to give a good direction except to tell you what my preferences are and let you use that as a basis to determine your own preferences.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor my part, I prefer mods that increase the difficulty and extend the game.\u00A0 I use Community Tech Tree, Outer Planets Mod, MKS (a colony and resource mod), the entire Near Future Technology suite, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS (a life support mod that incorporates mental health in addition to food), Connected Living Spaces (it requires that your kerbals move through vessels in kerbal-sized corridors), Kerbal Construction Time (it makes rockets take time to build), kOS (the write-your-own-autopilot mod that I mentioned before), and about three dozen others that have the same general theme, plus all of the utilities and other mods necessary to keep these ones playing well together in the literal play-the-game-without-crashing-to-desktop sense.\u00A0 I also deliberately keep an old version of KSP with\u00A0\u003Ca

files myself, such as reworking the large \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E unit and fuel cells to be about 10% efficient compared to the stock versions, because I enjoy\u00A0the logistical challenge that arises when you force KSP to more closely obey\u00A0the laws of thermodynamics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s most\u00A0important for you to see what you would like and to try that.\u00A0 Also, I will warn you that it is best to prepare a new career save for mods because some mods can be very unkind to existing installs (don\u0027t install a life support mod when you have crewed vessels away from Kerbin).\u00A0 If you need any further advice, please don\u0027t hesitate to

It\u0027s pretty straight forward to use (once you get the hang of it- I didn\u0027t the first time I tried, but have since come around to it) and will deal with all the versions/dependencies/conflicts and also suggest additional mods based on what you\u0027re installing (e.g. the Near Future mods all recommend each other, real solar system recommends a load of realism mods etc.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you want to do mods manually, either because you don\u0027t like \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E or because there are mods you can\u0027t get through \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E- one example is Soundtrack Editor which requires files to be added outside of GameData so can\u0027t be done by \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E- you can try either SpaceDock (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://spacedock.info/kerbal-space-program\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://spacedock.info/kerbal-space-program\u003C/a\u003E) or CurseForge (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.curseforge.com/kerbal/ksp-mods\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.curseforge.com/kerbal/ksp-mods\u003C/a\u003E) which between them should contain pretty much every mod you could possibly want. It\u0027s a lot harder to do things completely manually as versions of different mods get released and you have to go and download/install them yourself plus different versions of mods work in different versions of KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegardless of how you install the mod, once it\u0027s added you can easily remove parts you don\u0027t want, edit the ones you do, even delete entire features of the mod e.g. get rid of the antenna feeds system from Near Future Exploration- I did that because it clashes with other comms-related mods I have installed but like the other parts. Editing mods can help you understand how the game works and appreciate the time and effort that went into them, but if you install a different version of the mod your changes will very likely be lost so keep a copy of anything you change outside your game files.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs you\u0027re playing on Steam (judging by the screenshots) it\u0027s always a good idea to copy the game files from Steam/steamapps/common to another location and then mod that copied version, leaving the Steam one clean and allowing it to update without causing any issues. You can also download other versions of the game by right-clicking KSP and clicking Properties, then the Betas tab and changing the drop-down menu from \u0027None\u0027 to the version you want. A good number of mods haven\u0027t been updated to support KSP 1.9 yet so rolling back to 1.8.1 will give you most of the features of 1.9 but with far greater mod support; going back further may cause some newer mods to not be supported at all but there are those on the forums who believe earlier versions were better (cue argument about which one was the best, fisticuffs, food being thrown etc.); try them for yourself and decide for yourself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEach time you change versions through Steam, make a copy of the game files and keep them somewhere else- you can not only keep different versions of the game on the same PC, you can keep multiple copies of each version with different mods in them, and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E can keep up with them all and install the mods you want for each different game instance independently.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA few mod recommendations from me:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E and scatterer make planets look pretty with blue skies and clouds. It makes a big difference, and shouldn\u0027t impact performance too much; if they do, turn the settings down a bit or drop the game settings down a notch. For the stock system, look up Astronomer\u0027s Visual Pack to make the planets even prettier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Strategia completely redesigns the strategy system and actually makes career mode better by adding a better sense of progression as you move from simple Mun probes to interplanetary expeditions.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- ReStock gives the stock parts a new coat of paint, with ReStock\u002B adding some additional parts that the stock game doesn\u0027t have as well as clones of some Making History engines. A lot of work on ReStock was done by the same person who made the Near Future mods so the solar panels in Near Future Solar and ReStock look very similar, as do the gold/silver variants of probe cores in NF exploration and ReStock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Near Future mods, if you\u0027re done dabbling with pure stock and want more options. There are several different Near Future mods out there and each does one specific thing- Propulsion adds high-end engines which are very efficient but power-hungry, Solar adds lots of solar panel options with a huge range of sizes, Electrical adds nuclear reactors (you\u0027ll need those to use the engines in Propulsion), Launch Vehicles adds 5m and 7.5m fuel tanks for huge launch rockets plus some engines that can be switched to burn liquid methane instead of liquid fuel. Related but separate are Cryo Engines (run on liquid hydrogen), Kerbal Atomics (nuclear engines, also run on liquid hydrogen), Cryo Tanks to hold that liquid hydrogen (and liquid methane) and Station Parts Expansion (a whole lot of space station parts which includes inflatable and deployable rotating rings). You might not need them all, but they can all tie in with each other and offer a pretty comprehensive set of options for doing almost anything.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Planetary Base Systems for making surface bases. The best part about them is the detachable rover wheels that can be mounted on the sides of each module so you can land, drive to the rest of the base and dock it together with very few issues. It has deployable habitation parts, a greenhouse that can tie in with life support mods, research labs and even mining equipment and (with NF electrical also installed) a nuclear reactor to power it all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Missing History- if you have the Making History DLC this mod adds some extra parts for it like reaction wheels and batteries, although ReStock\u002B adds similar parts as well in more recent versions. The one thing you should definitely get it for is the conversion of the FL-A10 adapter into a fuel tank, a must have for small rockets and probes; delete the rest if you don\u0027t need it but keep that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- OctoSat for modular probes, unlocks a bit later in the tech tree but is well worth getting for the sheer versatility it allows. It contains versions of almost every part in the game- solar panels, fuel tanks, engines, reaction wheels, probe cores, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E, science parts, you name it- and yet is small enough to stick on a 1.25m stack, has some powerful communications parts and can even be used as a lander, although you might break the solar panels doing that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Gravity Turn, because launching rockets into orbit can be tricky but this will make it as simple as pressing \u0027Launch\u0027 and it does the rest for you. It makes launches much more efficient and will improve with successive launches of the same rocket to use minimal delta-V getting to orbit and leave more fuel for going places afterwards, or a larger payload capacity if you want.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Stage Recovery recovers discarded stages, as long as you have enough parachutes on them. It can also recover entire vessels and land using thrust, and automatically refunds you based on adjustable parameters for speed, distance from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E and likelihood of burning up on re-entry. Early in a career game, being able to get 90% or more of the dry mass from your lower stages makes a HUGE difference, and it helps later in the game too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- MechJeb can automate almost anything- planning and executing maneuvers, docking, landing, plane autopilot and much more besides. Some say it\u0027s cheating, but it takes a lot of the guesswork out of planning long distance missions and requires no extra parts as it adds directly to any and every command part* including from mods. (*that I\u0027ve seen, at any rate)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor planet packs,\u00A0Kopernicus, the solar system modification mod, isn\u0027t 1.9 compatible and only recently became 1.8 compatible so for any planet pack you need to use KSP v1.8.1 or earlier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0The Outer Planets mod adds additional outer system gas giant systems\u00A0that resemble the real solar system but at Kerbal scale (which is about 1/10th the scale of the real solar system) and Dwarf Planets Plus adds some additional small planets at varying ranges. XPC revived builds on the stock system by adding some additional moons and does a small amount of shuffling, with compatibility provided for outer planets to put the additional moons for Eeloo around Plock instead because OPM moves the real Eeloo to be a moon of Saturn analog Sarnus. There is also the Grannus expansion pack which adds a second solar system around the star Grannus. A variant exists that makes that the primary star instead of Kerbol aka the Sun, but stick to the basic version and you should be able to use it with OPM/XPC/DPP without any problems.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you want something a bit more challenging, try JNSQ which redesigns the stock planets at 2.7x scale (around 1/4 real scale) and adds some extras. The rescale is significantly more difficult than stock, as orbital velocity on Kerbin increases from 2200m/s to 3800m/s and delta-V increases to get anywhere, so it\u0027s probably best to play through with the stock scale stuff first, but if you want a more difficult game then go for it; there is support for a rescaled GEP and an artistic upgrade called Ad Astra, however Ad Astra isn\u0027t 1.8 compatible yet so you\u0027ll have to use KSP 1.7.3 or earlier to use that. Kopernicus, the solar system modification mod, isn\u0027t 1.9 compatible and only recently became 1.8 compatible so for any planet pack you need to use KSP v1.8.1 or earlier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t recommend going for the real solar system or realism mods until you have a lot of experience at smaller scales, and if you\u0027re going to use a life support mod I\u0027d suggest using Snacks to gain experience using a simple life support system before moving on to something more complex like TACLS or Kerbalism.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hdeedose","CreatedById":201851,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-15T13:52:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks very much for all your answers .
