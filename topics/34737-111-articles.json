Good thing I made a backup save.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had set up a system where a could have a gantry and a rail system within the B9 cargo pods to easily remove probes and small ships instead of trying to manhandle them inside the tiny S2 bays.

This is a generic lander I created for Duna and everything smaler. Originally I had used the Thor capsule from (Novapunch?).. anyway there was suddenly an issue with the model where the command pod would detach itself from the rest of the ship when I loaded it on the launch pad. No clue why it happened, not even struts kept it attached to the service module/booster. So I had to replace it with the squad capsule. The problem was that the EVA hatch and ladder were no longer aligned with the ladders on the rest of the ship. In comes the docking washer to fix that and also repackage all the parachutes by giving easy access all around the perimeter of the service module section. Everything was tested on ground before launch. Then came 23.5. With the new fix, the docking washer does rotate, but now so does the decoupler just below it in the opposite direction, negating any work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/USgz0As.png\u0022 alt=\u0022USgz0As.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3rd issue, and I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s IR that is doing it because I don\u0027t have any IR parts, just a disaster that has not happened before until the new IR install. I use the RemoteTech2, forcing me to build large relay stations in Kerbin orbit to communicate with all my far flung probes. Only this week I\u0027ve manged to get something to all the planets. I had 2 relays.. one decided to blow up a month ago. It was tedious to realigned all the outbound probes to the secondary. Today I checked on that relay to aim at a few new things, and it fell out of the sky. It would not respond to any rotate commands. When I checked the map screen.. at an altitude of 5000km it has 2m/s as the orbital speed. Even using HyperEdit to fix the orbit, it did not fix the problem. It fixed it for a moment, nice circular orbit, then nothing, a strait cyan blue line back to Kerbal. One of the settings on the Hyperedit menu said \u0022infinity\u0022 This has never happened before until the update.

I couldn\u0027t replicate it, and of course I can\u0027t find the screenies I thought I had taken. The pistons were different lengths and docked when I quicksaved. When I reloaded they had the same issues we had been dealing with recently. That craft was shot so I retrieved it to try to duplicate the bug. After that, quicksaves loaded fine even when pistons were different lengths and servo groups had the same names. I can\u0027t figure out what broke it that one time. I would advice caution when quicksaving docked craft that use similar servo names or have servos set at different states. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EALSO, I know this probably isn\u0027t an IR issue but I discovered that you do NOT want to dock a rover into another open claw, unless you want to see the seedy blue underbelly of Kerbin. Make sure the docking is done with the armed claw of the active ship. Not one that is standing by. Here I found it by backing into the open claw of the rear rover.
