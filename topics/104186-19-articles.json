Needless to say, the technological contradictions surrounding the mission are red flags which suggest that the event never transpired in reality.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd finally, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10. 2014 Asteroid Attack (The landing was made by CIA to \u003Cstrong\u003Econdition the masses for the man-made asteroid attack of 2014.\u003C/strong\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/_G8ntOZiihA?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003Ejesus christ someone get me out of here\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-23T16:20:28Z\u0022 title=\u002207/23/2015 04:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by windows_x_seven\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WinkAllKerb\u0026#039;\u0026#039;","CreatedById":78047,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T16:12:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022childs dissaprove that\u0022 ; ) definetly a collector ; )\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T16:29:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Overfloater\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Overfloater\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u0022Dark side of the Moon\u0022.\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003EWhy i never heard the phrase \u0022dark side of the Earth\u0022? ;-S\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a dark side of the Moon, it just changes during the lunar cycle.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Loligoat","CreatedById":99368,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T16:33:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022windows_x_seven\u0022 data-cite=\u0022windows_x_seven\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EROSETTA AND PHILAE ARE A HOAX, WE NEVER LANDED ON IT\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat wasn\u0027t even a facepalm, that was just a sigh followed by a long silence from me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WinkAllKerb\u0026#039;\u0026#039;","CreatedById":78047,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T16:35:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ekinda like what\u0027s next before 96 ? xDr\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
