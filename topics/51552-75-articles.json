Pretty sure that\u0027s undefined, mathematically speaking. But my understanding of Line of Sight may be different. Two tangents on opposite ends of a chord through the center-point of a circle are parallel to each other and will offer no intersect. Move the chord away from the center and you get an intersect, which will allow you to solve for the altitude needed.\u003Cp\u003EFor 742 km orbit, you can find the field of view via \u003Cem\u003E2 * sin x = 300 (radius) / 1042 (altitude \u002B radius)\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis gives about a 32.5 degree FOV at the planet, which translates to about 41% of the perimeter. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess since the station has a height of 70 m, that would translate to additional FOV, but I am not sure which part of the planet blocks the signal. If the mountains to the west of KSC block the signal, this would need to be accounted for as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thought i used standard algebra to find how they got to 742. Pretty sure 742 is wrong and you could have anything in the range of planet radius to antenna/dish/sphere of influence limit for the orbit of kerbin. If mountains don\u0027t block things satellites should gain line of sight at 600.01 km orbits, but they would need near perfect positioning. The higher you go the more positioning wiggle room for a 3 satellite grouping.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo reach 742 i think they did something like this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDistance to horizon before it is simplified can be described as:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E (R\u002Bh)^2 = R^2 \u002B d^2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ER = radius\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ed = distance\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eh = height\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe are seeking the height that gives a distance of the radius * 2. So d=2R\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E (R\u002Bh)^2 = R^2 \u002B 2R^2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ER \u002B h = square root ( R^2 \u002B (2*R)^2 )\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eh = square root ( R^2 \u002B (2*R)^2 ) - R\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow take a known radius like kerbin and you get: 741.6408...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMun 247.2136\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMinmus 74.1641\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEtc. I don\u0027t think that gives horizon to horizon view, or \u0027half\u0027 the planet as someone described earlier. That is the distance from the satellite to the horizon -- if it went straight out it would have view of half the planet, but it travels at an angle, so some distance is used to go out and some is used to down -- reducing the field of view to some area short of the horizon. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour field of view formula probably describes how much of the actual surface is seen.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wiracho","CreatedById":69847,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-02T23:09:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei think i broke remote tech hehe....i unzip the \u0022parts\u0022 folder, and the remoteTech_antennas.cfg...i did this to have only the parts and the integration to carrer mode...so i tried in sand box, the antenas extend, and everything was good....but now in carrer mode, and sand box the remotetech antennas are locked, i cant extend....i unzip all the folders and files, but its the same....i put the modulemanager1_5...pliz help, and sorry for my english\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mdapol","CreatedById":98306,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-02T23:17:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo I\u0027m still wondering what the bug is that causes all the RT antennas to not have any animation.
