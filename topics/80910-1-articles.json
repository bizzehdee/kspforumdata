Before the update they were on a crappy rover and were IN couple of command seats. After the update I go back to controlling them but they seem to have warped out of the seats and are standing where the rover initially was (the rover rolled down the hill). After mashing the keyboard to make them respond in any way and smashing into them with another kerbal and the rover nothing happens except they do fall over, have the rag doll effect and get back up. I have tried switching to other vehicles nearby and reloading a save is not an option.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny ideas for how to get them working again?

I had a bug similar to that happen to me a while ago when I was landed on Ike, but the kerbals somehow were changed to debris instead of eva. There might be a way to regain control of them, but it would probably require some messing around. For my problem, I just terminated the ship and the kerbals and revived the kerbals through the game files, although there probably is a better way. Also, are you using any mods? I think my problem was with a glitch in the kas mod. Anyway, if you don\u0027t care about saving the ship, use the method I used. Otherwise, I\u0027d just try some different things and see what results.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vilheim","CreatedById":83096,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-06T13:46:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think your Kerbals may be in similar state as the Kerbals that need rescuing in the \u0022Rescue Kerbal from orbit\u0022 missions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith that in mind, what you can try to do is get some sort of cockpit really close to the kerbal, so that they are in grabbing range. Then switch over to said kerbal, and hit F to grab on to the cockpit\u0027s ladder/get into the cockpit. After that, your Kerbal should be fine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is just my guess, though, haven\u0027t had this bug myself so I can\u0027t tell you for sure.
