Each has enough chutes to allow a slow enough descent for an intact recovery after return. The launch to orbit stage requires an RGU pod and power (I add a battery and some solar panels). Usually I need some SRBs to maintain either the proper TWR or dV, but those I do not recover but rather they get jettisoned. They are mostly fuel anyway and so the cost is minimal in comparison to the entire mission cost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter achieving orbit from launch, I separate the stages, save and then select the launch stage from the control center. Its then a simple matter of deorbiting and recovering the spent stage. Upon return and reentry of the payload stage, its a similar process for recovery. I find that my budget for any one mission tends to be about 10% of my available funds; sometimes 20%.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"juanml82","CreatedById":105344,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-04T03:11:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EToo bad.
