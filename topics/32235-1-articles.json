The stock one, I believe the persistence file has a setting code for the solar panels for stock. I would need to break some off to test, which unfortunately don\u0027t have time for right now, but there should be something in the persistent controling it. Check \u0022stateString = \u0022 in the part information under the MODULE header. Normally they are EXTENDED or RETRACTED. Try setting it to RETRACTED if the stock deployed ones are breaking on load up.
