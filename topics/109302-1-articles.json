It\u0027s kind of a pain now. You should be able to transfer science when docked like you can for fuel etc. \n\nOh well pretty minor."},{"CreatedByName":"Freshmeat","CreatedById":111048,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T15:48:35Z","Content":"I use [Ship Manifest](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/62270-0-90-0-Ship-Manifest-%28Crew-Science-Resources%29-v-4-1-4-4-10-Apr-15) to solve that problem.\n\nI know that \u0022there is a mod for that\u0022 is not the answer one hopes for, but this one seems pretty stable and maintained."},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T18:03:11Z","Content":"You know, this would be the perfect thing for an engineer to do. No, not a scientist, an engineer... bear with me. \n\n- A pilot gets out, goes to the science experiment, and beats it with a wrench until it gives him what he wants.\n- A scientist wants perform the experiment himself so he gets out of the command module and goes to the equipment and performs the science the \u0027proper\u0027 way.\n- An engineer rewires (electronic engineer) and reprograms (software engineer) the thing to feed the data straight to the command module.\n\nSo I say, Squad, give engineers a purpose. Let them pull science from within the command pod."}]}
