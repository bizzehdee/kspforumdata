And painfully coming to the conclusion I might be the first and perhaps only one to discuss what I find to have become troublesome. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Problem\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis problem are the changes to the carreer mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy opinion is that the introduction of the carreer mode in v0.22 made the harvest of science points to easy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlmost all of my science was gathered by probes containing SC-9001-Jr and the mystery goo container and finally gravioli detectors and thermometers and keep sending tests on biomes, through atmospheres or on low and high altitudes around a given body and repeat till 90-100% of the availale science points were gathered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI actually send a Ion powered probe (after unlocking them in v0.22) to the Joolian system and researched 90-100% of the available science points on jool and all of it\u0027s moons on high and low orbit passes in just one single mission. That I considered to easy. I was hoping feature updates would make it harder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd what did KSP do. They did exactly that. They made it harder by rendering a science module inoperable after a single use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo counter that difficulty \u0022Squad\u0022 introduced the new Mobile processing Lab MPL-LG-2. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to render this module functional it needs 2 kerbals working on it. Before this module can reset the research containers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat ^^ is what is ruiening my gameplay. And I will explain to you why.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first reason why this new system ruins my carreer gameplay is that it forces my playstyle in a direction I do not want to go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of my idealistic ways of playing the carreer mode is to simulate a spacerace similar to the progression of manned spaceflight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis means that I want to perse simulate a apollo styled mun landing. Not completely replicate apollo. But use the similar method of hohman transfer using a command module in LMO with a Eagle lander. This requires docking ports, rcs, mk2 lander can and the MK1-2 command pod. These mentioned stock parts I find benefitial for a apollo styled lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EParts that I have not yet unlocked. And unlocking them requires THOUSANDS of science points still. While having already gathered EVA science on both kerbin, mun and minmus. Orbiting above almost all their Biomes and both at high and low altitudes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGathering the necessary science points to unlock the parts I deem benefitial for a apollo styled mun landing requires me to get science from the other planets and moons. Historically accurate if you look at human spaceflight. Before the moon landing several sattelites prior to the landings went to venus and mars and other research probes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOfcourse IRL spaceflight science gain wasn\u0027t based on science farming by probes such as the veneras, mariners, Cosmos and Mars probes. But by researches and progresses made here on earth did docking ports and other parts become available.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI still find it mysteriously what a test on a science module and a mystery goo module allows the construction of a docking port or the production of a new fuel container. But ok, it\u0027s a game. It needs to have a unrealistic system of unlocking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat does this all mean for me?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt means that prior to launching a apollo styled mun landing in carreer mode I firstly need to make a similar heavy styled apollo rocket to get a big science lab to the outer planets with any of my Kermans on it completely blasting my sense of realistic spacefligt out of the window.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr alternatively I could launch 10 Sattelites into LKO and wait for a transfer window to one of my desired planets and then take all 10 of them there so that each science module can resend the test which makes science farming that way a complete grind and absolutely unrealstic and stupid and inacurate in perspective to human spaceflight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo my suggestion to the devs (squad) and other KSP designers is to... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EA:\u003C/strong\u003E Add a module to unmanned probes in order to reset science modules\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EB:\u003C/strong\u003E Overhaul the science system completely\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EC:\u003C/strong\u003E Go back to how it was and implement any other additional configuration on how to make it harder to get science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ED:\u003C/strong\u003E Yield much more then 20% on transmitting gathered science. Something in the range of 50-60% so you only need to send 3 probes per celestial body to get most science. Which still is pretty darn stupid since back in the day before apollo man had only send several probes to venus and mars. And sending several probes to Kerbins analog of planets thus eve and duna isn\u0027t gonna cut the necessary research points.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy case here is closed. I made my point. I\u0027m curious on the comments about this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurthermore I would like a temporarily solution to the problem as I did progressed many hours into the carreer already and I don\u0027t want it lost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo is there a way to cheat science points. Or to edit files so that I can make it that a science transmit yields 100% science or that it would reset automatically again as it once was.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mythbusters844","CreatedById":72313,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-18T18:27:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis has came up a few times before, and basically, the reason why science is so easy to get is for beginner players that want to play career mode before sandbox.

The game wasn\u0027t made to re imagine humans attempt at reaching the stars. The fact you start with Kerbals instead of probes might unhistorical or even unlogical, but then kerbals aren\u0027t exactly the most cautious or caring individuals (endless recruits!). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you find it a big issue, and can\u0027t stand playing the game in its current state, look to mods.

Especially at the start of the tree, where even decoupler aren\u0027t unlocked. It also gives science early, as its vital to figure out if you want to progress further in the tree. The lab is also given very early because if you can\u0027t get a station going using it early, you will be rewarded with more capable science missions.

You are forced to go the manned route though. Without manned you lose large chunks of development by bringing the kerbal home. Truthfully the current placement of the 2 manned lander can sucks.

From a game design perspective (and I admit this is a broad, generalized and not very well thought out suggestion) a superior solution would be to eliminate the tech tree and implement contracts that give the player a few new parts with which to achieve an objective (be it getting a satellite into orbit or taking a few temperatures on minmus with 60%\u002B transmission reception), the successful completion of which unlocks those parts for use along with other contracts. It gets rid of science mining, lets the player know what to expect next, and can easily double as a tutorial as contract requirements become more and more complex and ambitious.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeck, if multiple contracts will unlock the same part, and the number of contracts increases by 2 for every contract attempted, it even will permit failure to be an option since the player can simply do another contract without being crippled by loss of money as the essential parts will always be available to the player. In fact it could even be adjusted so the player gains more money for completing the contract by not using those non-essential contract parts, adding both a layer of challenge and a greater payout to the player for completing it with as few parts as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComplexity through superior simplicity!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESadly, I know things will never be implemented that way... but we can dream, can\u0027t we?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan\u0027t we?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-19T08:10:28Z\u0022 title=\u002204/19/2014 08:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 19, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Scoundrel\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Paul Kingtiger","CreatedById":57455,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-19T12:51:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a lot of stuff in the tech tree that doesn\u0027t make sense, and unfortunately I don\u0027t think it will change that much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake probes for example.
