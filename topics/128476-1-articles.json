I\u0027m just saying like that mod that everyone has(except me because #4gb ram) and also water contracts are needed. Maybe like get science data from the surface of the water in area X. Also have things like rescue Butcher Kerman and Al Kerman from a boat on kerbin. And add things like test a part skimming the water. And please make the advanced grabbing units grab the dirt on kerbin. And also make ore be present in oceans.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"YargJay9991","CreatedById":143494,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-24T03:16:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDefine better water... \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E If you mean something like the Scatterer Ocean Shaders, then I don\u0027t think Squad will do that due to performance issues, but with the Unity 5 upgrade new water might be possible.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou might also want to elaborate on your suggestions, if you want them, sell them. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMake it look appealing so others might want them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHappy Flying\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYargJay9991\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Francois424","CreatedById":98138,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-24T03:27:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I\u0027d like to be able to do with water is produce LFO, or just O\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E (Life support).\u003Cbr\u003E\nA small electrolyzer\u00A0part to replace the drills would do.\u00A0 That way I can produce fuel while exploring the oceans of at least Kerbin/Eve.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHow to determine if it can be processed ?\u00A0 I would say go with Density.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
