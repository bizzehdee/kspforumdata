Deadlines are completely unreasonable if you have Kerbal Construction Time installed. About half the missions so far have had a base deadline of 70 (Earth) days.

Rewards are misaligned. At the start of the game, most RP0 contracts are offering a few thousand funds at most, while yours are offering about 20k (both combine the advance and completion rewards into one sum). Later, however, yours are only barely worth doing, because A) The cost of the ship approaches or is greater than the reward and B) RP0 contracts to do the same thing offer much, much more. As an example, RP0 offers 2,750,000 to land a man on the moon, while you offer 400,000 for Apollo-11 and 85k for Apollo-17.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain, for the most part, I like what you\u0027ve put together.

My solution was to find and replace all instances of targetBody = Earth to targetBody = @Homeworld within each contract in the RSS version before starting a new game, this isnt ideal really but it works for now. I will make the necessary corrections for the next release. I may create a small plugin to automatically rename targetBody tags based on the plugins installed, this would be compatible with any contract pack and would enable RP-0 compatibility, but this will be afew weeks away!\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe early missions are dull...
