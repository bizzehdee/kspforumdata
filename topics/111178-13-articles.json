I\u0027m about 100ish missions in and enjoying it for the most part, but I\u0027ve got two major complaints.\n\n1. Deadlines are completely unreasonable if you have Kerbal Construction Time installed. About half the missions so far have had a base deadline of 70 (Earth) days. However, many of the ships I build for such missions take longer than that to build. I had to use Contract Reward Modifier to multiply contract deadlines tenfold.\n\n2. Rewards are misaligned. At the start of the game, most RP0 contracts are offering a few thousand funds at most, while yours are offering about 20k (both combine the advance and completion rewards into one sum). Later, however, yours are only barely worth doing, because A) The cost of the ship approaches or is greater than the reward and B) RP0 contracts to do the same thing offer much, much more. As an example, RP0 offers 2,750,000 to land a man on the moon, while you offer 400,000 for Apollo-11 and 85k for Apollo-17.\n\nAgain, for the most part, I like what you\u0027ve put together. I just think it could be even better."},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-30T17:39:17Z","Content":"RP-0 does not support contract packs. That would explain your issue. :]"},{"CreatedByName":"Manabender","CreatedById":125632,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-30T18:14:53Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 26 minutes ago, NathanKell said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E RP-0 does not support contract packs. That would explain your issue. :]\n\u003E \n\nBe that as it may, I can\u0027t see any logical use for the RSS version of Historic Missions that doesn\u0027t involve RSS (for obvious reasons), RO (which comes highly recommended by RSS), and RP0 (which comes highly recommended by RO and RSS for anyone wanting to play career mode; career mode being required for contract packs to do anything).\n\nThat doesn\u0027t mean RP-0 should support contract packs. I\u0027ve seen the extent of the work you do just to make RSS\u002BRO\u002BRP-0 bare-bones playable (fantastic work, might I add), asking any more just seems selfish and cruel.\n\nSupport can work two ways, however. Instead of RP-0 supporting a mod, a mod can support RP-0. That seems like the most logical path for RSS Historic Missions. Hence why I\u0027m posting here.\n\nOn a related note, both of you are doing awesome work. Keep being awesome. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"Whitecat106","CreatedById":140086,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-30T19:39:44Z","Content":"Hello everyone,\n\nLong time no speak! I have been very busy IRL and with Orbital Decay lately so I apologize for the lack of replies and content.\n\nI myself have been playing through my own pack using both RSS, RO, RP-0 and KCT, the issues and solutions I have found are below:\n\n- RP-0 prevents most of the Historic Missions from loading; this is due to the defined names of planets with RP-0/RO being different to those assigned by RSS, (as far as I can tell), RO uses a different version of the planet name from the GameEngine, using the planet type name rather than the planet defined name, for example RSS uses body.getName() and RP-0/RO uses body.name(), thus some parts of contract configurator parse correctly and others do not. My solution was to find and replace all instances of targetBody = Earth to targetBody = @Homeworld within each contract in the RSS version before starting a new game, this isnt ideal really but it works for now. I will make the necessary corrections for the next release. I may create a small plugin to automatically rename targetBody tags based on the plugins installed, this would be compatible with any contract pack and would enable RP-0 compatibility, but this will be afew weeks away!\n- The early missions are dull... Yep you\u0027re right, even I skipped Explorer - 10 because of the repetitive nature, (oh and the 210 Soyuz missions are coming up.. ![:o](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_ohmy.png \u0022:o\u0022) ), I will try and spice up the early missions a tad!\n- The deadlines, now these are a mixed opinion I can see, personally I like the idea of having to rush the build by 10% using KCT, reminds me of the haste of the space race itself, this combined with the high reward funds kind of makes the pack balanced in the early years, (Currently at 1965 relatively at the moment).\n- Some contracts are too nit picky, by this I mean for instance Luna-1, as someone who has not actually played a full Realism career before getting to the Moon from an inclined launch site with little delta-v was tough, even tougher was being within 500Km of the surface to complete the contract... maybe some more realistic altitude requirements are necessary here!\n- There is a void of Russian missions between 1961 and 1964; this is due to the pack currently only having missions up to Luna-4 and not all the way to Luna-16, I will add some more for the next update.\n- The declining rewards for example Apollo - 11 400000 and Apollo-17 85000 was intentional to mirror the decline in interest from the world and thus decline in funding.\n\nAll in all I have found some bugs I couldn\u0027t find by just staring at the contract files over the last year and hopefully I can improve the next version with what I have learned!\n\nAnymore suggestions for the next update are welcome, and thank you all for the interesting debates over the last few pages! Again I apologize for my lack of activity, hopefully once 1.5.0 of Orbital Decay is released I can get to work on this pack again.\n\nFurthermore I will be adding the pack to a GitHub repositiory this week, hopefully this will encourage some community involvement in the making of the pack from now on!\n\nP.S since the Witcher 3 dlc is out tomorrow, I may be away from the keyboard for a few days!\n\nWhitecat106 ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-30T19:41:31Z\u0022 title=\u002205/30/2016 07:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 30, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Whitecat106**"},{"CreatedByName":"Maxsimal","CreatedById":160254,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-04T23:23:05Z","Content":"I\u0027m also having trouble getting historical missions working with RSS/RP-0/RO in a new game.

Already looking at possibly 1000\u002B changes! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022)\n\nRight now the 2.2.0 pre release on [Github](https://github.com/Whitecat106/Historic-Missions) contains RP-0 fixes and some new missions.\n\nWhitecat106 ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"gonzo98x","CreatedById":102583,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-07T13:40:01Z","Content":"As a RSS/RO/RP-0 player I just want to say thank you for the updates.\n\nI am using 2.1.0 and the historical contracts did in fact show up. Using KCT I am still able to stay on point or ahead of schedule with the accurate timeline of the missions. Just takes some planning. I like the pressure!\n\nI am going to try 2.2.0 and see what\u0027s different.\n\nMy only question is this. I am not terribly interested in running any missions other than the American ones. If I ignore the USSR missions will that prevent future American missions from appearing? Simply, if I don\u0027t do the Luna missions will I be able to move on from Mercury to Gemini or will the mod hold me back until those Luna missions are completed before advancing?"},{"CreatedByName":"gonzo98x","CreatedById":102583,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-07T14:46:14Z","Content":"I ran a couple quick tests.\n\nTest 1 - New career mode. I can not get the Freedom 7 mission to show up unless I do the early USSR missions. This answers my question about needing to do them to unlock future american missions. I was able to get much later american missions to appear before the freedom 7 mission simply by ignoring the early vostok missions. Once I completed the Russian missions then the Freedom 7 mission appeared.\n\nTest 2- I looked into a RSS/RO setup without RP-0 and while everything worked game play is vastly changed. The tech nodes becomes rearranged and much less \u0027historical\u0027 / realistic. The early nodes are much less expensive to unlock and give you much later technology. Essentially, if someone is looking to unlock tech in a realistic progression with historical play through than RP-0 is a must.\n\nI hope this information helps in the further development of this mod. I consider this mod ESSENTIAL to an RSS setup.\n\nP.S. Aurora 7 Mission on the RSS build has a min altitude of 72000m req. I assume this was copied over from stock and should be about double that?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-08T00:17:30Z\u0022 title=\u002206/08/2016 12:17  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 8, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by gonzo98x**"}]}
