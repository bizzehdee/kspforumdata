And, since I wanted to drop a flag at KSC2 to use as a target, I flew one of my Kethane jets there which maxes out at around 320m/s and got there in well under an hour (warping of course). I still haven\u0027t come up with a non-electric design that\u0027s efficient enough to make KSC2 though, payload or otherwise.

Mine \u0027thinks\u0027 it\u0027s an airplane. I tried several different ways to build it but no matter what I did the center of lift was always WAY off unless I built it horizontally. While it does fly really great and I can land it vertically, it\u0027s not actually landing. It\u0027s more of a controlled vertical stall. If I get the bubble more than 5 or so degrees off absolute vertical, it flips over. Basically, a couple of kilometers from where I want to land I have to do a HARD nose up until it\u0027s vertical, I climb to about 4km and then let it stall and fall in reverse. That also means that when it comes time to land the only precision I can guarantee is somewhere within a 2km radius.

While it does fly really great and I can land it vertically, it\u0027s not actually landing. It\u0027s more of a controlled vertical stall. If I get the bubble more than 5 or so degrees off absolute vertical, it flips over. Basically, a couple of kilometers from where I want to land I have to do a HARD nose up until it\u0027s vertical, I climb to about 4km and then let it stall and fall in reverse. That also means that when it comes time to land the only precision I can guarantee is somewhere within a 2km radius.
