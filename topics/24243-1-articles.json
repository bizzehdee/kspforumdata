I\u0027m a giant newb, I\u0027ve got Mechjeb and I\u0027m able to get stuff into orbit and dock ships and, well, that\u0027s about it. My current stumbling block is trying to get something bigger into play.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome problems I\u0027ve faced:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. If I have a station set up (usually a cylinder atop the rocket) I tend to find that the rocket blows up. Usually one of the connections, typically the one connecting the rear engine of the station, gives out, and boom. I\u0027m wondering if I am accelerating too hard, or if the weight of the station itself is the problem?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Is there any mileage in a piggy-back launch like the Space Shuttle, or is that a dead end? A huge number of Kerbals have died in my experiments with this method of launch. I feel bad. But is there something in it? Typically I find that either I lose control of the rocket and it tips over, or if I put a buttload of power into the first stage to offset it then it just tears itself up. Is there a solution?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Are there any general things I should be aware of when looking at the Centre of Mass, Centre of Thrust and Centre of Lift? Do I just want to keep them all near the bottom?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. If I want to build an interplanetary ship in space, do I effectively have to dock all the parts together or are there other ways?

KSP parts are fairly close to the their structural limits, so they will collapse if you pile too many on top of themselves. You\u0027re looking at around 4 of the largest 1m tanks or two of the largest 2m tanks (same overall height). It\u0027s often stronger to build out sideways. Accelerating too hard can cause the problem as well, but there\u0027s more margin there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Dead end. It\u0027s possible but both halves need to maintain the same thrust to weight ratio all the way up which means they both burn fuel and you have to manually transfer it over before you eject the \u0027booster\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.

You can occasionally get them out of alignment when moving things around in the VAB and that means a constant lean to your rocket as it flies. It\u0027s kind of annoying, actually. The closer the center of mass is to your engines the better, but that\u0027s something that\u0027s going to be dependent on your designs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.

If you\u0027re heading to Tylo, you\u0027re probably going to have to put something together in space. A return-trip Eve lander almost begs to be built in one piece on the ground, and that\u0027s something that has to have 12,000 delta-V just to get back to Eve\u0027s orbit. My interplanetary craft? I\u0027m building it in orbit piece by piece. Try using multiple docking ports.

It comes down to getting the center of mass to the center of the craft, and directly inline with the center of thrust. Else it\u0027s going to list to the side it\u0027s unbalanced towards. It\u0027s incredibly difficult to balance a shuttle style launch with two SRBs on either side, a main liquid engine, and a drop tank.

Rocket engine blows up: some possible causes from my experience:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea. Initial launch too jerky. Before starting the stage the engine weight hangs down a bit. The sudden jerk of starting can cause it to impact whatever is above it instead of just pushing upward. I have sometimes overcome this by activating and then throttling up the engines before releasing the launch clamps\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eb. Too much force/power. When using a large orange tank with a mainsail engine near my final stage I find that it tends to break apart due to sheer engine power. Other than using as many struts as possible I finally found that burning fuel from higher tanks and leaving the fuel tank directly above the engine full would keep my vehicle in one piece. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(f=ma, so less mass on top requires less force to accelerate thus reducing the force passing through the middle section to the top. When it burned the fuel directly above it then it worked in reverse; raising the center of mass for the rocket and eventually causing catastrophic failure in the connecting segments.) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also avoid using RCS fuel tanks anywhere that will experience \u0022mainsail\u0022 thrust. The RCS fuel tanks are just too flimsy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ec. Overheating? Not sure if this is your problem, but the solution tends to be less throttle and a close eye. Sometimes seperatron rockets placed in a bad spot will cause an engine to explode as they pass it when staging.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 2. I avoid wings on my rockets... too many kerbals lost to changing force vectors of lift as a result of the velocity and atmospheric density. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. I don\u0027t pay much attention to center of mass for rockets, but top-heavy is prone to tipping over and hard to steer. Having engines thrust as far down as possibly makes it easier to steer with thrust vectoring but you have to leave ASAS running if you have a topheavy craft because if it turns too far sideways it is like balancing a broomstick on the palm of your hand and it will just fall over. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.

If I have a station set up (usually a cylinder atop the rocket) I tend to find that the rocket blows up. Usually one of the connections, typically the one connecting the rear engine of the station, gives out, and boom. I\u0027m wondering if I am accelerating too hard, or if the weight of the station itself is the problem?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I tend to aim for a 2.2 TWR, and if the ship can\u0027t handle that, figure out how to strut things so it holds together better. Sometimes I even go so far as to put 8 symmetrically mounted pylons around the top of one stage, and strut them to the bottom of the next stage. Or some other part that\u0027s breaking under acceleration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Hovis\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Hovis\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E2. Is there any mileage in a piggy-back launch like the Space Shuttle, or is that a dead end? A huge number of Kerbals have died in my experiments with this method of launch. I feel bad. But is there something in it? Typically I find that either I lose control of the rocket and it tips over, or if I put a buttload of power into the first stage to offset it then it just tears itself up. Is there a solution?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt can be made to work, though that\u0027s a lot easier with an addon that someone wrote that allows you to adjust the thrust of engines to handle things like that. While a functional solution, that means that you\u0027re lifting engines that aren\u0027t using their full thrust at any point in the launch, which is inefficient. Personally, I consider it more trouble than it\u0027s worth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Hovis\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Hovis\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E3. Are there any general things I should be aware of when looking at the Centre of Mass, Centre of Thrust and Centre of Lift? Do I just want to keep them all near the bottom?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou need to make sure that the center of thrust goes through the center of mass, otherwise you\u0027ll have steering problems in space or during vertical ascents. Center of Lift is something you only need worry about if you\u0027re building a space plane. On the other hand, if you\u0027re using control surfaces to guide a rocket, make sure that they\u0027re towards the back of the rocket, having a lot of drag towards the nose of the craft causes it to be inherently unstable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Hovis\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Hovis\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E4. If I want to build an interplanetary ship in space, do I effectively have to dock all the parts together or are there other ways?
