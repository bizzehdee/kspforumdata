I\u0027m not sure if this was an artifact of updating to the new inventory system in the middle of a game, but my last Kerbal rescue contract was around Duna, and when I finally got around to picking the stranded Kerbal up from his dead capsule, it turned out he didn\u0027t have an EVA pack in his inventory, and neither did any of the crew of the rescue vessel. That sure made things more difficult, especially\u00A0 given the large size and docking port wobbliness\u00A0of the rescuing vessel! It ended up taking me almost an hour to finally get a hatch close enough\u00A0for him to grab.\u00A0 I can\u0027t say that I found getting blindsided by that\u00A0particularly fun, but if I had known that was the situation, I could have planned for it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs to your idea, I don\u0027t know so much about the whole injury aspect, but making it harder to find them in later rescue contracts sounds like a great idea to me, as does immobilizing them somehow. For example, they could be in a lander that\u0027s on its side, with its antenna broken off and\u00A0 its\u00A0exit hatch obstructed by the ground. The game would give you a general area of where the crash happened, but to actually find the stranded Kerbal,\u00A0 you would have to get within some range like 10km to get a navigation signal from their EVA suit radio, and then within physics range perhaps to actually be allowed to switch to the stranded vessel or Kerbonaut. Then of course you would have to figure out how to right the vessel to do the rescue, and then perhaps even make some repairs to it so its occupant can fly/drive it to some predetermined location themselves.\u00A0 There would be a lot of possibilities in that vein.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
