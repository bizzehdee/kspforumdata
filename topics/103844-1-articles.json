I believe, that these games have been insanely over-hyped, like, more than any other game I\u0027ve seen my life, barring obviously larger things, like, Minecraft updates, or Call of Duty seventy thousand. But these games aren\u0027t what everyone makes them out to be. People either think it\u0027s, a dumb attempt to try to make a horror game by using Chuck E. Cheese as the basis, or they think that the only point to the game is the \u0022scurreh\u0022 jump-scares. But there is a reason this game evolved to be more than another mere, indie game. It\u0027s unknown feeling behind the game\u0027s back-story is what interests so many. There are many mysteries to theorize about and guess on the events and why they happen. And some people, myself included, strangely like the characters of the game. Whoa whoa whoa hold on a minute, \u0022bruh, you sayin that you one of dose, FNaF bad guys who all about, havin .... with robotic, corpse stained animalz. that\u0027s so wrung bro.\u0022 (fun fact, that took longer to type than this entire message) this is another one of those stereotypes people associate with things. They try to find the bad in something, and then associate everything connected to that group by that bad thing. It\u0027s like calling all of the KSP players in the world, nerdy, unattractive, uncool losers who play a stupid rocket game. Now that hurt, didn\u0027t it? So how does that make it a viable thing to say.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut before I drag myself out of topic, back to the games.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe games certaintly aren\u0027t anything groundbreaking on their own, but there\u0027s one thing these games capture well, impending fear. That\u0027s why everyone likes them. The general trope with horror games is, \u0022RAWH blood everywhere! RAWH skeletons! RAWH JUMPSCARE!\u0022 but these games divide from that. There\u0027s inherently nothing wrong with these locations. But you know, there\u0027s a killer(s) out there, who want you dead. And that drives anxiety levels up the wall. And as I mentioned earlier, the true reason why people like these games is because of the story. It\u0027s an unsolved magic murder mystery! It\u0027s intriguing! That\u0027s why people want to find out the answer and theorize, and it\u0027s why the games are widely accepted. And for the games being milked, I disagree. It\u0027s a one man deal who, did this for every release schedule. Release game, spend six months modelling new characters, locations, a story, audio, and rendering that all, and THEN going in and making a game around that, in hundreds, of thousands of individually rendered images creating a game. That\u0027s a lot of effort for one person. And come on, eight dollars isn\u0027t really, \u0022milking it\u0022, if you\u0027re talking about six months. What is it, EA\u0027s Madden, and NBA, and FIFA, and NHL, come out once a year, on the year, clamoring for sixty dollars. Each. Scott would have to create thirty FNaF games over a period of fifteen years to equal that in one year. (There are people who do get all four EA games, trust me.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, so what about imitation games? Name a game that HASN\u0027T been imitated before, even slightly? Because honestly, every game has gotten some crap stupid fan game at some point, that\u0027s fact. So what if there\u0027s a few of these? If we don\u0027t care about them, why do they remotely matter? Minecraft got a million clones because it was popular. Flappy Bird got a million clones because it was popular. Do we care about them? No! We just point at them, laugh a bit, and move on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, in my opinion, the games are a excellent mystery wrapped in a entry level horror game, that doesn\u0027t try to hard to out right scare you with BOO!, but more or less imposes demise.

If it were triple A priced or priced as a standard indie game people would be up in arms about a dev releasing an unfinished game or withholding content for DLC in order to make more money.\u003Cp\u003ESecondly it\u0027s horror comes from the fact that you have to do zero work to find any of the lore. Plenty of games have horror in them worse than FNAF.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake Fallout NV for example, there\u0027s a quest requiring you to retrieve a compass from a wreck of a bus, once you get there the bus is ran off the road and surrounded by skeletons too small to be an adult and lots of lunch boxes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow what happened there? Who were they? did their families die at the same time or did they survive never knowing what happened to them?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s also houses that have a skeleton in the bathtub with a knife next to another one. What is the story there?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECaesars legion is filled with the exact same things are well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only different is that FNAF hands you all of this on a silver platter all the while wanting to know if you\u0027d like a piggyback ride while it\u0027s making airplane noises.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t personally own any FNAF games, but from what I have seen on Game Theory at least, the story and lore was never really fully handed to you (though I do not know if that changed with FNAF 3). I mean, a decent amount of it was given, and you could get more of it through observing, but there always seemed to be loose ends. Each successive game tied up some of the previous loose ends, but left more of the mystery to be solved. Looking closely and connecting dots could get you further in solving the mysteries, but not always all the way there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that is the difference between the games you were describing and games with mysteries and lore like FNAF. In the examples you gave you can never find out what happened to the dead children or the 2 skeletons. You can only vaguely guess as to the causes and results of what happened, and then move on. You\u0027re not going to spend hours connecting dots and gathering information because it is pointless to. FNAF gives you a mystery, but it keeps developing the mystery the more you play the games. The delays between each released helped this even more, giving people time to connect dots and theorize before the next release would come out, generating anticipation and encouraging even more connecting of dots and theorizing. It is the hunt to solve the mystery that makes the FNAF games interesting, not the existence of the mystery itself. There isn\u0027t a hunt to solve the mysteries in the examples you gave; if there was they would make great mysteries.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ethanadams","CreatedById":136913,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-11T03:15:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBut hey that\u0027s a theory a game theory\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RAINCRAFTER","CreatedById":127524,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-11T12:37:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022EpicX rocketry gardens.co\u0022 data-cite=\u0022EpicX rocketry gardens.co\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EThis a very serious case of overhyping over a game and my reason why I say this?\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EThis could become the end of video games by if the movie is a smash then people to make more games like this then it gets to the point alot of game companies start making more clones of Fnaf and then its just the same again and again when the trends dies out people will most likely forget about the generes before the mayhem started or EA invests in the FNAF games and buys them then people will buy it and EA\u0027s games are horrible then games become trash games like before in the early days of gaming and nintendo saved the day by licenses.
