Though i can build simple aircraft which helps with first atmospheric part tests. Also got to the Mun (Orbit) once but couldn\u0027t return due to lack of fuel. At least i have technology now to rescue my poor Kerbal and do other Kerbal rescues. Very hard to get science now to unlock Skipper/Rockomax parts to make Mun landings possible for more science. Career mode for sure is very very hard for new players now (normal difficulty). Also lost Jeb and Valentine due to re-entry heat problems with capsules turning around during aerobreaking.

From reading the craft file, it looks like what you had is very similar to what I had, except that you\u0027re using the 90/110 fuel tanks instead of the 45/55 ones and you also have tail fins. I read on another thread that the larger tanks somehow have less drag when stacked up than the smaller ones, so that may have made a significant difference. You also put less fuel in your upper stage and more in your lower than I did, which probably helped as well. Moreover, the tail fins probably helped you to maintain a better profile -- if you think that ship was hard to control you should have seen mine! The thing I didn\u0027t mention in my OP was that I was trying to do this as my second mission of the game, so I only had the first two nodes of the tech tree unlocked.
