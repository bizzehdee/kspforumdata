I\u0027ve had pretty good results so far starting to turn off vertical at a couple km tops (I hate dropping SRBs straight down onto the launch pad, but then again I\u0027ve been yelled at by real-life range safety officers before) and pitching over gradually.

From reading the craft file, it looks like what you had is very similar to what I had, except that you\u0027re using the 90/110 fuel tanks instead of the 45/55 ones and you also have tail fins. I read on another thread that the larger tanks somehow have less drag when stacked up than the smaller ones, so that may have made a significant difference. You also put less fuel in your upper stage and more in your lower than I did, which probably helped as well. Moreover, the tail fins probably helped you to maintain a better profile -- if you think that ship was hard to control you should have seen mine! The thing I didn\u0027t mention in my OP was that I was trying to do this as my second mission of the game, so I only had the first two nodes of the tech tree unlocked. No tail fins or bigger tanks for me. Anyway, you have shown that it is doable without upgrading any facilities!\n\nOh, and as to the Launchpad upgrade being first, I was thinking more that the astronaut facility would be the best one to do first, because then you can do space EVAs over all the different Kerbin biomes to get more science. Either way, the Launchpad would definitely be the next one for me. There\u0027s no getting to the Mun with only 18 tons! I guess it\u0027s really a matter of what you\u0027re trying to do.
