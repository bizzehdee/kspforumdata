(For example, a 500-part ship would have a base score of -2,500... add the Mission accomplished to bring it up to -2,000... usually 2 stages or so to LKO, one stage for each transfer, with lander in-between, so say 5 stages: 5*-10 = -50... that takes score to -2,050... you would ned to take 20 and a half \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003EKerbals\u003C/span\u003E Orange Tanks to get a positive score :-/)(Why did you call it \u0027The more the Merrier\u0027?

And I can confirm it is possible. It just is going to be a hell of a lot harder than I thought. I have so far put 1 orange tank on the surface of eloo safely. I have to go back to the drawing board for a redesign though as im about out of places to ADD MAOR BOOSTERS. I hate to do it but I might have to resort to an asparagus monster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway I would also like to note that there is an extra 500 point reward to anyone who does this with a spaceplane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd if it helps get you guys intrested in the challange I have a friend whose drawing up badge designs right now.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
