Each of these have their own nuclear tug (the tugs have 3240 units of fuel and two nuclear rockets). It took me a long time to assemble this in kerbin orbit and now I want to see if this was worth it. I wanted to do a test first so that nothing went wrong, so I took the tug with the ground base and waited for the window to Jool (using ksp transfer calculator). I used the maneuver node to see how much I would need to burn to get to Jool, the best i could get was 1934m/s for a Jool periapsis of about 1,400,000,000. I started my burn, keeping the header on the blue vector. I stopped there cause it seemed like something wasn\u0027t right. So first question is, should I keep the header on the prograde vector? Next question is how to lower that huge periapsis before actually getting into Jool orbit?

The difference in fuel will be fairly minimal. If you aren\u0027t planning aerobraking, it might make things easier. But otherwise, once you\u0027re on transfer orbit, just set up a new node and play with the controls. See which ones make periapsis go down. If inclination is the reason you aren\u0027t getting good periapsis, best place to adjust that is at ascending/descending nodes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut yeah, once you set the navigation node, it\u0027s just a matter of burning in direction of blue marker. The only reason you might be getting off course this way is that your \u0022control from\u0022 part of the ship might not match the direction of your engines. That can happen if your overall ship is a multitude of docked parts. Just find a docking port, capsule, or probe that points the right way, click on it, select, \u0022Control from here,\u0022 and you should be set.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"numerobis","CreatedById":62016,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-01T04:50:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI beg to differ.

If your goal is transfer to Laythe, it\u0027s going to be considerably less.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuppose, you are heading to Jool on Hohmann transfer orbit from Kerbin. You\u0027ll hit Jool\u0027s SOI at 1,750m/s. If your periapsis is right there at the edge of the system, transfer to Laythe will cost you 1,700m/s and you\u0027ll reach Laythe SOI going 1,310m/s. If your goal is parking in Laythe orbit, you\u0027ll have to burn these 1,310 and then some, but that\u0027s an absolute minimum for parking anywhere in Laythe SOI. So your total Delta-V is 3,060m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, suppose you are going to pass right above Jool\u0027s atmo. You\u0027ll buzz the giant at 9,740m/s and it will cost you 1,080m/s to slow down to Laythe transfer. You\u0027ll reach Laythe\u0027s SOI going 1,270m/s relative to it. So your total Delta-V is going to be 2,450m/s. So you do save 600m/s with extremely low periapsis. Of course, if you are going to drop that low, you might as well aerobrake and save a lot more. A more typical periapsis of a few thousand km over Jool will save a lot less.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, if you decide to hit Laythe directly, by carefully adjusting your periapsis from a distance, you\u0027ll enter Laythe SOI at 4,860m/s. So this is definitely not the best option if you are planning to put a station there. On the other hand, if you are planning a direct landing on Laythe, there is no reason not to do that. You\u0027ll hit Laythe atmo going 5,450m/s, and that\u0027s perfectly survivable even in Laythe\u0027s thiner atmosphere. (Though, once they enable over-G damage, you\u0027ll have to chose re-entry angle very, very carefully. If you come in too steeply, you can easily hit 50G\u002B.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Luis","CreatedById":55075,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-01T08:46:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo answer the first part of your question, the blue node vector shows the direction you should be pointing as your craft reaches the manoeuvre node. For a simple transfer burn, that will line up with the prograde marker at that point. But if you start your burn earlier, they don\u0027t match. Because the blue marker is point at your prograde vector at some future point along your orbit, it actually angles downwards towards Kerbin a bit. And the earlier you start your burn, the bigger the discrepancy. This means that a lot of your thrust is wasted by firing in the wrong direction. If your burn produces exactly the same amount of delta v on either side of the node, the average vector should still line up with the projected orbit trajectory. But your orbit will be a lot more circular - less of a narrow elipse - because of the extra thrust you have expended that wasn\u0027t prograde. And because exactly balancing the delta v across the manoeuvre node is hard to do, you will probably also miss your intended intercept point to some degree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI find it is generally best to start your burn when the prograde marker is no more than 5 degrees from the node marker on the nav ball.

Almost no deviation form the projected final orbit or total delta-v, too (wobbling uncertainty is often more of an issue). So I\u0027d say it\u0027s not much to sweat about, as long as you have T/W over 0.1.

It\u0027s *much* further away and the transfer burn requires around 1900m/s dV. If your Minmus burn is taking 10 minutes, a Jool transfer burn will need at least 20. At LKO, your orbital period is only 30 minutes, so starting 10 minutes early will put you 120 degrees away from the manoeuvre node. If you just point at the blue navball marker from that far away, your final trajectory will deviate hugely from the idealised manoeuvre node projection.

As long as you don\u0027t have a tight dV budget you don\u0027t have to be too picky about the timing of these. The first should take you to just under kerbin\u0027s escape velocity, an orbit with an apoapse just under Minmus\u0027s orbit, or shorter still if you\u0027re underpowered. Then when you swing around your periapsis again you can make the final burn to eject you towards Jool. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMidcourse corrections can easily iron out targeting errors and get you a periapse around Jool of your choosing. If you\u0027re going with aerocapture, make sure you fine tune the periapse before you enter the Jool SoI, and this goes double for Laythe. Considering the thrust you described in earlier posts, I\u0027d strongly recommend aerocapture around Jool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI should point out that the above are meerly suggestions based on my own experience, and as this thread has shown, there\u0027s more than one way to tackle the problem. That said, I don\u0027t think you should give up on Laythe so quickly. If you can make it to Duna, even sloppily, Laythe is definitely doable, and a very rewarding challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Luis","CreatedById":55075,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-11T07:14:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDuna is actually harder to reach than Jool, in some ways, because its SOI is much smaller.
