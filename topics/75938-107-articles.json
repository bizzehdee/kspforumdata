However, the stock wheel MM configs have yet to be gone over for any breaking changes relating to the 1.0 release, so that will be my next project.

Why do I have to select \u0027right\u0027 to have one of your parts that I\u0027ve placed on the LEFT side of a rover orient itself correctly? This is true of the Long Track, and now also the ERS wheel. I\u0027ve been wondering this for a while now. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, there you go. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAh, the wheel tread pattern swap. I need to look into that. And the left/right thing is just me configuring the side swap wrong. Invert the names in the .cfg and it\u0027ll be fixed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Gaalidas\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Gaalidas\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBasically, as I mentioned in my update notes for github, I found the ASET config was referencing an old path to the model, which I fixed up. For the people that want to replace the old wheels rather than add to them, I uploaded an updated MM config which will replace all the stock wheels and the ASET wheel. However, the stock wheel MM configs have yet to be gone over for any breaking changes relating to the 1.0 release, so that will be my next project. I have yet to succeed in launching KSP since the update due to mod incompatibilities and exceptions and such. I \u003Cem\u003Ereally \u003C/em\u003Eneed to clean my GameData folder out.\u003Cp\u003EFor those having problems with the ERS wheels in their standard configuration, I\u0027d make sure you\u0027ve got the may 15th update for ERS, and be sure that v0.3 of JSIPartUtilities has been installed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for me working over those experimental modules and such, I really can\u0027t help myself. Excess bugs me, and redundancy pisses me off (so to speak, and not necessarily in a negative way all the time) so I just \u003Cem\u003Ehave\u003C/em\u003E to filly with them or I\u0027ll go nuts... well, \u003Cem\u003Emore\u003C/em\u003E nuts anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Another thing we need to do now is find a way of re-implementing the ERS wheel\u0027s retracted mode. I had a look at the original config and it references the animation as a part of the FSWheel module directly. I remember you had supported something similar in your modules at one time, lo-fi. As it is now, using your wheel module means the ERS wheel cannot go into retracted mode without some more config editing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou don\u0027t need JSI installed \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E Retract is on the list for when I tackle landing gear.
