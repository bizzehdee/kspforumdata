What you see here is a 4000m/s prograde burn node created for that purpose:confused: Kraken must love me so much he always visits when im towing an E class...

See how much Xenon I get and how much delta V I get after grabbing the asteroid. I literally spent two (Earth) days (although not continuously playing) to tow it from a Ap=150Mm (escaping) orbit to a 81Mm one (that doesn\u0027t escape Kerbin) (the screenshot is somewhere yesterday while towing is still in progress).\n\nJust give you a data point of how things would look like and what is achievable. Technically I could reduce my number of Ions to get higher dV, but the towing experience will be much worse..."},{"CreatedByName":"n0xiety","CreatedById":143324,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T11:19:23Z","Content":"I think you got me wrong. I am not having problem with dV or thrust. Mining works great and you can practically get more than 10000dV if you mine the whole asteroid while towing it. My problem is the fact that atleast half of my attempts ends up with kraken attack. I must have seen every bug about kraken. Asteroid stoping in orbit, phantom acceleration, unstopable turn, universe disappearing, atmosphere disappearing... All of these happens while towing a big asteroid.

I see weird explosion - because my solar clipped into the asteroid and then I warped/quickloaded. I see it spins - because I\u0027m not thrusting against CoM exactly. Other than those, no other issue that caught my eye."},{"CreatedByName":"n0xiety","CreatedById":143324,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T12:10:18Z","Content":"Well look at it this way. Asteroids and comets have water(generally) Turn water into the most used space stage fuel atm = liquid hydrogen and oxygen. Totally doable easily in real life. Besides that much xenon gas would bankrupt my career and still won\u0027t be able to eject an E class out of solar system."},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T12:20:31Z","Content":"It should cost a lot more energy to produce this fuel - sure doable in real life, but on the scale of hundreds of tons? maybe not just with a drill and ISRU and this amount of electricity. Also the ISRU can produce pure LF or pure O with that rate - water might be a bad real life example for it. So I wasn\u0027t connecting the mining system with any real life concepts. In my mind asteroid is still something that scientists are most interested in, not engineers - but that\u0027s just me.\n\nI don\u0027t have much fund pressure in my career so I\u0027m doing that - partly because I used some other mods that over-rewards some contracts and I just wanted to waste the extra money somewhere to balance myself, but whatever..."},{"CreatedByName":"Requia","CreatedById":112924,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T09:00:35Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I think you got me wrong.

It will, however, stop them once they have started. The only problem there is if the kraken has already trashed the orbit, restarting won\u0027t fix that if it\u0027s been saved.\n\nCheers,\n\n-Claw"}]}
