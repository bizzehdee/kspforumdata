The launch escape works fine while the rocket is in mid-flight, but not before launch. When I active the action group to decouple the pod and fire the escape rockets, the capsule separates and flies off, but the camera focuses on a point between the rocket and the capsule, as if they were still connected. Also, several parts that were connected to the decoupler now stay with the Capsule\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Q0iWSVO.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Q0iWSVO.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a little bit, the entire rocket explodes for some reason and the capsule is suddenly accelerated at high speed toward the launch pad, as if pulled back by a bungee cord.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1hqi5gu.png\u0022 alt=\u00221hqi5gu.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly very quick deployment of parachutes can interrupt this effect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo get to the bottom of this, I tested decoupling the pod.

Works quite well, even with no SAS. The 3.75m default DRE heatshield masses a good amount, so my total mass for the capsule, shield, chutes, and docking port were almost 12 tons. But, she flew pretty much straight as an arrow the whole way. I imagine without the shield, it would have been a bit more exciting, since FAR wasn\u0027t calculating the pod to have much drag at that orientation anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, you might consider making the bottom node for the capsule a size 3. FAR has calculated size/drag from the nodes, so given that you are 3.75 meters at the base, it would help to have the right node size. I did try this during testing and it didn\u0027t fix the odd drag, so no magic bullet there. And since stock now has size 3 parts, it would probably be beneficial to follow that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope all this helps you out.
