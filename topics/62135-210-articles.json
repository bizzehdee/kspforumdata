I have used the IR arm and it works however its bulky takes up quite alot of room in the cargo bay because of the attachment point. I was just saying that the work you guys do, I think you would do an incredible arm that would round out the KSO and the pack in general. Because like I said it could be extremely versitile, for base building or attaching to a rover or to release the rover. I mean I know you guys would make it versatile because most of the parts in this pack can be used for 20 different things. I honestly don\u0027t think it would be a one use thing. It would be incredibly versatile and useful in building bases. You land to far away, get the rover attach the arm and drive it to where it has to go. You want to deploy the rover from a cargo bay use the arm, building a station and you don\u0027t want to use the tug use the arm, servicing the cactye telescope, i mean it adds a whole new dimension to the game if its done properly and if there are any modders out there that could do it I know you guys could do it properly and make it versatile. I mean think about it, it could be a modular arm that could be configured in different ways for different purposes. \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF0000;\u0022\u003EThat all being said, as I said this isn\u0027t a request it is merely a suggestion and something you guys should think about if you ever come back to doing stuff for KSO. I mean the hours you guys put in to it, you probably just want to move on to different things.

The robotic arm has been a suggestion from the very start of phase 1. And there\u0027s been great suggestions in this thread on how to get current robot arm mods to work with these shuttles. However, I\u0027m sure if Helldiver wanted to make one, he\u0027d make one. His solution to station building is the Tug. Furthermore, I\u0027m pretty sure nobody was branding anybody.

I\u0027ll post again when I\u0027ve finished up the meshes.

My earlier experiments with deploying the MKS from the Super 25 showed me that the MKS modules were too big for the shuttle, so I am working on a more compact variant. But it\u0027s more than that; rather than clutter the parts catalog, the mod I wrote lets you change the decals on the part and swap out the modules as well. It\u0027s like a mini Module Manager that you can control. It works for the existing MKS/OKS 3D meshes too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022OrbitusII\u0022 data-cite=\u0022OrbitusII\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be really cool to put together a community KSOS expansion thread if there\u0027s enough people with contributions...
