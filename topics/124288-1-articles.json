I need help. I know that the Basic Fins I put are bugged and they clip through my ship and this is maybe why it crashes. The game also crashes even when I loaded another ship but not systematically each time I go back to the space center. I have attached a log file so you can sort this out helpfully.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDropbox link: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/sh/k4wxiwk1o1m345w/AADuqmBkNA7UPOQf3Qm_4Z98a?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/k4wxiwk1o1m345w/AADuqmBkNA7UPOQf3Qm_4Z98a?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stickman939","CreatedById":131481,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-03T10:29:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat is the craft size of your ship?
