I\u0027ve done a little research on it, and I understand that creating an alpha channel is supposed to alleviate this problem. However, when I did that, it just makes everything a little darker. I\u0027m using photoshop CS5, and it\u0027s just not working out. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny thoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xellith","CreatedById":35053,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-07T00:13:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt sounds like it could possibly be inverted Normals. If you can see inside your model when its in unity and you see the textures pop up from the inside on the transparent faces then its definitely a Normals issue. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Dont mean to patronise or anything but what Im saying now is for people other than yourself that may not be aware and may read this in future)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen creating a model, only one side of a face actually gets the texture. The other side is transparent. You may have seen this in hundreds of games out there where you can see inside rocks and look outwards at somewhere else. Your camera being inside an object and looking outwards for example is an instance of seeing these \u0022normals\u0022 from the inside. Thus them being transparent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I dont personally know of a quick way of fixing inverted normals. I often just go through them one by one comparing them to my unity/KSP product and flip them as and when I think they are due a flippin. Or say screw it and delete a huge chunk of my model and re-do it lol.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps. Im sure someone else will be along to offer you a faster solution to your problem.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CluelessModeler","CreatedById":58172,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-07T00:20:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, that does help a bit. But, the camera view is outside of the model, and I\u0027m still seeing parts that intersect internally, from the outside. It\u0027s almost like the face that is closest to the camera is transparent, but, the opposite side (furthest away), has the correct coloring.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xellith","CreatedById":35053,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-07T00:49:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022CluelessModeler\u0022 data-cite=\u0022CluelessModeler\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell, that does help a bit.
