Can you build a nice orbiting shipyard type complex and build stuff there? I see the mod Kerbal Inventory System, Kerbal Attachment System. Can you use this mod to build ships in orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOutside of a gravity well fuel costs are significantly reduced so it makes since that a long term interplanetary mission ship would likely be constructed in this manner. I really wish stock KSP gave you a way to do this.

I suppose later in the game in if your playing science or career mode getting to orbit isn\u0027t such an issue. You unlock better fuel tanks, engines etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso yes you are right you are still in a gravity well anywhere near a planet. But you are in not in the gravity well as deep so it\u0027s much easier to obtain escape velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking forward to lots of mod updates but playing vanilla for now.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
