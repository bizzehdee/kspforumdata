I thought it was just in a highly eccentric orbit, not a suborbital impact trajectory (I think I must have stopped reading after \u0022captured into a wide orbit\u0022). I understand now. Yeah, what you\u0027re saying is about right from my experience. The planner doesn\u0027t really work terribly well for that situation. I suspect it\u0027s due at least partly to math errors and needing to hit a very precise 4D (3D \u002B time) position.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I\u0027ve found works is to create a 1st node that puts you in the roughly right area, then add a second node to the projected result of the first, and play around with that; that has allowed me to get an intercept in similar circumstances. Basically plan both your initial and mid-course correction burns at the same time. It\u0027s fiddly, but possible, and has worked for me. Using that method, it\u0027s still extremely sensitive to tiny adjustments, with the correct intercept point only showing for a very narrow range, tiny adjustments either way and it vanishes again. In initial planning don\u0027t worry about completely closing the closest approach, just get confirmation that you\u0027ll be within about 250km of it, then do the first burn. After the first burn is complete, you can then more easily refine the mid-course correction burn to narrow the approach, and/or plot additional correction burns and final velocity matching burn.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Arkalius","CreatedById":40968,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T03:53:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, when you zoom out far enough, trajectories that intersect the body\u0027s surface no longer clip under the body, so you can\u0027t tell it\u0027s going to impact from that picture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess I can try what you\u0027re saying, but I don\u0027t even know where to ballpark the apoapsis at this point... are there any mods that help you predict where bodies will be on their orbit in the future?

Play around with both the pro/retrograde and radial adjustments on the 2nd node, plus sliding it up and down the ascending trajectory, until you get at least a flicker of intercept markers.

Adjustments/corrections are generally really low cost in terms of dV once you\u0027re half way to Mun or further out, but remember to get a read of that 2nd node\u0027s required dV before doing the first burn, as it\u0027s easy to plot a 1000m/s 2nd node and not realise it (navball only shows dV for 1st node), 2nd needs you to exit node-edit mode and then hover over the unselected 2nd node.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for mods, don\u0027t know.
