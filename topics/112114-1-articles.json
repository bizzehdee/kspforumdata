I want to send a ship to it to try to redirect it. I\u0027m trying to set up an orbital trajectory to intercept it, but KSP won\u0027t show me useful intercept markers. Look at [this image](http://i.imgur.com/Oo3X3s3.png). I want to have it so that I intercept the asteroid on its orbit around my planned orbit\u0027s apoapsis, but KSP insists on showing me rather unhelpful intercept points down close to the planet.\n\nHow can I force KSP to show me relative position markers at the point where my planned apoapsis intersects the asteroid\u0027s orbit?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-07T03:39:41Z\u0022 title=\u002206/07/2015 03:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Arkalius**"},{"CreatedByName":"DeMatt","CreatedById":90539,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T02:20:04Z","Content":"What KSP is telling you with that, is that your apoapsis DOESN\u0027T intersect the asteroid\u0027s orbit. Try right-clicking and moving the camera around.\n\nAs to how to set up the intercept, the first thing I would do is to bring your orbiting tug into the same plane as the asteroid - set up a maneuver at the ascending or descending node and burn as necessary to bring that to zero. Then you can push your apoapsis out to where the asteroid will be."},{"CreatedByName":"Arkalius","CreatedById":40968,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T02:31:14Z","Content":"Even if I get it perfectly aligned (they are pretty close in that screenshot) I still don\u0027t get a useful intercept marker.

The node planner/editor only shows you the next 2 closest points of approach, even if those are a long way apart. With a huge difference in orbital period between LKO and a high Ap orbit such as shown in the picture, it should change fairly quickly.\n\nIf the asteroid is up in the top of its orbit, and you\u0027re in LKO, then it will be down at the bottom by the time you reach the top.

The problem is, I don\u0027t know what that optimal intersection is, and the game refuses to tell me.\n\nI mean think about it... look at the picture. How long will it take the asteroid to move in its own orbit the a point near my planned apoapsis? It will be about the same amount of time it will take me to reach that apoapsis.

I didn\u0027t spot \u0022collision course\u0022 in your message or picture. I thought it was just in a highly eccentric orbit, not a suborbital impact trajectory (I think I must have stopped reading after \u0022captured into a wide orbit\u0022). I understand now. Yeah, what you\u0027re saying is about right from my experience. The planner doesn\u0027t really work terribly well for that situation. I suspect it\u0027s due at least partly to math errors and needing to hit a very precise 4D (3D \u002B time) position.\n\nWhat I\u0027ve found works is to create a 1st node that puts you in the roughly right area, then add a second node to the projected result of the first, and play around with that; that has allowed me to get an intercept in similar circumstances. Basically plan both your initial and mid-course correction burns at the same time. It\u0027s fiddly, but possible, and has worked for me. Using that method, it\u0027s still extremely sensitive to tiny adjustments, with the correct intercept point only showing for a very narrow range, tiny adjustments either way and it vanishes again. In initial planning don\u0027t worry about completely closing the closest approach, just get confirmation that you\u0027ll be within about 250km of it, then do the first burn. After the first burn is complete, you can then more easily refine the mid-course correction burn to narrow the approach, and/or plot additional correction burns and final velocity matching burn."},{"CreatedByName":"Arkalius","CreatedById":40968,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T03:53:28Z","Content":"Yeah, when you zoom out far enough, trajectories that intersect the body\u0027s surface no longer clip under the body, so you can\u0027t tell it\u0027s going to impact from that picture.\n\nI guess I can try what you\u0027re saying, but I don\u0027t even know where to ballpark the apoapsis at this point... are there any mods that help you predict where bodies will be on their orbit in the future? I could at least come up with a good ballpark if I could plan an orbit, check apoapsis time, and see where the asteroid will be in that time, then adjust as needed.\n\nIt\u0027s going to require a fair bit of delta-v to get to an intercept (about 1500-2000 I reckon). Then I need to have enough delta-v to move the asteroid out of a collision course.

Sounds kinda fun.\n\nTry putting your projected Ap from 1st node about half way between Kerbin and the asteroid\u0027s current position, with the Ap marker roughly on top of its descending trajectory. Then try your second node about 50-75% up your ascending trajectory. Play around with both the pro/retrograde and radial adjustments on the 2nd node, plus sliding it up and down the ascending trajectory, until you get at least a flicker of intercept markers. It is all a bit tiresome, really, just a combination of trial, error, and zen. Maybe someone else has found a better trick and will share some better tricks for it. Adjustments/corrections are generally really low cost in terms of dV once you\u0027re half way to Mun or further out, but remember to get a read of that 2nd node\u0027s required dV before doing the first burn, as it\u0027s easy to plot a 1000m/s 2nd node and not realise it (navball only shows dV for 1st node), 2nd needs you to exit node-edit mode and then hover over the unselected 2nd node.\n\nAs for mods, don\u0027t know.

So one thing you could try is to put a fake second maneuver node at your apoapsis to raise your periapsis far away from the asteroids. You of course won\u0027t actually use this fake node, but you should be able to force it to show you the closest approach near your apoapsis because you give it no other close option on your next orbit."},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T04:57:03Z","Content":"Another possibility is getting into a matching orbit, but retrograde ... it\u0027s not going to be the most efficient, but you\u0027ll overfly the asteroid at some point pretty far out, and it won\u0027t take much of a radial burn to establish something like a 40-50 km periapsis and just reduce the orbit that way."},{"CreatedByName":"Arkalius","CreatedById":40968,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T03:17:47Z","Content":"So I made it work. It turns out you will get intercept markers there but it\u0027s extremely finicky and sensitive. I was able to ballpark it well enough to get there and come to a relative stop within 3.6km.

I set up a maneuver node that brought the periapsis up to a safe level and lined up the node marker with the center of mass and docked it.\n\nI have some fuel left to bring it\u0027s apoapsis down a good bit but I\u0027ll have to send another craft (will probably send a mining barge) to fix up its orbit even more.
