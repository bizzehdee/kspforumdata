Some times after setting up a maneuvering node and with a bit of disorientation, I have no idea where the blue maneuvering node cue for directional burn, is supposed to be located. It would be nice to have a small blue dot around the edge when the symbol is not visible. Perhaps something similar for the other symbols.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pixel of Life","CreatedById":45646,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-31T16:17:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI believe this is exactly what you\u0027re looking for:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/50524-0-23-Enhanced-Navball-1-2\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EEnhanced Navball 1.2\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
