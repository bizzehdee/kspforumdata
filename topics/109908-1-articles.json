This previously inconspicuous star underwent an outburst early in 2002, during which it temporarily increased in brightness to become 600,000 times more luminous than our Sun. Light from this sudden eruption is illuminating the interstellar dust surrounding the star, producing the most spectacular \u0022light echo\u0022 in the history of astronomy.\n\u003E As light from the eruption propagates outward into the dust, it is scattered by the dust and travels to the Earth. The scattered light has travelled an extra distance in comparison to light that reaches Earth directly from the stellar outburst. Such a light echo is the optical analogue of the sound echo produced when an Alpine yodel is reflected from the surrounding mountainsides.\n\u003E \n\u003E The NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope has been observing the V838 Mon light echo since 2002. Each new observation of the light echo reveals a new and unique \u0022thin-section\u0022 through the interstellar dust around the star. This video morphs images of the light echo from the Hubble taken at multiple times between 2002 and 2006. The numerous whorls and eddies in the interstellar dust are particularly noticeable. Possibly they have been produced by the effects of magnetic fields in the space between the stars.\n\n It\u0027s older news, but searching the science labs showed no mention of it. Apologies if this HAS appeared here before.\n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=U1fvMSs9cps \n\n(no idea why this isn\u0027t embedding)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-19T04:46:10Z\u0022 title=\u002205/19/2015 04:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by vger**"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T05:46:28Z","Content":"If anyone is wondering, the reason the image looks kind of fake-ish is because it uses morphs as means of interpolation between frames."},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T07:03:58Z","Content":"How bright is that light echo?
