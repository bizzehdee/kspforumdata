Alot of mods can be incompatible with each other or take too much memory and I\u0027ll have to sift through which mods I need and which I can live without to suit the way I play.\n\nI\u0027m thinking of generating some sort of list that would detail a list of mods to suit people\u0027s needs.\n\nFor example for those that prefer to build bases:\n\nMKS/OKS\n\nInfernal robotics\n\nKarbonite\n\nEct...\n\nAnd lists for realism, visual fx, stock enhancement, gameplay.\n\nAlso withing each gameplay style there would be multiple options depending on system requirements. \n\nMaybe could even group all the mods into one zip.\n\nIt\u0027s just an idea at the moment but don\u0027t want to start something that people won\u0027t find helpful or useful. \n\nLet me know thanks"},{"CreatedByName":"Monsterlunch","CreatedById":135085,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T17:31:45Z","Content":"That\u0027s a goodie Sir! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nI have been looking for Mod-Compliations for quite a while and have not found anything useful, so here\u0027s mine: \n\nI currently play a stockish ksp-realism style:\n\nThis gamestyle is not vastly memory consuming, I\u0027m partly playing this game on my Surface Pro 2, onboard graphics. ![:sticktongue:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif)\n\nThere is room for beauty though, as installing more an more graphics mods makes this exploration gamestyle so much more awesome. \n\nMods are: \n\n- **KWRocketry (Stylish Rocket Parts)**\n\n [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/51037-1-02-KW-Rocketry-v2-7-Available-1-02-Compatibility!-16-05-2015](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/51037-1-02-KW-Rocketry-v2-7-Available-1-02-Compatibility!-16-05-2015)\n\n- **Station Parts Expansion (Self-explaining, i guess)**\n\n [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/91814-1-02-Stockalike-Station-Parts-Expansion-%2804-05-2015-CTT-and-minor-fixes%29](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/91814-1-02-Stockalike-Station-Parts-Expansion-%2804-05-2015-CTT-and-minor-fixes%29)\n\n- **Procedual Fairing (Because 2-Part Fairings!)**\n\n [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/39512-1-0-2-Procedural-Fairings-3-14-FAR-Euler-support-%28May-10%29](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/39512-1-0-2-Procedural-Fairings-3-14-FAR-Euler-support-%28May-10%29)\n\n- **Near Future Spacecraft \u002B Construction \u002B (Solar)**\n\n [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/52042-0-21](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/52042-0-21)\n\n*Note: Although called Near Future, using only the Construction, Spacecraft and Solar extension, realistic gameplay is obtained.* \n\n- **KAS (Interactive EVA Stuff is just so much fun!)**\n\n [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92514-0-24-2-Kerbal-Attachment-System-%28KAS%29-0-4-8-Fixed-for-0-24-2-x86-x64-%29](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92514-0-24-2-Kerbal-Attachment-System-%28KAS%29-0-4-8-Fixed-for-0-24-2-x86-x64-%29) \n\n- **Habitat Pack (Inflate!)**\n\n [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/64442-0-23-5-Habitat-Pack-v0-4](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/64442-0-23-5-Habitat-Pack-v0-4)\n\n*Note: Although outdated, patching some numbers in the .cfg\u0027s made this mod work fine for me.* \n\nThat\u0027s it. ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)\n\nI have not listed essentials like Kerbal Engineer Mechjeb etc.\n\nIf you consider taking on this project, i would be glad to help you. \n\nNow it\u0027s your turn."},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T17:40:36Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E realism\n\n[See here.](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/99966)"},{"CreatedByName":"magico13","CreatedById":73338,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T17:55:09Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Maybe could even group all the mods into one zip.\n\nBefore this turns into another one of *those* threads, I\u0027ll kindly point out that a LOT of people (usually mod authors) are against this idea, for a multitude of reasons which basically boil down to \u0022it\u0027s a nightmare for mod authors to provide support\u0022.

I\u0027m a huge fan of CKAN, saves me bouncing between Kerbalstuff, curse etc. I might see if i can speak to MR CKAN (will have a look who it is) and see if this could be integrated within CKAN. Such as an extra tab or even some sort of order to the huge list of mods. \n\nWould also be great to have an independent launch with opengl function in CKAN and some sort of counter for memory usage for the mods. Even if its something as simple as High, Med, Low.\n\nEDIT: PJF ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-23T13:04:42Z\u0022 title=\u002205/23/2015 01:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Squeaky**"}]}
