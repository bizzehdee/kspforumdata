Meanwhile, Billy Bob Jeb\u0027s Space Program can have a massively different fairing for every launch, thus playing within the limits they like. Realism is maintained by allowing each space program/launcher family to have a fairing that fits the launcher or payload as necessary, paying the drag (and fuel) penalties thereof as appropriate. Since there are no development costs for rockets in KSP there should be no penalty for fairings of varying size per launch.

Just make it symmetric, hide it under fairings, and don\u0027t let the angle of attack grow too high. Maybe start the gravity turn a bit later than usual. It\u0027s no worse than balancing on a ball.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"panzer1b","CreatedById":95108,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-15T00:37:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIm almost positive the fairings are at the minimum intended for 1.0 release. While its possible they dont make it in (like some features that havent made it in time for update, such as barns for .90), it seems like the aero update makes them much more necessary then before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for clouds, i highly doubt its going to get in (without a mod) anytime soon. Its also a way to cut down performance for those that can barely handle the game as is. While these mods are great, and personally id love some stock improvements in visuals, i dont believe squad should FORCE it upon people, \u002B how hard is installing a purely cosmetic mod that doesnt interfere with anything, doesnt touch gameplay, change parts, ect. Mods i use myself are planetshine, primarily for the darker vaccum backlighting, and EVE, with some of my own modifications to clouds, ect, and some alternative textures sourced from other games/mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TeddyDD\u0022 data-cite=\u0022TeddyDD\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnd any non-procedural fairing is big clutter in your parts list \u0026lt;yay\u0026gt;\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m \u002B1 for procedural everything \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am so in that league, i personally would make almost anything that remotely makes sense to be procedural, into a procedural part. How nice would removal of the 10-20 different wings be, if we could change that into 1-4 procedural wings with maybe different end styles, rounded corners, vs sharp corners, ect ect. I also would love procedural fuel tanks, and procedural structural panels/girders ect to be stock. This would let us create so many different shapes, create replicas of most craft, create 100% custom craft, and nolonger be forced to abuse part clipping to maintain a specific appearance of whatever we are making.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough i dont have high hopes as squad doesnt seem very much in support of procedural parts, focusing instead on adding features that just increase lag and load times. Now i really like this game, but i feel procedural parts would be beneficial both in creating more options, variety of designs, and most of all cut down the issue with massive part counts (why have wings made of 30-50 smaller ones when you can make it from 1-3 procedural wings. Same with fuel tanks, why not let us make a single fuel tank at any size (within a reasonable limit) to cut down the wobliness and lag.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-15T00:47:07Z\u0022 title=\u002202/15/2015 12:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by panzer1b\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
