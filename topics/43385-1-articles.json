I love many things in this game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd especially the fact that it is not based on scripting but on real (or simulated as real) physics, which allow players to innovate and even create things beyond expectation of everyone. So , congratulations to developers and thank you for this awesome work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis being said, i am not a big fan of Mods... I , as many people, think that playing stock gives the most satisfaction and fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut i would like to discuss about what you all think is the really most \u0022reasonable\u0022 and important things to add next in the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIMHO two biggest three biggest things yet missing in the game are :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Pumps (hydrolic or electric) allowing to move things with a slow pressure (like doors, pushing something slowly with a rover to tighten space bases? creating lifting machines (escalators ?) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand of course a piece that attach two parts and allow them to rotate on its axis. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust those two litte new things would allow so many more deep gameplay and possibilities. (cargo, big hangars, mechanical work machines etc)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethen immaginatio and investigation of the community will do the rest to so many awesome and usefull new crafts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- More diverse and interactive interriors (like HSC container ! but allowing to move and even pass throught doors inside a big station or spacecraft.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVery useful for complex bases on other planets surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Allowing kerbals to attach some parts in space (other than docking ports wich are quite limited in crafting bigger and thickier things)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ejust allowing them to attach some parts only like structural pannels and linear struts would be enought .\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd maybe further, making planets and surfaces a bit more complex/ textured with more things to see discover (like ruins, artifacts etc.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust my 2 cents. But i feel like those things, wouldn\u0027t be sooo hard to implement \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(some mods already did) and would add so much. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you think everybody ?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EiEiO","CreatedById":79607,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-21T18:58:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI really want Kerbals to be able to construct ships in space or on the ground...
