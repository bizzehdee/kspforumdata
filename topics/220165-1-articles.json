It doesn\u0027t have to be many but I think, especially for more serious things, liking it feels awkward, if we try to show support for something. For example if an update is delayed when you like the post are you liking that the update is delayed or supporting the devs?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-10-23T11:47:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoved to the network\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Royalswissarmyknife","CreatedById":216092,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-10-23T16:03:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI thought he meant emoji\u0027s\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:blush:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:blush:\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-10-23T20:34:52Z\u0022 title=\u002210/23/2023 08:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Oct 23\u0022\u003EOctober 23, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Royalswissarmyknife\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlamoVampire","CreatedById":78020,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-10-23T19:21:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnpopular opinion?
