They wont look as nice as Kosmos pack stations but they get the job done...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the station body and structure use the structural fuselage as it is much lighter than the fuel tanks. Once you are in orbit you wont need much fuel so design your launch vehicle to take you almost there This way you can get away with just having a small engine and a single fuel tank for circularization and orbit operations. Alternatively you can use a stack of RCS tanks and linear RCS for station propulsion. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe extendable ladders can be used as decorative antennas or solar panels, inverted landing legs for satellite dishes, stacks of big radial decouples for experiment racks. To get perpendicular modules just place a radial decoupler on the main body then put a 90degree turned fuselage onto it so it is half inside the body. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will post some pics of a few of my stock stations/satellites later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Actually I already have a few!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry for the lack of spoiler...
