You will be building very small, simple rockets. You already have knowledge of the basics from the training missions. You just need to get a feel for actually building your own rockets. I think fewer parts is actually beneficial for a newer player, so that you\u0027re not overwhelmed by the sheer number of parts available and the complexity of more advanced rockets.
