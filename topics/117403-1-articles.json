That and i edited the probe core on teh vessel to have like 5 million electric charge so i didnt need to drag 5t of batteries or massive solar panels up there, again, i cant consider this to be a legit attempt as its pretty much cheating. Still trying to mess with a single nuke single rapier combo, but i cant seem to get it high enough fast enough on that single puny rapier pushing 15t so that the nuke doesnt eat a boatload of fuel when its circularizing a suboptimal trajectory left behind by the rapier.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dispatcher","CreatedById":78707,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-02T04:25:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI hear you.

That would at a minimum make landing especially if its not laythe (say i choose to go elsewhere) much easier as landing with wheels is hard unless you plan well ahead and take advantage or some flat areas that are hard to find (and ofc that might be able to land on water if done right).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, i dont have anything against clipping if its within reason, for example clipping a FLT-200 inside a MK1-MK2 adapter is ok as both have same fuel capacity and the adapter has roughly 2 times the volume of the flt with equal fuel inside, so based on sound logic, you could actually fit that much volume inside it, as for 2 FLTs, i stay away from any more then say 20-30% clipping unless im designing a purely for looks vessel in which case i usually dont care about fuel at all since pure for looks = Hedit or inf fuel to orbit anyways.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for ion clipping batteries/fuiel tanks, ive already done a fully working laythe roundtrip SSTO that way, i basically shoved ~12 ions, all the batteries i need, ~30 of the .625m xenon tanks, and some RTGs inside a MK1 service bay. Im quite aware that abusing teh game makes laythe roundtrips doable (i managed a 13t laythe roundtrip in a super small fighter like craft before in 1.03), but the idea behind this thread is well, being able to pull this off with what id consider a rather non cheaty craft. Clipping i have nothing against fundamanetally, especially since alot (err 99% of) my designs are designed to some degree based on appearance, but the things i avoid are clipping engines, fuel tanks, wings, ect. Only exceptions to that general rule are: i need to get a particlar lok and need to clip a small control surface in nose or tail without it visible, or nukes as i hate how ugly they look fully exposed, usually clip them so only the rear shows and the rest is inside a fuselage or fuel tank or whatever. Aside from that, i stay away from anything id consider cheaty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, do you know what the optimal wing area per ton is in 1.04, i know its far less then older versions of the game like 0.90 where wing spam was not a bad thing, but here it seems that i can get away with as little as a 2 delta deluxes and 2 small control surfaces for ~10t, which is imo rather low. Im no expert, but is it true that the less wings you use the better off you are in general?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOhh, and apparently placing a circular intake behind a rapier and clipping it inside the rapier essentially disabled drag on teh rapier and gives you both intake air AND lowers drag. Ofc i do not consider this legit, but i also dont get why having exposed engines in the rear gives such a harsh drag penalty vs placing a nose cone or intake behind said engine makes you have LESS drag and free intake air (shock cones or circulars in front and behind every stack gives the least drag possible.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-02T14:18:33Z\u0022 title=\u002208/02/2015 02:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by panzer1b\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-02T14:18:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI must say I\u0027m a but surprised that you\u0027re asking this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would have thought the SSTO to Laythe and Beyond challenge would have answered the question one way or the other by now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy spaceplane that could do Laythe and return in 0.90 massed something like 25 tonnes on the runway, so doing it in under 15 under the current system seems very unlikely to me.

I think a single-stage flight to Eeloo landing and back to Kerbin is clearly possible using some of the ships from the SST-Laythe challenge. It is possible to go from LKO to Eeloo\u0027s surface and back to Kerbin for 3050m/s. I did it \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/85936-SST-Eeloo-and-back-challenge?p=1351441\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1351441\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E using the old aerodynamics for 2897m/s, modern aerodynamics would prevent that 142m/s braking pass through Jool\u0027s atmosphere but doing it just outside the atmosphere would work for 150m/s. This uses the K-Mu-E-K-K-J path to get to Jool, if you wanted to use a simpler K-E-K-J path you could do it for only 300m/s more, so 3350m/s. Or you could go straight to Jool and fly on to Eeloo with the greatly reduced arrival speed that Jool allows for 4000m/ round trip total. (And as always using a Jool flyby on the return to Kerbin.) With no flybys at all it takes about 2100 (LKO to Eeloo)\u002B1400(brake into orbit)\u002B620(land)\u002B620(takeoff)\u002B1100(LEO to Kerbin)=5840m/s, which I agree would be roughly impossible for an SSTO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Regarding the SS-to Laythe and return, with no flybys I think it\u0027s flatly impossible for anything under 15 tons with more than 1 LV-N and 1 Rapier (\u00221L/1R\u0022), and barely impossible for even that. With flybys it should be possible for the 1L/1R design. I\u0027m not counting ion ships, the ultra-low TWR for a Rapier-ion only ship would be too brutal to contemplate.

The Rapier not so much, but it doesn\u0027t matter since it\u0027s only used where control surfaces can compensate. The reaction wheel combined with moving fuel around is enough to keep it stable in vacuum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the reason you get less dV is because you have more drag, so you use more fuel getting to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike in real life, KSP wings only produce lift when they\u0027re at an angle to the Airflow. If you mount your wings parallel to the rest of the craft, then the whole craft has to be angled for the wings for lift. This is bad for drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo get around that, your wings need to be angled, in relation to the fuselage, so the leading edge is higher than the trailing edge (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle_of_incidence#Angle_of_incidence_of_fixed-wing_aircraft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAngle of Incidence\u003C/a\u003E). Because it\u0027s better to have only the wings, at an angle to the air flow, than the whole craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI angle wings 5 degrees on my designs. USE Shift \u002B W, A, S, D, Q, or E, as appropriate before mounting, or one tick with the Rotation Gizmo, while holding Shift in angle snap mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen that is done, you can probably reduce the wing size, too. You only need about 1 lift rating per 10 ton (not counting Control surfaces).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMine has 2 Small Deltas (2x 0.5), 2 Structural Wing Type D (2x 0.25) = 1.5 Lift rating for 15 tons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EControl surfaces are also twice as heavy compared to the Lift rating they provide. With a few exceptions*, wings weigh 100 kg per Lift rating and control Surfaces ~200 kg per Lift rating. So try if you can do with less.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*) Swept Wings are too heavy at 257 kg for 1.37 Lift. FAT-455 Aeroplane Tail Fin, Big-S Spaceplane Tail Fin and Deluxe Winglet are lighter than other control surfaces, maybe because they are considered wing and control surface combined.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
