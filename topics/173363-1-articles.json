The work involves developing advanced flight sims for manned and unmanned aircraft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou have to have an engineering degree, a masters degree is best. If you\u0027re really good it might be possible to overlook the degree requirement, but you\u0027d need a lot of software development experience. Skill requirements: 3D graphic programming, C/C\u002B\u002B (w/shell scripting, like bash or powershell), good network skills (UDP), OpenGL, Python, Git. Some knowledge of Qt is a big plus. Having game experience (like Unity or Unreal) would be important here too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese are full-time jobs with top benefits in an amazing work environment. Shout out if you\u0027re interested. Feel free to spread the word.
