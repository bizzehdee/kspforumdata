I need to improve on the ignition system, nozzles (most likely built into the fuel itself), and making it a bit more potent for thrust. A primary goal at the moment is to make an engine I can mount in an estes rocket. So overall I think I\u0027ve found a good start point for a long term project~\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust thought I\u0027d share, any comments or suggestions (and subscriptions to my youtube channel!) are welcome!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"drakesdoom","CreatedById":57297,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-14T03:24:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy remake the wheel on the nozzle?

Do I need to keep a hole drilled all the way through the fuel? I\u0027ve looked at other designs and it seems helpful in concentrating the escape of the gases in one direction... might be wrong though. The metal tubing I realize can be dangerous, I think I am going to try for some sort of reinforced cardboard or something but I\u0027m not sure. Also I have a large source of it but what does ruse powder do?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tangent","CreatedById":59076,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-17T18:50:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe rust will cause your solid propellant to burn hotter and faster because its an oxidizer (Iron OXIDE) i dont have any numbers or anything because i don\u0027t really measure much while making them but i have gotten great results. Drilling a hole down the center will cause more fuel to be burning at any given time but it can also cause an explosion, or at least a fireball. I just experiment with different materials until i find something i like. Adding a small amount of baking soda will cause the fuel to burn a bit slower, but the key is that pretty much anything organic or reactive can be added to the fuel for different effects. Rocket science isnt so hard once you give up on numbers\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso if your really careful you can use mercury to cause aluminum to rust almost completely and that can be added to the fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo.1 tip NEVER INHALE VAPORS\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-17T18:54:31Z\u0022 title=\u002205/17/2013 06:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 17, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Tangent\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GOOMH","CreatedById":8729,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-17T20:07:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI know you can use Hydrogen Peroxide as a monopropellant, any of guys think it be possible to do on a hobby scale or am I reaching too high again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Just did some research for peroxide to be a propellant it needs to be 90% concentration and apparently H2O2 can be a pain in the backside to concentrate.
