However with the hunt for science from different biomes I have found that it is very hard to see what you have and haven\u0027t collected. I know that there is a list for certain biomes and planets and the kind of encounter in the science archive but it\u0027s not really that helpfull to find locations you haven\u0027t been at yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I\u0027d really like to have is a biome mapping onto the surface of celestial body, be it in map mode or flight mode so I can see where to land. It would be awesome if those biome borders were maybe detectable from space with a camera for science or something like it. And then having a checklist of possible things to do in that biome. It doesn\u0027t have to be automated but some improved tool to keep track of what you\u0027ve done is needed imo. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven though I can do an EVA in orbit to check the biome, then go the science archive and check for the biome and then decelerate very fast to land exactly below where I did the EVA is a functional hack, I\u0027d rather have a map with crosses or something where I\u0027ve been already.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have found the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55832-PLUGIN-PARTS-0-23-SCANsat-terrain-mapping?highlight=biome\u002Bmapping\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Emapping mod\u003C/a\u003E and even though I like the idea very much I don\u0027t think that should be separate (optional) from (for) the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for reading and what do you think?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Daveroski","CreatedById":93896,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-13T13:55:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI want to launch a sat into orbit around a body and instead of getting science from the sat it just enables me to toggle \u0022Biome View\u0022 on the chart screen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I can land.
