Having built and seen so many of them before 1.0, I was surprised to find it so difficult to find any. Granted I was struggling myself, but always within about 150 m/s of reaching orbit and I\u0027m not the most skilled pilot by a long shot. But now that I\u0027ve found success, I figure \u0022If I can do it, then many others could probably do it better (or may already have).\u0022\n\nSo, the challenge here will be to, as you may have guessed, build an SSTO spaceplane which uses only a single Turbojet during the atmospheric portion of the ascent. Only stock parts may be used though mods for information, pilot assistance and/or visual enhancement are perfectly acceptable.As this is less of a performance competition and more of a \u0022Lets see all the crazy stuff we can do here\u0022 type of challenge, there will be no traditional scoring. However, all who complete the challenge will be listed, and \u0022Top Three\u0022 entries could be maintained for various categories (largest, smallest, most delta-v, FAR, etc). Added as necessary, I suppose. The true goal here is to see the range of designs possible while using just one Turbojet.

View full album](//imgur.com/a/dzNV4)\n\nWARNING! - This plane is a poor high altitude flier! It satisfies only the following criteria:\n\n - reach low orbit (75km) with as little fuel left as possible (but enough to deorbit)\n\n - land safely\\*\n\n - takeoff without being too much of an ass\n\n - re-enter without tumbleing into a tailspin\n\nIt does fly nicely at low speed in low athmosphere, due to safe landing requirement but high altitude direction change is poor. Other difficulties/disadvantages include a dangerous takeoff. High speed is required and the placement of the gear can cause loss of control. But the advantage is that it\u0027s very easy to ascend into orbit.\n\n**Link:** [TurboJet Orbiter](http://www.filedropper.com/sp-43turbojetorbiteriib)\n\n**Flight**: (The rocket engines are assigned to the RCS group. There\u0027s no RCS fuel or thrusters otherwise)\n\n1. On the runway: throttle down, engage RCS to activate rocket engines, stage to activate turbojet, disengage RCS, engage SAS.\n\n2. Full throttle, wait until \u003E70-90 m/s, pull up to take off. (The plane is lazy on takeoff and needs a lot of speed)\n\n3. Pitch up to 60 degrees and climb until 4-5km up. Aim to level off at 6km.\n\n4. At 6-7km level the craft as best as you can and set the angle of attack to 10 degrees. Then leave it alone.\n\n*5. Right click on the turbojet to observe thrust. It will rise to about 520.*\n\n*6. The moment thrust begins to decline, engage RCS to activate rocket engines.*\n\n**The above was a mistake.** Instead:\n\n- Wait until airspeed peaks. When you notice it\u0027s started to decline, engage rocket engines.\n\n7. At some point the angle of attack will rise too much. You will have to adjust it back to about 10-15 degrees. Check once at around 40km.\n\n8. Now that the plane is orbit bound, raise Ap to 72km. Cut the throttle and coast up.\n\n9. Circularise orbit at Ap. A few drops of fuel should remain.\n\nIf the plane fails to reach orbit try a different ascent profile. The most extreme should be 5 degrees AoA at 5km. This will yield most thrust out of the tubojet at the expense of highest temperatures and loss to drag. AoA higher than 15 degrees will not gain enough velocity leaving the rocket engines with too much work to do (and not enough fuel). Starting the push to space at 10km or higher is likely to waste liquid fuel and will only serve to spare the plane from overheating. The ideal profile should be the one where the plane reaches highest velocity on turbojet power while barely escaping melting due to heat. It can handle 10 degrees AoA at ~6-7km assuming an airspeed of ~300 m/s so try that profile first unless you have a better idea. Winglets will receive most heat but will quickly dissipate it.\n\n**Re-entry**:\n\n1. At Pe: Perform a retro burn to lower Pe to 35km. This will give a shallow descent with plenty of time to bleed of excess speed.\n\n1a. Aim for a continent. The goal is an unpowered glide with only a tiny bit of low altitude flying possible.\n\n2. Once back in the athmopshere, maintain a high angle of attack. 30-50 is fine and will reduce re-entry heating to manageable levels.\n\n3. Assuming the craft is ~10km, ~200-400m/s and mostly stable, dive down. Do not level off untill about 2km.\n\n4. Below 2km the craft is easy to control. Float down to the ground and pick a flat landing spot.\n\n5. Final approach should be \u003C90 m/s. \u0022Flare\u0022 up a few times to kill as much airspeed as possible. Aim to touch down at ~45 m/s or less.\n\nWARNING! - The small gear is very evil and narrow. Make the landing as level as humanly possible. The slower the better.\n\n**Other:**\n\n - Do not be affraid of low altitude as that is where the plane is at it\u0027s best behavior (assuming all fuel has been burned and engines are off).\n\n - Batteries can store a total of 260 power units. Most of this is needed to control the craft during and following re-entry.\n\n - Fuel is a nuisance once the de-orbit burn has been performed. Burn everything.\n\n - Service bay contains: OKTO probe core, small torque wheel, 2 small batteries.\n\nThis has been an interesting challenge. Thanks. One more plane that actually works. Now i have 4!\n\n\\*\u0022Land safely\u0022 and \u0022narrow wheelbase\u0022 do not go well together.

Also, in the Thud vs Terrier test, I wonder what would happen if a tail connector was used above the Thud in the same manner as for the Terrier.
