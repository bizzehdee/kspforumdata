Not really universal, but not bad. You might make it on Laythe but only because you have so much dV (4900m/s) you can afford to cruise slowly to orbit. Not enough TWR for Eve obviously. It\u0027s not really aerodynamic enough for going fast in atmosphere so Kerbin is out and maybe Laythe as well. On paper it will do Tylo, in real life probably not, the craft below, much simpler with 5300m/s dV will just about make it from 80km and back to 80km on Tylo, I would top it off with another 100 tank just to get it above 5400m/s dV.
