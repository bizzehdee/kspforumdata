Note that I am new to this; however, I think I\u0027ve got this right in my own network.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am assuming a few things here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. You are not using the Root range model (although you may want to)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. You have unlocked at least the Communotron 32 Omni antenna. If you haven\u0027t, then you will need to dedicate one dish on each satellite to the network.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Each of the satellites has at least two, and preferably three dish antennas appropriate for whatever range you are working at.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour satellites should each have one Communtron 32 Omni antenna. This is how the satellites communicate with each other. If you don\u0027t have this, then one of the dishes on your satellite has just become your dedicated link to the other sats and you must target the satellite itself. Ideally, you should set your comms up this way:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECommunotron 32 for comms with other sats, KSC, and craft orbiting Kerbin. One dish pointing at Mun. One dish pointing at Minimus. One dish set to Active vessel, in case something goes awry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you *don\u0027t* have access to the Communtron 32, then point one dish from each Sat towards Kerbin, one dish towards the next sat in the chain (i.e. Sat 1 targets Sat 2, Sat 2 targets Sat 3, Sat 3 targets Sat 1. Your polar Sat isn\u0027t very helpful in this scenario.) Dish three points to Mun, Dish four to Minimus. Active vessel is a loss unless you add a fifth dish.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat you\u0027ve done wrong, as far as I can see, is your satellites have dishes that target Kerbin, but the sats themselves are outside their cones. Look at the pictures. Assuming you don\u0027t have an Omni onboard that can reach the other sats (and I know you don\u0027t because if you did, you\u0027d have a connection), your cones cover the planet perfectly, but anything outside the cone receives no coverage, and each sat\u0027s neighbors are outside the cones. Picture the satellites as three people standing in front of a sphere, all equidistant from the sphere and from each other. Each person, Adam, Bob, and Charlie, have LED flashlights. If I turn out the lights, and Adam, Bob, and Charlie all turn on their flashlights and point them directly towards the sphere, the cone of light from the flashlights will illuminate nearly the entire sphere, but Adam\u0027s light won\u0027t light up Bob or Charlie, and Bob\u0027s won\u0027t illuminate Adam or Charlie, etc. This is the scenario you\u0027ve created.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope this helps.
