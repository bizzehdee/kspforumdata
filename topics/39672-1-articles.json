So basically, no.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, segregating binaries and data is absolutely best practice, even more so on *nix than Windows, and often the very reason these extra partitions exist (that way user data can\u0027t fill up a system volume). Granted this game isn\u0027t intended a system-wide installation on a multi-user platform, but it\u0027s little headache to make it so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the very least, I\u0027d like the option to point the saves and therefore screenshots (or possibly only screenshots) to another folder while the default is as now, perhaps my Google Drive/other? Since it\u0027s a more advanced requirement I don\u0027t expect directory navigation GUI to accompany it, but a config file or text entry field in the configuration screen would be nice. Simple sanity checking for the location (can it be written to) will be enough to confirm the path is valid.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
