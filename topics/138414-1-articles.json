I see that the stock parts all point to .mu files in the FX directory, but I have no idea how to make them. I tried messing around with the particle emitter in Unity, but to no avail. Part tools didn\u0027t recognize the emitter and thus didn\u0027t make an .mu for it. I have also looked on google, but usually, the only thing that comes up is the Hot Rockets mod. Can anyone tell me how to make custom engine effects, or point me to a forum post that can show me how? \u00A0I have no clue. I was thinking it might have to do with using legacy particle effects, given that KSP used legacy animations (at one point?)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(EDIT)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI believe i found it. KSP has a KSP Particle Emitter in the Parttools\u00A0package.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWow I look for hours then find the answer minutes after asking the question...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-29T01:35:53Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2016 01:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by robot_rover\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
