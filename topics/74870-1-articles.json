If you already are in a circular low orbit around Kerbin (LKO), the next step would be to make the inclination match with Minmus: set Minmus as target, so the line of nodes appear; then open a maneuver node on either the Ascending or Descending node and add some Delta-V to the normal component: when doing right, the inclination shown for the orbit after the burn will get down, you should aim to make it close to 0.0. Form the orbit already on the same orbital plane of Minmus, the next step would then be to plan the Hohmann transfer (that I bet you know about).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is not mandatory to make separate steps, and some steps may not be needed at all: you will make an encounter with Minmus also with an inclined orbit, if the encounter point is with one of the nodes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-12T20:38:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor Minmus, I would recommend sticking your apoapsis out near Minmus\u0027s orbit to get a close intersect, then making a mid-course correction for the inclination to hit its SOI.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"asb3pe","CreatedById":112330,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-12T21:06:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI got Jebediah stuck too while following along with Scotts videos. hehe But I actually did what Scott suggested, and I used the little thrusters to get myself off Minimus and back into a Kerbin orbit... and then when I had used up all my thruster fuel and was REALLY \u0022dead in the water\u0022, I did about 20 EVA\u0027s with good guy Jeb pushing on the back of the capsule to slow down my orbit until it fell onto Kerbin... and somehow Jebediah returned home safe and sound! \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/82276-I-ve-stranded-Jebediah-Kerman-around-Minimus-help!\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHere\u0027s the thread\u003C/a\u003E I made last week about it - I guess it\u0027s a common problem?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyhoo... yeah, getting an encounter is hit or miss with me too, I struggle with doing the orbits but it\u0027s almost more a function of the oftentimes problematic adjustment sliders.

Basically set up a direct prograde burn (yellow circle only) that has your orbit intersect Minmus. Once you set that maneuver up you add orbits (or just wait) until you get small closest approach or encounter with minmus. Once you see the timing will get you close you can fine tune the maneuver with the blue/pink/yellow to lower your Minmus periapsis to 13km. Then just execut the maneuver and you should be on your way. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProtip; for large/long burns don\u0027t bother with the last 10-20 dV of the maneuver. Just save your fuel for a small correction burn at another maneuver node you set up in a minute or two.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could try to match inclination and match orbit, but it feels so much simpler to just get a simple maneuver that puts in onto it\u0027s orbit and just wait for the timing to match so that it is present when you get there.
