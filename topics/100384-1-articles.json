Ultimately, I want an easier way to see the contracts I care about during flight. Even if the contract window remembers which contracts are collapsed and which are expanded on a per-ship basis, this would help a lot. Since the contract window is so small in-flight, a more extreme solution would be to only carry certain contracts on a certain flight, but you\u0027d probably want the ability to change your mind - view any other contract - in flight, so it wouldn\u0027t have to be that permanent.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-12T19:50:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#008000;\u0022\u003E[MOD - Changed thread title for clarity.]\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Slam_Jones","CreatedById":125101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-12T21:31:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI wouldn\u0027t be opposed.
