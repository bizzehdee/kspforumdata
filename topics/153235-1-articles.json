Structural sturdiness. Early versions of this had wing-mounted engine pylons ahead of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E to help balance out the rear-ward engines. However, the combination of the RAPIERs working their way up to 360kN apiece and aerodynamic load stresses gave me a long and frustrating series of structural failures and/or wing torqing, with struts only sometimes helping (and often making things worse) and being required in very significant amounts, wrecking the aerodynamics, and therefore needing more engines, which needed more reinforcing, etc. Death-spiralled pretty bad. Changing things so that they are in line with the load helped enormously, though the rear pods are still strutted to keep them from rotating as the thrust dials up. Haven\u0027t found a good solution to that yet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. It provides superior gimbal coverage. This is needed because, due to the piggyback layout, I have a significant vertical \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E shift as the fuel in the carry vehicle burns off. In atmospheric flight this tendency is controllable through the aerodynamic forces, but once the rockets are engaged a. the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E shift accelerates dramatically as the oxidizer burns and b. the dynamic pressure drops like a rock as the ship climbs. This is also the reason for the lone Thud at the back; it acts as an orbital manouvering thruster and the high gimbal range allows it to do so regardless of the presence or absence of the payload.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf there was a aerodynamically clean, structurally sound way to get those engines further forward I\u0027d be real interested in seeing it, but I haven\u0027t found one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-10T02:15:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222881523\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022153235\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221481318132\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u00222982\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022foamyesque\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 hours ago, foamyesque said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nit acts as an orbital manouvering thruster and the high gimbal range allows it to do so regardless of the presence or absence of the payload.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow about one Rapier where you adjust its thrust limiter in flight to shift \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Thrust\u0022\u003ECoT\u003C/abbr\u003E?

I\u0027ve been messing with your plane for hours -- my designs mostly work, but have pitch control issues as I\u0027m sure you well know, and I\u0027m tired of dealing with it now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst off, you are a total nutcake for trying to launch this lander thing full of fuel. Any rational person would launch it with just enough to land on Minmus, and the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E savings from the fuel weight would easily get you to Minmus. And it would fix most of your vertical \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E shifting issues.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome things I found that you may try on your new plane:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn your nacelles, at the back, you have 4 rapiers. 3 are attached to NCS adapters, with one NCS adapter having an unattached node. *AND* you have a 4 way coupler with only one node used, and 3 nodes open. So you need to reattach those properly. You only need one or the other -- the NCS or the 4 way -- not both.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe 2.5m nosecones can be replaced\u00A0with a Rockomax Adapter \u002B a 1.25m nosecone -- they weigh less and are somewhat less draggy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI took the 3 batteries out of your MK2 cargo bay and replaced them with a 4k battery in your main fuselage. And then I took the 2 advanced reaction wheels out and replaced them with another large reaction wheel next to the new big battery. Then I took the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Radio-isotope Thermo-electric Generator (a.k.a. Mars rover heating device)\u0022\u003Ertg\u003C/abbr\u003E and fuel cell out and put them in a 1.25 service bay, and the antenna I put on the outside and then deleted the cargo bay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"foamyesque","CreatedById":2982,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-10T08:13:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222882019\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022153235\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221481353231\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022154251\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022bewing\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, bewing said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn your nacelles, at the back, you have 4 rapiers. 3 are attached to NCS adapters, with one NCS adapter having an unattached node. *AND* you have a 4 way coupler with only one node used, and 3 nodes open.
