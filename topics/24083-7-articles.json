Well, they can tailstrike if you are careless, but around 60-70m/s, if you pull up 5-10\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA, they will lift off without problems and with some margin. Right after that you can do the sharp pull to 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA, and having the camera looking form an angle and not directly behind helps. Note you turn on and off the engines with action groups (1 main engine, 2 switch RAPIER mode, 3 VTOL system), otherwise the VTOL system is in the same stage as the main engine. I\u0027m actually not sure what is your problem... ^^\u0027\u003Cp\u003EEdit: it seems the problem was more of a \u0022first time SSTOer\u0022 than anything else, and since that is something I get asked a lot, I will leave this copy-paste of myself here in case anybody needs it or wants to refresh on the basics:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Rune\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Rune\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOh, you mean a SSTO guide! I get asked that so much I should write one:\u003Cp\u003ELets see, up to about 20 kms it is really easy, leave it in a 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA climb with ASAS on and don\u0027t touch a thing. But form there to around 30 kms is where you pick up speed, so you have to pitch down when you get to this point, in order to lower vertical speed to give time for the plane to accelerate. You should get to at least 1,500m/s on jets alone before you think of using rocket power, and there is a handy indicator for vertical speed a lot of people miss to the right of the altimeter, keep an eye on that and consider its scale is logarithmic! Settle for something like 50m/s vertical speed and go for a speed run on those ten kms. By the time you get to 30,000m, though, a couple things have happened:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-You are going so fast you have to pitch down all the time to keep a stable heading, because the planet curves below you so fast (\u0026gt;1,500m/s surface speed).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Air is getting thin, the intake indicator reads 0.01 or less but it is sort of stuck on that number. This is the reason you can go so fast, the thin air, but you will flame out soon since the only thing keeping air on your engines is the fact that you are going so fast, and soon not even that will work, because your drag/thrust ratio keeps getting worse for sciency reasons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt that point, you reach serious diminishing returns by staying longer in the atmosphere, so let the plane pitch up by itself until you get the RAPIERs automatic switching to rocket power (No flameout on that puppy unless you set it to manual!), at which point you can close the intakes to cut drag, though that\u0027s not necessary. Pitch a bit down to prograde once your vertical speed is above 100m/s to be very efficient, and go to map view to take a look at your apoapsis and time to it, because from then on you are flying like a rocket. Once apoapsis is outside the atmosphere, coast to it adjusting for drag as necessary, and circularize afterwards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune.
