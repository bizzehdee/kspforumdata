Has anyone noticed a change in music with the latest update? Could be with 1.0 also, I haven\u0027t tried it. What I mean is that the transition to music feels different. When I got into space at the 70km mark, it used to start this classical \u0022into space\u0022 kerbal theme. However now, it is kind of the same but starts mid track and feels awkward. Could it be a bug or an intentional change or? I have to admit it annoys me a lot more than it should, it is just that the transition it had before of going into space felt kind of magical and now just weird. Has anyone noticed any difference in the music in any case?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T10:08:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a bug that\u0027s been around for a while.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Olack","CreatedById":113490,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T11:58:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh really?
