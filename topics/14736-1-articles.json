I got the new payload to the Mun and landed down the first time about 1 km away, but I brought enough fuel to do a second takeoff and maneuver myself closer - it\\\u0027s right on the ridge of the large crater on the Mun\\\u0027s equator to give you a rough idea, but the second vehicle landed on the inside of the ridge so I couldn\\\u0027t see the other base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I\\\u0027m kind of hovering the thing over towards it, and I end up over-estimating how much thrust I needed to get there, so I miss it the second time. I land and come back for my last try as I\\\u0027m low on fuel and I keep getting slightly closer, but not as close as I wanted - the second time I was about 600m away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I come back in for the final try and everything is looking pretty solid. I get to about 600m away (coming in mostly vertical), at about 20 m/s, and the game locks up. I figure the landing craft is going to end up hitting the surface and explode on me - no biggie, I wanted to try again and get it right the first time, anyway. When the game stops lagging, there is an explosion, but it\\\u0027s from the base already landed/established, and then the second craft comes in explodes since I didn\\\u0027t have time to slow down. I was probably about 150m away on the horizontal when the explosion occurred.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone know what gives? When the base exploded the first time, I figured it was because I switched from an accelerating craft (or one in orbit at a constant velocity) to that one, and the physics engine was carrying over some of the momentum or something. No biggie, I got the 10 tons of dead weight back up there and landed in roughly the same spot. I don\\\u0027t get what happened this time though, does the engine get wonky when vehicles get too close to each other on non-Kerbin surfaces? How close is too close? If this is the case, how does that \u0027Community Game\u0027 work where there\\\u0027s upwards of 5 craft in a small area?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help is much appreciated.

When I make a quick save does it make a copy of the persistence in the same folder with some sort of time stamp? Can I access this save at any time, or does the load feature only access the last save made, whether that save was made manually or automatically? I doubt I have a save of that time to access, but it\\\u0027s no biggie since landing that hunk o\\\u0027 parts is actually a bit of a challenge, I would just like to avoid this happening in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn regards to prevention, is there a way to \u0027safeguard\u0027 myself in a general way? If I went into the file and edited the heights to be 2 or 3 what the game saves them as, would they \u0027respawn\u0027 each time at that 2 or 3 above height (assuming its measured in meters and not by a coordinate measured differently) each time I got close enough to have the game load their physics/models? If this worked, would the game overwrite the edited height each time and, thus, risk this happening whenever I try to land something else nearby? I assume craft with proper legs would be able to survive a 3 meter drop from a standstill on the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the suggestions, I\\\u0027ll look into what I can do. It\\\u0027s just a bit bothersome because I was really happy that I managed to get that close during a pinpoint landing on my first shot, and then it destroyed my most difficult payload to deliver. I don\\\u0027t mind bringing it up there once more, but I don\\\u0027t want to have to redo it too much since the decent from 50km takes me about a half hour because of its size and having to babysit it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maltesh","CreatedById":17144,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-20T23:09:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EQuicksave only makes one save, which is overwritten every time you quicksave again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really don\\\u0027t know what causes the \u003Cstrong\u003Ehgt =\u003C/strong\u003E attributes to be set to -1, so I can\\\u0027t really give any information on how to prevent it. And, if I recall correctly, if you set it too high, the base will drop from that height when the active scene approaches within 200m, which will result in its own problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIF you want to generally fix it if it\\\u0027s already happened, manually BACK UP the persistence file by copying the file to elswhere on your hard drive., find out what bases are afflicted by attempting to load them from the Flight Tracker screen, then restore from the backup and start tinkering. My general rule of thumb: All the parts that make up the vessel have a \u003Cstrong\u003Eposition =\u003C/strong\u003E attribute with three numbers separated by commas, the second being the y- position. Find the Y-position of the lowest part attatched to the craft, flip the value to positive, and set the \u003Cstrong\u003Ehgt =\u003C/strong\u003E value a bit higher than that. If it explodes, restore from the backup and set it a little higher than that. If you screw it up, restore from the backup.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yeah, if you\\\u0027re going to tinker with the persistence file, back it up somewhere safe first. I know, I mentioned it before, but it bears repeating. I edit it fairly often, and every so often, I still make a make a mistake that wipes the file and requires me to restore from the back up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
