I\u0027ve got a big modpack installed that includes a bunch of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E stuff, specifically the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E Kontainers and the Cryo engines/tanks mods. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E Kontainer includes Fuel switching support for Liquid Hydrogen but not for the newer Liquid Methane. In the Kontainer\u0027s code, switching fuels is handled by FSfuelSwitch and FStextureSwitch2. In the former, fuels are declared with their costs, amounts and weights whereas the latter handles the actual switching. The fuel tank setups are numbered 0 to 9. I have been able to add Liquid Methane in by substituting for an unused resource, but I\u0027d like a separate Liquid Methane \u002B Oxidizer configuration. I can\u0027t however keep number the fuel tanks after 9 by going either to 10 or using the hexadecimal system. Is there any way to add more fuel configurations, or is 10 a maximum?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
