Game should create bond not only between parts attached by nodes/surface attachment, but also, then they touch eachother. It\u0027s a bit unrealistic, that huge ship, that looks like someting, that could withstand few missile shots, is cut in half when one piece joining two parts together is gone.

One of them has a probe core an an engine attached, so that it kinda looks like \u003Cem\u003EThe Enterprise\u003C/em\u003E with only one engine (the square is the saucer).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you fire that engine it pushes the first I-beam, which pushes the one attached at a right angle on its right side, which pushes the beam at the very front of the ship, which pulls on the beam on the left side. In the current system that is all, as the left hand beam is not technically attached to the first one - it only touches it. This causes a bit of a bug though, since heavy acceleration can cause the entire structure to bend, and the ends will move apart and rub around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the proposed system, the left hand beam would now pull on the first one, which would in turn push the right hand beam, etc. This causes an infinite loop of parts mutually pushing and pulling each other. And it gets worse, because when that initial thrust happened, and pushed beam one, it not only would have pushed the right hand beam but the left as well! So now there are two physics loops one running clockwise and the other counter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan this situation be resolved? Yes, but it\u0027s much more costly to calculate and keep track of than the current system. Remember that in a computer, nothing is simultaneous - you have to deal with each part one at a time, so keeping track of which parts a given force has or has not already effected becomes a huge concern. You can\u0027t just run down the tree passing the force along, you also have to keep track of whether or not a force has been applied yet. There are further complexities (which compound as the design become more interesting, and forces come from multiple vectors) that I\u0027m not even going to attempt to describe. This is probably one reason why the Kraken exists - even the current system can cause physics propagation loops, producing phantom forces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only real option is the \u0022welding\u0022 method. Here collections of parts that are connected permanently are predetermined, and become single logical parts. Thus my square of beams is treated like a single object, and forces no longer propagate from one beam to the next at all. This solves the bending problem, as well as the physics loop problem. However now how do you handle breaking one part of the square? The whole thing would be destroyed! And what about a very large ring, that would (logically) bend and flex to some degree - or break apart under enough stress. Welded, it would be not be affected by realistic forces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere really is not good way to do this that will satisfy everyone, because each system has a critical problem. So what do the devs do? Nothing! There isn\u0027t a solution that is actually \u003Cem\u003Ebetter for everyone\u003C/em\u003E than what they have now, so it\u0027s better to leave it as is than waste time on something that won\u0027t actually be an improvement across the board.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tuareg","CreatedById":84241,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-06T02:57:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ekhmmm... I would just add that creating multiparent connections doesnt create physical loop just connection loop, actually doesnt have any kind of connection to calculating physical forces and with ships built on the go you can already create connection loops. we just can\u0027t design it in the VAB.

Giant fuel tanks, heat shields, and massive drydocks with greatly reduced lag. Although the better option would be to make it optional to use like most parts of KSP rather than not implementing it as there are probably still some people against the direction lock automations.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-06T16:52:06Z\u0022 title=\u002202/06/2015 04:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Spartwo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
