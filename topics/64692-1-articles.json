That is not long at all. I would have put the time limit at something like 6 in-game hours. The thing is, It takes what, 6 minutes or so to get to orbit, another 15 to complete an orbit... The minimum time before any docking can happen is 20 minutes or so. That assumes you can manage to basically hit the other ship from below perfectly as you burn to orbit, which doesn\u0027t often happen. After that, you would typically need to wait ANOTHER orbit, thus, 35 minutes total. 5 minutes for two Ion-powered docking actions is not an easy task.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RickRastardly","CreatedById":78405,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-02T10:46:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think the challenge here is the docking side of things with ion engines, so I\u0027m assuming the items you want to dock are already in orbit before the timer starts?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso the OP should be posting his or hers best result.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pds314","CreatedById":70014,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-02T10:55:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Why haven\u0027t the leaderboards been updated?
