I could sent a manned mission to pick up the science to return to kerbin, but I\u0027d prefer to send a probe if possible. If I land a probe nearby, can one of my guys EVA over and store the science in it like they would a capsule? If not, would it work if I put something like a MK1 lander with probe controls? Whatever is lightest I guess.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELikewise, would a probe be suitable for minmus hopping and science collecting? I realise I couldn\u0027t reset equipment but I\u0027d take eg 4 science JRs and then fly back to the science lab for resetting. Thinking that would be lighter than a manned capsule.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"klesh","CreatedById":110814,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T11:21:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would suggest trying with the lightest 1-man command pod, the Lander Can (with a probe on top).

Find a part that has the ability you seek and copy and paste the desired code that describes it into a part that does not. Might take some trial and error or lots of code reading to make sure you have all the relevant lines of code - but I think this one is pretty easy. Thus your engineers will have thrown out some less useful probe parts (why where those in there?) and replaced them with a glove box for storing science or snacks (depending on the code you use).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-05-04T14:23:17Z\u0022 title=\u002205/04/2021 02:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EMay 4, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Snark\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ELink to defunct website removed by moderator\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T17:53:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESpecifically, this is what you\u0027re after: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E}\tMODULE\u003Cbr\u003E\t{\u003Cbr\u003E\t\tname = ModuleScienceContainer\u003Cbr\u003E\t\treviewActionName = Review Stored Data\u003Cbr\u003E\t\tstoreActionName = Store Experiments\u003Cbr\u003E\t\tevaOnlyStorage = True\u003Cbr\u003E\t\tstorageRange = 1.3\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrDude","CreatedById":134194,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T18:17:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThats the Stuff...
