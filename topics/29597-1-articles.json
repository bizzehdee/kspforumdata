Fortunately I found a little sneaky way to fix it. It does involve a little cheating in some people\u0027s eyes, because it involves editing your save, but it saves you spending hours and hours trying to line up your docking ports exactly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis video explains it best:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/YsEHIn_ucIA\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://youtu.be/YsEHIn_ucIA\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
