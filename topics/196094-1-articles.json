Is there a version of it that does work with 1.10.1 or an alternative mod that does? (Im on win10 if this helps). When I mean \u0022not loading\u0022 I mean its getting hung up on verifying the breaking ground expansion and not proceeding into the games playable state. Or am I just an idiot who\u0027s installing it wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"goldenpsp","CreatedById":113874,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-04T01:21:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy don\u0027t you ask in the mod\u0027s thread?\u00A0 You will get more views of people who actually know about the mod, including the mod author.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"I troll children online.","CreatedById":203050,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-04T02:23:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
