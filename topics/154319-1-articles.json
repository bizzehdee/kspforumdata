It does not happen when the panels are still retracted, only if I extend them, save the game, load the new save game and go to the station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt does not help to reset the gyro, the cubes that were controlling the solar panel beams when docking are in hibernation, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E is off, there are no reaction wheels attached that could cause the spinning, deactivation \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E does not help, and the rotation is unstoppable if switching to the detached parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf have the following Mods: MechJeb, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E, Kopernicus Planetary System Modifier, ModularFlightIntegrator, Planet Shine and it\u0027s default configuration, Scatterer, Stock Visual Enhancements: Scatterer Configs and SVE High-Res, Stock Visual Terrain High-Res, TextureReplacer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you got any questions or ideas, I would be very thankful for any input on how to solve this.
