I tend to keep things to myself, but my partner isn\u0027t impressed with my KSPy things. Sooooo...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the Seed Pod. It uses parts from bazillions of mods, notable: Near Future Tech (all), Infernal Robotics, KW rocketry, realchutes, deadly reentry, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo save $ in my career mode and take advantage of a Jool window (and make up for a failed Laythe lander/orbiter Cassini type probe) I decided to build a massive nuclear/hydrogen orbiter with four small probes nestled inside and attached with robotic hinges. Two landers and two orbital probes. The two landers are for Laythe, and the orbital probes for any Joolian moons I happen upon. Massive delta-v after launch (still 3500\u002B) thanks to NFT hydrogen/nuclear thermal engine combos. Transfer burn was already complete and the external hydrogen drop tanks released.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s27.postimg.org/nwy8wq69f/screenshot43.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot43.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd here she is with the hinges open, showing how I can deploy the probes. Each is tied to an action group. Probes have their own engines (albiet small) for minor corrections. So far so good, next posts will see how well I did (got a long flight and with Dang it! loaded, ANYTHING can happen)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s27.postimg.org/dbedkpzxv/screenshot44.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot44.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zylark","CreatedById":101018,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-27T03:37:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELooking good.

The structural parts are addictive I have had to pull my hand away from the mouse, shaking, to keep my part count down because I want to build some crazy, hex-adapted 20\u002B count stack of life support and power systems with nuclear reactors surrounded by those cool cages and service modules.

Because of the higher volume, you need SO much for decent delta-v, and even though the tanks are very light they get extremely bulky on launch and without mad struts you end up with uncle joe\u0027s wobbly-spacecraft ride and splat.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-27T04:09:19Z\u0022 title=\u002208/27/2014 04:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 27, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by autumnalequinox\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Efreaking censors grrr.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"autumnalequinox","CreatedById":114782,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-31T03:56:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFINALLY, after a long journey.
