\u00A0Our interplanetary ship is starting at Kerbin\u0027s orbit and ending at Duna\u0027s orbit, so the transfer orbit\u0027s periapsis and apoapsis will correspond closely to Kerbin\u0027s and Duna\u0027s semi-major axes. \u00A0Again, this is a rough estimate that assumes Kerbin and Duna\u0027s orbits are perfectly circular and perfectly aligned with one another, but they are fairly close to that ideal and so provide a good example.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOur transfer orbit\u0027s periapsis is\u00A0Kerbin\u0027s orbit, i.e.\u00A013.600 Gm. \u00A0Its apoapsis is Duna\u0027s orbit, i.e. 20.726 Gm. \u00A0The total major axis of this orbit is 34.326 Gm, so its semi-major axis is 17.163 Gm.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow we need to know how long it will take to travel this orbit. \u00A0For this, we can use Kepler\u0027s Third Law, which states that the orbital period (time to orbit once) is related to two things: \u00A0the semi-major axis of the orbit and the gravity of the object it\u0027s orbiting (specifically, the equation is T\u003Csub\u003Eorbitalperiod\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0= 2\u03C0 *\u00A0(A\u003Csub\u003Esemi-major\u003C/sub\u003E\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E\u00A0/ MG)\u003Csup\u003E1/2\u003C/sup\u003E. \u00A0The nice thing about Kepler\u0027s third law is that eccentricity doesn\u0027t matter: \u00A0all orbits of a given semi-major axis in a system will have the same period. \u00A0The nice thing about these orbits is that they all orbit the same thing (the sun) so the gravitational parameter (MG) is the same in all three cases, which means that you don\u0027t actually need to figure out the mass and gravity of the sun\u00A0if you know the orbital period and semi-major axis of at least one of those orbits.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbin\u0027s orbital period is 426 6-hour days. \u00A0For Kepler\u0027s laws, we need this in seconds (and Kerbin\u0027s year is not exactly 426 days long; but the remainder can be sucked up into the rounding error), so 426 (days/orbit) * 6 (hours/day) * 60 (minutes/hour) * 60 (seconds/minute) = 9201600 seconds/orbit. \u00A0Plugging in what we know and a bit of algebraic wizardry later (you mentioned wanting to work this stuff out for yourself, so I won\u0027t show the specifics), it works out that for any object orbiting the KSP sun, the orbital period equals the semi-major axis raised to the three-halves power (break out your scientific calculator) times a constant equal to 5.8017 x 10\u003Csup\u003E-9\u003C/sup\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo check the answer, we can use Duna\u0027s semi-major axis: \u00A0again, I\u0027ll leave the details to the student, but all told, it gives an orbital period of roughly 801.5 days, which agrees pretty well with Duna\u0027s actual orbital period of 801.6 days.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, let\u0027s try it on the transfer orbit: \u00A0with a semi-major axis of 17.163 Gm, the orbital period works out to about 13,045,000 seconds, or 603.9 6-hour days. \u00A0Just by looking at it, it makes sense:\u00A0the transfer orbit should be somewhere between the other orbits. \u00A0However, this isn\u0027t the number we want: \u00A0the transfer takes place over half an orbit. \u00A0Therefore, we want half the orbital period, or 302\u00A0days.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow we know how long we\u0027ll be in transit. \u00A0The next job is to find out when to leave so that when we arrive at Duna\u0027s orbit, Duna will be there. \u00A0For that, we need a little creative imagery:\u00A0\u00A0imagine the solar system as a clock face, and\u00A0let\u0027s put Kerbin at the six o\u0027clock position at the time of departure. \u00A0We want to time our departure so that when our vessel arrives at the opposite point of its orbit (at the twelve o\u0027clock position), Duna will be there. \u00A0The clock visual isn\u0027t the best because the orbits in KSP go anticlockwise, but so long as you understand which direction you\u0027re going, you\u0027ll be fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf we want to arrive at Duna when Duna is at the twelve o\u0027clock position, and our trip there takes 302 days, then we want to start when Duna is 302 days away from the twelve o\u0027clock position. \u00A0That should be obvious. \u00A0To get that, we need Duna\u0027s orbital period--but wait! \u00A0We figured that out as a check on our modified Kepler equation! \u00A0302 days out of 801.5 days (I\u0027m using the calculated value; I\u0027m assuming you don\u0027t want to use anything else for this) is .3768 of the orbit. \u00A0We\u0027re assuming Duna\u0027s orbit is circular (if it\u0027s very eccentric, it needs another layer of calculation), so .3768 of a circle is, out of 360 degrees, 135 degrees away from twelve o\u0027clock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s no reference point for the twelve o\u0027clock position on our solar system clock, however, so let\u0027s use what we have. \u00A0Kerbin is at the six o\u0027clock position when we start, which is 180 degrees away from twelve o\u0027clock. \u00A0Subtract off the 135 degrees of Duna\u0027s position with respect to twelve o\u0027clock and we get 45 degrees for Duna\u0027s position with respect to six o\u0027clock, i.e. Kerbin. \u00A0The fact that it is positive 45 degrees means that Duna needs to be 45 degrees ahead of Kerbin in its orbit when you launch--again, this should make sense. \u00A0Duna\u0027s orbit is higher, therefore slower, so for your faster transfer orbit to get to the same place at the same time, you need to give Duna a head start.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSet up a manoeuvre node when Duna is 45 degrees ahead of Kerbin and you should get the encounter. \u00A0It may take a bit of tweaking and will certainly require a mid-course correction, but it should\u00A0work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNeedless to say, this is the quick-and-dirty method of getting encounters. \u00A0It works well for Duna because Duna\u0027s orbit is nearly circular, coplanar, and concentric to Kerbin\u0027s. \u00A0It works less well for other planets with different orbital parameters. \u00A0For example, even with Duna, the slight eccentricity and inclination make it so that some transfer windows are better than others because there are extra dimensions of alignment that you need to consider in order to get the absolute best efficiency. \u00A0For a better example, consider Dres. \u00A0Dres transfer windows recur\u00A0about every 1.25 years;\u00A0a window is available before the end of Year 1, but\u00A0if you wait for the window in Year 3, you can save nearly 500 m/s of delta vee by taking advantage of a more favourable orbital alignment. \u00A0However, these extra-favourable alignments only occur about every decade, so you may want to just pack a little extra fuel instead of a lot of extra snacks. \u00A0Besides, overcoming the limitations of planetary orbital arrangement is part of why you play KSP in the first place--you learn nothing by sitting at home and time warping!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
