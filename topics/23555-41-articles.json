When I got poor bill out to the rover and tried to use it, it didn\u0027t work because its Okto2 probe core (the only battery storage it has, it\u0027s nuclear powered) was...broken somehow. No storage, no control functions, no right-click menu. One of the containers in the cargo bay survived and I was able to get a battery out of it, which got the rover working again. I just took the container out of the bay entirely, and laid it on the ground there.
