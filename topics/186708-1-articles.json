Rendevous is not too hard, but\u00A0docking a craft to a station that can\u0027t rotate is pretty difficult until you practice a lot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor rendevous, If they\u0027re in the same orbit then\u00A0they\u0027ll stay the same distance from each other. How far are the two crafts from one another? If it\u0027s not too far (\u0026lt;\u00A020km), select the other target in the Map, switch the NavBall to Target, and burn toward\u00A0the pink Target Prograde marker. Once you get close, or if the green prograde drifts too far form the target prograde, burn on\u00A0the green velocity retrograde marker to bring yourself to a stop, and repeat. Once you\u0027re better at this, you can push / pull the velocity marker to approach much faster.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the two crafts are\u00A0not currently close to each other, you need to get yourself into a different orbit. Pick a point where the two orbits are the closest/touching, and then burn prograde (if ahead) or retrograde (if behind). It doesn\u0027t have to be too much. Eventually, you or the other craft will catch up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis old guide is pretty good:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u0022104709\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed688295299\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/83437-illustrated-tutorial-for-orbital-rendezvous/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:213px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Siska","CreatedById":195997,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-26T11:45:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nor just burn prograde to accelerate so the orbits are not the same, and make manuever at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E with which you will encounter the other vessel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\non the necounter, just burn retrograde (navbal must be set to \u0022target\u0022) until you get 0 velocity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthan just slowly approach the vessel with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E or wthevr.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chris2004**","CreatedById":199039,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-26T12:33:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you both!!!!
