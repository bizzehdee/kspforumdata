My goal right now is to make an SSTO that can travel to anything within Kerbin\u0027s SOI, and can travel anywhere else after (such as Jol) after refueling.\n\nThe plane below is my best design so far and can make it into orbit around the mun and come back. The only major problem was that the nuclear engines tended to overheat everything around them.\n\nOverheating\n\n[http://imgur.com/yShR5Tw](http://imgur.com/yShR5Tw)\n\nSo, I made a slight modification to fix that problem. All I did was move the engines further apart so they wouldn\u0027t get as much radiated heat.\n\n[http://imgur.com/w3rTEnv](http://imgur.com/w3rTEnv)\n\nWith the new design, I can\u0027t return from the Mun\u0027s orbit. There just isn\u0027t enough dV. Kerbal Engineer claims that the original (top image) had about 2,000 m/s dV after reaching orbit. The new design has only 1000 m/s dV, sometimes less. Even if I remove excess oxidizer and intakes, it doesn\u0027t seem to make any difference.\n\nI\u0027ve tried tweaking the fuel, adding wings, removing wings, but nothing seems to matter.\n\nAnyone have any ideas about why this might be happening or a link to an advanced 1.0 spaceplane tutorial that could help? All I could find were basic tutorials for 1.0 so far. I always run into this problem with spaceplanes. I find a design that seems to almost work great, but anything I change only seems to make it worse.\n\nThis is my first time posting so please go easy if I messed something up.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-01T01:46:14Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2015 01:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by 11matt556**"},{"CreatedByName":"TrevTrevarian","CreatedById":134252,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T21:26:36Z","Content":"The only thing I can think of is that sometimes when I move fuel tanks, the fuel lines that feed them disconnect.

Etc. beyond that I\u0027m stumped.\n\nI did the exact same thing with each plane, and flew them each probably 15 or 20 times now, so I doubt its my ascent. And the fuel line is connected in 4B, but from the angle its covered up.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The grey attachments are decouplers, so 4B is two-stage and 4C is 1-stage. That could easily explain the dV difference if you were dropping the outer stage.\n\nI never dropped the stage though. I only used it as a connection. Kerbal Engineer considered both of them 2 stages anyway since I put the Atomic rockets on the second stage and had the decouplers as the last stage.\n\nI\u0027ll try switching out the connectors though to see if it makes any difference. Maybe the dV is being calculated wrong somehow.\n\nEDIT: So it looks like it was a dV miscalculation. I don\u0027t know how I managed to make it to the Mun and back before, but apparently both designs ACTUALLY have about the same dV. I guess I got lucky that time, or flew it very well, because I can\u0027t seem to make it back again.\n\nThanks for your help with my (very stupid) mistake. Any general suggestions or tips that might help with this or future designs?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-01T01:44:44Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2015 01:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by 11matt556**"},{"CreatedByName":"TrevTrevarian","CreatedById":134252,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T02:54:36Z","Content":"I\u0027m honestly really happy it was human error, I\u0027ve been trying to figure out how that significant of a difference could be made by such a small change all day and it\u0027s been killing me.

There are a ton of posts all around the forum that have some pretty good tips in them, but with 1.0 I\u0027m not sure how much of it still applies."}]}
