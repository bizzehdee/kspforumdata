My goal right now is to make an SSTO that can travel to anything within Kerbin\u0027s SOI, and can travel anywhere else after (such as Jol) after refueling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe plane below is my best design so far and can make it into orbit around the mun and come back. The only major problem was that the nuclear engines tended to overheat everything around them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverheating\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/yShR5Tw\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/yShR5Tw\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I made a slight modification to fix that problem. All I did was move the engines further apart so they wouldn\u0027t get as much radiated heat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/w3rTEnv\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/w3rTEnv\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the new design, I can\u0027t return from the Mun\u0027s orbit. There just isn\u0027t enough dV. Kerbal Engineer claims that the original (top image) had about 2,000 m/s dV after reaching orbit. The new design has only 1000 m/s dV, sometimes less. Even if I remove excess oxidizer and intakes, it doesn\u0027t seem to make any difference.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve tried tweaking the fuel, adding wings, removing wings, but nothing seems to matter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone have any ideas about why this might be happening or a link to an advanced 1.0 spaceplane tutorial that could help? All I could find were basic tutorials for 1.0 so far. I always run into this problem with spaceplanes. I find a design that seems to almost work great, but anything I change only seems to make it worse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is my first time posting so please go easy if I messed something up.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-01T01:46:14Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2015 01:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by 11matt556\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TrevTrevarian","CreatedById":134252,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T21:26:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe only thing I can think of is that sometimes when I move fuel tanks, the fuel lines that feed them disconnect.
