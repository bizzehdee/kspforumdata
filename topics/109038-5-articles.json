The engines were already based on stock engines. So really there isn\u0027t any real changes needed. Actually I\u0027m already happy with Whiplash performance from the Masamune. Kunai needs a little nerfing since it is actually based on real life concepts. I may or may not increase the efficiency of the Masamune. \n\nI was thinking stock behavior as in just using just the non-plugin modules that are used in KSP, but it appears that the consensus is to keep everything as is... ok I\u0027ll just do the textures.
