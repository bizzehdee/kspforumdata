If you are too close, MJ sometimes jumps to the next opportunity, which may be a whole orbit away. Sometimes when this happens I just build the node myself and fly it (or click execute on MJ).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re unfamiliar with building your own rendezvous, I would recommend messing around with it some to get some experience.

If you have the knowledge, you can strongarm MJ into submission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn any case, you can pass the time in two ways. You can forcebly time warp while MJ is flying, then drop out of warp for it to execute (leave some time for it to adjust). Or you can click on MJ\u0027s \u0022auto warp\u0022 radio button. When active, it will manage all warping activities so you don\u0027t have to walk off and do something else.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-09T22:53:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou didn\u0027t say where you\u0027re starting from ... if it\u0027s Kerbin, you might be better off just moving to the Mun before trying to rendezvous with the station.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-09T23:44:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m with Vanamonde and 5th Horseman - make sure you\u0027ve got \u0027autowarp\u0027 activated in MJ and the rest is just how long it takes to get an intercept. If you\u0027re in the same orbit height (or close) but far away MJ should make a \u0027phasing orbit\u0027 to change relative speeds. How far does it go? How quickly the positions in orbit coincide depends on the distance (thus orbital period) between the two orbits. Also, if you\u0027re low, the game sets a limit on how quickly you can warp - only 2x under 10km IIRC. Try setting your station higher if that\u0027s the case or getting your vehicle into a much higher orbit, just so you can warp more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn close orbits a time-to-transfer of a couple of hours is not unlikely but with warp that should happen in 5 minutes or less real-time.

MJ will make a series of manoeuvres to get the RVZ done, some of which can take a bit of time depending on your situation. If both craft start in or near the same orbit then MJ will burn to quite a high orbit to wait for alignment before burning back down. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso the amount of torque available has quite an impact on these things. If your ship is a dead-weight brick then MJ cant rotate it any quicker than you could and he has half a dozen tweak-burns to align for. If each alignment he makes takes 30 seconds then you lose almost 5 minutes just turning to face. (edit: you really dont wanna try and dock under-torqued/rcs\u0027d parts anyway)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts also worth remembering MechJeb isnt foolproof, he can and will get it wrong. In particular he struggles to match the default 0.1ms tolerance with high TWR ships and may hunt it back-and-forth to little gain. (I cant use landing guidance module for the same reason, my TWR is so high that he cannot balance the throttle and ends up in hover/climb)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-10T08:39:28Z\u0022 title=\u002203/10/2014 08:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 10, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by celem\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rickenbacker","CreatedById":2349,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-10T09:50:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u00225thHorseman\u0022 data-cite=\u00225thHorseman\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDoes MechJeb not allow time warp?
