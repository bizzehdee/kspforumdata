Reason I ask, is that my mod now lowers the volume of all sources gradually while ascending out of atmosphere, and gradually increases it as well when reentering atmosphere. It is a great effect, I think, but there is a problem. I need to keep the volumes within the settings set by the user in the main menu, so that music is not increases if the user has disabled all music. But then I need to know what type of audio source I am iterating through.
