That is, except the LK lander itself, which barely has enough power for its mission of landing and returning to Munar orbit. As designed, I used the Block-D for the descent and dumped it with plenty of fuel remaining. On subsequent missions, I kept the Block D attached and landed it that way, using RCS and SAS to keep it precariously balanced. And even then, the Block D still had plenty of fuel to take off and land again in another biome.\n\n![19610500644_db6f45f42b_n.jpg](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/296/19610500644_db6f45f42b_n.jpg)\n\nWhich had my think, why bother with the lander at all? Why have the Soyuz 7K-LOK waiting in orbit? Because the American Apollo did it that way? Why don\u0027t I just slap some landing gear on the Block D itself and call it good.\n\n![20304392436_f5e28bf8f6.jpg](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/273/20304392436_f5e28bf8f6.jpg)\n\nLiterally.\n\nIn the Early Cyrillic alphabet, the name of the letter \u00C3\u00C2\u00B4 (d) name was \u00C3\u00C2\u00B4\u00C3\u00C2\u00BE\u00C3\u00C2\u00B1\u00C3\u2018\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C3\u00C2\u00BE (dobro), meaning \u0022good\u0022. Since this is a lander built around Block D, it is actually very good.\n\nIt does everything the N1-L3 did in getting two Kerbals to the Mun with 40% of the mass, 40% of the fuel, 60% of the cost, and 15% more delta-V. And, unlike the LK, it has plenty of fuel to land on the Mun twice before coming home. Plus, the launcher, an N1-L3 without the first Block A engine, is easier to fly.\n\nIn going to Minmus I was able to land and take off half a dozen times, bunny hopping around the planet picking up multiple biome science. Then I was able to return to Kerbin and rendezvous with an orbiting space station to drop the science off in the science module. \n\nRemove the materials bay, add a docking port and put an Aurora module under the Koyuz capsule any you can fulfill space station and base contracts as well.\n\n![20196523679_d410d034d7.jpg](https://farm1.staticflickr.com/476/20196523679_d410d034d7.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptKordite","CreatedById":142147,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-23T13:41:13Z","Content":"The Dobro is pretty good.

These are semi-historical in that the payload is pretty close to looking like what the Russians put into orbit but the launcher is just what is needed to get into Kerbin orbit. \n\nFor example, Sputnik was put into space with a R7 rocket, what in this illustration is sitting below the Vostok and Soyuz. But at the very left you can see how small a rocket is needed to put a Stayputnik into orbit. And then, when you get to the Vostok and Soyuz, I eliminated one entire stage and half of another and still have the 3500 m/s delta-V necessary to make orbit. The N1 was designed for lifting space stations into orbit, interplanetary flights and going to the Mun but, in KSP, you can chop off the bottom stage and two off the top and still put the Mir core module into orbit. Even what I have here is a little overpowered but I went with that because it\u0027s what the N1 was for."}]}
