When starting the game everything works fine...I can double click Kerbin to focus on it, I can click the orbit of a craft to place a node, if a target is selected I can click on the closest approach markers and see my distance, etc. to the target and I can select other crafts by clicking on them. At some point, this all stops working...I can\u0027t do anything with the mouse clicks in map view, mousing over the \u0022closest approach\u0022 markers for my target no longer gives me information...I have to restart the saved game from scratch to correct this...and it eventually repeats.

Therefore the game \u0022locks the input\u0022 and you can no longer do anything. It normally does this during loading screens, for example, and then restores control to you when the scene has loaded. But sometimes, KSP may falsely believe that your input should be locked, or it fails to restore control.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo check if this is happening, go to the debug menu (Alt\u002BF12) and look into the tab named \u0022input locks\u0022.
