It feels fairly stable at all speeds, as long as it\u0027s going in a straight line - I can turn on SAS and not get any wobble, at which point I can basically walk away. I got it that way largely by tuning the numbers in FAR CAS, but there\u0027s one that I can\u0027t seem to get right: Ixy should be near zero, but mine is consistently a large negative number.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom the tooltip, it sounds like this means that when the plane starts rolling, it should become easier to pitch, and vice versa, which matches my experience in flying it: It\u0027s certainly not impossible to turn, and I\u0027ve even managed to turn it all the way around at about Mach 2 while keeping a fairly steady altitude (I overshot the Space Center).

I\u0027m wondering if the problem is something more fundamental to the design, like the way the wings curve upward, or if there\u0027s some tweak I just haven\u0027t thought of yet.

So I guess, roughly, having the wings curve way up like that makes it so that the axis that the plane wants to roll around is pitched down compared to the axis that I want it to roll around; so rolling away from center makes the nose droop, but rolling back to center should raise it up again. Seems like a fix would not be trivial, although moving the center of mass forward might decrease the effect (while also making it turn even more slowly, but then I\u0027m not expecting this thing to ever be super-maneuverable).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-20T19:03:48Z\u0022 title=\u002208/20/2013 07:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 20, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by PetWolverine\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ferram4","CreatedById":21328,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-20T20:04:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWith a design like that (which seems to have too much wing to start with) part of the problem might just be that the you\u0027ve got a lot of wing far from the CoM; that will make rolling difficult to start with.

Also, you should make sure to add struts between your wings if you want to properly test a vehicle, since the change in wing geometry can be enough to greatly affect the performance of the aircraft.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis sounds like a testable hypothesis. To the lab! We should expect that if I move the wings forward and back, it should have a noticeable impact on the products of inertia (or at least Ixy, the one I\u0027m interested in).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/93cdL\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled. View full album\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat seventh image is telling. I don\u0027t know why I didn\u0027t try it before - I tried a single B9 wing, but not a p-wing - but notice that Ixy in that shot is roughly half what it is in all the previous p-wing shots. It certainly makes sense for it to be non-zero in this case; the \u0022craft\u0022 is unbalanced. But adding another one on the other side should balance it, returning it to zero, and instead it doubles it. So it would seem that adding more p-wings always changes Ixy in the same direction, regardless of where the p-wings are.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs it always the same amount? Well, no; in the eighth shot we see Ixy more than doubling when we go from 1 wing to 2. But when we add a third wing, bringing the craft back into balance along the x axis (but way out on the y axis), it is now almost exactly triple the value for one wing. Will it return to zero if we mirror each wing? No; even though it is now perfectly balanced along the y axis, and no more out of balance than before along the x axis, Ixy doubles again. You can see how this would add up to thoroughly destabilize a plane of any appreciable size.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suspect that the y offset of the wing\u0027s mass is always being given the same value, regardless of its actual position. Of course, this could be a problem in the p-wing code rather than yours, but I think at this point the conclusion that it\u0027s a real bug is inescapable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I understand the necessity of struts; I didn\u0027t intend to leave them off, but saw my wings flopping as I was lifting off and thought hey, just roll with it and see how it flies. My point was that the B9 wings with horribly, uncontrollably variable geometry were \u003Cstrong\u003Emore stable\u003C/strong\u003E than the very rigid procedural wings of the previous iteration. This is of course just my perception, and if the numbers in the hangar are just for reference and aren\u0027t used in any in-flight calculations, then I would have to look for another explanation for the difference between these two planes. But there\u0027s still a mistake in those numbers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry for the wall of text. Anyway, don\u0027t get me wrong, I love this mod and appreciate the work you\u0027re doing. I\u0027ll just stick to B9 wings rather than procedural for the time being.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Subcidal","CreatedById":20751,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-23T05:53:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHas anybody made a Delta V chart with FAR in mind?
