Much science was gathered along the way and we have literally days worth of food left.\n\nJeb seems upbeat about their situation but Bill and Bob seem somewhat subdued and panicked (respectively) regarding the way that the antenna fell off during atmospheric descent. The science bay also disintegrated along with the antenna while INSIDE the service bay. The service bay remains entirely undamaged.\n\nOne is left to conclude that the service bays do not adhere to the previously accepted laws of physics. Alas (again) we are unable to articulate this back to CAPCOM because the aforementioned antenna has fallen off.\n\n\u003Cthis recording=\u0022\u0022 ends=\u0022\u0022 with=\u0022\u0022 the=\u0022\u0022 last=\u0022\u0022 will=\u0022\u0022 and=\u0022\u0022 testaments=\u0022\u0022 of=\u0022\u0022 three=\u0022\u0022 brave=\u0022\u0022 kerbonauts,=\u0022\u0022 omitted=\u0022\u0022 here=\u0022\u0022 for=\u0022\u0022 reasons=\u0022\u0022 of=\u0022\u0022 privacy=\u0022\u0022 and=\u0022\u0022 respect=\u0022\u0022 for=\u0022\u0022 the=\u0022\u0022 doomed=\u0022\u0022\u003E\u003C/this\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T00:57:26Z","Content":"I can picture this in my mind, but it would be better to have pictures ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"wossname","CreatedById":118005,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T07:00:12Z","Content":"Maybe Bob will be able to rig-up a longwave transmitter out of curry dishes and one of the goo canisters.

Very resourceful. He sent us back this lovely picture of their predicament...\n\n[http://imgur.com/6DzEyk3](http://imgur.com/6DzEyk3)\n\nThey have over 1500 science points (estimated) on board so I can\u0027t really leave them there. I guess they will have to be rescued by a girl."}]}
