(Although a fully-upgraded Tier 3\u00A0Space Plane Hangar is required.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe AS-3F is controlled by a probe core, and carries no passengers; it is, however, fitted with a cargo bay that can return very small components from orbit, or, perhaps, rescue a kerbal if fitted with a command pod. It is powered by no less than four Panthers in-atmo and two Thuds for vacuum (with ~2,000m/s dV fully fueled); unfortunately these are also its weaknesses. It comes with four flush-mounted solar panels to recharge the probe core and batteries in orbit. The wingtip tanks and outboard sections are connected by fuel lines to\u00A0automatically feed into the main body, although it is still recommended to manually rebalance the center of mass by transferring fuel to the frontal tanks before attempting atmospheric flight after reentry from orbit. The two small rear fuel tanks are partially drained of oxidizer, as liquid fuel is relatively scarce and the\u00A0fuel budget for jet engines uses most of it or more during ascent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EBackground\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI spent *far* too long trying to develop a Tier 2 R\u0026amp;D SSTO (hours and hours); no ramjet or supersonic intakes. After 9 major iterations of a basic airframe and many more versions of those in between, I came up with this. My aim was to use it for those component recovery missions... but to be honest, I ended up doing the space program goof up of \u0027overcomplicate for nothing but higher cost and lots of used up time\u0027. Still!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh yeah, and I can\u0027t non-physics time warp the recovery missions because there\u0027s no AGU, so it stays loosely inside the cargo bay.

I was thinking over a name including \u0027Thunder\u0027 because it uses Thuds for its rockets (it\u0027s like, the first time I ever used Thuds lol), specifically chosen due to being the only engine able to meet the thrust requirement within weight margins. For the craft name, I eventually settled on \u2018Skystreak\u2019, which the ramjet upgrade definitely lives up to. Though, the Whiplash upgraded variants probably deserve something with \u2018Thunder\u2019...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/UwqiK2c.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHere\u0027s a bonus image\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0of the 9F/3F next to the 8C, its functioning predecessor with an LV-T45, but needed a cargo bay-held ejectable fuel tank pack to make it to orbit, so not exactly an SSTO (but does have tons more delta-V in orbit than the 9F/3F; \u002B300 compared to \u002B100). The fuel tank pack was pretty cheap though, so it was probably still a really good design even if not \u0027true SSTO\u0027. The best thing the 8C did for me though, was give me a solid numbers for fuel, thrust, and mass baselines for a functioning low-ish tech\u00A0SSTO.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLastly, some time during the design process I learned that turning off angle snap in Offset/Rotate mode allows free movement of parts.

I do not know how the extra mass will affect the ascent, however, as it is already a struggle (though adding a command pod in the cargo bay area will allow removal of the Small Inline Reaction Wheel).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor component recovery missions, it\u2019s doable for very small parts; the best I\u2019ve done was a Panther engine floating around up in orbit (goofy other companies trying to mid-tech SSTO like me\u2026 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E ). However, you can\u2019t time warp for long periods or else the two entities (craft and part) will eventually drift apart due to absence of physics during orbital warp. Atmospheric warp, however, is fine, as physics are active. Oh, also, you won\u2019t receive the reward for \u2018obtaining\u2019 the component because technically, you never do.

Also, I fly with a lot of instrumentation assistance (i.e., MechJeb/Engineer readouts), so I usually fly off of information like what my vertical speed and acceleration are. My recall of the altitude and speed checkpoints is decent, but the AS-3F is fairly underpowered, so additional information definitely helps during the ascent. This is a general, inaccurate outline that is a good place to start from:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. START-UP SEQUENCE: SAS ON, MAX THROTTLE. Press \u20180\u2019 [CLOSES ALL INTAKES].

Somewhere between 14km and 15km at a speed above 700m/s, activate RCS and Thuds [Press \u20182\u2019], pitch up to 45-60 degrees without going under 600m/s speed.

This allows a recovery mission or a station rendezvous (though it has no docking ports, so an AGU on the station must be used or a docking port should be added (unknown how this will affect already difficult ascent profile)).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022KcTtJQe.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KcTtJQe.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(It was built right before 1.1 came out; note the old LY-10s.

The AS-3J\u00A0climbs to 6000m at 70 degrees from the horizontal at 75-80% power. And at the speed run, a small sliver between 10km and 13km altitude, the quad Whiplashes at full throttle give the lighter variants\u00A0a huge kick (topping out at around 5.15 TWR). And whereas the Panther variant is a fight to get up to speed, the Whiplash variants are a fight to... not overheat and explode, and hope there\u0027s no asymmetrical flameouts. Oh, and try and keep the thing controlled pointed straight and not get pulled up or down by aero forces.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, specifics. I\u2019m going to start off with my favorite one- the\u003Cstrong\u003E AS-3J Skystreak\u003C/strong\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022XjlpCIo.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XjlpCIo.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(AS-3J, first flight.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI figured oxidizer is uselessly heavy, so I took out all of the oxidizer, removed some tanks from the wingtips, replaced the short rocket fuselage with a liquid fuel one, and stuck in dual LV-Ns. Compared to the original Panther-Thud variant, it actually ends up having roughly the same fully fueled\u00A0mass, in actuality being slightly \u003Cem\u003Elighter\u003C/em\u003E. It is, in fact,\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ethe lightest\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0of the Tier 3 R\u0026amp;D variants, coming in at 30 tons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe poor TWR of LV-Ns makes it a little hard for the final ascent, but if the Skystreak\u2019s trajectory can be kicked up to launch it to 40km off of the Whiplashes, it makes it to orbit with over 1k delta-V left. But hey, no oxidizer makes logistics that much easier (or annoying, for refuel stations with oxidizer), and super efficient LV-Ns.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQuite an improvement over the Panther-Thud original prototype. (Naturally, Thuds had to be used on the AS-3F because Panthers don\u2019t have the thrust to get the plane to a fast enough velocity, so the rocket stage had more work to do for the ascent.) Unfortunately, still not enough to do even a Minmus landing (or at least a round trip) without a refuel. With a refuel though, it\u2019s got pretty respectable range.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe\u003Cstrong\u003E AS-3G Skystreak\u003C/strong\u003E is a more conventional variant that uses dual Dart aerospikes instead, but it\u2019s fairly\u00A0boring otherwise. Gets up with pretty decent dV too, though (I think also about 1k, so same limitations as the 3J). This is the generalist variant, with good thrust and relatively good ISP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022t3ZJDJJ.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/t3ZJDJJ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(This picture is dated, and the name in the craft editor is no longer its designation.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022txSSN61.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/txSSN61.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Yeah, the kerbals will need to jump a bit.

It\u0027s a straight upgrade using simple tech- LV-T45s, making it the only upgrade variant with gimbaling rockets. It comes with\u00A0the long Mk2 cargo bay. Not built for range, but for actual orbit delivery duties with its higher thrust but lower ISP compared to dual Darts. Untested, but expected to perform as designed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd lastly, there\u2019s the \u003Cstrong\u003EAS-3K Skystreak\u003C/strong\u003E. One step up from the AS-3J, it has\u003Cem\u003E three\u003C/em\u003E LV-Ns. Also untested, also expected to function well enough. The slight increase in thrust should make the ascent somewhat easier to handle.

I\u0027m thinking the most optimal configuration would be using quad Rapiers and have dual Whiplashes on the main body, then switch the internal fuel lines\u00A0to pump rocket fuel to the outboard modules.\u00A0If anyone wants to give that a shot, cool, report back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-18T02:48:42Z\u0022 title=\u002205/18/2016 02:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 18, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Box of Stardust\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
