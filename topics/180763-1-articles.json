The game just updated to 1.6 but this issue was there before.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow to reproduce (subassembly issue)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nCreate a subassembly category in Linux [Windows], create a subassembly in that category.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSave the game to a non-quicksave.
