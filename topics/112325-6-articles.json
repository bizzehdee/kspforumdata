I really like your cleveland, to be honest, it\u2019s probably the best stock ship on the forums I\u2019ve seen so far. Those fighters look brilliant. I especially like the open-cockpit design of your fighters. That final kerbpaint touch, although not neccisarily stock, makes everything look even better. I would install kerbpaint just to see your models.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have a suggestion, the Schwerer Gustav railgun the Germans used (a bit) in WWII.
