When I was in high school I used to have a math teacher who was ambidextrous. He always had two pieces of chalk, one in the right and the other in the left. He positioned himself to the center of the blackboard, started writing with left and when he was in the middle of the board he continued with his right hand. I also remember the same guy could draw perfect circles by hand on the blackboard; don\u0027t think that has anything to do with this, but it sure made in one of the most awesome teachers!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
