However, once your able to scale down your payloads, science and crew pods, all bets are off!\n\nAnd the problem with just ignoring the ability, is once you know it\u0027s there, any time where you could solve a problem just by using it, it becomes very hard to think about a different solution. I\u0022m currently *trying* to build a ship to escape the atmosphere with a few material bays, but all I want to do is just say screw it, and make them tiny.

I think the only science part that wouldn\u0027t make sense for inverse cost is the goo pod. Because unless you can reduce the ammount of science you get from smaller parts, we have to assume that you\u0027re packing the same amount of accuracy into even a smaller thermometre.
