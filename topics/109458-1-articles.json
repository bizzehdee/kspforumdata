It would be awesome to put the 2.5m stack separator on there and have it make a 2.5m fairing, instead of a 1.25m one (which means I have to then also make an interstage, adding a bunch of parts to the rocket for something I am throwing away, anyway)."},{"CreatedByName":"Kegereneku","CreatedById":66154,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T09:04:40Z","Content":"How many time did I wondered myself...\n\nI think the subtlety is that the separators would have to also check the diameter of the \u0022node\u0022 before the engine (and overide the previous size), the engine obviously already contain the data saying that it is a 1.25m or a 2.5m part, but I doubt every other fuel tank do.\n\nOnly work-around I know (since 1.0) is to add a fairing hiding the decoupler."},{"CreatedByName":"Murph","CreatedById":90837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T09:54:38Z","Content":"Technically, the decoupler doesn\u0027t create the shroud, it\u0027s created by the engine itself.

I tried to do an Apollo mission yesterday, with a LEM extraction... the interstage fairings add no structural stability, so the whole thing started wobbling around... :/\n\nAlso, doing a LEM extraction revealed itself being very difficult with the stock interstage fairings. You are forced to use a decoupler between CM/LEM, wich will stay in the way when you want to turn around and dock...\n\nThe ideal would be to have only the interstage fairing to hold the two (firmly ![-_-](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_sleep.png) ) , so that ghere would be nothing between LM and LEM inside the rocket.\n\nAnyone knows a workaround ?"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T20:32:54Z","Content":"I thought it would be more of a gameplay question, but I would actually like this.
