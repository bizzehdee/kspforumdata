They were courteous enough to express their disappointment privately and make a few suggestions as to how I could rectify the situation to their satisfaction. Rather than delete or modify the original thread I thought I would create a new one and talk about the 1701 replica and my reasons for not originally posting it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, as requested, I have added a 3 view of the ship (I don\u0027t understand why someone would want this since they\u0027re getting the craft file anyways).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/2AXa3\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled. View full album\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo why didn\u0027t I release the craft file? Honestly, it was just an experiment with gizmos I had made when .90 first came out. I was originally playing around with the ion engine file to see what would happen if I added the rapier multimode module and what the relationship was between electric power and throttle/thrust, and when I messed with the scale I realized that they looked like impulse engines. Thus the Enterprise was born, and from that the idea to build a practical replica of the NASA concept ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow this thing is useless for anything but cinematics or a \u0022get this lump of junk into orbit\u0022 challenge IMHO, as it was basically an exercise in construction techniques that would allow me to explore gizmos and develop some skills for my 2001 themed career. The modified craft (which I have added in the downloads, and bundled the impulse engines with it) is flyable (once you get it to space) and very cheaty - perfect for cinematic work but nothing more. However the bridge is pretty puny so I don\u0027t consider it a craft worthy of the community, to be honest. I personally would look to better builders for a far more functional and practical Star Trek themed ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah, I honestly didn\u0027t think it was that great or that anyone would be interested in it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the link to the files, which includes the stock version as well as the mod craft version:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbal.curseforge.com/shareables/227811-kerbal-dynamics-kdx-1701-enterprise\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ECurseforge\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Azimech","CreatedById":50750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-13T23:09:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGreat!

As much as I don\u0027t mind the Abrams\u0027 movies (okay I hated that last one, way to butcher my favourite film from the TOS/TMP cast era), I particularly despise the \u002709 Constitution class for taking the worst features of TOS and TNG Enterprises, IMHO. As for doing a full sized refit/A in stock, even a half scale (err kerbal scale?) replica would be an absurdly huge number of parts, so I don\u0027t see it as something that could be done in KSP at the moment. Of course, that might all change with 1.0.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, I\u0027m glad people are enjoying the craft.
