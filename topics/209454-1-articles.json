I tried to use the little maneuver button on the right side of the screen, but it says my orbital inclination is too high, I\u0027ve tried launching some other rockets in sandbox mode with different orbital inclinations, but still, all my orbits are the yellow/green color.

Do you have mods installed? Is it perhaps showing an orbit that is a contract objective?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Astuted","CreatedById":222594,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-08-21T20:38:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think you can get contracts in sandbox?
