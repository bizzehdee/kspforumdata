So, I\u0027m hoping there\u0027s a setting that will allow me to adjust the flare\u0027s location. Is this even a scatterer issue or is it cause by something on the Kopernicus side?\n\u003E \n\nPlease be more specific when reporting your issue. Are those scatterer sunflares? If they aren\u0027t centered on associated star what are they centered on? How did you modify the config?"}]}
