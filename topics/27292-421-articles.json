And speaking of which, I spent my weekend finishing the base part of the station - it now has the full compliment of eight modules, giving it a crew compliment of up to eighteen Kerbals (there\u0027s currently sixteen there; I left room for visiting crews), two lab modules and the equivalent of two orange tanks worth of fuel sitting in orbit of Mun. I still haven\u0027t decoupled the transfer stage that brought the hub module to the Mun; I\u0027m thinking once its job of supposting the grinding of the Mun biomes is complete it might make the hop out to Minmus for the same purpose.

Mission Control elects Bill and Jeb to pilot the LEM. The two bravely descend to the surface on a 2-staged lander. However, the fuel consumption seems anomalous: something is not right with the descent stage (*). The lander lands hard, destroying the descent stage; Jeb tries to escape using the ascent stage, but the crash is too violent: Jeb is unable to control the attitude in time, and the lander crashes, killing them both. Bill and Jeb become the first two casualties of the space program. Bob is ordered to return at the KSC: he will never fly again.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe months passes and a new design is approved and tested. After 2 unsuccessful mission that highligted construction problems in the new launch stage, a new mission is launched, with the objective to reach the final resting site of the two astronauts. Tomner and Shelbald successfully land at the site, after some piloting difficulties to correct the LZ.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut at this point, the engineers at KSC make a shocking discovery: too much fuel has been used to pick the landing site, and now the lander is unable to dock with the command module!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe situation is bleak: it will take 21 days to recondition the launchpad (KCT), and the crew only has water for 8 days. The command module has plenty of fuel, but is unable to land to pick them up. With a rescue mission out of the question, the only chance of survival is some serious piloting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShelbald takes off from the surface of the Mun, trying to meet with the CM in orbit. The fuel runs out before they can circularize, but it\u0027s enough: the closest encounter is 3 km... at 10 km from the surface. Now the two can only hope that the CM pilot will pull off a miracle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the CM, Kiruki leaps into action: he first matches the velocity with the lander, and then sprints towards it at an unsafe speed of 200 m/s. There is no time for safety, at 4 minutes from the crash. He reaches the LEM and kills the relative velocity: when the CM stops, the two ships are separated by less than 20m... a close call that could have resulted in a crash.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith no time to lose, Tomner exits the LEM and flies to the CM, to relative safety. Shelbald is up next: in the few seconds it took Tomner to transfer, the two ships have already drifted away by more than 100m.
