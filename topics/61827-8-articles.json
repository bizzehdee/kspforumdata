As long as you try to keep descending at 5-6 m/s or so, then just locking to negative surface velocity should steer you fine. (It starts to break down if you want to hover, since as your vertical velocity starts to get near zero, the surface vector direction will get very \u0027sideways\u0027 and \u0027swingy\u0027 and staying locked to it when it does that would be suicidal. When I wanted to make a hover and seek-for-better-terrain algorithm, I had to do something more complex than just locking to retrograde.
