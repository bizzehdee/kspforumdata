FIXED!\n- ~~A small bug with the \u0022turbine spin\u0022 when switching modes of the MASAMUNE where the turbine spins down in nuclear rocket mode.~~ FIXED! (New models and design change this.)\n- ~~Bug where the alternator does not supply electricity in nuclear rocket mode. This is caused by the muti-mode engine module. Just deploy solar panels in space.~~  FIXED! (Although still good to have solar panels.)\n\n**Current Status:**\n\n- M.A.S.A.M.U.N.E.: COMPLETE ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)\n- N.O.D.A.C.H.I.: COMPLETE ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif \u0022:cool:\u0022)\n- K.U.N.A.I.: COMPLETE ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)\n- SHORT-M: COMPLETE ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)\n- M.U.R.A.M.A.S.A.: COMPLETE ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif \u0022:cool:\u0022)\n- K.A.T.A.N.A.: MK2 cross-section, Being finished\n\n**Currently Planned:**\n\n- **Direct Air Cycle Engines (Phase I)**\n    - MX-01 K.
