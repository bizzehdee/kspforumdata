The relevant bits might have to have their AO rebaked (or just removed) though - I recall there being a bit of empty space in the texture, so if it\u0027s not too much trouble those particular pieces of texture could be duplicated to the empty space. For the Ct65 I think you could just move the struts to the inner ring. The rest are less certain I guess - keep the pistons if possible, but I guess it\u0027s still worth asking whether the ring should be removed or just shrunken.\n\nBTW, I don\u0027t think it\u0027s necessary to make the attachment base as small as possible. If they\u0027re the same size as the nozzle, or only slightly bigger, that\u0027s probably fine as far as clustering is concerned ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nEDIT: Ninja\u0027d ...

Luckily, as you point out, there\u0027s some space in the texture for a few extra bits. There are also going to be duplicate piston sets in the model for the ringed and bare versions.
