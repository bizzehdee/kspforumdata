I was actually able to make a working Synchropter with synchronizing gears. This Helicopter has twin rotors that inter mesh above the body of the heli. And the synch gears keep the rotors timed together so they do not hit. It even works, for a while. It uses jet engine powered turbo shafts that work in conjunction with the sas system on the rotors to produce lift. Nothing fancy, just makes the rotors compact.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis design is highly experimental at the moment and is prone to malfunction. The rotor bearings are not sufficient to keep the rotors and synch gears in line at high speeds, but, it is a working design and I though you all might like to have a look at it and see how I did it anyways. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Hope to see improved designs released by you all soon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[download ---\u0026gt;] \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download/lhwoly0e45ejdfc/JAK-19x_Kerbakon.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJak-19x Kerbakon\u003C/a\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1346.photobucket.com/albums/p685/Jakalth/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/kerbakon2_zpsaafcab1e.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022kerbakon2_zpsaafcab1e.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1346.photobucket.com/albums/p685/Jakalth/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/kerbakon1_zpsefa4a50d.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022kerbakon1_zpsefa4a50d.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is a close up picture of the synch gears under each of the turboshaft engines. They are made from a small fl-a10 adapter with 2 sets of 8 small pylons attached to it. The two sets of pylons are then angled towards each other so that their tops meet, making a gear tooth. This gear setup allows the two turbo shafts to be synched at an angle. The results look like the following.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1346.photobucket.com/albums/p685/Jakalth/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/synchgears_zps11ba5101.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022synchgears_zps11ba5101.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe gears work decent enough, but I keep having issues with the shaft getting deflected enough that the gears can slip a tooth. Also, under high enough load, the adapter fails completely due to over stressing. But this only happens with the throttle is set to over 75% and the power limiter on the jet engines is turned up to 100%.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimple preflight checklist:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: turn on SAS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: hit spacebar to active the small seperators shown above\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3: make sure your controling from the cockpit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4: hit spacebar again to activate the engines\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5: fly\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Azimech","CreatedById":50750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-20T00:53:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood work! At last, some new original designs based on my turboshaft are spawning. Anyway, you\u0027ve encountered the KSP limitation of not having different materials with different properties. Building gears in KSP is very irritating process. The colliders aren\u0027t respected properly or the drag is too high. The more people understand these awkward limitations, the more people can push Squad to implement a better materials system.

But if the turbo shaft is kept below 90 RPM, then the suspension on the landing gear(used to make the bearing) can react fast enough to push the gears back into place before they can slip. Sadly, the rotors used in this test model prefer to run over 90 RPM, so issues arise. I\u0027ve tried making much larger, conventional rotors, but they get too big. And once again, the rotor bearing sets show that they are not strong enough to handle the added mass of the much larger conventional rotors, and they fall apart even quicker.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI might just have to try making a second version using the sturdier rotor bearings I have. But the problem there is that the sturdier bearing sets have about 20% more parts, and this heli is already pushing 520 parts total... Not ideal either.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jon144","CreatedById":80626,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-20T03:20:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAwesome!

That and with that many parts, the game is not happy about mirroring the engines. As for the rotors, yeah, made them separately.
