One of my big annoyances is RCS being used for things SAS can accomplish. I\u0027d like to see a mod that disables RCS from activating when I use the WASDQE keys, but still be controlled for the translation controls IJKLHN. I know you can toggle RCS on and off as needed, but I always eventually forget, and end up firing RCS to do a simple roll, for example. As some craft don\u0027t have enough SAS, there would need to be a toggle to allow RCS to act like stock on these craft.
