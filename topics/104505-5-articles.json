FOr example, I don\u0027t want it to exceed 15% on control surface deflection but to be able to do it manually. Make it separate on all 3 axes.\n\u003E Useful for FAR and airplanes in general. That\u0027s how real ACS works.\n\nDoesn\u0027t FAR have something like this ?\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Well your post one said you are looking for suggestions for new ideas, so I thought I throw an idea past you. One of my big annoyances is RCS being used for things SAS can accomplish. I\u0027d like to see a mod that disables RCS from activating when I use the WASDQE keys, but still be controlled for the translation controls IJKLHN. I know you can toggle RCS on and off as needed, but I always eventually forget, and end up firing RCS to do a simple roll, for example. As some craft don\u0027t have enough SAS, there would need to be a toggle to allow RCS to act like stock on these craft. Maybe a simple \u0022RCS Translate Only\u0022 toggle on the ship\u0027s right-click menu?\n\n\u003E Seconding the need to disable RCS on crafts that are fast-turning with RWs alone. Using RCS on such crafts often leads to undesired changes in orbit, and lost dV.\n\nI\u0027ll see if i can do such a thing. Maybe ill just toggle the RCS on/off.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Spoke too early. Today it did that again. [Logs here.](https://www.sendspace.com/file/z4ync7)\n\n From your logs i read that you got a lot of mods installed did you try removing them and see if this issue pops up? Having a smaller list of mods that could cause issues would for sure help finding the root cause for this."},{"CreatedByName":"bgeery","CreatedById":128020,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T09:44:00Z","Content":"Well, here is another idea for you. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) I just bumped into the problem where the take/store all experiments button isn\u0027t adequate, and there\u0027s no workarounds AFAIK.
