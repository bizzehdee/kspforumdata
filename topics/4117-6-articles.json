Everyone able to get to orbit alright? Anyone managed to do an orbit and land back as KSC? For a real challenge, take a satellite up in one flight, return and land, and then go back in a separate flight, rendezvous with the satellite and re-capture it in the shuttlebay.

I noticed the single trail from the main engines..not a biggie for me. I attached a radial parachute from another pack to the SRBs and they disapeared anyway not again not much point untill we can reused them. It would be nice to see ejection rockets from the SRBs but i think until a process of having lower thrust (like a burn out period) rarther than a 100% to 0% thrust as SRBs are now there is no need. Only thing i have a problem with is getting so close to landing then having it flip over on me. Either way keep up the great work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-07T00:13:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tiberion\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Tiberion\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can try out making 3 particle trails, see if it adds too much lag (since too many separate trails can eat framerates)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had a radial parachute for the SRBs for testing, but didn\\\u0027t like how it worked, so it needs work; Question though: since we can\\\u0027t recover things yet, do we really want to land the boosters to sit around on the ground/in the ocean as debris?

KSP would be pretty much unplayable on such machine, since most rockets that make it past orbit have a lot more than 3 engines. 7 engined configurations run without lag for me. Since the shuttle engine isn\\\u0027t going to be mounted in groups, 3 trails will be fine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe can\\\u0027t recover things yet, but we may, in the future. Plus, it may look cool to see chutes deploying after dropping the SRBs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yes, I\\\u0027ve achieved orbit with this, even deployed a satellite.
