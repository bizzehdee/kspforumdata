How can i find out how long this time will and attach enough batteries ?\n\nThe wiki only lists the orbit darkness time (in Kerbin Time) and not the one who is relevant from the surface.\n\nIt would be good if we could make a list, also from other bodies (I plan a refuling station on duna and minmus):\n\n[TABLE=width: 300, align: center]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]**Mun surface darkness time:**\n\n[/TD]\n\n[TD]**3d 2h** \n\n[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]**Minmus surface darkness time:**[/TD]\n\n[TD]**6 h**\n\n[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]**Duna surface darkness time:**\n\n[/TD]\n\n[TD]**1 d 4 h**\n\n[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[/TABLE]\n\nThanks at all of you at explaing it in such a detail!\n\nHere are the darkness times for reference\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-11T08:52:53Z\u0022 title=\u002204/11/2015 08:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ManuxKerb**"},{"CreatedByName":"impyre","CreatedById":116031,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-11T01:23:06Z","Content":"...The surface darkness time will vary depending on altitude and the planet\u0027s sidereal rotational period. For most bodies altitude can usually be ignored, if behind a cliff or mountain, you might expect a few additional minutes of darkness, but it shouldn\u0027t be significant... for the Mun though (whose sidereal rotation period is a tad over 6 days) being near a mountain or other obstruction could increase darkness time significantly. For minmus this is 40,400 seconds (or just a little under 11 hours 15 minutes). This is applicable if you\u0027re at a relatively high altitude (or otherwise unobstructed view of the horizon). This means you could expect to spend 20,200 seconds in darkness (or about 5.6 hours... better call it 6 to be safe).\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nLatitude doesn\u0027t affect rotational period (total daytime \u002B nighttime), as though you have less distance to travel your velocity will be proportionally less also. And just FYI, if you can get right on the pole, you could see the sun all the time (excepting eclipses of course).\n\nEdit: for clarity.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-11T07:29:27Z\u0022 title=\u002204/11/2015 07:29  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by impyre**"},{"CreatedByName":"Deutherius","CreatedById":125381,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-11T01:51:54Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Latitude doesn\u0027t affect this, as though you have less distance to travel your velocity will be proportionally less also.

I chose to address what may be a common misconception (that day/night times are affected by latitude due to rotational velocity being lower), that\u0027s all.\n\nEDIT: Perhaps I should\u0027ve been more clear to reduce confusion.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-11T07:28:16Z\u0022 title=\u002204/11/2015 07:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by impyre**"}]}
