Here\u0027s my idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAntennas\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo be active, they must always be open. They also drain a half of what current probe cores do. The different antennas have certain different optimum ranges. When transmitting below the minimum range, the power requirement increases. This is to prevent the large dish antenna from being used for everything because it\u0027s the best. When above the maximum range, the antenna shuts down. It can still be given commands, but they won\u0027t work unless they are in range. Of course, the antennas\u0027 positions in the Tech Tree needs to be reworked. If more planets are added, these values need to be reworked. Adding more antennas does not affect anything, and will not draw more power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECommunotron 16: 0.1 meters to 15,000,000 meters. Requires the least amount of ElectricCharge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComms DTS-M1: 500,000 meters to 20,000,000,000 meters. Requires the second most ElectricCharge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECommunotron 88-88: 15,000,000 meters to 500,000,000,000 meters (Well beyond the orbit of Eeloo) Requires a medium amount of ElectricCharge, until past the SMA of Duna\u0027s orbit, when it starts to require exponentially greater power requirements.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnsible DTS-M3: 20,000,000,000 meters to infinity, requires very large amounts of ElectricCharge. I don\u0027t know \u003Cem\u003Ewhy\u003C/em\u003E you\u0027d be sending anything out further than Eeloo, but at least it\u0027s an option. (Probably used with PlanetFactory, or for sending Voyager Probes out.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAntennas can relay information, and an antenna will connect to the antenna that\u0027s in the optimum range and itself is somewhere along the line connected to Kerbin. Note that unlike RemoteTech, lines of sight don\u0027t matter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EProbes\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProbes have twice the battery capacity, and only drain a quarter of the ElectricCharge of what they currently drain. They only respond to input when an antenna is operational. Probes also have a built in black and white camera that can be used for a small amount of scientific value. Probes can be reset by a Kerbal on EVA to restore it\u0027s battery.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPods and Life Support\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach Kerbal in a pod drains 1 unit of LifeSupport per second. Pods contain there own supply of this. If LifeSupport runs out, ElectricCharge is automatically used to refill it slowly. ElectricCharge is also slowly drained constantly, but Pods have 5 times the battery power. Instead of reaction wheels, the Monopropellant in the pods is used when turning, through small RCS jets in strategic locations. This RCS can not be used to translate, and is not controlled by the RCS key (default R). So that a ridiculous amount of Monopropellant is not required, the Isp of the RCS jets on the pods are much higher than the regular RCS. Because both batteries and Reaction Wheels are unlocked rather early in the tech tree, the limited amount of monopropellant is not a problem. If Monopropellant does run out, a very weak reaction wheel is enabled.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-13T22:24:18Z\u0022 title=\u002203/13/2014 10:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 13, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by GregroxMun\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LethalDose","CreatedById":92657,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-14T00:37:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou may want to check out the TAC life support and Remotech 2 mods.
