A perception of beauty. Women dye their hair blond and tan to get that Barbie or Baywatch look at the beach or gym. Guys? I dunno really, I guess they like the look. Even my boss says he needs a tan when he looks at his pale legs when wearing shorts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. They either minimize the danger of UV lamps in their heads or think a few times won\u0027t kill them. Or they know a Barbie-like friend who tans all the time and they are\u0027nt dead so it must be OK right?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. I dunno, but maybe some dislike how pale their skin is and wish it were golden or orange, thus the tanning booth popularity. Ironically in some Asian countries lightening their skin to make it pale is what they do to look beautiful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. They are fine with pale skin but like having the option of changing their skin and hair color like a chameleon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince I am not white but know my mindset, I can say honestly I would not use tanning booths if I was. And if friends mocked ne for being pale and I grew tired of it I would just work outside, mow the lawn or go outside more. Or I would just ignore it or say \u0022So? Cancer and me are not exactly BFFs.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThoughts?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-07-22T22:51:50Z\u0022 title=\u002207/22/2023 10:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Jul 22\u0022\u003EJuly 22, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Spacescifi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-07-23T02:23:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nbecause if i sat out on my deck nakid id get arrested.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spacescifi","CreatedById":197504,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-07-23T02:34:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224304930\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022218550\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221690078998\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002210883\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nuke\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n10 minutes ago, Nuke said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nbecause if i sat out on my deck nakid id get arrested.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh I get that (I understand).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe the difference between a tanned face and a pale body is so jarring to look at in the mirror that they rather just do the full body tan.

My grandfather had skin cancer cryogenically removed from his head. I cannot recall the type of skin cancer he had. My father in recent years had to have basal cell carcinoma surgically excised from his right cheek which has left a noticeable scar. The common link between them? Spending decent amounts of time outdoors. Both (grandfather passed in 06) are/were avid golfers. My own mother would routinely require cryosurgery to remove precancerous lesions from her which resulted from repeated exposure in her youth to forced tanning by her mother when my mom was a child. In the last few years (5-7) she has not been to her dermatologist and I doubt her care facility would take her there now. What do all 3 of my relatives also have in common beyond bring lighter skinned? The majority of the UV exposure was in northern latitudes in Ohio and Michigan. Yes my father has also received UV damage here in the state we live in now (southern state) but that only increases risk. I STRONGLY encourage you to see a dermatologist to be on the safe side. From what I can see in your post it seems you share similar risk factors as my relatives along with the belief that its not as big a risk as it actually is. But I only can speak from what Ive seen happen to my own family.

My grandfather had skin cancer cryogenically removed from his head. I cannot recall the type of skin cancer he had. My father in recent years had to have basal cell carcinoma surgically excised from his right cheek which has left a noticeable scar. The common link between them? Spending decent amounts of time outdoors. Both (grandfather passed in 06) are/were avid golfers. My own mother would routinely require cryosurgery to remove precancerous lesions from her which resulted from repeated exposure in her youth to forced tanning by her mother when my mom was a child. In the last few years (5-7) she has not been to her dermatologist and I doubt her care facility would take her there now. What do all 3 of my relatives also have in common beyond bring lighter skinned? The majority of the UV exposure was in northern latitudes in Ohio and Michigan. Yes my father has also received UV damage here in the state we live in now (southern state) but that only increases risk. I STRONGLY encourage you to see a dermatologist to be on the safe side. From what I can see in your post it seems you share similar risk factors as my relatives along with the belief that its not as big a risk as it actually is. But I only can speak from what Ive seen happen to my own family.

People who spend more time outdoors can suffer from more skin cancers\u2014yet still die less often than people who hide inside, and succumb to heart disease because they sit around like tubs of goo instead of getting out in the world. That is the point. The answer to your claim is to look at all cause mortality as a function of lifetime sun exposure. If you are right, people who spend more time outdoors should live shorter lives.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSingle cause concern WRT heath is virtually always a bad idea (the last 3 years should have taught literally everyone this). It\u0027s all a series of trades. Even smoking is probably a trade off. It\u0027s the substantial cancer risk vs weight (think smokers tend to lower BMI). Smoking is so bad in terms of cancer risk that any weight benefit is lost\u2014and you can not be fat by not eating garbage, so best solution is to NOT smoke, and not eat crap. Sun is beneficial, exercise outdoors is beneficial (health and mental health), down side is over exposure. Easy enough to mitigate by not getting sunburned (where the bulk of the problem lies). So loads of outside time, try not to get sunburned.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32918215/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32918215/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nActive sun exposure habits have a dual effect; it increases the incidence of skin cancer, but also improves the prognosis in terms of all-cause mortality.

I am done. I am walking away. \u00A0I know the risks of UV and have seen first hand the results of those risks. Take heed of those risks or not, its your choice but never dismiss the risks because you think they somehow do not apply. Fare well.
