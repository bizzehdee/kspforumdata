I bought this laptop (i5, 8GB RAM, GTX850) with the intention of playing kerbal and a few other games from time to time. in .90 I was not dissapointed, my frame rates were so high (for small craft) compared to my old computer that I kept crashing landers because timewarp worked so much faster. Even big stuff were playable, allthough with lof FPS. Nowdays, I rarely get above 9 FPS, even with small craft, and big ones are out of the question (2-4 FPS). \n\nA question to you other guys: my computer shows a CPU load of 20-25% on all cores, RAM is not an issue (I play with no mods), disk usage is low and allthough I haven\u0027t checked the GPU with a program, the fan doesen\u0027t suggest it\u0027s working very hard.
