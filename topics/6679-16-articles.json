Sorry for the delays.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: So I had some ideas about a week and a half ago that Cardboard and I discussed over Steam. We want to eventually make parts that will allow for the Munar landing of entire stations, and I proposed a plan that would involve mounting large fuel-containing structures onto trusses at each end of the station, allowing for four sets of engines or more would form the four legs of a table. That is to say that the engine would be flown and landed while horizontal, rather than vertical, and would land on these four sections like table legs. I then realized that once landed, a capsule on the side would be unable to launch away from the station, and I laughed it all off, saying I must be high on pixie dust. We would have to think of another way, and the vague and unsatisfying solution that we reached is that the station would have to be dropped from orbit, with MechJeb controlling the landing while the capsule performs its own, separately. We had no idea how this would work in practice, so we stopped talking about it. We may very well use the MechJeb solution at some point in the future, but until then, I have found the solution tonight. I present- the Ski Jump Launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropbox.com/u/43321825/kosmos%20landing%20concept.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022kosmos%20landing%20concept.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEither I\\\u0027m a Jeb-level genius at this point or my pixie dust just got knocked to the next level.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, this is not the immediate focus yet.
