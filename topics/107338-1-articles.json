Basically, what I mean is that in space, Newtons laws apply; however in sci fi movies, ships fly like they\u0027re on rails. Essentially if there was a mod that included inertial dampening AI which would activate directional RCS to make spaceships fly like airplanes, it would make unlimited fuel fake futuristic space fighters/frigates more fun, and more interesting to look at for machinimas and whatever other cinematic space fighter scenes (mostly) people would be using this for. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E(TL;DR, Space Engineer\u0027s inertial dampeners in a mod so that RCS can make ships fly like planes in space. They would still use RCS, just in an inefficient yet pretty manner.)\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
