My thoughts went roughly like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Hey, there\u0027s Mun coming up. I wonder how high that should appear to get if I want to swing towards it in a higher orbit. I mean, it can\u0027t be as easy as just aiming at it, right? Let\u0027s see... if I boost from a circular orbit, I raise the apoapsis right across from where I am. And if I ignore Kerbin\u0027s size, my semimajor axis would be about half that of Mun. If we normalize it, T^2 = a^3 (where T is period and a is the semimajor axis), so roughly speaking, half my period would take... \u003Cstrong\u003Ea fourth of Mun\u0027s\u003C/strong\u003E!

I didn\u0027t even think to check my math and go around again, I was in such a hurry to hit the throttle. I felt stunned and amazed that it worked out so nicely. It still feels like a crowning moment of geek awesome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy current favorite lander is four-way symmetrical; one of the engines fell off when I headed back toward the lander from a distance on Minmus (there\u0027s this thing where it re-draws the physics when you\u0027re 250 meters from the craft, and that makes it go off the surface somehow), and it ended up on its side. I got in anyway and lit it up -- there was nothing to lose -- and to my surprise, it left the surface (though it was tumbling pretty well). With judicious engine power applied \u003Cstrong\u003Eonly\u003C/strong\u003E when the craft was more-or-less pointed up, managed to leave Minmus\u0027 sphere of influence well behind me... and when I finally made some serious distance, cut the power, and checked the orbital map, I found that my trajectory was just right to enter an aerobraking orbit around Kerbin. I\u0027ve never felt so lucky, or so strong a desire to claim that it was all intentional somehow. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UNSC","CreatedById":31653,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-29T05:12:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI once went on eva without realising that the rocket\u0027s engines were still slightly on.
