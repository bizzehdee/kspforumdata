How about this: While exploring the Kerbol system, finds made while doing science can lead to new tech that wasn\u0027t previously in the tech tree. An example would be \u0022DISCOVERY! While taking a surface sample on Duna, Jeb finds a new mineral Kerbtanium that makes possible new stronger lighter struts!\u0022 These discoveries could be kinda like the easer eggs, scattered and hidden throughout the system, or could be found through normal science. An added benefit would be to make it harder to fill in the tech tree with a couple of novelty missions.

Things we learned in our build up to the Moon with Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo allowed us to build all sorts of new things here on Earth, not necessarily materials from the moon but things needed to get there that found other applications both in and out of the space program. Science in KSP is a simplification of that idea. Not to knock the idea but it seems like your requesting a different form of what we already have.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-25T16:03:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EScience could definitely use some work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHarvesting resources from space is daft, but harvesting knowledge is not.
