Had a few things happen at work, and have had to pick up the duties of another department.... so my already busy schedule has become far overloaded.  This has left not much time (and very little brain power) to devote to modding.  Kind of irritates me, as at this point the mod likely only needs 5-6 hours worth of solid work to get it back to release status... but trying to find that time (when I\u0027m not worn down by work/life) has been impossible lately.  Hopefully this situation will not go on for too much longer, and I\u0027ll be able to finish up the current rewrite stuff, and move back onto developing new stuff (mostly just new parts, the plugin is quite capable).

Would use the same models, but the volume would be adjusted properly.  These models could then be added to the existing MFT-A part as a new variant.  Total time to do the work - likely 2-3 hours.\n\nThe second option would be to add a new \u0027tank type modifier\u0027 that simply reduced the available raw volume by a percentage.  It wouldn\u0027t be exact (and could be quite off for some models), but would be much quicker to implement.  Simply define the new modifier type, specifying the values as appropriate (IIRC its tankVolumeModifier that would be adjusted), and then add that modifier as an option to the tanks/part configs.  Total time to do the work - 10-15 minutes.\n\nBoth of those options are entirely config based and would not require any changes to the existing plugin code, and could even be done through an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E patch."},{"CreatedByName":"jack gamer","CreatedById":185705,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-07-16T06:23:50Z","Content":"I get this weird bug or some sort.![839D2E9141DB56FD2B491C314626B4ECD5F8C1B3](https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/964218133957319441/839D2E9141DB56FD2B491C314626B4ECD5F8C1B3/)"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-07-16T15:12:35Z","Content":"These parts look kind of familiar...\n\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed5536583282\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?app=core\u0026module=system\u0026controller=embed\u0026url=https://twitter.com/SpaceflightIns/status/1018875758410858496\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-07-17T16:09:41Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 7/16/2018 at 12:23 AM, jack gamer said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I get this weird bug or some sort.\n\u003E \n\nInteresting -- looks like the IVA still needs to have its position updated to match the model.
