If you are not able to overclock your CPU there is not much that can be done. I would recommend switching to Shadowplay for recording as it works with a H.264 encoder chip built into the video card and is less taxing on the CPU then Loilo or Bandicam. That should provide better performance while recording. ShadowPlay (also know as NVidia Share with newer versions) is included with the NVidia GeForce Experience software. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.geforce.com/geforce-experience/download\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.geforce.com/geforce-experience/download\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, That Zotac card is worse then the 750Ti and does not support Shadowplay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Reason","CreatedById":157053,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-17T19:33:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHmm I never tryed to overclock my CPU and I do have SP installed but it didn\u0027t seem to be doing anything, needs more testing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lelitu","CreatedById":146287,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-19T03:00:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222988556\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022157816\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221489770676\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022157053\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Reason\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 3/18/2017 at 6:11 AM, Reason said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the main question is what do I do?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot to be rude I know what the problem is now so How to I get the most out of what I got to work with is what I\u0027m asking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe 2nd Video card a own is a Zotac GTS450 1GB 128BIT DDR5 its curtly not being used.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith an older AMD chip like you have, there\u0027s really nothing that you can do.
