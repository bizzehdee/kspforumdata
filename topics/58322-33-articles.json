Because \u0027proper game mechanics\u0027 don\u0027t just appear with a bit of wishful thinking. Additionally that is a pretty subjective way of putting things. InfiniteDice has proper game mechanics for what he originally set out to do. If someone else isn\u0027t satisfied it doesn\u0027t change his goals. God forbid a player actually contribute any effort to achieve the gameplay they want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for actual games.... people sell those.
