It will take roughly 240 years (in Earth\u0027s reference frame) to get there. Then say 25 years after the seedship launches a technological breakthrough allows us build ships capable of accelerating up to .5 c. A seedship launched with the new technology now takes only 50 years or so to get to Tau Ceti so it will pass the older ship enroute and by the time the original seedship arrives it will find a 165 year old colony instead of the virgin territory they were expecting. This example has many simplifying assumptions but you get the idea: this is the basic problem with generation ships, and it only gets more and more extreme the farther away the destination is.

It is not likely that anyone is ever going invest the resources to build interstellar generation ships. Fission fragment, Orion, or even proton-proton fusion interstellar rockets would need totally absurd mass ratios to reach and decelerate from relativistic velocities, therefore they are effectively generation ships.

Since they have a beam to brake on, they are also accelerated to greater speeds than the colony ships before them, reducing the travel time significantly. The magnetic sails are also used as interstellar parachutes, more so by colony ships than by the regulars that come later.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe colony ships in turn, are sleeper ships. They carry a few hundred people, and thousands of frozen embryos, and all the equipment needed to build a colony (in the first wave) and additional supplies (later on). They might even carry fusion or fission-powered SSTO space planes, instead of blunt capsule landers, that go back and forth between the ships. The much greater mass of such a plane might be justified by not needing as many landers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShameless self-advertisement ahead:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://media.moddb.com/images/members/1/120/119207/Starship.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022 title=\u0022Enlarge image\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Starship.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage_thumbnailed\u0022 src=\u0022http://media.moddb.com/images/members/1/120/119207/Starship.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFurther into the future, we might develop antimatter engines and, more importantly, a way to produce antimatter in sufficient quantities.
