Allowing the nerva to have a mode to enhance other engines with it\u0027s own output. (With or in place of it\u0027s own thrust.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Having it have more realistic heat output.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. Anything else?!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow much would this be. I saw something that is had double the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E of other engines. I thought it was only 50%. Might have had to do with using other bells. Not sure. Could this be done realistically?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd if it could and we reduced everything down to 1/10th or to the current game realities what would it come out to?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. how much fuel would it have if not near infinite from the nuclear side.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. How much could it shove stuff into other engines to enhance them and what percentange base in real life(50%/100%?)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. How much heat and how much heat per engine/ output if possible at all. And how much would things like distance matter between engines?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. What else is missing?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know one description was double the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E compared to chemical. Something else suggested different designed increased thrust or had low thrust variation based on the design.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E I figured it could enhance other engines \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E value and not thrust. Although one thing seemed to indicate some nuclear could increase thrust also. I figured it could at minimum change the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E of engine set to receive it to 5or 10% increase in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E. With variations based on how many each Nerva could increase or with massive heat gains from more at once. Whatever would be realistic if any of it.(The nerva would have to be in a mode to send out it\u0027s output and the engines in a mode or set to receive it.) So, what could be realistic?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCould a nerva realistically be used to enhance a chemical rocket not directly attached?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022150\u0022 width=\u0022200\u0022 data-embed-src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zm7PNlK5Aco?feature=oembed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-01-01T11:31:14Z\u0022 title=\u002201/01/2022 11:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 1, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
