On the old laptop I could zoom in using the trackpad (pinch to zoom) but the keys bound to the zoom command would not work in IVA, on the new one the trackpad will not zoom in in IVA or any other in game view and the buttons bound to zoom work in every game mode but IVA. This means that I can\u0027t zoom in at all in IVA. I am running a clear 1.05 install but this problem has persisted since around 0.90. The trackpad zoom works fine in other programs which is a bit weird. Any help would be appreciated.

It is likely that your old laptop just sent the \u0022mouse scroll\u0022 command to KSP, as KSP doesn\u0027t actually have support for pinch-to-zoom, just for mousewheel scrolling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour new laptop may have an option to use pinch-to-zoom as a regular scroll in its options.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mrmcp1","CreatedById":79657,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-14T16:11:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the help, unfortunately activating two finger scrolling had no effect and my touchpad does not appear to support edge scrolling.
