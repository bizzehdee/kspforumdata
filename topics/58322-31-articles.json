The Damage system in Skillful for some reason, fairly consistently, registers the procedural wings as damaged. It seems to have something to do with the procedural control surfaces that are part of the mod as well, possibly. They still mostly work but the control surfaces can\u0027t be used as flaps and the procedural wings will highlight yellow upon launch which is a bit irritating. I haven\u0027t tested if this is also an issue with procedural fairings, but if it is it would likely be much more of a problem as you\u0027d quite likely not be able to decouple them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, while playing I found that I would very much like to have an expansion of action group functionality of the weapons, mainly to allow the \u0022Control This\u0022 to be toggled by action group which as far as I have been able to see isn\u0027t currently possible.
