As far as launch heights and trajectories, burn time is a lot less important than TWR. Your thrust to weight radio will dictate what you can do with a given stage, and remember: your TWR will steadily rise as you burn fuel. Higher TWRs will always allow you to perform more efficient maneuvers, since you can time your burns more precisely, and do more burning at the optimal times for efficient transfers. However, higher TWR also implies you\u0027re carrying more engine weight, and unnecessarily high TWRs will come at the cost of lower delta-v.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a launch on kerbin, You need 4500-4700 delta v to achieve low orbit. The rest of the orbits around kerbin will cost up to a maximum of around 2000 delta v assuming an orbit near minmus WITHOUT using any gravity assists. Realistically though you shouldn\u0027t have to spend more than 1000, since if you\u0027re going higher than the mun (800 dv to apoapsis at munar intercept) you can use the mun as a gravity assist to push up your orbit and partially circularize.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou also want a TWR to stay at around 2 during atmospheric ascent on kerbin, since above that will cause you to exceed terminal velocity, resulting in high losses to air drag, and below that you will spend too much time at low altitudes in thick air before accelerating to orbit, resulting in high losses to gravity. An ideal ascent will use radial staging and discard fuel tanks as soon as they become empty, while using fuel lines to keep the next stages full so all of your engines can burn constantly during ascent and not waste weight or thrust potential. You should aim for a beginning TWR of around 1.7 per stage, keeping in mind that it will increase as the stage burns, and that your first stage should have a higher TWR to accelerate your rocket up to terminal velocity as quickly as possible (solid boosters are good for this).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor more info, see my complete rocket design and launching tutorial, in my signature.
