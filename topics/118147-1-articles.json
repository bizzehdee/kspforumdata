When installed this mod allows vessels to continue rotating, even under timewarp or when not selected. It can even make your vessels keep a persistent relative position, for example keeping an antenna pointed down at Kerbin consistently.\n\nDownload links and such can be found in the [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/113507](\u003Ca%20href=)\u0022\u003E**forum thread**."},{"CreatedByName":"Wallygator","CreatedById":97357,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T20:06:54Z","Content":"Should be stock.

The time warp cheat is the only workaround we have when your ship randomly starts spinning out of control for strange reasons.\n\nI guess the way to solve sudden rotation bugs is to set a threshold where the vessel would rotate in timewarp. If the vessel is rotating too slowly, the game should just take the rotation of the vessel to be negligible.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-11T15:14:33Z\u0022 title=\u002208/11/2015 03:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Rdivine**"},{"CreatedByName":"John FX","CreatedById":59415,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T15:45:08Z","Content":"I highly recommend this mod. Be warned though that it leads to new ways to have \u0060fun\u0060 for example I had one probe around Minmus that was rotating at just the wrong speed which meant that the time it took for the panels to face the sun was the same as it took to face the panel away from the sun due to craft rotation and I had a fully functioning dead probe... (caveat, this was with RT so that needed power too)\n\nIt was great.\n\nAs far as waiting until all physics bugs are gone, I think that would impose too harsh a criteria and our wait would become eternal. I\u0060d rather have this stock and deal with rotation bugs than use insta-stop.\n\nI would imagine that it would just be another difficulty setting so it could be turned off temporarily for \u0060problem craft\u0060in the cheat menu."},{"CreatedByName":"micha","CreatedById":113840,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T17:01:11Z","Content":"Oh cool, I never tried this mod so didn\u0027t know it could also do \u0022point at X\u0022.

It saves the craft\u0027s rotation speed in persistence and then reapplies it when time warp stops or when the craft is loaded. Assuming it is well coded (I haven\u0027t looked) it should have very little performance hit. It does not calculate physics while on rails. Further more, any rotation that would have happened, were the ship not in on-rails mode, will not have applied. \n\nSo the end result is the craft retains it\u0027s rotation speed but it will not be facing the same direction coming out of time warp as it would be if you never entered time warp, because it still doesn\u0027t rotate in time warp. \n\nStill, it\u0027s good enough for most people.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-13T14:20:26Z\u0022 title=\u002208/13/2015 02:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain**"},{"CreatedByName":"Wolfox","CreatedById":59958,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-18T13:36:10Z","Content":"Its also good for keeping solar panels of your satellites and stations pointed at sun at all times, just set the relative body as sun and direct it the way you want, no more sliding on the side when planet it is orbiting move around its own orbit."}]}
