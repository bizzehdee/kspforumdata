Today, when practically all houses in our nation are electrified, it is dining by candlelight which is considered elegant. In the same way, back when everyone\u0027s furniture was handmade, handmade furniture was mundane. Now, handmade furniture is not mundane, and a hand-carved piece is a mark of, you guessed it, elegance.

A cursory inspection of Somalia, for instance, reveals that all humanity does not live in air-conditioned, heated houses with a car out front and an abundance of food. Increases in the wealth and living standard of a nation have always been associated with a shedding of agrarian jobs, and later, manufacturing jobs. (Exhibit A? The USA, aka, the world\u0027s most capitalist, free-market nation.) This increase in wealth and, note,\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Ecreation of new jobs, which are necessary to an increased production of wealth,\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003Ealways occurs as a result of technological development.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Perhaps,\u0022 you ask, still not convinced, \u0022we should go back to when technology hadn\u0027t taken away everyone\u0027s jobs, to simpler, more pleasant times.\u0022 Well, see, some folks in a certain nation already tried that, one of the few known historical examples.

The more regulated an economy, the higher the unemployment (except in Belarus, as pointed out by someone above). A recent decrease in federal regulation and taxation during the last four years in America (*ahem*) have corresponded to an increase in employment (*double ahem*). The primary cause of unemployment is government meddling, not mechanization.
