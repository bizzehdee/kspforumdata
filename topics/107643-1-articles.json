Let me tell you how I started - and you can read the Kerbal Foundries thread to draw your own conclusions... I was unhappy with wheels. Particularly their lack of suspension adjustment. I searched high and low for mods that could rectify this, asked a few questions and met with answers like \u0022oh, it\u0027s baked into the parts, you can\u0027t change it\u0022. Well, not to take anybody at their word, I started digging. I found the unity docs, which suggested otherwise, along with some outdated stuff on the wiki on how to make a KSP plugin. With little experience as a programmer and none making a game mod, I set about figuring out wheels in KSP. Along the way, people have decided they like what I\u0027m doing and joined the project. Not because I asked them really, more because they liked what I\u0027ve been doing and felt they could contribute. It\u0027s both awesome and humbling. 50k downloads and 300,000 thread views later, and I\u0027m still gobsmacked by the support I\u0027ve been offered on my incredible journey into game modding. But it wouldn\u0027t be here now if I hadn\u0027t picked up the tools and show people my vision - such as it was - for a KSP mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo my point is this: if you\u0027ve got a vision, pick up the tools and show it.
