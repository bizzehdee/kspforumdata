Thanks for the response. In two seperate versions of KSP (.22 and .23) I ran into a situation in my career save where all of my ships disappeared after playing well into the game. Both times this occurred when my save game file size was right around 2500KB. Not sure if this is just a weird coincidence or not, but it lead me to believe that there was a maximum file size limit for KSP save game files. Anyone else have any thoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-02T04:29:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have seen plenty of save games MUCH larger than 2.5 MB. Sounds like you might have something else going on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo these ships have control parts on them still? The game has a setting for max allowed debris. I think it defaults to 250, and past that it will start auto deleting debris.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~Claw\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
