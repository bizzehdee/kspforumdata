This would have been left on the moon had the mission gone to plan, but those familiar with history or the Tom Hanks film may recall that as the crew approached Earth, they needed ballast from the LM to account for missing lunar material mass.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe finger-nail sized piece of cloth that I had seen and attempted to acquire was among the bits that the crew saved from the LM moments before jettisoning their \u0022lifeboat\u0022.\u00A0Currently, this item has been lost in transit, sent on a journey requiring many things to come together in order to deliver it safely to its destination and much like during its original trip to the moon it \u0022had a problem\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI thought it somewhat fitting, ironic even, that this would happen; that an artifact from Apollo 13 would make it all the way to the moon and back despite overwhelming odds only to be lost by the posties.

Unless the trashed item has actually been dumped (which would count as littering...) there is nothing to say that the person has abandoned ownership or has not transferred ownership to someone else (i.e. to a skip\u0027s owners who factor scrap metal profits into demolition costs, or to the municipal cogeneration plant which needs burnable stuff for their incinerators). Since people pay good money for bits of spacecraft, they certainly have value and therefore, by definition, are unlikely to be \u0022abandoned\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA related legal confusion arises with the notion of \u0022claiming ownership\u0022: nobody needs to \u0022claim\u0022 ownership for ownership to be very real and effective. Therefore no claim of ownership is required for theft to occur. Ownership is the default state of anything which is not abandoned or has never been owned. A thief\u0027s argument that \u0022nobody said it was theirs\u0022 is no defence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost jurisdictions gravitate around a two-pronged definition (taking \u002B denying the owner of his rights) whereby you commit theft if you take something which you know is owned by someone else, and if you keep it as if you were the owner. That second part generally crystallises if you make no effort to find the owner: it\u0027s technically theft if you keep a tyre iron that you find by the side of the road, but there is often no reasonable way to find the owner; on the other hand there is no doubt who you should contact if you find a bit of space shuttle. Since everybody knows that NASA was actively requesting the return of the bits, then you can\u0027t ever claim that it isn\u0027t theft if you just hold on to it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd the final legal minefield for the \u0022theft\u0022 question is the statute of limitations (or prescription) for theft. Some jurisdictions count from the time the crime is committed, others from the time it is discovered. In the latter case, if law enforcement or the rightful owner don\u0027t know you have the object in question, you can never start the clock running and therefore can never escape the charge of theft on the day you try to sell what you stole.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is a whole other question of \u003Cem\u003Enemo dat\u003C/em\u003E and buying in good faith, which people seem to ignore unless the original owner makes a big deal about it. In practice, it would seem that just saying that it came from \u0022a NASA contractor\u0022 is as good as any other anti-tiger charm for most such sales of spacecraft parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI understand what you mean about repressing trophy hunters, though, and I\u0027m sure that that factors into it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Death Engineering","CreatedById":68528,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-19T20:00:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Di1Yms0h.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022665\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Di1Yms0h.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe sage mostly fizzles out at the end.
