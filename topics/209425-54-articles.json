The bonus is that they offer cheap hyperthreading and generally are good chips. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverclocking means you need an unlocked K-chip and the appropriate Z87 or Z97 chipset to allow proper overclocking. Some other chipsets do work, but Intel is not too happy about that. The process of overclocking entails increasing the clock speed via the multiplier. Then you fully load the CPU to get it to heat up. If that turns out to be stable and temperatures are all right, rinse and repeat until you hit a clockspeed that is not stable any more. At this point you add a little bit of voltage, which should help your chip to run stable again and then you go back to increasing the multiplier in steps. You repeat all this until your temperatures get unacceptably high or the voltage reaches a point that is considered unsafe for your chip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is pretty much it. There are a lot more settings you can fiddle with, but that is the process in a nutshell. The thing with Core Intels is that they are ridiculously easy to overclock. If you know how to read, follow instructions and have some patience, pretty much any chip can be overclocked to a worth while speed. Nothing is guaranteed, but exceptions are fairly rare. The older Core chips generally overclock a little better than the newest ones (Ivy Bridge and Haswell), but are of course a little less efficient per clock.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-30T23:39:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022steve_v\u0022 data-cite=\u0022steve_v\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI too have to take the cpu clock out of auto for anything interesting to happen\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u003Cem\u003EAuto\u003C/em\u003E feature is generally a horrible way of overclocking your chip.
