The crafts used to get us there!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026amp; then I thought, hay if you gave anybody else my age the given materials I could build a rocket and leave earths orbit circum-navigate the moon in orbit, sling shot around and come back to earth. But that isn\u0027t going to happen, but what I could do is build a smaller sub-orbital \u0022 model \u0022 rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am just wondering if anybody on the forums here, would like me to upload photo\u0027s on progress / work I have done. But I also add that it will be a bit off a slow project ( as of the funding ) but it will be a fun science project. I would be happy to receive any input / advice too!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efeel free to PM or just post a comment on here!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers, Ryan!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
