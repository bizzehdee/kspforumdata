I\u0027ve been putting parachutes on everything to try and recover some of the costs since I am early in, and some of the contracts don\u0027t make me much money, once I build a craft to do them, when you count all the parts I loose.

My experience has been that contracts are (mostly) financially worth it, and generally don\u0027t require recovering debris for cash. I never bother with trying to recover debris, and do financially OK.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, it\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Ecaveat emptor\u003C/em\u003E with the contracts-- some of them are sucker deals, keep an eye on what they pay and don\u0027t accept if they\u0027re asking for something really hard and don\u0027t pay much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the solution here may not be a matter of \u0022how to recover debris,\u0022 but rather being more choosy about which contracts to take, and being careful about ship design to keep costs down. For example, use SRBs as much as possible-- they\u0027re dirt cheap, it doesn\u0027t matter much if you don\u0027t recover them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing that took me a while to catch on to: You know how the contract advertises an \u0022advance\u0022 and a \u0022completion\u0022 amount for funds? When I first started playing career, I just assumed that the advance was taken out of the total reward (i.e. if a contract has a $20K advance and a $100K reward, I just assumed that I\u0027d get $20K up front and then $80K when I finish.) It turns out that my assumption was wrong: they add together. You get the advance right up front, free and clear, and then the reward when the contract completes. I find that the advance is nearly always enough to cover the cost of the ship I need to do the contract, with funds to spare.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe I\u0027m the only person to make that dumb mistake \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E, just mentioning it in case anyone else has been similarly confused.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mastikator","CreatedById":135309,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T18:57:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to recover debris then you\u0027ll need a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/86677-1-0-2-StageRecovery-Recover-Funds-from-Dropped-Stages-v1-5-6-%285-15-15%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Estage recovery mod\u003C/a\u003E, otherwise debris in the atmosphere gets deleted without chance for recovery even if it would\u0027ve (or even did) land safely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGenerally solid boosters are worth less than parachutes, but once you start using rockets like the mainsail then it starts to be worth it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OddFunction","CreatedById":143805,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T22:15:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mastikator\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Mastikator\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf you want to recover debris then you\u0027ll need a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/86677-1-0-2-StageRecovery-Recover-Funds-from-Dropped-Stages-v1-5-6-%285-15-15%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Estage recovery mod\u003C/a\u003E, otherwise debris in the atmosphere gets deleted without chance for recovery even if it would\u0027ve (or even did) land safely.\u003Cp\u003EGenerally solid boosters are worth less than parachutes, but once you start using rockets like the mainsail then it starts to be worth it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGet the mod, its the best thing ever, and should really be stock IMO.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wakaleo","CreatedById":143502,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T00:29:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis mod seems worthwhile installing - better than throwing funds away.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
