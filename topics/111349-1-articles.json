I\u0027ve been putting parachutes on everything to try and recover some of the costs since I am early in, and some of the contracts don\u0027t make me much money, once I build a craft to do them, when you count all the parts I loose. (30,000 to test a rocket booster at 16,000 feet. Need two for balance, plus I need to get them up that high. Craft costs me 27,00. Though I did combine with another contract)\n\nI did the contract and watched as all the parts landed (mostly) safely. The main pod gets back home, and there are stages sitting all around the space center (went straight up). But I can physically see most of everything I went up with. But \u0027debris\u0027 isn\u0027t showing on the map, and even though it\u0027s all sitting \\*right on the center grounds\\* I can only recover whatever is still attached to the pod. \n\nShould I be able to recover the other stuff, or is that really not doable in this game?\n\nAgain, thanks for all your help.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-26T00:45:30Z\u0022 title=\u002206/26/2015 12:45  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SignalCorps**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mitchz95","CreatedById":82292,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T07:08:11Z","Content":"You should be able to recover anything landed on Kerbin, from either the tracking station or the space center.

My experience has been that contracts are (mostly) financially worth it, and generally don\u0027t require recovering debris for cash. I never bother with trying to recover debris, and do financially OK.\n\nOf course, it\u0027s *caveat emptor* with the contracts-- some of them are sucker deals, keep an eye on what they pay and don\u0027t accept if they\u0027re asking for something really hard and don\u0027t pay much.\n\nSo the solution here may not be a matter of \u0022how to recover debris,\u0022 but rather being more choosy about which contracts to take, and being careful about ship design to keep costs down. For example, use SRBs as much as possible-- they\u0027re dirt cheap, it doesn\u0027t matter much if you don\u0027t recover them.\n\nOne thing that took me a while to catch on to: You know how the contract advertises an \u0022advance\u0022 and a \u0022completion\u0022 amount for funds? When I first started playing career, I just assumed that the advance was taken out of the total reward (i.e. if a contract has a $20K advance and a $100K reward, I just assumed that I\u0027d get $20K up front and then $80K when I finish.) It turns out that my assumption was wrong: they add together. You get the advance right up front, free and clear, and then the reward when the contract completes. I find that the advance is nearly always enough to cover the cost of the ship I need to do the contract, with funds to spare.\n\nMaybe I\u0027m the only person to make that dumb mistake ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif), just mentioning it in case anyone else has been similarly confused."},{"CreatedByName":"Mastikator","CreatedById":135309,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T18:57:50Z","Content":"If you want to recover debris then you\u0027ll need a [stage recovery mod](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/86677-1-0-2-StageRecovery-Recover-Funds-from-Dropped-Stages-v1-5-6-%285-15-15%29), otherwise debris in the atmosphere gets deleted without chance for recovery even if it would\u0027ve (or even did) land safely.\n\nGenerally solid boosters are worth less than parachutes, but once you start using rockets like the mainsail then it starts to be worth it."},{"CreatedByName":"OddFunction","CreatedById":143805,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T22:15:02Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E If you want to recover debris then you\u0027ll need a [stage recovery mod](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/86677-1-0-2-StageRecovery-Recover-Funds-from-Dropped-Stages-v1-5-6-%285-15-15%29), otherwise debris in the atmosphere gets deleted without chance for recovery even if it would\u0027ve (or even did) land safely.\n\u003E Generally solid boosters are worth less than parachutes, but once you start using rockets like the mainsail then it starts to be worth it.\n\nThis.\n\nGet the mod, its the best thing ever, and should really be stock IMO."},{"CreatedByName":"Wakaleo","CreatedById":143502,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T00:29:22Z","Content":"This mod seems worthwhile installing - better than throwing funds away."}]}
