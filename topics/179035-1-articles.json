Jool\u0027s atmosphere is actually quite thin (hydrogen is not dense)\u00A0-- but unless you expend an enormous amount of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E to slow down first, you are going to be entering very fast. There is only one antenna that can handle high atmospheric speeds, and that\u0027s the surface-mount Communotron (the 16-S). That antenna is a direct antenna, and can\u0027t be \u0022stacked\u0022. It can\u0027t possibly communicate with Kerbin, no matter what you do, so you also have no choice except to have a relay antenna in orbit. If all you have is the RA-15, you are probably going to need a very long string of them reaching back to Kerbin. The next step up is the RA-100, which you would only need one of.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheFlyingKerman","CreatedById":182407,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-10-17T08:26:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou may use the usual HG-55 or 88-88 antenna. Just retract it when entering the atmosphere. When you reach the lower atmosphere, slow down using a parachute, then extend the antenna to transmit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat said, for transmitting science you what signal strength \u0026gt;83% so that you get the maximum 40% science bonus. So a RA-100 relay in orbit is very useful, and in addition build a huge array of RA-100 on the Kerbin side.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother tip for the mission is that you need plenty of battery, at least 2000EC, because there is little solar power at Jool orbit and none when inside the atmosphere. An \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Radio-isotope Thermo-electric Generator (a.k.a. Mars rover heating device)\u0022\u003ERTG\u003C/abbr\u003E is the recommended power source but it is still too slow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PrvDancer85","CreatedById":180954,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-10-17T10:19:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI belive antennas work inside of cargobays, but i maybe wrong\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"swjr-swis","CreatedById":152460,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-10-17T10:39:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223469618\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022179035\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221539771575\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022180954\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PrvDancer85\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n18 minutes ago, PrvDancer85 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI belive antennas work inside of cargobays, but i maybe wrong\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou are not wrong.
