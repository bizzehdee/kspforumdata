So far I\u0027ve tried multiple parts mods and pre-built copters\u00A0(Breaking Ground DLC, Airplane Plus, KAX, Cold War Aerospace) coupled with multiple autopilot mods (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E, TCA, Atmosphere Autopilot) without much luck to get things to hover (since rotors aren\u0027t recognized as thrust generators by most mods)\u00A0or fly in a relatively predictable pattern. So far, the best combination I\u0027ve found is AA with Cold War Aerospace, but it\u0027s still VERY tenuous at best. I\u0027d rather not have to get nipple-deep into scripting with kOS autopilot...at that point I\u0027ll just scrub the multiple-copter approach. But, my perfectionist side is manifesting itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyone have any success with other mods or approaches? Sorry, wasn\u0027t sure where to put this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthanks in advance!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
