Nasa really isn\u0027t \u0027vital\u0027 for our survival anymore. But I do agree that the program being governmental was a helpful push for a lot of kids and adults during 70\u0027s-90\u0027s. Yet, this is a bit of a dream like mentality for what was actually going on (as a motivator versus how American schools were/are actually run). Nasa might have been a great symbol, but it really stopped where it started in a lot of ways. Kids will look at these commercial programs just the same and say; I want to work at SpaceX, etc.etc.\n\nThat\u0027s just my view of it."},{"CreatedByName":"Jack","CreatedById":265,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-27T17:46:40Z","Content":"And then the kids watch the Apollo 13 movie.\n\n :-["},{"CreatedByName":"hpearson","CreatedById":803,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-27T20:13:01Z","Content":"\\*wipes single man tear from eye"},{"CreatedByName":"Rickenbacker","CreatedById":2349,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-28T12:48:57Z","Content":"Robert Heinlein said it best.

When you don\u0027t have much money, you tend to be really careful with what little you have. What really makes my blood boil is all the budget cuts. Surely there are other areas where money could be saved, such as defense. Yes, it\u0027s important, but the USA spends as much on its military *as the rest of the world put together*, [I shit you not](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_military_expenditures).
