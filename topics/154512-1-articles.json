I built a large, jet-propelled hydrofoil in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E. During my R\u0026amp;D, I would roll it off the launch pad and guide it into the water to test. It ended up being such an efficient hydrofoil that it actually took off from the water into the air at a certain (insane for water) speed, allowing me to fly it around. I then made the thing a high-altitude flier as well as a water-loving boat. Eventually I got my \u0022boat\u0022 to the point where I had it flaming-out in the upper atmosphere, having originally taken off from the ocean.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI eventually decided to launch the same craft from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E so I\u0027d have a convenient runway. I opened the craft file from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E into the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E and launched it. All of a sudden, it\u0027s flipping around like crazy on take-off. If I get it up in the air at all, it wobbles and twists, then ends up crashing. No matter what I do to modify the craft, I cannot not fly it. I tried using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E, MechJeb, and Atmosphere Autopilot (all of which worked from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E), to no avail.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, I returned to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, re-opened the same craft, rolled it off the rocket launch pad to the runway... and ended up taking it for yet another smooth, fast flight into the wild blue yonder.

First, get it in the water. Press Action Group 2 to deploy the fore, inboard elevons (and retract the landing gear). The elevons provide the lifting ability in the water, otherwise you\u0027ll sink at speed. All other elevons should not be locked in place so they\u0027ll provide control both on water and in the air. Only the bottom three elevons need to be locked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you get the boat up to about 30 m/sec. it should have risen up out of the water and will be slicing just over the surface with barely anything touching (as pictured). You will need to back off on the speed because it will pick up quickly. Unless, of course, you want to fly it up out of the water. When that happens, press Action Group 3 to retract the locked elevons used for water mode so you\u0027ll have full flight control in the air.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI stripped as many mod-based parts as possible from the model, including MechJeb, but I did use TweakScale to make the rudders and front landing gear larger.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe issue with flying it from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E may have something to do with the elevons reversing their directions from what I built, but I have not confirmed this. They must be reversed in order to work. Sometimes, even from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, I find the elevons locked in strange directions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-01-06T02:57:47Z\u0022 title=\u002201/06/2017 02:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 6, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by JonathanPerregaux\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-06T04:20:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHmmm.

If I were going to mess with it some more, my basic aim would go like this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou have those front and rear winglets angled down at 45 degrees (the anhedral that you already are very familiar with) -- and then you have your hydrofoil elevons at 90 degrees to that, so they are angled 45 degrees to vertical in the opposite direction. So, my basic point would be -- both of those angles are way too extreme. The elevons are fighting each other in the yaw direction; giving you large forces trying to rip your wings off sideways. Additionally, I was getting very little benefit out of the rudders that I could see. I couldn\u0027t really steer the thing (in bote mode) at over 40 m/s effectively.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, I tossed all the radial air intakes, and made the rudders into aero tailfins on top of the craft. Changed out the outer pair of shock cones for circular intakes, as I said. Switched out your big landing gear in the back for a pair of medium gears (which made the thing sit level with stock wheels, which was nice). But what all that did was to clear out the entire underside of the spasebote. I also added one more small fuel tank just behind the cockpit to rebalance the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E, and moved your nacelles down one click to align your thrust vector with the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E more exactly. And, as I said, got rid of all the \u0022upper surface\u0022 elevons -- because they are not pointed in the right direction to help with pitch and roll control.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then yes, I tried adding a pair of raised dihedral wings to lift your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E up -- to help with the roll instability thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut what I was about to say is that since -- after all that messing around -- there is nothing on the bottom of the spasebote, it seemed like the next logical step would be to make your anhedral winglets be at maybe 10 degrees instead of 45. And then attach the hydrofoil elevons at 20 degrees off the winglets, so they are angled at 10 degrees to the water, instead of 45 degrees. I think doing that may help your roll problem a lot (along with adding more control surfaces and reaction wheel that is devoted to roll and pitch control).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(And if you like, I can post some of my test versions of your craft for you to look at.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-01-06T23:37:06Z\u0022 title=\u002201/06/2017 11:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 6, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by bewing\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-07T01:36:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOK, I tried out my suggestion.
