Too much of it may aggravate SAS wobble.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* Speaking of SAS wobble: stiffen your airframe. Even a perfectly-tuned SAS will freak out when presented with a flexing airframe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* Speaking of SAS tuning: PID tuners. Use \u0027em,\u00A0they work.

Set the control surface\u00A0deflections to maximum, then make use of the correlation between airspeed and dynamic pressure. Set up Dynamic Deflection to reduce deflection at low pressure but increase it at high. With enough fine tuning, you can get it so that full stick always holds your plane right at the edge of a stall, regardless of the airspeed. Great for supersonic dogfighters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* The time acceleration trick mentioned above is worthwhile. Get into the air, carefully crank up the time acceleration and observe the plane. Reinforce anything that flexes. Big Mk3 monsters are especially susceptible to time acceleration induced detonation,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* If carrying nukes, light \u0027em at 20km and shut down the oxidising rocketry as soon as your apoapsis approaches 70km. Circularise on the nuke alone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* Airbrakes make reentry much safer, much faster, and much more likely to reach KSC. With well-set airbrakes, you can (if you choose) come ripping in over the KSC mountains at high Mach, slam on the brakes and drop Stuka-style\u00A0into a landing approach.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* However, airbrakes are not necessary.

Another thing (this is one of the obvious things), is to try and make sure your landing gear are near to the CoM/CoL, doing so will make it easier to lift off the landing strip before you reach the end. Of course, at the same time you also have to make sure when taking off not to smash your engines on the runway, I do that often lol.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSome of my best planes (which again, isn\u0027t something I do often as I haven\u0027t really worked out a good purpose for them, but may try to work with them more in 1.1), I didn\u0027t even need to touch the controls to make it lift off the runway.
