That ratio made the admin building an underpowered waste if you wanted to convert something INTO funds, and overpowered if you wanted to convert something FROM funds. Now they seem to understand that Funds operate on a different scale than the other two. A single Fund point is really only worth about 1/1000th of a science point, and they seem to have changed the scales of the strategies accordingly."},{"CreatedByName":"EtherDragon","CreatedById":82405,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T19:33:33Z","Content":"Awesome! Can\u0027t wait. There were so very many strategies that were completely useless in 0.90 because by the time I had enough of the currency to kick them off, I didn\u0027t need them."}]}
