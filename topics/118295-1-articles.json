I\u0027ve been building a [control panel for KSP](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/102513-My-KSP-control-panel). It\u0027s almost complete, certainly flight ready, and this weekend I\u0027ll be demoing it at the [Sydney Mini Maker Faire](http://makerfairesydney.com/). Basically that means I\u0027ll be spending two days playing Kerbal Space Program with a great big control desk with people who may or may not have seen the game before. Pretty cool right? ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nNow, to speed things up and avoid spending long periods during the event on ship-building, I would like to have a bunch of ready-to-go vessels to fly for different objectives. I\u0027m really not that great at designing ships, so I was hoping the fine folk here could help out with vessel suggestions.\n\nHere\u0027s the rules:\n\n- Stock parts only. I\u0027m installing all of the visual and sound enhancements I think I can get away with, but don\u0027t want to add any part packs. Mostly because I\u0027ve never really used any of them and don\u0027t want to have to explain them, sorry.\n- Easy to fly vessels. I don\u0027t think it\u0027s reasonable to try to explain to a newbie how to use custom action groups to switch between three different types of engines to get an SSTO to orbit. Especially when there\u0027s a big red stage button longing to be whacked. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) I\u0027m looking for well-balanced, stable ascent vehicles. Landers that are easily managed and can cope with mild abuse. That sort of thing.\n- Stuff that looks good. This is where all of my designs fail miserably. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nHere are the kinds of missions I was thinking could be easily run, and what I\u0027ve dug up so far to do them with, looking on this forum and KerbalX:\n\n- A Kerbin orbit space station. Something that vessels launching from Kerbin can dock with. I\u0027ve pretty much settled on using [this ISS replica](http://kerbalx.com/Scathalh/Kerbin-Space-Station). But open to other suggestions!\n- An LKO vehicle. Something that can launch from KSC and dock with the orbital station at around 500km orbit. I was thinking about just using the Kerbal X modified with a docking port on the nose, but am a little bit nervous about the asparagus staging it uses. Alternatives welcome!\n- A Mun lander and return mission. I was thinking about using the [Apollo 12](http://kerbalx.com/The_ShadowZone/Apollo-12) vessel for a realistic Kerbin moon landing. I\u0027d be very interested to see any other vessels for a simple moon landing and return.\n- A moon base, probably Minmus. I\u0027d like to assemble a base on Minmus using Rune\u0027s [base-in-a-box](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/130016-Base-In-A-Box-Expandable-modular-surface-base%21/page2). Just a small base that we can aim landings at.\n- A dedicated lander. I\u0027d be keen to get links to descent and lander subassemblies. Stuff that I can hyperedit to a moon or any of the other bodies and have folk try to land. Even upper stages that can manage a landing, then lift off and return to Kerbin would be fun. I haven\u0027t yet found any good vessels for this that are guaranteed 1.0.4 compatible.\n\nThat\u0027s all I can think of. I\u0027d love to hear about any other ideas people might have for this sort of demo, as well as links to ready to fly craft for it."},{"CreatedByName":"Endersmens","CreatedById":80723,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-12T14:09:53Z","Content":"Any chance you want a few atmospheric planes?\n\nCause that\u0027s where I specialize. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Jabbernewt","CreatedById":83880,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-12T14:11:53Z","Content":"How do a series of \u0022first flight\u0022 vessels and a small station sound?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-12T14:27:20Z\u0022 title=\u002208/12/2015 02:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jabbernewt**"},{"CreatedByName":"Azimech","CreatedById":50750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-12T14:27:47Z","Content":"Check these:\n\n[http://kerbalx.com/Azimech/77I---Station-Core-Mk1](http://kerbalx.com/Azimech/77I---Station-Core-Mk1)\n\n[http://kerbalx.com/Azimech/77I---Science-Module-Mk1](http://kerbalx.com/Azimech/77I---Science-Module-Mk1)\n\n[http://kerbalx.com/Azimech/77I---Crew-Module-Mk1](http://kerbalx.com/Azimech/77I---Crew-Module-Mk1)\n\nYou can build a nice small station out of them."},{"CreatedByName":"Yukon0009","CreatedById":109376,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-12T14:37:09Z","Content":"Slapped a lander together based off you requirements.\n\nOver 2k DV, high TWR, full RCS system.\n\nDownload coming after I do some more testing.\n\n[![screenshot2351_zps8o6mg4xe.png](http://i1383.photobucket.com/albums/ah315/Yukon0009/screenshot2351_zps8o6mg4xe.png)](http://s1383.photobucket.com/user/Yukon0009/media/screenshot2351_zps8o6mg4xe.png.html)"},{"CreatedByName":"Jabbernewt","CreatedById":83880,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T01:00:25Z","Content":"I\u0027ve got two crafts, one for Mun landing, another for LKO crew transfer. Let\u0027s start with the Muke (mun nuke).\n\nThe Muke, as the name suggests, is a nuclear craft. In standard configuration it has 410 liquid fuel units, 240 monoprop. units, and an RTG in the back.\n\nI\u0027ve also created a set of external fuel tanks, one for either side of the vehicle. This adds 320 extra fuel units, 160 monoprop. units, and solar panels. The pods would have ion engines as well, but the Kracken eats the battery pack that the engines and fuel are connected to when I dock the pods onto the Muke. \n\n![4pwr6vh.png](http://i.imgur.com/4pwr6vh.png)\n\n![lrBO0S0.png](http://i.imgur.com/lrBO0S0.png)\n\n![gtt4qGJ.png](http://i.imgur.com/gtt4qGJ.png)\n\n![4agElWy.png](http://i.imgur.com/4agElWy.png)\n\n![np7E8FJ.png](http://i.imgur.com/np7E8FJ.png)\n\nThe Muke by itself will get you into Munar orbit, and that\u0027s about it. With the fuel pods, you can land on the Mun, and prolly make it back into orbit. I would\u0027ve myself, but a bug messed up my orbit (straight into the surface of the Mun). That said, I was able to change my trajectory to enable orbit, and then landing. With the fuel used in the corrections I could\u0027ve gotten back into orbit, but not much further than that.\n\nSecond craft is just a plain LKO crew transfer. Flying is fun- the main booster stage has fuel tanks that fall away soyuz style, and there is a full abort system. Notes for flying are in the craft description.\n\n![APdwMn1.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/APdwMn1.jpg)\n\n![p7T93r8.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/p7T93r8.jpg)\n\n![l6ulS3r.png](http://i.imgur.com/l6ulS3r.png)\n\n![PSN4nLJ.png](http://i.imgur.com/PSN4nLJ.png)\n\n![MNUZJNu.png](http://i.imgur.com/MNUZJNu.png)\n\nIf these sound good, let me know, and I\u0027ll rustle up a download for you (and anyone else, for that matter).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-13T02:39:57Z\u0022 title=\u002208/13/2015 02:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jabbernewt**"},{"CreatedByName":"stibbons","CreatedById":57865,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T02:42:12Z","Content":"Woo, lots of awesome responses.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Any chance you want a few atmospheric planes?\n\u003E Cause that\u0027s where I specialize. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nI don\u0027t fly planes at all, so not sure how much of a run they\u0027d get.

Because of the sheer number of folk wanting a turn, I ended up sticking to KSC launches, some of them achieving a stable orbit, some suborbital, and quite a few going straight up until they escaped Kerbin.
