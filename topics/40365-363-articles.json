You said you launched a second ship and it worked fine- did you try undocking and redocking from that second ship? If that\u0027s what consistently causes the problem, we might be closer to narrowing down what\u0027s going on. You\u0027ve already tried a lot of the \u0022have you tried turning it off and on again?\u0022-style potential fixes, so I can\u0027t give much more advice, sadly.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-07T00:25:42Z\u0022 title=\u002205/07/2014 12:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 7, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by ArcFurnace\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jffr363","CreatedById":110264,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-07T00:47:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo I tried undocking the lander and still same issue, and redocking the lander didnt help either.

However, some of the numbers in the .cfg files have me stumped:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFusion reactors - for GEKKO and OMEGA, powerRequirements scales with the cube of the radius. For the more \u0027generic\u0027 2.5m and 3.75m reactors, it scales with the square of the radius. Is one of these wrong, or doesn\u0027t it matter a lot, so a number was simply chosen?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAntimatter reactors - thermalPower, resourceRate, and their upgraded counterparts scale with the cube of the radius. reactorTemp scales with approximately radius^1.22. And that\u0027s \u003Cstrong\u003Every\u003C/strong\u003E approximate. Is there some (hopefully simple) formula to follow?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFormulae would be nice for fission reactors and antimatter initiated reactors too. log(26.666)/log(2) might be close enough for thermal power, but just putting in those numbers and not knowing why feels horrible.
