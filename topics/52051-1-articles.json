Should there be a mod, you will be informed of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProject Realife WILL contain the .craft files for replicas of craft still in operation today. Sorry, Apollo fans, but the Saturn V ain\u0027t on there. But on the other hand, things such as the Delta IV, the Atlas, the Proton, the Soyuz, and the Shengzou will be in the VAB, ready for you to use. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWill Project Realife Document ended Missions?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs long as the spacecraft still exists, we will. The Spirit rover will be on Duna, with a busted well and no battery, Venera will be on Eve with a broken shield and smashed panels, and such. They will be useless debris, sure, but adds to the feeling of danger and realism in the space program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat Agencies Will You Document?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll agencies, from NASA\u0027s MAVEN to CNSA\u0027s Tiagong-1, will be featured in the \u0022Real Life\u0022 persistance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWill You Document Future Flights?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am uncertain.

But flights that have yet to reach their destination \u003Cem\u003Ewill be\u003C/em\u003E shown, on their current trajectory-if possible. This means India\u0027s Mars Orbiter will be in it\u0027s transfer to Duna, and MAVEN will be sitting on the launchpad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhen will it be finished\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUncertain.
