In the planet information panel in the tracking station I noticed the following problems/errors:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nEccentricity is a unitless quantity, it shouldn\u0027t have units of degrees\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSideral period should have units of time, not m/s (I\u0027m assuming the currently displayed number is actually in seconds but marked with the wrong units)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMass, circumference, semi-major axis, etc should really be expressed in larger units (like km instead of m) or with scientific notation. It\u0027s really difficult to compare \u0022124032971708644000 kg\u0022 and \u00224233073194324100000 kg\u0022 at first glance for example, and I think one of the cool things KSP teaches is how wildly different the masses and gravity of planets are which could be improved here.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAdd planet radius/diameter instead of just circumference (maybe have a little toggle button between them)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWAY too many significant figures everywhere, better behavior might be to round to 3-4 sig figs with scientific notation then allow us to mouse over values and get the full precision written out without scientific notation. It\u0027s very wall-of-text right now\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nJust a fun idea, but maybe add some kerbal-ey units like how many \u0022Jebs\u0022 a planet weighs or something if we mouse over data\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain I realize these aren\u0027t critical bugs but I just thought I\u0027d comment. Thank you for your continued communication about patch development!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wasml","CreatedById":120438,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-04-18T02:36:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo add to the list above:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli style=\u0022margin-left:40px;\u0022\u003E\nPlanet circumference has a few more digits than the orbit SMA.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli style=\u0022margin-left:40px;\u0022\u003E\nKerbin gravity is 1 m/s - should be ~9.81\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli style=\u0022margin-left:40px;\u0022\u003E\nKerbin atmosphere is not 1 atm\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capran","CreatedById":65692,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-04-20T18:09:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just noticed those figures myself.
