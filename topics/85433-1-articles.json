Personally, I would like to create a documentary, and with my overpowering love for KSP, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m considering KSP as the focus for this documentary. Obviously if I were to go ahead with this I would want to do the best job possible, hopefully getting interviews with the developers, players, the media team and so on. It would cover the early days of KSP all the way through to whats going on now and the hopes for its future. (Please note that this isn\u0027t everything that would go into the documentary, Its just what i can think of right now)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can imagine, I don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t want to devote a year of work to this project if nobody is really interested, so I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d like to know if you guys would be interested in a documentary of this nature!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou might have noticed that the poll at the top mentions moneyz. Obviously if I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m going to be filming this \u0026amp; going off to interviews with a crew etc., money is going to need to come from somewhere. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m going to put in a large portion of it myself (its my project and I feel obligated) but that almost certainly wont be enough. To solve this issue I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m considering turning to a crowd funding platform.
