I have never had this issue before, and I am very confused as to how to fix it. The zip file I am trying to upload is 0.5 G. All the fields are filled out, so I\u0027m assuming I have to reduce the file size. Can anyone offer me advice on what to do?\u00A0 Thanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: RESOLVED\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-04-15T22:08:32Z\u0022 title=\u002204/15/2022 10:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EApril 15, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by wpetula\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ERESOLVED\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
