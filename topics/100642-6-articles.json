Parts than can change their size or shape just give the player more options to design their craft without blasting their machine with additional memory-reducing parts.\n\nThat\u0027s not quite procedural. A player can make any shape. Then, a way for the computer to define that shape can be made.

But the majority are similar to each other.\n\nKSP is about putting parts together. It\u0027s a basic mechanic. And if a changeable shape fuel tank is introduced, then that building mechanic will change. You might as well make the game all about building a payload, and then when you click \u0022Launch\u0022 it asks you what kind of rocket you want. Parts that can change shape are not like a delta-V readout, which doesn\u0027t do much in the long run other than let you know a rocket\u0027s capabilities. Variable shape parts would heavily change the puzzle aspect, because then I don\u0027t need to do much thinking anymore if they\u0027re in the game.

You could, in some other way, specify each thing on the object (the four sections, ten subdivisions thing). You\u0027re describing variable geometry fuel tanks/wings/fairings/whatever else.\n\n\u0022Procedural\u0022 doesn\u0027t really have a solid definition, but given that apparently tanks in the Procedural Parts mod work like \u0022set diameter and length and texture, and the tank adjusts to fit that,\u0022 and no one in the community has a problem calling those tanks \u0022procedural,\u0022 I think it\u0027s a bit pointless to try to maintain that \u0022telling it the appropriate diameter and height\u0022 isn\u0027t procedural. As far as I can tell, the term \u0022procedural\u0022 in the community basically means \u0022the part doesn\u0027t have a fixed size and shape, but rather dynamically generates the model and textures based on parameters that can be changed fairly easily\u0022 -- that is, the *model* (and textures) is procedural, and isn\u0027t limited to what someone made in Blender or other external software. Basically, the part model used ingame is dynamically generated by a subroutine (or \u0022procedure\u0022) at runtime, rather than set beforehand in 3D modeling software and just loaded straight into the game. And by that standard, \u0022sculpt this fairing that is then processed as one part and only shows as one part in the VAB menu\u0022 is certainly procedural. I think you\u0027re getting too hung up on Procedural Fairings and the way that does things, but *even then* you can tweak the shape of a PF fairing within certain parameters, and don\u0027t have to accept the automagically generated one.\n\nI admit the definition is sorta fuzzy; from the dev\u0027s point of view, something can be procedural and yet hardcoded, if it\u0027s easy to change (e.g. if one number controls terrain on Kerbin, it\u0027s procedural from their point of view but not from ours, because we can\u0027t change that number).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Different result as in it\u0027s not the same as another result for a different seed.\n\nI\u0027m really confused what you mean here. If you supply different input to a PP or PF part, they produce different models. If you stick a different payload in a PF fairing, it defaults to a different model (yes, \u0022thing contained in this part\u0022 is *absolutely* an input in the same way that \u0022thing set by tweakables\u0022 is one; PF adjusts to both, proc tanks to the latter, these fairing seem to do input slightly differently, but all of them have some sort of input on the basis of which they create a model). \u0022Seed\u0022 is not a concept that has anything to do with procedures; a procedure has *parameters* or *arguments* or *inputs*, but \u0022seed\u0022 is a term only applicable to a PRNG (or, I suppose, a plant). From that point of view, \u0022procedural\u0022 would be like \u0022procedural level generation\u0022 in other games, in which it\u0027s a shorthand for \u0022pseudorandom levels instead of handmade ones.\u0022 But that\u0027s not the only use of the term; PF and PP don\u0027t have \u0022seeds,\u0022 because the point isn\u0027t to be pseudorandom. I accept that you didn\u0027t introduce the term here AFAIK, but it\u0027s still not a term one would typically use. Incidentally, the real term used to describe a function that produces different output when given different input is \u0022not constant.\u0022\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Sort of. It proves that those people don\u0027t build like you.\n\n...which was kinda his point? There are many people who post on the \u0022What have you done\u0022 thread. The fact that they don\u0027t tend to build like him establishes that his way of building is not the only way. I\u0027d wager that many build \\*very\\* differently from him, since he plays RSS\u002BFAR\u002BRealFuels\u002Bother realism stuff AFAIK, and so his rockets are presumably mostly less ridiculous-looking than what stock players can easily do. I don\u0027t see how this in any way goes against \u0022different people do stuff differently.\u0022\n\n\u003E \n\u003E That will hardly change my style of play. I already account for all those things. Heck, it\u0027ll be fun re-learning the atmospheric physics of KSP.\n\nBut there are plenty of people whose style it \\*will\\* change. So is the rule \u0022when Bill Phil already accounts for it you can add it, but otherwise no\u0022? You account for those things, but players who don\u0027t know how real rockets work likely have not a clue that engine thrust is lower at sea level than in orbit (they didn\u0027t think fuel consumption changed either, but since KSP so far changes fuel consumption they assume that\u0027s how it works), or that reentering in a steep orbit from Minmus is going to be fatal for their astronauts. *Columbia* probably helped public awareness of this, but how many regular players do you think act like you have to stick heat shields on everything when the 3-person capsule doesn\u0027t even \\*have\\* something that works like a heat shield? Given that currently the obvious way to recover, say, a Goo canister from orbit is no better than \u0022slap it on the side of a rocket and have it exposed to the full force on the atmosphere on reentry,\u0022 and there\u0027s no issue with doing that in stock, do you think that adding reentry heat will not change people\u0027s style of play? I mean, that makes the whole concept of recovering experiments very, very different, with a lot more consideration to the cross-section of the rocket.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I never used PROCEDURAL parts because they don\u0027t really exist. They\u0027re not actually procedural.\n\nAnd here\u0027s the confusion. When everyone else on the entire forum uses the term \u0022procedural\u0022 one way, and you use it another way, then discussions are actually pretty much pointless -- you aren\u0027t even talking about the same thing as everyone else. You\u0027re hung up on \u0022procedural\u0022 meaning \u0022procedural generation based on pseudorandom seed,\u0022 but that\u0027s *not* what the term means at all: all it means is that something is algorithmically generated based on input. Randomness is utterly irrelevant, and insisting on a definition of \u0022procedural\u0022 that no one else uses means you should probably reconsider if you want to discuss things.\n\n\u003E There is quite a large difference between changing the atmospheric conditions or adding re-entry heat and \u0022procedural\u0022 parts. One affects flight, the other construction. A construction change would be harder to navigate around, so to say.\n\nHow do you figure? We\u0027ve already had major changes in construction -- tweakables and gizmos (or do you think \u0022you can offset a part in any direction, including to clip it inside something else\u0022 *isn\u0027t* a major change?) And it doesn\u0027t seem like this is even going to be too far a departure from current building -- you still control the shape of the fairing, just without having to use tons of individual parts and the standard generic VAB interface (you get a more optimized for the task one)."},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-26T09:05:58Z","Content":"If the mesh is loaded by the game, it\u0027s not procedural.
