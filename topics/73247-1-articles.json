If you want to add a resource in a mod that is compatible with other mods, it has to use the same \u0027name=\u0027 for the resource. Often this is not a real problem, but sometimes you just want it to have a different name (Kerosene instead of the stock Liquid Fuel for example). Adding something like \u0027title=\u0027 would allow modders to set different names for our resources while still maintaining mod compatibility.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kegereneku","CreatedById":66154,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-25T22:23:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother modder to give an opinion on this ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf this thread rating is any indication it\u0027s worth to keep it on the first page a little longer.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Javster","CreatedById":74613,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-26T18:33:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a good idea.
