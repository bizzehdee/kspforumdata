One thing I like watching during rocket launches is the fuel and electrical umbilical cords shoot off as the rocket flies past the tower. I guess some people don\u0027t ever notice this but I think it\u0027s something cool to look at upon the second or third replay of the rocket just taking off. I don\u0027t know, but I think its pretty amazing to have a rocket off the ground and there\u0027s still things attached to it until the very last second.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptRobau","CreatedById":41695,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-21T09:50:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFASA has launch clamps that work like that I have to say they always make the launch look better.
