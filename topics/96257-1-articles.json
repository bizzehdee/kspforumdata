Try moving all of your savegames out and starting a new game. If that all functions correctly, exit out and try to resume the game. If that works, then you can start moving save files back one or a few at a time. When clicking on \u0022Resume\u0022 stops bring up the game selection screen, then you have narrowed down the broken save.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf that doesn\u0027t work, then post a log file so we can have a look. Usually if you can start a new game, then it messes up next time, you might have it installed to some place like Program Files or the Desktop. Windows can mess up KSP in those locations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDirections on where to find and how to upload log files can be found here: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92230-%21%21%21-PLEASE-READ-BEFORE-POSTING-%21%21%21-Stock-Support-Bug-Reporting-Guide\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92230-%21%21%21-PLEASE-READ-BEFORE-POSTING-%21%21%21-Stock-Support-Bug-Reporting-Guide\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~Claw\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
