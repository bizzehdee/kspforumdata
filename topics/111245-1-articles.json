However my craft doesn\u0027t make orbit and while I technically know that more fuel for my rocket thruster attached to it would eventually lead for it to orbit it would also be wrong for me to design it that way, because it would go more towards rocket than to spaceplane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I try different stuff, more turbo engines, more wings, less wings, more intakes and switching it up, but the results stay the same and I have no clue as to where to begin to push the craft in the right direction and if I don\u0027t know that (since obviously how am I supposed to know what I am really doing I don\u0027t have a spaceplane degree after all) I can\u0027t finish the plane.

The TurboJet thrust is pretty insane and gives a lot of push before rocket engines are ignited. That said, i allways refuel at LKO and the planes i build aren\u0027t too heavy and barely have wings. But it seems strange that most people go higher up and pitch the plane up at a certain point (which i never do).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my mind, an LKO SSTO needs to be easy to control during acent, not overly burdened with fuel and engines, be stable during re-entry and easy to land. Mass and drag are the enemy as are control surfaces. They should be placed further back. Being able to takeoff the runway is a bonus but there\u0027s nothing really wrong with gliding off the runway then pulling up. I\u0027ve made too many failures to count and i\u0027d advise building the thing as simple as humanly possible. Better to realise you\u0027ll need a tiny bit more grunt to achieve a stable orbit, then to carry too much mass from the beginning and never realise it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEngines that are great in my experience: TurboJet, Aerospike, T-30, radially attached Twitch pairs and 909s. Thuds are not so good, T-45 is a bit wimpy in athmosphere compared to T-30 and features gimbals which can do more harm than good. I don\u0027t use Nukes because my planes don\u0027t fly very far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWings are allways a problem. Best to use them to get the center of lift where it needs to be. Control surfaces should be close enough to the center of mass to exert control over it, yet at the same time they should never bee too far up front because they tend to cause the same problems fins do when placed too high up on rockets. For that reason placing the CoM as far back as possible is helpfull. Placing tanks that drain and change mass and other heavier bits (cockpits and things) that don\u0027t goes a long way towards making a plane a good one. If the CoM moves too much during flight, unexpected things can happen and you cannot monitor it during flight. A general rule is to place the CoL behind the CoM so that both markers touch in the SPH. An empty plane can fly and land well enough if the CoM moves further forward as tanks empty. If it moves back, the plane is in trouble.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s pretty much a constant challenge. It\u0027s probably easier to herd cats than to create SSTOs... Best give it a single, specific purpose (rescuing kerbals from LKO is a good one) and use only the bare essentials for the initial build. Then as things go wrong or you discover you need more stuff on the plane, modify, check where your centers of frustration are, occasionally rebuild and keep going until ragequit or succes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EResist the temptation to overbuild.

KerikBalm has suggested correctly that loses to drag are much higher due to higher top airspeed in athmosphere with jets \u002B rockets burning. Shedding mass wasn\u0027t enough to offset this higher drag. When activating at peak TurboJet thrust, the jets cut out one Km lower (23.8km vs 24.8) and the difference in airspeed at this point was 1416 vs. 1356 m/s. Though slightly faster, the less efficient approach used up more LFO overall. Both craft were piloted to a 72-80 orbit using an identical plane.

I don\u0027t care how efficient its engines are... its not going to lift off an achieve orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELikewise, when you need to raise your apopasis by ~20km, and your horizontal speed by ~1,000 m/s.. a tiny LV-1 is not going to cut it, evne if it is lighter and has a higher Isp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever... that is a pretty extreme difference.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe LV-T30 vs LV-T 45 is a 0.25 ton difference, and a 15 kN difference... There are marginal cases where the LV-T30 is better than the LV-T45... but *generally speaking*, the 45 will do better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your SSTO is getting a bit too big for 1x LV-T45 to push it into orbit, but you don\u0027t want to add another attachment node (and associated drag and weight), switching to 1x LV-T30 may be a good idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E If the T-45 can get the job done carrying less fuel then the anwser is no i guess.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGenerally, yes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssuming payload \u002B fuel mass makes engine mass negligible... a LV-T45 will achieve a dV of 320 m/s for the same amount of fuel that a LV-T30 uses to achieve a dV of 300 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBut if they\u0027re close to equal would the T-30 not provide a stronger push into orbit? I mean if it gets a higher Ap or raises it faster, then whatever it loses during circularisation is what the T-45 loses during ascent, so they come close.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the LV-T45 is really struggling to get a payload to orbit, it will start to lose a lot due to excessive gravity and aerodynamic drag, and a LV-T30 would be better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis has not been the case for most of my designs, and I go even 1 step further, and switch a LV-T45 for an even lower thrust Aerospike (with an eve higher Isp).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGoing all the way to Nukes though... is a bad idea... the same with LV-909s I think.... then the thrust is really too weak.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the \u0022stronger push to orbit\u0022... that is valuable, and in some of my designs I use rapiers in closed cycle (which aren\u0027t that great) to intially raise my apoapsis higher, and then circularize with a more efficient engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor smaller designs... I just go with pure rapiers.... adding another node when you only have 2-3 engine attachment nodes will significantly increase drag...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EEsp since they will be almost equal in Isp during a portion of the ascent.
