Ladies and Manleys, straight from the All-Kerbin Makehappy Psychiatric Facility... It\u0027s Kerb Kerman!**\n\n**Kerb**: Thank you, Bob. It\u0027s great to be back! I am so happy to see your... well, I can\u0027t see your face. You\u0027re behind the camera. All I see are your hands... so great to see your hands again, Bob. \n\n**Back atcha, Boss.**\n\n**Kerb**: Thanks... I think. Pointing face at camera-time! Hello everyone! I\u0027m so glad to pretend that I\u0027m seeing you! I know it\u0027s been a whole year since we last saw each other. So much has happened in that time! The KKS Studio utterly destroyed! An evil dictator overthrown! A new government established!\n\n**And your stay at the psychiatric hos-**\n\n**Kerb**:ANYWAYS! I am happy to report that after a generous grant from the Kerbal Republic of Better Than The Last Guy and a case of Tekuila we bribed Oggy with, our studio is now back in working order and no-longer home to a nest of radioactive squids.\n\n**Dr. Thomble:**: Is this really a good idea?\n\n**Kerb**: With me today is Dr. Thomble Kerman, totally because we wanted him on the show and not because it was a condition of my release! \n\n**Dr. Thomble:**: Kerb...\n\n**Kerb**: Now, Dr. Thomble, since you\u0027re the only one I\u0027m allowed to be near at the moment, why don\u0027t you tell our viewers a little about what\u0027s happened since our last broadcast.\n\n**Dr. Thomble:**: Alright, Kerb. I\u0027m going to use the clicker now. I\u0027m going to press the button to make a picture come up. How do you feel about that?\n\n**Kerb**: Fine. Yup. Totally fine. No urges to take you down in a flying tackle and tear it out of your tiny, tiny hands. Nope.. none at all.\n\n**Dr. Thomble:**: Good. \\*Sigh\\* Well, of course we have this amazing picture of the Great Xackylvanian Monument of How Awesome I Am being destroyed in the aftermath of High Lord Emperor Xacktar\u0027s fall.\n\n![DBB372DD8972E1A137C1E6D28132FC6A157B051B](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/693902535299243128/DBB372DD8972E1A137C1E6D28132FC6A157B051B/)\n\n**Kerb**: Well, he didn\u0027t really fall.\n\n**Dr. Thomble:**: Pardon?\n\n**Kerb**: It was more like everything fell on him. You know, more a SQUISH-ing type deal, only with a lot of fire. Jeb was there too!\n\n**Dr. Thomble:**: It\u0027s a figure of speech, Kerb.\n\n**Kerb**: No, I don\u0027t think so. He WAS giving a speech, but he definitely didn\u0027t have any figure after that rocket landed on him. It was more like a pud-\n\n**Dr. Thomble:**: Kerb! Stay focused.\n\n**Kerb**: Right! So... evil statue head popped right off, just like in the studio when-\n\n**Dr. Thomble:**: KERB!\n\n**Kerb**: Fiiiiine. So, Dr. Kerbal-who-doesn\u0027t-like-fun, what happened next. \n\n**Dr. Thomble:**: Well, to be honest, there was a lot of \\*ahem\\* \u0027celebration\u0027 over the following weeks.\n\n**Kerb**: I stole half a Mun buggy!\n\n**I raided the Emergency Snack Storage Station.**\n\n**Dr. Thomble:**: \\*sigh\\* How wonderful for you both. ...What would you even do with half a Mun buggy?\n\n**Kerb**: Oh, I had Oggy weld it to my half of a fuel truck.\n\n**Dr. Thomble:**: ...\n\n**Kerb**: There\u0027s a picture of it. If you let me have my clicker for a second. Just a second.\n\n**Dr. Thomble:**: No.\n\n**Kerb**: C\u0027mon. I just want to press it once. Just one press... one click...\n\n**Dr. Thomble:**: NO!\n\n![7F1A5980F99E470C1C09F983F07515A76476AA24](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/693902535299323579/7F1A5980F99E470C1C09F983F07515A76476AA24/)\n\n**Kerb**: Oh yeah. She is beautiful.\n\n**Dr. Thomble:**: That... I... Where did you get half of a fuel truck? No, wait. I don\u0027t want to know. I just don\u0027t.\n\n**Kerb**: It\u0027s a great story. You see, it was right after the failed launch that sent that thruster assembly right into the fuel tanks by the space plane hanger. You remember that? It was the one two weeks before the splat of Lord Xacktar, not the one that detonated the solid fuel depository, though. It was great, Oggy came to me with-\n\n**Dr. Thomble:**: ENOUGH! No. I said no, Kerb. Bad Kerb! I think someone needs a time out.\n\n**Kerb**: Aww. \n\n**We\u0027ll be right back after this tearful rendition of \u0027Woohoo, The Mean Guy is Dead!\u0027 Stay tuned!**\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n**We now return you to the host who\u0027s not just crazy, he\u0027s crazy for you! It\u0027s Kerb Kerman!**\n\n**Kerb**: Thank you, Bob. You know, I have to give a big thank you to Bob for coming back to the show after betraying the KKS, blowing up the studio...\n\n**Dr. Thomble:**: Why exactly ARE you here, Bob? You played a pivotal role in the revolution. You should be a senator.\n\n**I like it back here. It\u0027s cozy.**\n\n**Kerb**: ...having me committed. Taking my clicker away.\n\n**Dr. Thomble:**: None of that now, Kerb. Why don\u0027t we talk about something less rage-inducing, like politics. \n\n**Kerb**: Right! What\u0027s that?\n\n**Dr. Thomble:**: \\*Sigh\\* The new government? A true republic where every kerbal has a vote? Weren\u0027t you there at the signing of the Declaration of Not Wanting to Do That Again?\n\n**Kerb**: No, you locked me in the room with the bouncy walls that day.\n\n**Dr. Thomble:**: Oh, right. Well, we should have a picture. Here.\n\n![7F24BC6F24276EB066FCEF32E76658A1AB2685DA](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/693902535300947119/7F24BC6F24276EB066FCEF32E76658A1AB2685DA/)\n\n**Kerb**: I don\u0027t see any paper on the table.\n\n**Dr. Thomble:**: Well, everything is digital now, you know. I think this was taken when they were all reading the EULA for signing the declaration.\n\n**Kerb**: Did they actually read it or did they just play Auto-Candy Pop! on their phones? That\u0027s what I do when they make me sign something.\n\n**Dr. Thomble:**: I... don\u0027t know. I\u0027m a doctor. I\u0027m a very busy person who doesn\u0027t have time to read lengthy documents or pay attention to what government officials are actually doing.\n\n**Kerb**: Same here.\n\n**Me too.**\n\n**Dr. Thomble:**: You\u0027re both doctors?\n\n**Kerb**: What?\n\n**I had plenty of time to study between shows.**\n\n**Dr. Thomble:**: Perhaps we should move on with the show, Kerb.\n\n**Kerb**: Ok! Politics, Digital Declarations! Totally oblivious to what our new governement is up to! Riveting stuff. Tell us more, Doc!\n\n**Dr. Thomble:**: Right, well. As you know...ok, you probably don\u0027t... as everyone else knows, Jeb, Bill, and our friend Bob here.\n\n**Dr. Bob, actually**\n\n**Dr. Thomble:**: Right. They were all instrumental in bringing down the evil Lord Xacktar. They were honored for their bravery and ability to not get blown up or sent to space.\n\n**Kerb**: But Jeb was sent to space.\n\n**Dr. Thomble:**: That\u0027s a minor technicality. \n\n**Kerb**: And he did blow up my studio!\n\n**Dr. Thomble:**: Kerb, pay attention. You\u0027re the host of this show, you should-\n\n**Kerb**: I am! I ask questions that are pre-approved by the glorious regime of his High Lord... wait, I\u0027m not supposed to do that anymore, am I? What is my job now? \n\n**Dr. Thomble:**: Well, you ask questions, but you don\u0027t need to cover up the truth anymore.\n\n**Kerb**: Really? Wow. You wouldn\u0027t think they\u0027d just let me do that on a national broadcast. So I can talk about how I got that infection on my-\n\n**Dr. Thomble:**: Perhaps not THAT kind of truth, Kerb.\n\n**Kerb**: The creme did help, by the way. \n\n**Dr. Thomble:**: \\*Sigh\\* Let\u0027s just put another picture up.\n\n![F4A9429D65354293D1E6A17F8102C7B10E918641](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/693902535301062107/F4A9429D65354293D1E6A17F8102C7B10E918641/)\n\n**Kerb**: Lookin Good, Bob.\n\n **Thanks, Boss.** \n\n**Dr. Thomble:**: The three new heroes of the republic put together a mission to rescue all the other kerbals who have been stranded in space during the last five decades.\n\n**Kerb**: Wow! How\u0027d it go?\n\n**Dr. Thomble:**: Well...\n\n![330006B92E38D31A91642FF3F36F73EABBA03E64](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/693902535301062191/330006B92E38D31A91642FF3F36F73EABBA03E64/)\n\n**Kerb**: This is so weird.\n\n**Dr. Thomble:**: Well, not really. They were working off of a Xacktar design.\n\n**Kerb**: No, I mean... I have this sudden urge to have you arrested and tell the viewers that this was a weather balloon. \n\n**Dr. Thomble:**: It\u0027s ok, Kerb. Let it out.\n\n**Kerb**: I mean, it\u0027s obviously NOT a weather balloon. There\u0027s nothing balloon-like about it. Why would anyone believe that?\n\n **Dr. Thomble:**: Well, there was all that business with the drugged snacks...\n\n**Kerb**: That makes me hungry.\n\n **Me too.** \n\n**Kerb**: Do we still have those commercial things, Bob? \n\n **Actually, we have some new ones now.**\n\n**Kerb**: Great! We\u0027ll be right back after these blatant lies about products you don\u0027t even need!\n\n **Stay tuned for more of the Kerb Kerman show!**\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n **Welcome back to the show where history comes back from the dead! It\u0027s the Kerb Kerman Show!**\n\n**Kerb**: Thank you, Bob. It\u0027s great to be back, everyone. I feel so stable and not-at-all insane anymore. \n\n**Dr. Thomble:**: I wish I could believe that.\n\n**Kerb**: There\u0027s something that\u0027s been bothering me.\n\n**Dr. Thomble:**: Just one thing?\n\n**Kerb**: Why do we still have a space program? As a well-loved and respected celebrity, I can say that I bribed, cheated and lied my way out of ever having to be sent on a mission to space because it was scary and I don\u0027t wanna. So why are we still building rockets?\n\n**Dr. Thomble:**: I\u0027m surprised, Kerb.\n\n**Kerb**: Oh?\n\n**Dr. Thomble:**: That actually is a good question. Here, have a cookie.\n\n**Kerb**: Yay!\n\n**Dr. Thomble:**: There are a couple of reasons, the main one being that 96% of our remaining population works for the space program, so when they voted to shut it down everyone was afraid of losing thier jobs. \n\n**Kerb**: Why didn\u0027t they want to make cookies for a living?\n\n**Dr. Thomble:**: All foodstuffs, construction and maintenance is automated by robot kerbals, you should know this, Kerb. Remember when they tried to replace you with a robot show host?\n\n**Kerb**: I poured juice on him and he caught on fire.\n\n**Dr. Thomble:**: There\u0027s also the matter of the hundreds of kerbals stranded inside capsules, space stations, and ships crashed on other planets. Here, I have another picture.\n\n![E23D1FCEC8D22AD0055A3D2F8D70F270A543DFFF](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/693902535301240340/E23D1FCEC8D22AD0055A3D2F8D70F270A543DFFF/)\n\n**Dr. Thomble:**: This is Wiltop Kerman. He\u0027s been on Duna for forty-six years. \n\n**Kerb**: I bet he\u0027s hungry.\n\n**Dr. Thomble:**: We can\u0027t just leave him there. What kind of horrible person would leave kerbals stranded all over the solar system?\n\n![B2C9EC8EAAEBA3AC85E81E30F3DA6797FCBC85E2](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/693902535301263569/B2C9EC8EAAEBA3AC85E81E30F3DA6797FCBC85E2/)\n\n**Kerb**: Alright, enough staring at the audience. \n\n**Dr. Thomble:**: The point is, we have to rescue our fellow kerbals! \n\n**Kerb**: So who is in charge of the space program now?\n\n**Dr. Thomble:**: Ah, well...\n\n**Kerb**: What?\n\n**Dr. Thomble:**: Well, there was a vote. We vote now, you know. All about the popular vote... yeah.\n\n**Kerb**: Bob, can you tell me who\u0027s in charge now?\n\n**Oggy won by a landslide.**\n\n**Kerb**: Ooooohhh.\n\n**Dr. Thomble:**: He *is* popular, I will give him that. I just worry about the future...\n\n**Kerb**: Well, Doc, you must admit that Oggy is the best rocket designer we have.\n\n**Dr. Thomble:**: Sadly, this is true. I just doubt the effectiveness of his \u0027administration\u0027 style.\n\n**Hey Kerb, you know that water tower out by the fuel tanks?**\n\n**Kerb**: Yeah?\n\n **It\u0027s full of whiskey now.** \n\n**Kerb**: Oooooh.\n\n**Dr. Thomble:**: He also installed a swimming pool and spends most of the budget on weekly beach parties.\n\n![A64854DDE5D7DFAEF54457642CD168EA6EB43940](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/693902535301360923/A64854DDE5D7DFAEF54457642CD168EA6EB43940/)\n\n**Kerb**: That looks fun! Can I go?\n\n**Dr. Thomble:**: I\u0027ll think about it.\n\n**Kerb**: That always means no.\n\n**Dr. Thomble:**:You\u0027ve done good today, Kerb. Do you think you could come back to host the show again?\n\n**Kerb**: Will I get my clicker back?\n\n**Dr. Thomble:**: I\u0027ll think about it.\n\n**Kerb**: Awwww. What do you think, Bob?\n\n**I think we\u0027re almost out of time here.** \n\n**Kerb**: Thanks, Bob. I\u0027d like to thank Dr. Thomble Kerman for letting me out of my cell and the Kerbal Republic of Better Than The Last Guy for funding the new Kerb Kerman Show!
