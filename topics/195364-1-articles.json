KSP accurately models Oberth effects (given that the game\u0027s planets are disproportionally massive), which means all the real world\u00A0math applies. I have therefore moved your question to the real science subforum, where it is more likely to be seen by the kind of people who might help.

Then pick a much bigger circular orbit to try and match. You have two good options for a transfer burn. From periapsis or from apoapsis. Both can get you to the target circular orbit with two transfer nodes (one at your original orbit, and the other at target to circularize). And it should be very easy for you to compare the amount of fuel required to complete either of these two maneuvers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"p1t1o","CreatedById":74091,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-07T11:49:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s take me a while to type out a full treatment, but here are some hints that helped me understand, maybe it\u0027ll unfold something in your head:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe key is the values of potential and kinetic energy of the ship(total), the fuel and the exhaust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd that the Oberth effect does not involve any extra energy from any source.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
