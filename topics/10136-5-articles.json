In my experience, ships with large numbers of parts cause framerate drops while the game is loading the terrain and also cause the loading of the terrain to take much longer than it should. Loading the terrain somehow conflicts with the physics and the engine doesn\\\u0027t seem able to do both at the same time without a massive performance hit. What I usually do is press Esc (or hold it down, rather, to make sure the game registers it) to open the menu. That pauses the physics and allows the game to load the terrain almost instantly. Close the menu and boom, good framerate. I find doing this is a lot faster than waiting for the framerate to smooth out on its own (which it will, eventually).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, are you planning to do other games besides KSP?
