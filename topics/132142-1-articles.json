Now I looked in my files and there is no\u00A0Squad/parts/resources/surveyscanner/surveyscanner/surveyscanner. It stops at 2 surveyscanners, since the first one is a folder and the last one is a cfg file. I have a picture here:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022j2nO4k7.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/j2nO4k7.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not sure what it is, but I haven\u0027t added any mods recently\u00A0and/or updated steam or KSP. I don\u0027t use CKAN either, so I\u0027m not sure what has gone wrong.
