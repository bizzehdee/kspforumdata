But, in many of those occasions, you have access to your phone or tablet, which doesn\u0027t solve the problem, since there is no KSP-related App that allows you to do more than look at a few stats, calculate delta-v, etc. That\u0027s why i think there should be a Official mobile app for KSP that allows you to actually do something on your saves and ships (or planes. or rockets. or Danny\u0027s apocalypse machines. You get the point).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince the full experience of KSP is incompatible with touchscreens, my\u00A0idea is to put only the ship editor and maybe the tracking station on the app. That way you can\u00A0create your Duna lander while waiting your food on the restaurant or tweak your Jool-5 mothership during a boring work\u00A0meeting (doing that could get you fired but, hey, now you have that nice badge on your signature!).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf transferring those .craft files from your phone or tablet\u00A0to your computer becomes a problem, then this app could include a small cloud with ~50MB, so that you can save your ships (or whatever) on your phone and upload them when you get home.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut that\u0027s just me.

You would have a mod running on your KSP at home that acts as server, and your phone app is the client that can send commands, all of which would\u00A0basically\u00A0rely on mechjebs autopilot to perform all your maneuvers.\u00A0The server mod would\u00A0just report back to the app\u00A0whether or not it was successful,\u00A0so you\u0027d be flying by the numbers, no visual queues during the maneuvers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example, on the app you\u0027d have a list of your saved ships, you could pick one and say launch. Your computer back home would load that ship onto the launch pad and just start mechjebs auto-launch function. After a few minutes when mechjeb has done it\u0027s magic, your app would receive a mission update that includes current info like a screenshot of your ship, delta v, orbit info, all that good stuff mechjeb already provides. Then you could select to do a transfer to the mun, so mechjeb back at your home machine just creates the node and executes like normal, after which you get a new mission status update, and so on and so forth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObviously if something goes wrong with your ship, there wouldn\u0027t be much you could do about it until you get home and actually watch what is happening, but if you have something you know works,\u00A0and assuming mechjeb auto pilot doesn\u0027t go haywire, I imagine you\u0027d be able to do quite a bit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"azander","CreatedById":147372,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-20T23:26:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUse dropbox, or any of the \u0027free\u0027 drive spaces out there and you can transfer your crafts that way.\u00A0 One less think for squad to deal with (server storage space, security, etc).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI happen to use a NFS drive to share mine between PC\u0027s.\u00A0 One almost always has the VAP or SPH open, while the other runs the missions themselves.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAz\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jeanjvs","CreatedById":147147,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-21T04:35:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222371803\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022130355\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221453332370\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022147372\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022azander\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 hours ago, azander said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUse dropbox, or any of the \u0027free\u0027 drive spaces out there and you can transfer your crafts that way.\u00A0 One less think for squad to deal with (server storage space, security, etc).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI happen to use a NFS drive to share mine between PC\u0027s.\u00A0 One almost always has the VAP or SPH open, while the other runs the missions themselves.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAz\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s probably a much better approach.
