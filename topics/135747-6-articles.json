At best, they could stabilize how much the barge rolls and pitches due to the waves while floating up and down in them and holding position to within 3 metres.The amount of up/down motion would then depend on the wave length (i.e. short wavelength waves that are freshly being churned up or are running against a current vs. long rollers left over from a distant storm.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for conditions at sea, you can view them online on \u003Ca href=\u0022http://weather.noaa.gov/fax/marshlatest.shtml\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ENOAA\u0027s marine forecast web page\u003C/a\u003E.
