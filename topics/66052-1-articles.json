The best coolant for this is water, it has insane heat capacity and a massive evaporation enthalpy. Only ones more efficient in kJ/kg of evaporation enthalpy are metals like aluminium or iron and their high boiling point makes them rather unpractical. Water dumps about 2.3MJ of heat per kg. Say our spacecraft is a sphere (to minimize surface area) of a 1m radius and isolated with 10cm of glass wool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis gives our spacecraft a surface area of about 12.5m^2. Glass wool has a heat transfer coefficient of about 0.04W/(m*deltaT). Our internal temperature is about 100C, outside is about 500C and our insulation is 10 cm. This gives us a heat influx of 2000W. So our system gains 2kJ per second. So a kg of water would keep this spacecraft alive for about 1100 seconds, or about 20 minutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E20 minutes of life per kg of coolant is a pretty bad deal. Especially when you consider that spacecraft aren\u0027t that good at autonomous operation. They can\u0027t recognize what rocks are interesting to us. So even if we gave it a big tank with a few hundred liters of water it would only survive for a few days, barely enough to investigate a few nearby rocks. And that coolant is costly to put into space. The tyranny of the rocket equation ensures that you need a much larger rocket, even if your payload is only slightly heavier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll in all, Venus is just a terrible, \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eterrible\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E place.
