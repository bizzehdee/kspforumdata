However they do use Unity Wheel colliders. Which yes, they are terrible. A lot of multiwheels is coded to try and cope with the deficiencies in them. Terrible suspension isn\u0027t something I\u0027ve dealt with yet but I have noticed issues climbing hills yes. mainly the bad behavior under varying loads is what I\u0027ve worked on. Though I beleive there is something quite wrong with Terrain at the moment and how it interacts with any Unity Wheelcollider at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn a thread discussing it back in 0.20, someone said something about it being the result of \u0027Imprecision\u0027 in the terrain mesh, or something. Basically, the visible terrain doesn\u0027t match where the engine thinks the terrain is at. So you hit segments where the suspension jacks either all the way up or all the way down the entire time you\u0027re on it, regardless of how you\u0027re actually moving (it does settle if you STOP moving entirely, but any movement, no matter how small, will set it off again). I\u0027m presuming they\u0027re the same thing in opposite directions: One where the engine thinks the terrain\u0027s above the visible terrain, the other where the engine thinks it\u0027s below the visible terrain. I\u0027m really not sure which is which.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe segments that cause the suspension to compress fully (as if there were major, sustained, Positive Gs) don\u0027t cause any problems. The segments that cause the suspension to go to full extension, however, cause SEVERE problems. I think it\u0027s related to the infiniglider bug, because what seems to be happening is that the suspension goes to full extension, jams there, and then starts trying to pull the rover off the ground. Gravity keeps it from really succeeding, but you end up in a state where it acts very much like you\u0027re barely touching the ground. Wheel thrust goes to almost zero, steering ability goes to almost zero, and the wheels start exhibiting serious directional instability (they bobble around, turning you a bit to either side more or less randomly). If you\u0027re on a slope and DO manage to get any steering authority at all it\u0027s very likely to turn extremely hard and tip over. If you catch one of the \u0027Negative G\u0027 segments while you\u0027re going downhill, it\u0027s EXTREMELY likely that you\u0027ll end up tumbling down said hill, probably throwing your kerbals and pieces of your rover (starting with the wheels) all over the place, regardless of how strong you build it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe new terrain seems to have this problem much more strongly, with the \u0027bad\u0027 segments being both more common and much larger. It makes trying to drive in any kind of hilly terrain at anything above a crawl pretty much pointless, because you\u0027ll inevitably go tumbling down a hill and break the rover.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-11T00:13:05Z\u0022 title=\u002208/11/2013 12:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 11, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Tiron\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TouhouTorpedo","CreatedById":30603,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-11T02:15:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t get me wrong, I know this problem you\u0027re speaking of.

The fixed version had the PARTS in the new folder structure but the plugin in the old folder structure (Mostly, I think it had to have the plugindata inside the plugins folder like on the new structure, but I distinctly remember you still had to put it in the root plugins folder or it wouldn\u0027t work). I\u0027m pretty sure a modification to the plugin was involved, but I gather it was a quick, minor one. And it didn\u0027t work at ALL, as opposed to your multiwheels, which do.

No idea how to do it though, if I had to guess I\u0027d say combine the part.cfg files with each one in its own PART{} wrapper. Granted, it\u0027s also possible to turn steering/power on and off via a right click config option like the stock wheels, but that might require modifying the plugin.
