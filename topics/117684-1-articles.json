It\u0027s for lifting/landing payloads on the Mun. Landing legs, H-shape, the payload goes under the klaw in the middle. I integrated the two \u0022bars\u0022 into the rockets, and launched it in upside-down position, with two fuel tanks/nosecones to save the worst of drag, and to keep 2.5m parts stacked tightly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3152580/sshots/2015-07-31_00007.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222015-07-31_00007.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd these are two fuel trucks. I bit the bullet of the air drag by using a launch stage meant for 50% heavier payloads and only filling them with fuel halfway. The setup was too large for any fairing, even the largest, and even if it did fit, a fairing so wide would create more drag than all the exposed parts you see - it\u0027s not a cure-all solution, it has mass and drag too and sometimes these are worse than what you\u0027d get with exposed payload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I removed the engines by landing on the Mun at 10m/s sharp, engine down. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3152580/sshots/2015-07-31_00004.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222015-07-31_00004.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlright, here\u0027s something like you requested. This payload actually is \u0022smooth\u0022 enough that it doesn\u0027t need a fairing. The parts introduce very little drag and the fairing\u0027s mass doesn\u0027t outweigh the occlusion benefit. But it\u0027s added for a very important reason.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou see, fairings are very stiff. Like, infinitely stiff. The payload may wobble all the way out of the fairing clipping through it and breaking off, but the fairing remains perfectly vertical. That makes them awesome structural elements, especialy considering they are relatively light, can be easily discarded when no longer needed and provide the occlusion benefits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this screenshot you see the setup for strutting the payload to the fairings. The girders and the Kickbacks will be removed in a moment as the cargo is already firmly strutted. See the batteries just below the klaws - the struts on the right of the right battery and on the left of the left battery go to the fairing. They were made by attaching them first to the craft, and then \u003Cem\u003Eattempting\u003C/em\u003E to attach them to the Kickbacks - since there was the fairing in the way, they attached to the fairing instead. Instead of three wobbly towers I have one firm fairling and the three pieces of payload nicely attached to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can similarly strut things to the fairing on the outside, drawing struts to the payload, though it\u0027s a little trickier. See below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3152580/sshots/2015-07-07_00021.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222015-07-07_00021.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis setup is not optimal as the kickbacks go a little too close to the fairing - they should be angled away. The trick is not to hover the cursor anywhere close to the fairing when \u0022attaching\u0022 the ends of the struts to the Kickbacks. The fairing animation extends it as you hover over it - and unfortunately that\u0027s not just an animation. The struts would attach not to the fairing in its standard state but to the animated segments floating outside. So move that cursor away and let the fairing \u0022settle\u0022 before attaching the ends of the struts. (actually, as you watch the left strut, they are angled sharply upwards - that\u0027s because I was \u0022attaching\u0022 them to the upper ends of the Kickbacks, far enough from the fairing that it wouldn\u0027t expand.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(and in the end launch, strutting, fairing, all worked alright and the payload exploded into million pieces when detached, because the SavingKlaws were placed too close together, clipped into each other and disasembled explosively once they became separate crafts).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne more thing that took me a while when building a fairing.
