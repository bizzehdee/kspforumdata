I misread the mass for the current leader, thus ended up .050 tonnes heavier than the leader (didn\u0027t realize it until half way through the mission). A little frustrating since I could have easily been less given:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.) I brought waaaaayyyyy too much fuel. I had at least 4 tonnes too much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.) I forgot solar panels on my last stage. This forced me to keep my last lander attached, which could have been used for more landings (as it was it was just dead weight the entire trip).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMods: MechJeb (only used for checking delta v stats)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding order: Laythe, Vall, Tylo, Bop, Pol, \u003Cstrong\u003EDuna\u003C/strong\u003E (had to do something with all that extra fuel!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnique features: Separate lander for each moon, no RCS or docking ports\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor landers, I used a command chair with a small probe to provide SAS. Since the lander weight consisted mostly of fuel, I decided against a reusable lander in favor of separate ones. This eliminated any need for RCS or docking ports. I don\u0027t know if it actually saved weight overall but it was certainly easier to not have to dock after each landing. It also allowed me to fine tune the delta V of each lander for the specific landing. My Tylo lander in particular was nice - good TWR on the landing stage made the landing very easy. The ascent stage was minimal and had plenty of delta V. My Laythe lander was actually the worst. I didn\u0027t use a parachute and my lander wanted to tip over. Fortunately I happened to land on a high spot at 3500m because I didn\u0027t quite make orbit during takeoff. Jebediah had to jetpack it to make it back to the main ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith so much extra fuel I decided to land on Duna on the way back. It took me a whole bunch of quick loads to get the landing right (I landed a very tall ship that rested directly on my nuclear engine). Eventually got it though. I returned to Kerbin with over 900 delta V still in the tanks. I could easily have landed on Minmus with the right aerocapture maneuver, but I was growing tired of it at that point so I just landed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGiven how this mission went, I think a 45 tonne ship is possible.......not sure I have the patience to give it another go though. It was a good challenge though and I learned quite a bit about making efficient transfers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/I1LU2\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/I1LU2\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF0000;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Edualmaster: Congratulation for finishing the JOOL-5 mission with a 50.969 tons ship!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E Pretty nice job, especially that you went to Duna too. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really like your idea about the separate landers.

So what would you do if you were me? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main goal of this challenge is to have fun and I let refueling missions too to help those who run out of fuel. But there\u0027s a million way to do this, I couldn\u0027t think of everything in advance, and I have to draw a line somewhere which is needed to reach to be in the Hall of Fame, especially for the hardest version. Managing all the Science Modules for the different landings, and changing them on the lander, and bringing them back to Kerbin were the hardest part in Jeb\u0027s level, allowing the Lab with 0.23 made it already much more easier.
