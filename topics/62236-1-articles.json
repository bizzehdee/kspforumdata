Recently loaded the Kethane mod. Launched two sats, one on a polar orbit, and the other on an equitorial ( sorry , can\u0027t spell it) orbit, slightly inclined, with kethane scanners, thinking that both in short time would map Kerbin for kethane. Meanwhile, did a couple of Minmus and Munar missions thinking by this time, Kerbin should be totally mapped out! Not so. This was all in the same game save, but I did not realize you had to be flying that or other particular ship to effect a change! My bad, live and learn.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blizzy78","CreatedById":68543,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-05T09:31:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SpacedCowboy\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SpacedCowboy\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eequitorial ( sorry , can\u0027t spell it)\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEquatorial.
