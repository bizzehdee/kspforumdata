I was never a heavy smoker but quitting was very hard. The nicotine patch \u002B distractions worked for me. By distractions I mean: having something completely different to do when I would normally smoke, having something to hold in my fingers all the time, and lots of exercise. I also have to admit that my first attempt(s) were not entirely successful but eventually I was able to quit entirely. That was ~14 years ago, and I still think about it. I definitely would not smoke again, but I definitely remember how enjoyable it was when I did.
