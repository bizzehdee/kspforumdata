He watched the technicians doing the last minute checks on the rocket. It didn\u2019t look like exactly like a rocket. Sure it had the long narrow shape, fins at the bottom, and a pointed nose. But, the set of fins at the top broke the lines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThey add authority when she\u2019s coming back,\u201D one of the engineers had said. \u201CThey\u2019ll help her shed speed during maneuvers in the middle and lower atmosphere.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CManeuvers; more like tumbling out of control,\u201D he thought after watching from inside the simulator.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen there was the reporting name for the design series, Basket. \u201CYou package up the passengers like eggs and they get home safe,\u201D the design engineer had said. \u00A0\u201CAnd you carry eggs in a basket, right? Besides using \u2018Carton\u2019 as a name sounds like something out of a Saturday morning serial.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe watched the techs leave the ship like a receding wave. Three of them remained, anonymous in their yellow hazmat suits. Walt flipped up his helmet and sealed his suit. The three pulled a hose off the truck that had driven up. The driver sat nervously in the cab. The hose was attached to the rocket and the truck. There was a small red cloud that quickly dissipated, as a pump was turned on. He shuddered. He heard that that stuff would dissolve a kerbal to his bones, and maybe beyond.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey unhooked the hose in another small red cloud. The hose was put back on the truck and it drove off. Another truck drove up. The techs opened up the hoods of their suits. They hooked up another hose to the rocket. Walt undid the seals on his suit. The smell of kerosene began to seep in. He flipped back the hood of his suit as the techs fueled the\u00A0rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe looked towards the kerbonaut complex. An open jeep with four kerbals drove towards the launchpad. Walt frowned. The two passengers on this flight were kerbals of wealth and influence. All the kerbals slated for the several first passenger flights were. But, how many would tolerate even the short run in the jeep? These two were adventurers, the ones who told those slightly fantastic stories at parties. Discomfort was part of the adventure. Should it be? He would have to talk to Mortimer about upgrading some of the facilities.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHey Walt,\u201D one of the passengers, Calley, called as he walked over after getting out of the jeep. \u201CSee you at the Plant in an hour.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSure thing, Calley,\u201D Walt said back. The Fuel Plant was the favoured . Jebediah waved with his helmet as he walked by. He was whistling \u201CThe Air Force Song.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThere goes our pilot,\u201D Calley said. He clapped Walt on the shoulder. \u201CDon\u2019t worry. Succeed or fail, it\u2019ll be a heck of ride.\u201D He dashed off to the waiting crew.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWalt walked back to his jeep. He sat down. He rested his chin on his hands on the steering wheel; watching the last of the preparations.\u00A0He knew it would fly true. It was different having passengers. Crews knew the risk. They saw it every day. They accepted that the risk would go bad someday. Walt worried about the day it went bad with passengers along for the ride.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-02-15T14:58:34Z\u0022 title=\u002202/15/2017 02:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 15, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by steuben\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
