The effective Isp is much much higher because of the use of air as propellant. When I say air as propellant, Im not talking the ~20% O2 for an oxidizer, I mean 100% of the air as working mass.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the same energy it takes to expell 1 kg of mass at 4000 m/s, you can expell 4kg of mass at 2000 m/s for double the thrust. 16 kg of mass at 1000 m/s for 4x the thrust... High effective Isp means a much lighter mass of fuel needed, which means a much smaller first stage, and thus lower required thrust, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem is that it only works if your first stage can get to a significant fraction of orbital velocity. A pulsejet IIRC is pretty limited in terms of Mach, and its not going to get you anywhere close.... you\u0027ll still need your rocket stage to be a nearly full size rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is why air launch from modified airliners/subsonic bombers makes very little sense: the gains are so small, and you can\u0027t really build an airbreathing craft big enough to handle a large rocket payload.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn F-15 going mach 2 in a zoom climb starts to look a little more appealing as it can eliminate some of the gravity losses and you get a bit more tangential/horizontal velocity... but it still doesn\u0027t make much sense.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScramjets could in theory get to a significant fraction of orbital velocity. In thoery a scramjet going at mach 10 on hydrogen fuel could get over 5,000 Isp, or 1,200 Isp on hydrocarbon fuels. Of course in reality we\u0027re only seeing our engines get about half their HC fuel maximum, so lets say 2,000 Isp for H2, or 600 Isp for HC fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo far the fastest scramjet that I can find information about reached Mach 6 or 2042 m/s... which isn\u0027t bad, and would be super effective in KSP but still leaves ~6km/sec to go for the next stage. The first stage of the Saturn V delivered 3,550 m/s (not sure what the final speed was... ie how large the drag losses were), and the first stage was about 5/6th the mass of the entire rocket. Going from 260 seconds of specific impulse to over 2000 would decrease the mass needed by over 10 fold, and thus the thrust needed.

The effective Isp is much much higher because of the use of air as propellant. When I say air as propellant, Im not talking the ~20% O2 for an oxidizer, I mean 100% of the air as working mass.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the same energy it takes to expell 1 kg of mass at 4000 m/s, you can expell 4kg of mass at 2000 m/s for double the thrust. 16 kg of mass at 1000 m/s for 4x the thrust... High effective Isp means a much lighter mass of fuel needed, which means a much smaller first stage, and thus lower required thrust, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem is that it only works if your first stage can get to a significant fraction of orbital velocity. A pulsejet IIRC is pretty limited in terms of Mach, and its not going to get you anywhere close.... you\u0027ll still need your rocket stage to be a nearly full size rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is why air launch from modified airliners/subsonic bombers makes very little sense: the gains are so small, and you can\u0027t really build an airbreathing craft big enough to handle a large rocket payload.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn F-15 going mach 2 in a zoom climb starts to look a little more appealing as it can eliminate some of the gravity losses and you get a bit more tangential/horizontal velocity... but it still doesn\u0027t make much sense.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScramjets could in theory get to a significant fraction of orbital velocity. In thoery a scramjet going at mach 10 on hydrogen fuel could get over 5,000 Isp, or 1,200 Isp on hydrocarbon fuels. Of course in reality we\u0027re only seeing our engines get about half their HC fuel maximum, so lets say 2,000 Isp for H2, or 600 Isp for HC fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo far the fastest scramjet that I can find information about reached Mach 6 or 2042 m/s... which isn\u0027t bad, and would be super effective in KSP but still leaves ~6km/sec to go for the next stage. The first stage of the Saturn V delivered 3,550 m/s (not sure what the final speed was... ie how large the drag losses were), and the first stage was about 5/6th the mass of the entire rocket.
