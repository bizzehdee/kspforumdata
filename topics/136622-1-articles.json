New to the forums and dabbled in ksp for awhile now. Looking to really get into it now. What I\u0027ve managed to do so far is finally make a plane that flies (albeit with SAS on still). I\u0027ve managed to also orbit the mun and launch a few orbital missions, but I\u0027m currently tackling career mode and my next goal is setting up a solid LEO station and solid network of satellites\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-10T15:59:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello A Wandering Mage and welcome to the forum!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt sounds like you\u0027re well on your way.\u00A0 I\u0027m sure you will find the forum to be a very helpful and informative resource as you progress up the learning curve.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHappy landings!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"njmksr","CreatedById":114236,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-10T16:20:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the KSP Community!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGreat to have you aboard!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"A Wandering Mage","CreatedById":161714,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-10T16:53:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the warm welcome! And as long as that learning curve isn\u0027t that parabolic arc straight into the ground most of us rookies have I think I\u0027ll be good. You\u0027re right about the help though.
