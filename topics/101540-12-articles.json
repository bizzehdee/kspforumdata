My main point against wildcard patches is complexity. The sum of all moduleManager patches forms a piece of software that is \n\n\\* hard to debug/diagnose\n\n\\* different for each KSP install (depends on mods, player can add custom patches)\n\n\\* scattered across GameData\n\nSo if something is wrong, it usually is hard to tell what exactly MM did, and where to find the code of the involved patches. To make modders\u0027 and players\u0027 life easier I tend to keep patches as explicit and readable as possible. Also, mods should not use the \u0027FINAL\u0027 time, because others might want to act later (e.g. balancing mods removing TweakScale patches).\n\nPS: Just as a remark about \u0022they\u0027re always radially attached\u0022: there are curved solar panels which use stack sizes, and there might also be a mod with foldable panels in a stacked package. Of course the solution would be to support those with explicit patches, but this illustrates how easy it is to hard-code assumptions that do not hold for all other mods.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Hello\n\u003E I use tweak scale in 1.0.2. and when when I scale any stock fuel tanks, weights and fuel quantity do not change.\n\u003E \n\u003E Is it a bug?\n\nSounds like a problem in your install.

Define one or two global scaletypes that will apply to all parts, make it go from (say) 0.25x size to 4x size. Or whatever.\n\n2. Apply it to @PART\n\n[\\*] (or do engines vs. other parts separately, depending)\n\n3. Everything is now tweakscalable with one very, very simple config, but you lose some of the functionality of how things work now:\n\n- Right now, patching parts individually means parts can be scaled between the same minimum and maximum *actual* sizes - like 0.625m (or whatever) minimum, 5m max, and the scale shown on the tweakable corresponds to the actual size of the part in meters too (for stack stuff).\n\n- If you change it to a blanket scaletype, parts would be scaled between min and max *relative* sizes, so parts that are actually larger to begin with can now be scaled to humongous sizes, which may or may not be what you want.\n\n- Result: Tiny parts can also be scaled down to absolutely minuscule sizes (like 0.15m for 0.625m parts in my example) as well, which is a bit weird. In short, you get a lot of weird size options now, but if everything\u0027s freescale, you can also move the slider to get the exact multiple you want.\n\n4. One way around that might be to do a somewhat less simple config that reads cross-sectional size (if that\u0027s defined in part configs somewhere??), maybe... And somehow magically try to cover all the cases where someone didn\u0027t bother to define that, or for surface parts that don\u0027t have it at all.\n\n5. Individual configs could still be written for particular parts requiring special mass exponents or whatever.\n\nSo long as the config is fairly straightforward (one kind of scaletype for engines, one for everything else), it would actually save quite a lot of work and be not that hard to debug.\n\nBUT, as pellinor says, when you start trying to do something fancy - sorting parts by resources, size, modules, whatever - all in one config.. or if a user writes a config and doesn\u0027t know the difference between @MODULE and MODULE in an MM config (or some such)... I could see it getting hairy.\n\nJust thinking out loud.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-10T00:22:29Z\u0022 title=\u002207/10/2015 12:22  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by AccidentalDisassembly**"},{"CreatedByName":"gilflo","CreatedById":62881,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-10T07:37:00Z","Content":"\u003E Sounds like a problem in your install.
