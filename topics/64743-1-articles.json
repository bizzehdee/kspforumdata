I guess it would be good for you to check around what features are available and which of those you think are important. Do you need a good camera, or is decent good enough? Do you want a big screen, and do you care about resolution? And, of course, the OS. Each OS has advantages and drawbacks. Android is very flexible, has a great range of free apps, but needs slightly more power and can be unsafe at time. Windows Phone is a great OS that runs and looks slick, but has a much more limited app store and is pretty closed. Apple OS is even worse in that area, but if you want what it does, it does it well. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E You will need to do some investigating \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rosco P.
