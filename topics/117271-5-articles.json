(You can have things clipping, just not completely inside eachother.

I also avoided clipping control surfaces because that looks bad (though wouldn\u0027t legislate against it, because there are limits given the parts we have) and never even occurred to me to clip engines (unless its a tiny bit, certainly never overlapping their outputs, because real jets don\u0027t do that).\n\nAmmo, guns (as they\u0027re fixed) and landing gear make sense to clip, because real planes don\u0027t have those bolted to the skin of the fuselage either.\n\nThis contest was created to find the best performing designs (originally my own) which still looked authentic, not to design ghastly, unrealistic winning machines.\n\nYes, people\u0027s ideas about what\u0027s acceptable will vary, so consensus is key.
