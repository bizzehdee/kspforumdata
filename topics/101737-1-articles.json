Then they bought one of those fancy asset store ui systems to make their ui easier.... I know they used an asset store ui thing for the rep bar at the very least, and indeed it did sound like some large, fancy thing....

The only ideal choice would be to save that screen, and load the R\u0026amp;D screen separately, which would take time. Which is rather silly when it doesn\u0027t even add much more burden to the GPU to just add the GUI overlay. If your GPU is going to hyperventilate having to draw the R\u0026amp;D screen over everything else, it is time to upgrade or at least trim down your video settings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is bound to be more optimization of the game yet to come, so whatever burden is occurring now with your system is definitely going to be reduced.
