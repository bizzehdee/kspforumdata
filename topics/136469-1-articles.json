(preferably Wind, it\u0027s actually the cheapest power source- as coal produces a lot of pollution and CO2 that is not accounted for in its direct costs- some estimates indicate the TRUE cost of coal is as much as 3x the cost currently paid by consumers- as the ecological, health and property damage from the sulfur and nitrogen emissions, increases in lung-cancer and acid-rain from a coal power plant are not currently paid for by the consumer of the electricity...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for more compact farming- there are a lot of solutions to obtain more food from less land we\u0027re already not making use of.\u00A0 For one, genetic engineering of crops is still really just in its infancy compared to the increases in crop yields we could obtain with more aggressive adoption of the technology.\u00A0 Further, multi-cropping (that is, planting multiple crops in the same field- such as vegetables beneath apple trees, or potatoes in the same fields as brussel sprouts...) really doesn\u0027t see enough use either, mainly as it\u0027s difficult to automate and thus requires a lot of labor.\u00A0 New technologies to permanently improve the soil such as Biochar hold a lot of potential to improve the base fertility of farmland as well.\u00A0 And finally, there\u0027s a lot to be said for growing crops underground in manmade caves, Dwarf Fortress style (just without the giant man-eating spiders), with growth-lamps, as doing this allows you to carefully control the temperature, humidity, and keep out many pests/weeds entirely (in fact, some studies have shown it\u0027s CURRENTLY economical in certain abandoned mining tunnels, with the gains in productivity making up for the costs of electricity).\u00A0 All of these will see more widespread use as increasing population drives increases in the the cost of food, driving farmers to increase yields in progressively more expensive ways, long before we start making serious use of vertical farming...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDITL\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScratch that- it looks like we\u0027re ALREADY starting to make use of underground farms in some places (notably London), even if it\u0027s still just a novelty at this point:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/agriculture/farming/11706406/Londons-first-underground-farm-opens-in-WW2-air-raid-shelter.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/agriculture/farming/11706406/Londons-first-underground-farm-opens-in-WW2-air-raid-shelter.html\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://growing-underground.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://growing-underground.com/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.gizmag.com/growing-underground-subterranean-urban-farm-london/38297/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.gizmag.com/growing-underground-subterranean-urban-farm-london/38297/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegards,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNorthstar\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis, its an question of costs, very high buildings are prestige projects, not something you do to save money / costs.
