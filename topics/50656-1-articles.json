I like it. With that in mind - it would be interesting and useful as well as instructive to have the research center in the sandbox mode active where one could click on the technologies one wants and according have those parts available for use in building. If one has built a rocket/lander/probe that has non selected parts then that ship would not be loadable from the assembling buildings. One could then select the different technology advancements and tree line(s) that would allow that ship model to be used. Do you think that would be a good use for the research center in the sandbox mode? \u003Cem\u003EPerhaps required science points could be listed to achieve that selected line of technology on the technology tree.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBJ Quest\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://ribbons.cgagnier.ca/image.php?ribbon=12242\u0022 alt=\u0022image.php?ribbon=12242\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS: Another idea I am thinking about (\u003Cem\u003Ecareer mode\u003C/em\u003E): Using the research center to keep track of amount (%) of science points obtained from the different areas where points can be obtained from. Perhaps once visited that area wold show up with science points (or % of points) obtained from it.
