So, I tied to throttle, and I\u0027ve even mess around with using some of the thrust calculation code from the electricenginemodule, but no matter how I do it, I the scaling isn\u0027t perfect. True, the cap will reduce as a function of throttle, but not at the same rate as the power draw for the engines. The engines appear to draw power non-linearly in some way, and I\u0027ve been unable reproduce the function that replicates that behavior.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the current version of the code I\u0027m using:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E// dynamicly configure power reception\u003Cbr\u003E                List\u0026lt;Part\u0026gt; parts = vessel.parts;  // lets find the maxPower in those part configs for each engine\u003Cbr\u003E                float eEnginePower = 0; //we\u0027ll save total electric engine power here\u003Cbr\u003E                foreach (Part part in parts)\u003Cbr\u003E                {\u003Cbr\u003E                    foreach (PartModule partModules in part.Modules) //search part modules\u003Cbr\u003E                    {\u003Cbr\u003E                        var eEngine = partModules as ElectricEngineController;\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E                        if (eEngine != null) // is it an electric engine?\u003Cbr\u003E                        {\u003Cbr\u003E                            var engine = eEngine.part.Modules[\u0022ModuleEngines\u0022] as ModuleEngines;\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E                            if (engine.isOperational) // is it activated?\u003Cbr\u003E                            {\u003Cbr\u003E                                // add each engine\u0027s power that we\u0027ve found\u003Cbr\u003E                                eEnginePower \u002B= eEngine.maxPower; \u003Cbr\u003E                            }\u003Cbr\u003E                        }\u003Cbr\u003E                    }\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E                }\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E                minDemand = getCurrentResourceDemand(\u0022Megajoules\u0022) \u002B getCurrentResourceDemand(\u0022ElectricCharge\u0022);// fallback for minimum demand\u003Cbr\u003E                maxDemand = eEnginePower * FlightGlobals.ActiveVessel.ctrlState.mainThrottle; // save the maximum demand scaled to the current throttle\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E                //if throttled up, recieve the maximum of demand up to the maximum available power (ie. atmo, dist, angle, total supply)\u003Cbr\u003E                if (FlightGlobals.ActiveVessel.ctrlState.mainThrottle \u0026gt; 0.0f) powerInputMegajoules = Math.Min(maxDemand, total_power / 1000.0 * GameConstants.microwave_dish_efficiency * atmosphericefficiency);\u003Cbr\u003E                // else only recieve the minimum demand (just enough to keep the lights running) again, if enough available power\u003Cbr\u003E                else powerInputMegajoules = Math.Min(minDemand, total_power / 1000.0 * GameConstants.microwave_dish_efficiency * atmosphericefficiency);\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd help would be greatly appreciated.
