KSP and a less than 1 GB speed boost program are the only things on it.\n\nI added mechjeb2 for the precision burns,\n\nstage recovery because i\u0027m playing career mode\n\nstation science so I have a reason to build a space station besides refueling.(side note: where are the experiments? I can\u0027t find them in the tech tree/VAB)\n\nnow onwards to the *interesting* part\n\nI launched a team of 2 kerbals (1 pilot, 1 scientist) to perform a zoom by of the satellite body minmus ( please forgive me if spelling is incorrect. it\u0027s the second satellite around kerban.) to grab some delicious science. I collected a large amount and was ready to escape back to kerbin when ***BAM*** my team fails to escape properly and all h\\*\\*l breaks lose. my \u0022orbit\u0022 if you can call it that  *radically changes on it\u0027s own* and forces me to reset the launch.\n\ni\u0027ve tried reseting the launch 3 times. I\u0027ve even reset the game by quitting and relaunching. nothing so far.\n\nany ideas where this bug is coming from? at least I can orbit and escape mun just fine. I haven\u0027t tried to escape kerbin yet though.\n\nfinal note: I have about a hour left of computer time at library when I post this and I can\u0027t return till monday. \n\nthank you all for helping or at least reading!"},{"CreatedByName":"Feradose","CreatedById":111211,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T00:33:27Z","Content":"Is there part clipping?"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt.
