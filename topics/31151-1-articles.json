It only provides a method of planning the maneuver you want to make. Set the marker, then grab and tug the little handles around to see what the result will be. Once you\u0027ve got it set the way you want, point your nose at the blue navball marker, and when the time comes, burn the engine as long as the timer says to. When done, you should be pretty close to the path you planned.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-03T19:43:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Gaziki\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Gaziki\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHi!\u003Cp\u003ESo I managed to circle te earth over and over but still dont know how to manover. while ship is moving i set an monouver on its path, but when ship pass over this point nothing happens and ship moves at old direction.

When you set a maneuver node, it will put a blue target on your navball and give you the amoun of delta V you need to expand to complete your maneuver, along with the amount of time you will have to burn. What you want to do is point towards the blue target on your navball and then warp to your node. When you reach your node, you want to throttle up, still facing that blue target. The yellow bar on the side should start draining down, meaning you are indeed accelerating on the right path. Be careful though, when the burn is almost complete, the maneuver node will start moving around the navball, so burn slowly and be sure to move your ship so it always points toward the target. And you can safely stop a maneuver when it has about 0.5m/s left. You can also fine tune it by using the translation controls with RCS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, if the maneuver node tells you you are gonna burn for a minute, you want to start burning towards your target 30 seconds before you get to the maneuver node. You always divide it by two to do it half before half after.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want something that will do the maneuver nodes for you, I recommend installing MechJeb 2.0.8. It is an autopilot for KSP and it can set maneuver nodes for you and execute them or simply execute the maneuver nodes you set, along with many other tools.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/12384-PART-0-20-Anatid-Robotics-MuMech-MechJeb-Autopilot-v2-0-8\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ELink to MechJeb 2.0.8\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck! ^^\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaziki","CreatedById":59288,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-03T20:44:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI dont understand it:D.

I\u0027m not telling him to use MechJeb and then job done. If you look at my post in its wholeness, you will see that I told him to watch how he does to learn how to do it after. I learned from MechJeb more than I learned from any tutorial. I learned the most efficient ways to do launches, takeoffs, rendez-vous and landings from MechJeb. Now I do them myself most of the time, excepted for 30 minute burns cause I have better to do honestly than sitting by my computer for 30 minutes correcting my orientation every 2 minutes or so for thirty minutes. But watching MechJeb go is much more educative than it could seem like at the first place.
