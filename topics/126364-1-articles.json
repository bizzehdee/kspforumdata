I imagine you swapped modes without knowing it, there\u0026#39;s no other explanation for such drastically different performance.

I made one wee change which I didn\u0026#39;t consider and that was adding struts to reinforce the plane. Removing them had a huge impact on performance. Worth noting as well that they were all within a structural fuselage. So onto the next question:- is there any way of adding struts without inducing massive drag?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nCraft files for proof:-\u003Cbr\u003E\n[url]http://pastebin.com/hzQhYVYD[/url][B] (Struts)[/B]\u003Cbr\u003E\n[url]http://pastebin.com/NPr0KnLz[/url] [B](No struts)[/B]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nEDIT2: Think I\u0026#39;ll make a new topic for this.\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-24T18:52:09Z\u0022 title=\u002211/24/2015 06:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Laughing Man\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
