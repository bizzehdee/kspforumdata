I usually go at 45 degree ascent to ~10k, 10 degree ascent to ~13k, and then 0-5 degree ascent for the rest. It seems no matter what I do though I top out at around 18k altitude and about 900 m/s speed...I cant seem to get past there. Dropping my altitude to ~16k I can get my speed up to about 930 m/s, but always lose it when I try to ascend again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone have any tips on design and / or piloting for the plane?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, it seems that if I roll even the slightest bit SAS is completely unable to stabalize it...it continues to roll back and forth trying to stabalize it for literally the rest of the flight...any ideas how to fix that as well?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kStrout","CreatedById":116630,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-21T19:06:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EStart smaller, that is gigantic for a 2 kerbal plane.

I will try downsizing and switching the elevons. I will also remove some of the precoolers if their intake isnt worth all that much. I dont have rapiers unlocked quite yet, but they were the next thing i was planning on getting from the tech tree and i have 809 science atm, so I will have them sooner than later (probably sometime today, as I have a mission about to visit jool / bop for the first time which I anticipate will give me loads of science).

Now, the drag models are closer to one another than they used to be but there\u0027s still sufficient difference down in the soup to make any advice I\u0027d give you suspect. Still, if your plane is just sending two Kerbals to orbit, you shouldn\u0027t need much wing (your payload is literally just the cockpit - two tonnes, say three for extra bits like batteries and solar panels, 12 tonnes theoretical takeoff mass so a single Turbojet could do the job; I\u0027d recommend pairing it with a pair of Thuds to keep things simple).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack in the day the advice was 1 unit of Lift Coefficient per tonne of plane; a Delta Wing and Wing Connector A both had a lift coefficient of 2, so a twelve tonne plane would require a pair of two Wing Connector As with a Delta on the end.
