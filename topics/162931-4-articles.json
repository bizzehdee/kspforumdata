HTP is 2.2x as dense as N\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003EO and jellied gasoline about the same as paraffin (0.9 kg/L). So the HEROS-3 carried around 9.33 L of paraffin and 119 L of pressurized N\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003EO, for a total propellant volume of 128 L. HTP\u002Bkerosene has a mass O/F ratio of 7, corresponding to a volume O/F ratio of 3.23 (VERY nice), so I estimate we could pack 30.2 L of jellied petrol and 97.8 L of HTP into the same rocket, for a total propellant mass of 169 kg.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis increases our propellant fraction from a damning 54% \u00A0on HEROS-3 to a much more respectable 69.2%. Other improvements can be made, since we don\u0027t need avionics packages on each booster, but given the likelihood of including chutes, etc. we can ignore that.
