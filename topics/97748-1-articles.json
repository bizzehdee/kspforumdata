At present there isn\u0027t much that it does. The fundamental question is strategically what is the value of having a hub? My thinking is the science lab needs to be heavier and more expensive, but do something vital. A few ideas for that:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Collectable/loadable materials for the materials bay - Surface samples as well as atmospheric samples, ground scatter core samples etc can be brought back to a science lab, processed, and then distributed to materials bays. When the materials bay is activated, different samples give higher and lower bonuses, meaning amassing a collection of the best samples is a huge asset. Samples can also be brought back to Kerbin, but if you\u0027re, say, on a Jool mission it might make more sense to fill materials bays with what you find there than shipping it all the way back to Kerbin for processing. This could be a big step toward end-game living-off-the-land type strategies. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Major upgradable ability of scientists is to improve science processing results for transmission back to Kerbin. I think you could even go in 20% increments, with level 1 scientists processing results to 20% and level 5 scientists processing to 100%. This would mean results and samples could be brought back to a science lab with a level 5 scientist for the same value as returning them to Kerbin. From a balance standpoint, science labs will be very heavy and expensive, meaning you aren\u0027t going to put them on every lander you send down, and getting a scientist to level 5 will be difficult enough that you wont have a large supply of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Soil testing necessary before determining a good drill site - When prospecting, orbital imaging will only tell you the general region in which harvestable resources can be found. Once there, the only way to tell if you\u0027ve struck gold is to process a surface sample either at Kerbin or a science lab. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EId love the idea that you could run longitudinal studies, but its too exploitable if you can just put these experiments on and press the period key for infinite science. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI already use orbital labs a great deal. Its a great system to put a station around kerbin with a lab on it and run 6 or 8 mun and minimus missions with a lander. Same for Jool and Eve missions. You leave your return fuel and a science lab in orbit. This kind of thing would be even more profitable if there were more compelling mechanics behind it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother idea Ive had is a big heavy \u0022training module\u0022 part added. As Kerbals gain experience, they must return either to kerbin or a training module in order to level up. This way instead of having to return home after every mission, kerbals could instead level up on the fly by returning to a training module. This part should be big, 3.75m maybe, be expensive, heavy, and power-hungry meaning sending one down on every lander makes little sense.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
