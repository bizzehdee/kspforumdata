For whatever reason, this one just happened to catch my eye. I guess I haven\u0027t taken care of them as well as I should have, so some of you might just dismiss this as some dust or a scratch or whatever, but I think its a little too odd to not share with the community.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i109.photobucket.com/albums/n48/Hyomoto/screenshot764a_zps379b1ace.png~original\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot764a_zps379b1ace.png~original\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI blew up the suspect part of the photo. You can clearly see two foreign objects there. I did some color and levels editing on the left to try and rule out being scratches. I guess its suspect but I don\u0027t think they are, there are clearly two objects visible in what seems like a low Munar orbit. I thought they might be stars but because of the lighting here, the starfield isn\u0027t even visible, and there aren\u0027t any planets or bright stars in that direction. And just to rule it out, no I don\u0027t have anything else orbiting the Mun. The closest I can figure is maybe it\u0027s an asteroid, but two close together like that?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, I just wanted to share my anomaly with you guys. Anyone else see anything weird out there?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Destroyer","CreatedById":36109,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-08T23:36:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps the Munar arch?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei\u0027m more interested in the red thingys.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"trekkie_","CreatedById":36130,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-08T23:50:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eswamp gas caught in the light of venus, that\u0027s all. now look at this flashy thing in my hand.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BagelRabbit","CreatedById":95028,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-09T00:42:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAren\u0027t they -- ah -- stars?

I\u0027ve been looking at my other pictures so it\u0027s easier for me to think otherwise. The problem is there isn\u0027t really anything all that bright in that direction, the majority of bright stars and/or planets are along the galactic plane. The station is oriented with the left side facing \u0027up\u0027 in the first photo, so the area in question is too low, there are a few bright stars but you can only just barely see them without being on the dark side. I don\u0027t usually shoot photos there because its hard to see (as if this is much better \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E).
