I tried step 4 of your guide for getting custom particles, copying the code provided in place of:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EMODULE\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E{\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ename = ModuleEngines\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EthrustVectorTransformName = thrustTransform\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ein the MassiveSRB config. This resulted in nothing changing, so I tried copying the launch pad smoke section of the BACC SRB from the squad_hotrockets config just after the Model_Particle module. This results in the massive SRB having exhaust emissions even while off and not being able to be turned on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo clearly I have no idea what I\u0027m doing \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand anymore help would be massively \u002B hugely appreciated \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sheiss","CreatedById":104246,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-03T17:44:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnyone? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
