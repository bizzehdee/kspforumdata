I understand that these wheels aren\u0027t the best for the game,\u00A0but I cant use any other wheel because of how big the vehicle is.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-08-02T20:57:39Z\u0022 title=\u002208/02/2016 08:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 2, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by FlamingOnion_1\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FlamingOnion_1","CreatedById":141134,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-02T20:57:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI Fixed the problem now...For some reason if I add a kerbal to the unmanned vehicle it will not work...\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
