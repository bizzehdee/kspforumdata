I wanted to make a Landing Leg with integrated Resource Harvester but as soon as I add the ModuleAnimationGroup, the lang gear stops working. In the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E it stays retracted no matter how often I hit \u0022deploy\u0022 and when I launch the Vessel, the Landing Legs stay deployed and can\u0027t be retracted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt doesn\u0027t matter if the part has multiple animations or not, a simple unconfigured Module is enough to break things.
