Additionally the flight assistant PID settings saved per craft or another per-craft damper PID for each axis, so it\u0027s possible to set them up to damp out any control bounce automatically. Dynamic Deflection modifies the surface deflection range based on a graph keyed to dynamic pressure vs max deflection %, with points input by the user, rather like an enhanced DPCR augment per control.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-23T19:39:06Z\u0022 title=\u002210/23/2015 07:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Van Disaster\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"baldamundo","CreatedById":138417,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-24T08:09:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow do people determine the appropriate attitude for spaceplane re-entry in FAR?
