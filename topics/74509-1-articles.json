Noone is forced to upload their mods there, and noone is forced to access the site. Curseforge.com (as linked on the top of the forums) is a place for modders to upload their content and is free of ads, download timers and all that other stuff. There are no plans to change that, and it\u0027s perfectly fine to go to that website instead to get your mods, or get them from the forums if you prefer.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry, but this claim is not valid. If you want popular mods, you are essentially forced to use Curse. This is not a legal obligation which is your use of the word; rather, it is a normative obligation. For example, you want a Samsung phone, but your friends have iPhones. If you want to AirDrop your friends (just a single feature), you must buy an iPhone. A more extreme example is that you don\u0027t like the new anti-privacy laws the US is passing. You don\u0027t have to live in the US, but you are obligated to do so because that is where you work and you have nowhere to go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, a ridiculous amount of ads!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/eQoBus2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022eQoBus2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDownload timers!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tK6L2ps.png\u0022 alt=\u0022tK6L2ps.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly found in the Curse main website, apparently \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S.: 48 trackers found with ads on, 12 without.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-09T14:41:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAsk the modder nicely to host elsewhere, it\u0027s up to them if they want to provide an alternative.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you ignore the advice to use the ad-less and timer-less kerbal.curseforge.com site, you get what you get.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KasperVld","CreatedById":40700,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-09T15:24:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAsk the modder nicely to host elsewhere, it\u0027s up to them if they want to provide an alternative.\u003Cp\u003EIf you ignore the advice to use the ad-less and timer-less kerbal.curseforge.com site, you get what you get.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re not forced to use Curse.
