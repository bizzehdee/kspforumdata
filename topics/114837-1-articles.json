She has an Apple computer. I\u0027m not familiar OS-X, and I want to make sure I know what I\u0027m doing by researching the install instructions beforehand. The installation instructions posted on the KSP website are:\n\n1. Download and Save to File\n\n2. Unzip the contents to a directory of your choice\n\n3. Run the game\n\nI think I can manage 1 \u0026 2, but how do I \u0022Run the game\u0022? On Windows, you run the game by launching KSP.exe, but that file doesn\u0027t exist in the Mac distribution, and there isn\u0027t any obvious equivalent.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nNever mind. I found the answer on the wiki. The equivalent to KSP.exe is apparently KSP.app on OS-X.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-02T05:02:38Z\u0022 title=\u002207/02/2015 05:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Annushka**"},{"CreatedByName":"stibbons","CreatedById":57865,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T05:09:41Z","Content":"Correct. The KSP.app folder is an [application bundle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundle_%28OS_X%29). When you extract it on a Mac it\u0027ll look like this:\n\n![npupnK1.png](http://i.imgur.com/npupnK1.png)\n\nJust double-click the KSP icon and you\u0027re good to go.\n\n(you ninja\u0027d your own answer, but by then I\u0027d already taken the screenshot and I didn\u0027t want to waste it. ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif) )"},{"CreatedByName":"Annushka","CreatedById":113235,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T05:22:13Z","Content":"Thank you, Stibbons. Your screenshot makes it very clear."},{"CreatedByName":"Dispatcher","CreatedById":78707,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-03T01:38:18Z","Content":"What I\u0027ve done for my friends who also have iMacs is to get them set up on Steam. I then gift them with games each year for an internationally celebrated religious holiday. Once they accept the gift, Steam loads it and all one needs to do is hit the Play button from within Steam. I prefer Steam simply because I can gift games to different friends and family who use different OSes (some use Windows and one Linux). I choose games which run on at least Windows and Mac, so that the person can enjoy the gift regardless of platform used.\n\nEdit: I forgot, you can also click on the Launchpad (usually found on the Dock row at the bottom or side of the screen), scroll until you get the right page, and click on the KSP icon (a shortcut).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-03T01:44:13Z\u0022 title=\u002207/03/2015 01:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Dispatcher**"}]}
