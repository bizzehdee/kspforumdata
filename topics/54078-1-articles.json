Often this ends in skewed flight paths and me wasting fuel to correct, re-correct, then sort of just make do with what ends up being free ticket on the ever lasting roller coast ride around Kerbal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk it\u0027s not that bad, but having the ability to map a key that would \u0022bump\u0022 the throttle would be nice. By bump I mean starting from 0% throttle, hitting a key bumps the throttle to 5%, but then back to 0% once the key is released.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SilverWarior","CreatedById":80669,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-23T07:00:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo you want tthe ability to finetuning your orbit. While having burn on key press would be nice you can achieve similar thing by adding a few RCS thrusters on your ship and use the for orbit finetuning. Infact using RCR for this is usually much better as it generates less force and therefore alows you to realy fine tune the orbit. Using main engines for this is sometimes just not practical as they generate to much force even with jut litle throtle.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-23T10:27:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyeah either rcs or x key to cut throttle immediately\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anthlon","CreatedById":58074,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-23T10:33:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Elinear RCS port mounted a proper way (same as engine) shoud work nice, as well as usual rcs ports\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-23T12:08:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen you reach the point that every tiny adjustment sends of your encounter to much, just wait until you traveled half the distance, than adjust it further.
