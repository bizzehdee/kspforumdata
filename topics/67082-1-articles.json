Driving the same route everyday had probably made me a bit overconfident. I knew all the bumps and curves in that road and was driving a bit too fast. I turn into a nice left handed follow-through with 100 kph only to notice the end of the curve is covered with mud. A farmer had recently come out of his field and didn\u0027t clean up his mess. Any experience biker knows you don\u0027t brake in the middle of a turn but I had no choice. I HAD to reduce speed despite the risk of spinning out.

Not familiar in that area I missed my exit on the autobahn. It was the time before satnavs so I had to check my maps. Soon I spotted signs for a rest stop and I moved over to the slow lane. For some reason all traffic in front of me suddenly slows down. No problem, I wasn\u0027t tailgating so I too reduce speed. I check my mirrors and spot a car gaining on me fast.

We didn\u0027t install the tire chains, as the temperature was fairly high those days (so I guess most people did the same). We encountered a heavy snowfall appearing suddenly from the nowhere. The snow on the autobahn became thicker and thicker in matter of minutes, making the asphalt very slippery. We had to reduce our speed to like 60 km/h. However, not every motorists obliged the law and safety measures, and continued to go as fast as 100-120 km/h. Suddenly, a line of stopped cars appeared in front of us (visibility was barely 50 metres that time). We could stop in time, but not everybody could avoid the accident. Some drivers tried to avoid crashing into the line by making sharp turns, resulting in bumping into the surrounding gouardrail. Some crashed into another car. These crashes ranged from minor scratches to movie-like accidents. A truck coming from behind could not stop, and broke through the guardrail, falling into the trench. (Its driver got out from the seat completely unharmed!) All of these events could be seen from the rearview mirror, and it was shocking. We were only saved from injuries and damage because there were two cars behind us, when the accident happened. Fortunately no people died in the accident (afaik), and my family and our car came out unscratched.

I capitalize Moose because you really can\u0027t get a handle on just how big and impressive they are until you see one in person, and also they have somewhat of a mystical aura and reputation. I\u0027ve heard some people say that a Moose can only be seen if it wants to be seen. My driver trainer told me 15 years ago while we were in New Hampshire to never honk at the Moose or he might charge your vehicle and F*** it up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xcorps","CreatedById":96531,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-05T10:13:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was once rappelling from a CH-46 onto a rooftop at the MOUT facility at Camp Lejeune for a dog and pony show. The plan was to go from the ramp of the helo down the line onto the roof of a two story building, then jump off the roof and through the window. We practiced it a few times, and good to go. When we did it live, I fell when I went through the window and the rope got tangled around my M16 which was attached to me with a sling. Since I was the last guy, the plan called for the helo to pull off when I went through the window. I got pulled against the window really freaking hard, hard enough to knock the wind out of me. Fortunately, my partner was paying attention and had the grace to undo the quicksnaps on the sling, and off my rifle went across the street.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen my platoon sergeant asked me where my rifle was, my life flashed before my eyes.
