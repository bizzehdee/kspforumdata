Manually deleting the /Gamedata/Squad/Spaces/ folder resulted in everything except the KSC, GUI, and skybox to magically vanish, so I must appeal to the more educated modders for help.\n\nCan someone make a mod that would systematically locate and eliminate all IVAs? Or at least some sort of patch that deletes the parts\u0027 references to the IVA files, which could then be manually deleted? Note that even doing this just for the stock IVAs would b a great help; that would free up ~100MB of space(My IVAs from mods are only at ~11MB total)."},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T23:47:35Z","Content":"Each mod adds it space folder for IVA you would also want to change the \n\n    \tINTERNAL\t{\t\tname = ****** to placeholder\t}\n\nThen you should be about to delete the space folder in the mods you have and if they have a props folder.\n\nEDIT- Have you converted all the texture to DDS or check if there all DDS format ?\n\nEDIT- If you delete the space folder and props folder in your KSP/GameData/Squad/ And copy this one in it\u0027s place it should have all you need and there is a MM patch to change any INTERNAL to placeholder if, I did it right but you would have to go in all you mods and delete the space and prop folder if they have one.
