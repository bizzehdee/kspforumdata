For those living under a rock, oblique wings are a concept in which a straight wing rests on a horizontal swivel. In theory, this should allow for the same performance advantages gained by variable-geometry wings, but without being a maintenance nightmare. Anyhow, I tried making one in the SPH, and it nosedived as soon as I pivoted the wing. Is this just me failing hardcore at spaceplane design, or can you just not do it in KSP?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPretty pictures: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.desktop.aero/library/whitepaper/vfmx.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022vfmx.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cdn.globalaircraft.org/media/img/planes/lowres/AD-1_2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022AD-1_2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Roughly my design)\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ultrasquid","CreatedById":10944,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-05T18:12:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry installing a MechJeb module and use the Smart ASS Surf function to manage your pitch and heading.
