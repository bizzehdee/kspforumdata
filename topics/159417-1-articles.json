It\u0027s where you find the various Easter Eggs hidden around the Kerbol system, on moons or planets, or even on parts of a rocket or spaceplane. It\u0027s basically where you try to find more easter eggs than another user, and take a screenshot of each easter egg you find. Happy hunting my fellow rocketeers!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbolExplorer","CreatedById":177191,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-29T09:28:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHeres and ester egg in gaia (not gonna say were it is)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedOther ipsEmbeddedOther_limited\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?app=core\u0026amp;module=system\u0026amp;controller=embed\u0026amp;url=http://imgur.com/dqIUgmt\u0022 style=\u0022height:442px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
