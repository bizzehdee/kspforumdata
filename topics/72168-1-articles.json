It essentially has the flight profile of a dart attached to an enormous golf ball. I would like to know if this craft is wasting fuel overcoming increased drag with FAR compared to a cylindrical rocket or if the superior mass fraction of a spherical tank more than makes up for this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll post pictures of the craft as soon as I have access to my desktop.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rtxoff","CreatedById":107622,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-12T16:58:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am not using FAR myself by as far as i know there is a built in tool in FAR with which you can find an awnser for your question.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the FAR page itself there a 3 videos about FAR with Scott Manley and the third one describes how to use this tool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/20451-0-23-5-Ferram-Aerospace-Research-v0-13-3-4-30-14\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/20451-0-23-5-Ferram-Aerospace-Research-v0-13-3-4-30-14\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wasmic","CreatedById":64885,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-12T17:02:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think that when subsonic, the spherical tank might be a good idea, but it\u0027ll probably lose out due to higher drag when supersonic.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
