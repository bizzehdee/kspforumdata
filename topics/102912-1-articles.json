Looking for info on satellites and orbiting the Mun, specifically Stayputnik. I\u0027ve noticed during manned flights that a transmitted report carries much less data than a carried home report. I don\u0027t understand that. As long as you have electricity, eventually an entire report should be able to be transmitted, especially the kind of info in the narrative- \u0022Hey, the Mystery Goo got hard!!\u0022 \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, is this the case with satellites? Data must be physically retrieved to get full benefit? And are satellites in themselves adequate as a source of science gathering? And do they need things like mystery goo, thermometers, and science station attached to them, which from my experience does not get the info back to Kerbin, without recovering the equipment. I assume a reaction wheel is required to prevent them from spinning? Do satellites have SAS?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat is the best way to approach this- for Mun orbital missions should I be putting enough rockets on it to bring back to Kerbin, and a parachute on as part of a science package and mystery goo modules to recover it that way?

Science data always requires some experiment to be carried out. Kerbals can do EVA reports and gather surface samples, so they are a type of science apparatus. Manned command pods have the capability to do crew reports, so they are also science apparatus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnmanned probe cores cannot do any experiments, so if you want science from your satellite you will have to put science apparatus on it, as well as an antenna to transmit the data (assuming you don\u0027t want to return it to Kerbin). The various probe cores have different capabilities. The Stayputnik has no SAS capabilities at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBest results from a science probe, to the Mun for instance, will be from returning as many experiments safely to Kerbin as possible.

Not that you can only have ONE experiment of each type in a command capsule, no matter the size. If you wish to store more than one set of data (eg. two goo reports in one capsule) your only choice is to use the Mobile Processing Lab.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis reduction in science points is a way to nerf unmanned one way missions, as launching a probe to land on the mun is cheaper than launching something that can land and return.
