Looking for info on satellites and orbiting the Mun, specifically Stayputnik. I\u0027ve noticed during manned flights that a transmitted report carries much less data than a carried home report. I don\u0027t understand that. As long as you have electricity, eventually an entire report should be able to be transmitted, especially the kind of info in the narrative- \u0022Hey, the Mystery Goo got hard!!\u0022 ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nAnyway, is this the case with satellites? Data must be physically retrieved to get full benefit? And are satellites in themselves adequate as a source of science gathering? And do they need things like mystery goo, thermometers, and science station attached to them, which from my experience does not get the info back to Kerbin, without recovering the equipment. I assume a reaction wheel is required to prevent them from spinning? Do satellites have SAS?\n\nWhat is the best way to approach this- for Mun orbital missions should I be putting enough rockets on it to bring back to Kerbin, and a parachute on as part of a science package and mystery goo modules to recover it that way?

Science data always requires some experiment to be carried out. Kerbals can do EVA reports and gather surface samples, so they are a type of science apparatus. Manned command pods have the capability to do crew reports, so they are also science apparatus.\n\nUnmanned probe cores cannot do any experiments, so if you want science from your satellite you will have to put science apparatus on it, as well as an antenna to transmit the data (assuming you don\u0027t want to return it to Kerbin). The various probe cores have different capabilities. The Stayputnik has no SAS capabilities at all.\n\nBest results from a science probe, to the Mun for instance, will be from returning as many experiments safely to Kerbin as possible. The wiki entry I linked to has details for science values for each experiment as well.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nHappy landings!\n\np.s. Usually the term satellite is reserved for something that remains in a specific orbit once it is placed, whereas probe is the common term for an unmanned spacecraft in general.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-29T13:52:39Z\u0022 title=\u002203/29/2015 01:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Starhawk**"},{"CreatedByName":"TheXRuler","CreatedById":125517,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-29T15:50:16Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E What is the best way to approach this- for Mun orbital missions should I be putting enough rockets on it to bring back to Kerbin, and a parachute on as part of a science package and mystery goo modules to recover it that way?

Not that you can only have ONE experiment of each type in a command capsule, no matter the size. If you wish to store more than one set of data (eg. two goo reports in one capsule) your only choice is to use the Mobile Processing Lab.\n\nThis reduction in science points is a way to nerf unmanned one way missions, as launching a probe to land on the mun is cheaper than launching something that can land and return. However I find that with the biomes added to every body in stock KSP now, it is quite possible to get enough science to escape the Kerbin\u0027s sphere of influence solely by transmitting."},{"CreatedByName":"moogoob","CreatedById":118251,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-29T15:57:25Z","Content":"Most of the time, I use probes/satellites either just for fun or to complete contracts. The \u0022explore\u0022 contracts don\u0027t specify \u0022return ALL science\u0022 from a biome/situation, so a less-efficient transmission can complete the contract just fine.\n\nAs well, not having to build recovery into your mission allows completion of such contracts with significantly reduced complexity, so it\u0027s worth it to just transmit. EG, my probe landers don\u0027t need to return to space, and I don\u0027t need to bring crew along. As well, my mission is done as soon as that \u0022Contract Completed\u0022 note pops up. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nEDIT: through transmitting alone I was able to complete the explore contracts for Jool, Pol and Bop in one flight, with one craft. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Bev7787","CreatedById":136501,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-30T07:51:33Z","Content":"The transmission value is normally a little bit higher if you\u0027re using a lab module."},{"CreatedByName":"Huntn","CreatedById":139751,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-30T17:00:53Z","Content":"Thanks for the advice and info guys!
