I created a fresh install, downloaded the new version from Steam, and launched a simple craft into orbit. Unfortunately, when it got there, I found what seems like it must be a bug. Whenever I try to use any of the direction assistance options from having a level 3 pilot, I end up with all my control surfaces oscillating wildly, including engine gimbal, \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.gfycat.com/AbleClearcutBallpython\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eas seen here\u003C/a\u003E. At least the craft ends up pointing in the right direction. In addition, when I went to reenter, I found that I had a similar, but worse problem in the atmosphere: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.gfycat.com/IllustriousValuableBoa\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESee here\u003C/a\u003E. In that case, it looks like the craft is jittering and rotating past the target orientation. I have a saved game in this state, so I can upload any information needed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
