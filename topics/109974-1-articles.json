I\u0027m Not sure how to go about this, but I think I\u0027d need to first determine if the active vessel is a kerbal, then get the skill type from somewhere.. Does that make sense? Will a kerbal on EVA be the active vessel?\n\nthanks for the help. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"MrHappyFace","CreatedById":76365,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T20:17:01Z","Content":"if (FlightGloals.ActiveVessel.isEVA){    Vessel vessel = FlightGlobals.ActiveVessel;    var experience = vessel.GetVesselCrew()[0].experienceTrait;    //TODO: add more stuff that does things}\n\nBeyond that, it\u0027s pretty self explanatory. Just don\u0027t use vessel.GetVesselCrew() in every update loop, as it is a very expensive operation. Cache the return value, and update it every time FlightGlobal.ActiveVessel changes.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-19T20:20:07Z\u0022 title=\u002205/19/2015 08:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MrHappyFace**\n  \ni am bad at using words"},{"CreatedByName":"Angelo Kerman","CreatedById":106975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T20:26:30Z","Content":"Very much appreciated, thank you ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"}]}
