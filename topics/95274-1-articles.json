Obviously this should only work on parts that touch or are fairly close to each other (should be easily decidably, from a technical standpoint).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am well aware that as of now, the strut part can actually serve this purpose, but it seems a bit clumsy in certain cases where I would need this functionality most. One example is when building large wing surfaces: You would want the whole wing to stick together and act as one surface, but instead if you just attach multiple wings to the center of your craft, they usually bend and move apart in certain flight situations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAttaching a strut between these kinds of wings is pretty tedious and sometimes you have to \u0022cheat\u0022 around with the translation tool, to make placing it possible at all!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo that\u0027s my overall proposition: An editor tool that allows you to click one part and then another part that touches it, welding the two parts together to create an attachment constraint, pretty much exactly as if the parts were connected by a strut.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis seems to be a very essential construction feature, to me!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-01T17:00:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMaybe it can come with an upgraded VAB, fit bajanxing in Career.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pandaman","CreatedById":130621,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-01T17:14:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like this idea, been thinking along those lines myself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis may very well not be at all practical, or even doable, from a programming point of view, but...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt could be handy if some configurations of these welded parts could be saved as new \u0027custom\u0027 single parts, like small sub assemblies.
