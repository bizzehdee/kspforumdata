The reasons for this request are fairly simple: sometimes people like me forget to assign hotkeys before the mission, docking may make undesired changes to hotkey assignments, and damage to the vehicle may require in-flight reassignment to attempt to rebalance things like rocket rings that are no longer symmetrical.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow it might work: I would like to see the reassignment go something like this: 1) select parts to assign a function to using mod key\u002BR-click. 2) press and hold hotkey reassign key such as \u0022\u0060\u0022 or \u0022~\u0022 and number to assign function to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe tricky part may be where a part has multiple functions, in which case selecting that part\u0027s function or multiple parts\u0027 functions to be controlled by the newly assigned hotkey may be difficult. A generic assignment might be toggled for things like engines, sensors, solar deployments, etc, and decouple for pylons, stage separations, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould anyone else like to see this?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
