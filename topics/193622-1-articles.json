There is no difference in modibility between steam or direct download. The one issue you may have with a steam install and mods is that auto updates tend to throw your saves out and you may need to wait a while for your favorite mods to update. There is a mitigation for this - KSP does not contain any DRM so you can leave the steam install location vanilla and copy and paste\u00A0another copy of KSP to a different location which will make your modded install immune to updates.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OHara","CreatedById":162784,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-05T05:21:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome players use the Steam Workshop to post their craft to share with others.\u00A0 Only people who bought KSP through Steam can download those craft.\u00A0 The workaround here is to ask the poster to post the craft on KerbalX.com.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tonka Crash","CreatedById":189552,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-05T12:26:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know if it matters, but I always try to buy direct rather than a 3rd party reaeller.
