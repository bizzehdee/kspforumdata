The mission of Tetsuo-Kaori 2 has a big deal for three reasons: one, it was only the second landing on the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn, the nearest of the two moons of the home planet Kerbin; two, it was the first time the new tri-wheeled rover was being used. It hadn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t even been tested before, which as time will tell was a foolish decision by mission control. Finally, it was a mission to examine the fallen probe Masaru 3, the first probe to land on another celestial body.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/i2ts7BIh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022i2ts7BIh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mission consisted of two spacecraft being launched; the first carried the Tetsuo spacecraft with three crewmembers consisting of Hersey, Malfry, and Handos Kerman. The second was an unmanned Kaori M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnar lander to rendezvous with the Tetsuo Command Module. The two spacecraft were docked was in a short time; only a few months ago pilots piloting the single-man Kaisuke capsules were struggling with attempts to dock with unpiloted vehicles. Now, it was routine, amazing at how fast those Kerbalnauts learn. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the time they had both reached the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn and reached orbit around it, there was already one problem: the fuel of the command module was 99% empty, but that was the least of the crew\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s concerns because once the ascent stage of the Kaori lander launches from the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn, the command stage would use the remaining fuel to return safely home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe landing was off target by 5.3 kilometers, perfect for the crew to travel by rover to the site. Then things started to really go wrong. The rover detached as expected, but then it started to roll down the slope where they landed on, they forgot to turn on the brakes. Hersey Kerman, being the commander, left to retrieve it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAccording to what Malfry found out later, the rover slid down into such a speed, that Hersey had to activate his jetpack to speed him up with the rover. Minutes passed, with nothing interesting, just Hersey attempting aimlessly to get the rover. After several minutes, he finally caught it, but both solar panes were broken, so there was no way it could be recharged, triggering an immediate abort of the mission. Hersey had to drive the rover all the way back to the lander. Then his batteries drain away, meaning that he had to walk back. Sometime on the way there, he had decided to jetpack his way back, reducing time. Then\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 it happened.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHersey had just overtaken the lander by accident when suddenly his jetpack started to malfunction, causing him to plummet to the surface. That was all Malfry knew when he turned on the radio.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CKaori 2 to Hersey, over.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 No response.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CKaori 2 to Hersey Kerman, over.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Still nothing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, the response came from Mission Control:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CK.S.P. to Kaori 2\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 we regret to inform you that the commander has perished, over.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMalfry Kerman by this message that he couldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t respond. He had just witnessed Kerbal Space Program\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s first fatality, and it was on the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn! All these miles from the small blue and green planet both Kerbals called \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153home.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a brief EVA to set up a memorial flag at approximately the spot Hersey perished, Malfry went back into the Kaori lander to launch back to the awaiting Tetsuo spacecraft. He pressed the button to launch, there was a sudden jerk\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 and nothing else. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CWhat the hell happened?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Was the first thing that went through is mind. He examined the fuel tank diagnostics: the ascent stage was empty. Then he remembered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CGoddamn it! How could I be so stupid?!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 In the midst of the chaos with the rover and Hersey\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s passing, he had forgot one of the most important procedures in any Kaori mission: since the first (ascent) stage is emptied during descent, it is required that the remaining fuel in the lower stage is transferred into the ascent stage. If you didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t, as Malfry had, than you will be stranded, with no way back home. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/yhmOkk8h.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022yhmOkk8h.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few hours after he had transmitted his unfortunate news, a response finally came: \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CK.S.P. to Kaori 2, we have good news, we have sent a single remotely controlled lander towards your position. Bad news is, it wouldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t reach your location for another eight hours.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe hours passed, and Malfry Kerman watched the sun set behind the giant hills of the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn. Then, in the dark sky, he saw a small streak of light move across the sky outside in the distance. It moved behind the crater, and then\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 a flash. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMalfry\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s heart sank, he knew what had happened before the transmission reached him.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CK.S.P. to Kaori 2, we regret to inform you that the remote lander has crashed, repeat, the remote lander has crashed.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Eventually the decision was made to actually have a manned Kaori-Tetsuo rescue mission, this time with an improved rover, now with four wheels, hopefully making the design more stable than before. Leading the mission and the one who will land on the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn was no other than the legendary Jebidiah Kerman, the first Kerbal to land on the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZTyQz64h.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ZTyQz64h.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few hours after the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnar dawn, Malfry received great news; Jebidiah had landed almost 8 kilometers away, and this time someone remembered to put on the breaks for the rover!
