Btw you should be able to walk around your crew cabin! I really think they should expand on the current IVa and overlay features. IVA should become more like an eva.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dirkidirk","CreatedById":200064,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-12-17T15:22:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nyes\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"James M","CreatedById":167171,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-01-23T23:14:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile I like the idea of being able to explore around in IVA, you have to consider zero G and how we\u0027d have to deal with that. (No VR support there) I will say however that the IVA mode does in fact have all the readouts you technically need. The only thing missing from cockpit view is some way to plan maneuvers or how to tell when a previously planned one is coming up.\u00A0\u00A0Without some sort of digital display, I don\u0027t think it\u0027d be possible.
