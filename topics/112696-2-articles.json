Other civs constantly pestering you to give them free technologies was also annoying in IV, and diplomacy in general is better in Civ V... well as long as you have the expansion packs.

The intention Gaben communicated is laudable, but without hard terms and conditions to back that up, it is nothing more than a pleasant suggestion. They are in no way obligated to do so, and as far as I am aware, have made no arrangements to makes this happen. Both a third party buying Steam and there being financial problems in paradise are scenarios where the people in charge of the money tend to keep it for themselves, meaning that there will be no effort to change availability. There are actually certain legal requirements for companies in trouble that would mostly forbid a move like these, further reducing chances of it ever happening. Though if you look at the legal conditions as they stand, they can pretty much pull the plug tomorrow if they please and there is little anyone can do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah, the future is hazy, but looking at how online services generally fare, and how big companies deal when it comes to consumer promises without any legal basis (and even then declaring bankruptcy will void any promises and contracts) there is little doubt how the end user game libraries will end up. I would love to be proven wrong, but it is somewhat silly to expect it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only realistic way of approaching things is that you view it is a renting service, for however long Steam will exist. Between 5-15 years seems a reasonable expectation. Consider your library already void, and you will be much happier in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022segaprophet\u0022 data-cite=\u0022segaprophet\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnother thought, there is also the possibility of Valve doing away with their current DRM scheme and making offline copies playable as part of their business strategy.

Files will get corrupt and other problems will arise. It might mitigate the problem for a little while, but it does not solve it.
