I know there are a few more in need of rescue still.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m currently rescuing 4 at a time when I can. I am kind of getting tired of it - but on the plus side I am building up a good team! The other good thing is, rescued Kerbals always get xp to start with, so are invariably level 1 from the get go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI feel that they should have limited the rescue mission so you could not exceed the maximum of the astronaut complex (ie if no more capacity, no more rescue missions), but it\u0027s good money so I wont complain too much.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
