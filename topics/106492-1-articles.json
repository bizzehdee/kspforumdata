I have 15 of 12 right now, and I\u0027ve hired all of .. ONE. And I have two minmus rescues outstanding right now.\n\nI wouldn\u0027t have even upgraded the complex once for that, but the second one is required for .. EVA or somesuch."},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRender","CreatedById":10651,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T05:37:18Z","Content":"The prevalence of Kerbal rescue missions does seem to be much higher now. I once had the entire list of potential missions be rescue contracts. Granted, I had to engineer it that way a bit, but it took surprisingly few rejected contracts for it to work out that way."},{"CreatedByName":"boostme","CreatedById":118817,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T05:47:39Z","Content":"Yeah. It just feels wrong to decline a kerbal in need. I\u0027m a softy that way.\n\nAlso Squad: Wow! Thanks. I\u0027m having loads of fun. I\u0027m going to continue filling my space hotel and see if I can make a record or something."},{"CreatedByName":"bakanando","CreatedById":126310,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T05:59:35Z","Content":"I designed a space hotel in 0.90 as a station for training kerbals where a interplanetary tug takes them around the kerbin SoI and a smaller shuttle is used to bring them back home. I might do something similar in my new 1.0 save."},{"CreatedByName":"Merinsan","CreatedById":57629,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T06:00:50Z","Content":"I currently have 15 Kerbals working for me, with a limit of 12, and I\u0027ve not hired a single Kerbal. I know there are a few more in need of rescue still.\n\nI\u0027m currently rescuing 4 at a time when I can. I am kind of getting tired of it - but on the plus side I am building up a good team! The other good thing is, rescued Kerbals always get xp to start with, so are invariably level 1 from the get go.\n\nI feel that they should have limited the rescue mission so you could not exceed the maximum of the astronaut complex (ie if no more capacity, no more rescue missions), but it\u0027s good money so I wont complain too much."}]}
