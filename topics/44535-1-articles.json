Try putting fuel lines all over the place. If that doesn\u0027t work, then try to quickly move the fuel manually to the tank closest to the engine before you get too close to 70km. My SSTO prototype is kinda like that. I haven\u0027t worked on it for a while, and it has a flaw where the engines on the outer wings use the fuel in the back sections of the craft, which is supposed to be reserved for the emergency rocket engine. They\u0027re supposed to draw from the tanks I have along the fuselage in the front, which would be easy to fix with fuel lines but like I said I haven\u0027t worked on it in a while and it\u0027s not the biggest problem with the craft anyway. I do use it from time to time, for special operations.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tiron","CreatedById":51836,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-01T07:46:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Supernovy\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Supernovy\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMoved to Gameplay Questions and Tutorials.\u003Cp\u003EDo you have enough oxidiser?
