General construction comes in handy in places, but Science tech is a better immediate return on investment. You can get lots more science much faster with the new instruments. General construction is better if you tend to overbuild missions. If you have launch clamps and some of the larger fuel tanks and the skipper engine, you have enough from there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL;DR, go science tech now, and you can fill out the rest of the tree faster. Going General construction will let you build bigger, but building bigger does not get you science any faster.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JtPB","CreatedById":103925,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-23T19:55:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Evisiting the Mun \u0026amp; Minmus is enough to unlock all the tree? or should i do a little jump to Duna to complete the science points?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-23T23:15:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGo for braces, launch clamps, fuel lines, and oxstat solar panels as soon as possible.
