There\u0027s something wrong with your game. I just tried it and they\u0027re perfectly centered. If you have mods, one of them could be messing up the placement for some reason. It\u0027s probably best to reinstall the whole game."},{"CreatedByName":"Camaron","CreatedById":100218,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T04:37:11Z","Content":"Bugs or not, some of the stock parts truly are awful.

The Jet fuel tank has a much bigger diameter, and it looks so wrong when connected to other 1.25m parts.\n\nThe mainsail also isn\u0027t symmetrical and perfectly round (iirc). When clipping it into a tank a part of it comes out"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T08:47:21Z","Content":"What bugs me the most is that the square parts (rover core, iron plate) behave as round when you try to attach something to a side. Making undercarriage from the 2x2 plate and 4 wheels requires quite a bit of Shift\u002BQ/Shift\u002BE to make the wheels all point in one direction."},{"CreatedByName":"Rhomphaia","CreatedById":2440,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T09:19:09Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E was looking at some of the new parts added in the last patch, when I notice that the Thermal Control Systems Large and Medium are both off center when you put them on the side of a tank \n\u003E Any other people notice this ?\n\nThe small one too.\n\n![Z4baFny.gif](http://i.imgur.com/Z4baFny.gif)"}]}
