The mission states to complete a space walk in orbit. I have my craft in a near perfect orbit at 95km and I am able to EVA my kerbal but looking at the mission tab my mission is not complete. I even let go and jetpacked around a bit to see if that would do it. I then re-entered atmosphere and recovered my vessel from the ocean to see if that would do it. Sure its only a side mission but I want the xp and satisfaction haha\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-12-24T01:03:37Z\u0022 title=\u002212/24/2023 01:03  AM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Dec 24\u0022\u003EDecember 24, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by The Space Peacock\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"18Watt","CreatedById":198538,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-12-24T00:37:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was able to complete that mission with no issues. \u00A0 I believe my orbit was similar, with AP less than 100 km. \u00A0I didn\u0027t even let go of the vessel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn my case, I had \u0027tracked\u0027 the mission. \u00A0Trying to think of things which could have been different on your launch. \u00A0I used a pretty basic vessel, early crew-pod with a parachute and heat-shield.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
