I wonder, if this might also happen, if we do NOT use any \u0022workaround\u0022 to complete those 41 tasks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(( The thing is: The first time i encountered this, i had to find my tricky solution to get my ackknowledgement on the \u0022under pressure\u0022 mission. I launged and transfered to Eve, i entered it\u0027s atmo, a heatshield was not pointing straight to retrograde, so it had seemingly NO protection at one corner (strange behaviour, too), overheated quickly, broke, i had to load... Then i landed, i lifted, transfered Kerbals to a carrier ship (i could have pushed their bay), and landed Kerbin. Mission not accomplished. I did not accept this, so i \u0022infinited\u0022 this one ... like ... again. ))\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince the last mission was \u0022fullfilled\u0022, i encounter the popping up of the green window.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSame on a kampagn i freshly started, just to workaround the \u0022bug(?)\u0022. I a hurry i completed anything. Same result. I\u0027d LOVE to play a private campagne WITH all Missions solved, and WITHOUT this popup window.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny educated comments on this? Will it stay like this forever, and i have to \u0022non-cheaty\u0022 fulfill the programs conditions (which in dept i can\u0027t exactly tell... only that Mission control grants the thing or otherwise doesnt), or is this a known issue, maybe for anyone how completed the 41, and will have a fix in the (near) future? I\u0027d really love to know. Thanks for ackkowledging.
