For moheart you are landing on an very uneven surface in the bottom of an hole and terrain is bugged so larger landing legs and wheels make you bounce around.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-----\u003Cbr\u003E\nNot an bug you can easy replicate without mods without replaying the story but is also very unlikely to be mod related.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EIncluded Attachments:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-03-18T21:43:51Z\u0022 title=\u002203/18/2024 09:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Mar 18\u0022\u003EMarch 18\u003C/time\u003E by Spicat\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
