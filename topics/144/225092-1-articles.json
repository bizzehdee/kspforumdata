Then attempting to select one of your previous games will cause that save to just disappear. Navigating to the save folder shows that it is still there, but KSP2 will not show it to me. This is not a new bug as of the current version, but I am not sure as to which version I first encountered it. Please note: in the attached screenshots, the one a sandbox campaign called \u0027default\u0027 comes chronologically first. The second screenshot was the immediate result of clicking onto the empty rectangle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EIncluded Attachments:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022Screenshot2024-06-11225322.png.e4fc1c51a9b2265bbe55d52337d86cf1.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/uploads/monthly_2024_06/Screenshot2024-06-11225322.png.e4fc1c51a9b2265bbe55d52337d86cf1.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022Screenshot2024-06-11225337.png.802616d333bf85c7e77170c8b133b72f.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/uploads/monthly_2024_06/Screenshot2024-06-11225337.png.802616d333bf85c7e77170c8b133b72f.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-06-11T22:06:24Z\u0022 title=\u002206/11/2024 10:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Jun 11\u0022\u003EJune 11\u003C/time\u003E by The Space Peacock\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DeW","CreatedById":198602,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-07-02T08:07:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn my case, campaign and saves were corrupt by a lack of free space. I recovered my VM with good but older saves from a backup. There is no obvious way to simply use an existing good save file from the campaign folder to continue the game.
