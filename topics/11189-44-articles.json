You will need 1 turbojet with 8 intakes to lift 11 tons of weight (including the turbojet and airintakes of course).\n2. You will need to reach at least 2150 m/s before 36.000 m to have a \u003C100m/s DV for 100km apoapsis circularization maneuver,\n3. To reach such a speed your will need at least 75 lt of jet fuel.\n4. The best launching strategy is to reach as soon as possible 350m/s of ascensional speed (eg. with a step slope ascent curve), then level and speed up until the needed speed is reached in less than 5 mins.\n5. If you don\u0027t need to transfer your ship around the Kerbol system, but just to reach orbit you can doit using small rocket and so less rocket fuel.\n6. Smart strategy is to divide the jet fuel flows from the rocket fuel flow: an perfect SSTO will burnout all it\u0027s jet fuel just before reach space and before engage rockets.\n7. SSTO need to be tested in any fuel condition, because also the reenter and/or re approach the runaway can be hard without a balanced plane: so the wing design and the weight displacement is one of the main goal. When you are designing a SSTO find a balance center without fuel tanks an then place them without moving that center.\n\n**Using that advices I produced a brand new SSTO cargo: the** **Sparrow**. \n\n- weights less than 40 tons without the 20ton payload\n- is a STOL plane that will fly at 20m/s: landing almost anywhere was never so easy\n- just 6 engines for 60tons\n- fast (2200 m/s at 34.000 m(with payload)\n- Very good flight maneuvers performance\n- Full SS (docking and balanced RCS)\n\nSpecial made wings \\*yes another gate crasher\\* using the [procedural wings](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/29862) by DJY is probably one of my best spaceplanes. I\u0027m extensively using it to build a new (large) SpaceStation around kerbin.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

I think you are right, the electric charge transfer is unavoidable on a station with power generators. Its might be open to abuse but I am inclined to discount charge entirely from the K Prize rules on fuel transfer except in a case where it contributes to ion propulsion where it acts as fuel, which will have to be judged case by case. Pernickety attitude control related electricity transfer rules are not going to add to the enjoyment of the K-Prize especially when you can use Timewarp to reduce the amount of control you need already by stopping rotation.
