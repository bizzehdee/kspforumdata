It seems to me, from glancing around the kerbal forums, few people are as heavily invested into SRB research as I am.. maybe because people already decided they\\\u0027re not worth looking at anymore? Personally, I have a great deal of fun trying to push them to compete with the liquid engine designs (as impossible as that it is for long distance travel). I\\\u0027m even considering trying to make it to the moon with SRBs! But that\\\u0027s far from now, for now I\\\u0027m just tinkering with how to cram a lot of them in a small space effectively. There\\\u0027s a few techniques that I had to come up with to overcome overheating and drastic shifts in speed, as well as weight limits (I\\\u0027ll leave you to figure those out from the craft file or on your own if you\\\u0027re interested at all). There\\\u0027s a few more things I want to try, and then I\\\u0027ll move onto Honeycomb III, which basically will be made from scratch with what I\\\u0027ve learned in mind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, either way I\\\u0027ve decided to share the fruits of my SRB experiments:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe Honeycomb II\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img265.imageshack.us/img265/880/honeycombiiside.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022honeycombiiside.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img256.imageshack.us/img256/3754/honeycombiitop.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022honeycombiitop.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome stats about the Honeycomb II:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt caps out at around 3km/s @ ~56km depending on how well you can time the first to second stage transition.
