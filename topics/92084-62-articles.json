A lot of papers suggested Charon might collect some of that material and have a transient atmosphere, however the occultation data (again, it\u0027s preliminary data) suggests no atmosphere whatsoever. However, we\u0027re going to have to wait for the spectral data to confirm that. Also, many scientists think that Mordor (Charon\u0027s reddish polar cap) is a thin veener due to volatiles coming from Pluto, freezing onto Charon\u0027s coldest spots and being chemically transformed into non-volatile tholins.
