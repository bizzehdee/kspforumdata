Here\\\u0027s the old thread: [http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=3206.msg32791#msg32791](http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=3206.msg32791#msg32791)\n\nSince then I\\\u0027ve made a number of videos, but kept forgetting to post them here. Without any more wasted time, here we go:\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/V_jNppkO1Wg?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n One of my first designs created for 0.14 which incorporated the then new landing legs; I specifically created this video to test a new encoder I was using, and it worked a bit better than previous videos. As people asked for annotations, I whipped some up describing what was going on in the video.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/_aW4T3smRzw?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n Soon afterwards I became enamoured with mechjeb; one of the first things I tried to do was discover how well it could handle a damaged or otherwise unflyable-by-a-human vehicle. Turns out, it can handle some things well, others not so much.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/bzGqv5CWBvI?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n This was the first craft I redesigned from scratch; I noticed many of my assumptions about part weights were wrong, and the redesign was done to address this, specifically this uses radial decouplers whenever possible since they\\\u0027re half the weight of a vertical one, and tries to keep the weight as centered near the base of the ship as possible.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/rSj4b9jEazA?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n When I took this video originally I thought I had discovered a bug; instead I discovered shortly afterwards that it was meant to work in this way. Obstructed engines provide no thrust - I even hacked a booster into orbit to test this. (Not shown in this video)\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/hG5WV6BbsfM?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n This was the first aircraft I created in 0.15. Reversed engines work great!\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/xAXhUK1GOGc?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n Turns out revving the engines on an aircraft in the water really screws with your fps, and plays havoc with the sound effects engine too - [glow=red,2,300]Warning! Noisy![/glow]\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/tYpiK6S1ylc?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n I discovered shortly afterwards that you could attach aircraft engines to spacecraft - this was a prototype design just to show its feasability; aircraft engines work \\*very\\* well up until around 10-12k, and comparatively sip on fuel. The engines in this video were all drawing off of one tank per wing. Later experiments got up to \\*eight\\* engines per wing and it was still stalling at 12k with plenty of fuel left in the one tank!.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/jr66LcbytYc?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n A minor design change from the previous prototype, but really this is all about the camera perspective used. I just wish there was a camera mode that worked relative to the ship\\\u0027s orientation rather than anything else. I really like how you can see the ship vibrating from the first stage\\\u0027s engines.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/MITQ6ndBN4w?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n This shows staging in space with one of my latest designs, then demonstrates just how \\*insanely precise\\* mechjeb can be - lands within four meters of a spacecraft. Finally, I end the video with a successful attempt to replicate a Mako style landing from Mass Effect using an unmanned mun rover."},{"CreatedByName":"SkyHook","CreatedById":31496,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-13T13:41:00Z","Content":"Good work man! =P"}]}
