You have two options for the aerobrake too, 1) you can aerobrake at Jool to bring your apoapsis in line with Laythe orbit (this is usually done with a periapsis around 116-119km) then set up a Laythe injection and aerobrake again at Laythe (usually about 22km) or 2) Head in to Laythe directly from an interplanetary trajectory and aerobrake there (only tried this once but I think the aerobrake was around 21km).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously 2 is more convenient but it relies on getting that Laythe encounter conveniently, plus Laythe\u0027s sphere of influence is much smaller so you have less time (and thus it costs more dV) to set up your periapsis for aerobraking.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SunJumper","CreatedById":27062,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-15T12:50:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis depends on how long you are willing to wait, but, my d/v aims for such a mission:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSC - LKO: 4.5km/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELKO - HSO: 0.9km/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHSO - Jool: 3km/s (can do the above as one burn to save 1.4km/s, requires better timing)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECorrection: 0.2km/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECapture: 0km/s (aerocapture).
