Since most of kerbals are KIA (because of the map/star system/galaxy change from OPM \u002B NH to KG2 (KerbalGalaxy2 :\u0022\u003E )) I hired one, placed him in a ship and hyper-edited it to orbit Miller\u0027s planet to test my tweaked Reflectron GX-128 in sending data to Kerbin. Didn\u0027t realize it will take a long time for an alignment to occur so I decided to put another manned-ship type to the opposite end so I relay the signal. For some reason, the first ship I sent out doesn\u0027t show anymore in the tracking station and the kerbal is listed as KIA in the astronaut\u0027s complex ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\nI went back again to the VAB to make another test ship with multiple GX-128s and half of the parts button and all of the options at the top screen aren\u0027t clickable anymore. ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\nTask manager shows KSP running a little about 2MB with the following mods:\n\nKSP: 1.0.4 (Win32) \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Unity: 4.6.4f1 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 OS: Windows 8.1 (6.3.9600) 64bit\n\nFilter Extensions\n\nUSI Tools\n\nChatterer\n\nCommunity Resource Pack\n\nContract Configurator\n\nContract Pack: Anomaly Surveyor\n\nContract Pack: Tourism Plus\n\nDMagic Orbital Science\n\nFirespitter\n\nInterstellar Fuel Switch\n\nKerbal Attachment System\n\nKerbal Engineer Redux\n\nKerbal Joint Reinforcement\n\nKerboKatzUtilities\n\nForScienceContinued!\n\nStork\n\nKerbal Inventory System\n\nKSP-AVC Plugin\n\nInfernal Robots\n\nModular Rocket Systems Lite\n\nNear Future Electrical\n\nFinal Frontier\n\nPilot Assistant\n\nPlanetShine\n\nRemoteTech\n\nDeepFreeze Continued\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6\n\nSCANsat\n\nSETI-Greenhouse\n\nShip Manifest\n\nStageRecovery\n\nTarsierSpaceTechnology\n\nTextureReplacer\n\nThrottleControlledAvionics\n\nTAC Life Support\n\nKerbal Alarm Clock\n\nAlternate Resource Panel\n\nTransfer Window Planner\n\nTweakScale\n\nUniversal Storage\n\nKSP Interstellar Extended\n\nWaypoint Manager\n\nOSE Workshop\n\n[x] Science!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-18T03:20:50Z\u0022 title=\u002207/18/2015 03:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Vist**"},{"CreatedByName":"Artyomka15","CreatedById":130209,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-18T08:38:34Z","Content":"New version will be released next week.

First, will the gargantuan system have its third planet (Edmunds planet?) the desert world? It was featured in the end of the movie, and was one of the characters options when picking mann\u0027s planet. Now if I remember, and read correctly, this desert world orbited a star, that was orbiting the black hole. Correct me if im wrong though. Either way, I would love to see this addition, even if it has to just be another planet orbiting the black hole. Second question, The NIM system. Will this ever get its own planet(s)? I mean we all know not every star has planets or dwarf planets, but how about some really big asteroids like gilly? Or maybe a dwarf planet? Either way, will continue playing through this mod, good luck!"},{"CreatedByName":"daniel l.","CreatedById":57763,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-18T23:01:42Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E New version will be released next week.
