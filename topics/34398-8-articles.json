I realized there was an easy way to make my chairs fit the Kerbals. I just imported one of the stock internals into Blender and, so now I can get the correct angles and sizes the various parts need to be. The chairs are pretty short, the width is easily twice the length. At some point I\u0027ll have to update the older internals with proper-fitting seats, but that can wait. I\u0027m pretty close to being done, Just those chairs and sound to go.
