Considering that the game is in... alpha, I think(dunno, new here and still learning the game and whatnot), you might have a issue with keeping all your old backups and not doing housekeeping to get rid of ones you no longer use. I once had to get rid of several gigs of old minecraft installs and mods because I was just a *bit* too careful and kept literally everything I had downloaded for minecraft. And I kept working installs with mods saved in a even safer place for some stupid reason.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy point is you should not hoard your old editions and old mods/installs. Eventually, you need to let them die to get space for new installs and mods/editions. Honestly, I\u0027d want to find a way to make a rotation of installs where it automatically keeps, say, 5 versions of the game, and 3 installs for each one(plus vanilla). If a update is released and I install it, then it purges the oldest version of the game I had, mods, installs, everything from that version, unless I make a manual backup. I\u0027d want to do this, but I honestly doubt I\u0027d be bothered nearly as much as I was back when I played minecraft alpha. I\u0027m not going to keep saves, installs, or even editions of the game, but I\u0027ll update at my own pace.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat being said, unless Squad has some fireworks as part of the next update, I wouldn\u0027t update tomorrow.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FITorion","CreatedById":7606,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-03T16:17:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E.20 broke my .19\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey\u0027ve said that they are trying to make it so updates don\u0027t break saves.
