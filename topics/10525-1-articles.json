Its appearance is however a bit odd; squid-like and no wheels.\n\nThe first \\\u0027version\\\u0027 of my Munar Rover was made of a capsule, RSC-tank and a number of RSC-thrusters. It turned out the RSC-tank was very fragile and prone to destruction upon contact with Munar surface, even with speeds just around 5 m/s. The brilliant solution was spamming a row of landing legs on the RSC-tank, improving the strength of the improvised Munar Rover dramatically. \n\nThe last test was an enormous succes; despite terrible piloting the Rover survived for almost 2 minutes ... !\n\nThis design has some drawbacks:\n\n-Capsule is now weak point \n\n-Very hard to control\n\n-Kerbals cannot return to Kerbin\n\n-Still prone to destruction\n\n![1ny1ib.jpg](http://i45.tinypic.com/1ny1ib.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"GoodGuy","CreatedById":17980,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-13T01:01:57Z","Content":"How does it work, exactly? does the landing legs propel it?"},{"CreatedByName":"Anachronda","CreatedById":23187,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-13T03:34:46Z","Content":"I suspect he uses the RCS to roll it along.

The landing legs functions more or less as protection for the fragile RCS-tank.
