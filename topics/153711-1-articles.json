They also rotate (forward/back) differently depending on where you are controlling them from.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKlaws, Command pods, probe cores, and docking ports can all be set as the \u0022control point\u0022 for the ship. And they can point in all different directions. If you have a klaw on both the front and back of your rover, and you switch\u00A0the \u0022control from here\u0022 from one to the other, then all your steering will get reversed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf your control point is pointing UP, and you are trying to steer some rover wheels, then funny things can happen. The wheels may steer all wrong. They may fight each other for which direction is forward or backward, and you may end up going nowhere. That all depends on how the symmetry of the wheels was set when you created the rover, and whether you built the rover in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E. You can see whether it\u0027s likely that you will have a problem just by looking at the navball.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou say you docked your \u0022movers\u0022 to your Hub. Therefore you must have some kind of docking ports pointing sideways. If you right click on one of those\u00A0docking ports and click the \u0022Control from Here\u0022 button -- that may completely fix your problem. Or make it a different problem, at least.
