Id guess that there might be so called part occlusion (say you place a fuel tank behind a nose cone, only the nose cone is considered to exert any drag), so id guess clipped pats could act as if they were hidden behind something else. Still, until release, we can only speculate, hopefully wing effects on other wings and parts blocking wings arent modeled, but if they are RIP sci-fi replicas, as most of them NEED wings/surfaces/ect clipped inside to function at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe one surefire way to cancel drag (that im aware of) is clipping stuff into one of those utility or cargo bays, as thatll flag them as shielded and they shouldnt be affected or even checked by the aero model untill you open said bay. Im actually tempted to make a reentry aircraft that has wings inside one of those utility bays, is capable of reentrying on its own,\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Eric S","CreatedById":57117,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-21T16:17:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022bdito\u0022 data-cite=\u0022bdito\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EClipping has always allowed you to bury things but it\u0027s never affected anything, even in FAR.
