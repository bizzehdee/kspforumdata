The rest of the install carried on fine so I didn\u0027t look too hard. I got into 1.1.2, put a plane on the Tier 1 airstrip (one up from dirt) and all three wheels of a plane that worked in 1.1 were completely embedded into the ground. Throttling took ages to create speed because it wasn\u0027t just visual, the wheels are failing to function at all as wheels, and are basically just a rigid part grinding against the surface.\u00A0When I hit around 22km/s the steering wheel in the rear exploded. So I went back to see what this updating error was, and if something had broken the install.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m unhappy to report that the error is the launcher\u0027s updater trying to update a file that the updater itself has in use and won\u0027t release. (see screenshot above) I\u0027m going to assume that this log file that wants renamed\u00A0is just a log file, and doesn\u0027t affect the rest of the update process. Which means I have a good clean copy of 1.1.2 - the version that patched broken\u00A0wheels from\u00A0the 1.1.1\u00A0patch for the broken wheels in 1.1 - and this new version\u00A0has broken wheels on a whole new level.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n---\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCareer mode doesn\u0027t work so long as you can\u0027t use the first\u00A0wheels the game gives to you. You can\u0027t build your first plane. You can\u0027t do any of the site survey missions that take players to new biomes where they can legitimately collect more science. (You can, but players mustn\u0027t be expected to build crazy rockets, out of early-game parts,\u00A0to deliver them to locations below 18km -- and I don\u0027t believe that\u0027s not how you intend it to be played.)\u00A0Between getting an\u00A0orbit and starting to run Moon missions all you can do is test parts and move tourists around. Building planes is not an option right now, even though it is exactly the intended path for players to follow and exactly what Mission Control emphasizes at that stage of the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDear Squad, THIS is the game of your game. You don\u0027t seem to pay much attention to the game of your game. Version after version, since 0.24, and well past 1.0 now, I have watched as this team has favored adding new parts\u00A0and new game\u00A0mechanics,\u00A0tweaking the physics, altering atmospheric drag formulas, and developing virtually every other area of the sandbox in which the game takes place OVER THE GAME THAT TAKES PLACE.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour playtesters clearly do not have a script to follow to test career mode, and they should. This team, and I\u0027m talking about the\u00A0development team,\u00A0needs to have more than just a soft-idea of what players will be doing with their newly unlocked parts as they progress through the career mode of the game. Mission control should be a central priority for you,\u00A0as it is the conduit through which new players see what they should try next, as well as what the game believes them\u00A0able to do with the tech they have, or will be getting soon. And at least some portion of your playtesters need to have a checklist of basic milestones to fulfill in each and every new iteration of the game that is passed down to them to verify that the path of the game --\u00A0most importantly the early game -- still works no matter the version. Because that\u0027s the GAME of this game. It\u0027s important. It should be the MOST important.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m taking time to write this because you could not have released this version, or the two that preceded it\u00A0if you had already taken this idea to heart; if it truly was a priority to you. Releasing, but over and over again, in this state\u00A0evidences a mind that has been so focused on implementing a more expansive sandbox that it has come to\u00A0devalue\u00A0game progression to the point that it\u0027s okay for the Career paths\u00A0to be completely and utterly broken -- if just for *this* release. It is not okay. It hasn\u0027t been okay since 1.0. And it should not be okay to you any more, or ever again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n---\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI will make myself\u00A0available if you\u0027d like to hire me to direct\u00A0playtesting.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThat role is supposed to be filled by an impassioned critic who rubs you the wrong way.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSomeone who won\u0027t quietly let things like this slide.
