My backwards solution was to make planes that land at very slow speed, so that any flat-ish surface was safe-ish to land on. You can either use lots of wings, a VTOL engine, parachutes, or some combination. The VTOL was my favorite, because it could compensate for varying air density at different altitudes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut to answer your question more directly, if you can find a safe flat runway site, I agree about the flag / hud markers. They don\u0027t cause any lag, and are not substantial if you happen to hit one. If you are brave, you could even hack the persistent.sfs file to arrange them perfectly. I don\u0027t prefer lights anymore, because the lights at the far end of the runway won\u0027t be visible until you have already crossed the near end, due to the 2.3 km physics range limit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
