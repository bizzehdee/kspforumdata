Though it quickly turned into that. Long ago all there was was the gun DYJ created and missiles/lazer that Romfarer had created. Weapons that would either destroy or not destroy a part. I wanted to put a damage system of some kind in place so I asked Rom about it and he wasn\u0026#39;t interested in doing it. I started making Skillful a week or so later.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo Skillful was always a damage mod, but registering hits from DYJ\u0026#39;s or Rom\u0026#39;s stuff wasn\u0026#39;t where I wanted to go, for it to work I had to make my own weapons... The other weapons that existed at the time were OP. In my mind everything is still OP. Needless to say Skillful then slowly fell into a weapons mod as that\u0026#39;s the only way I could keep the damage system working within a confined set of rules. This led to feature creep and the eventual burn-out.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSkillful hasn\u0026#39;t really been worked on for over a year now, but still stands out for a few features that haven\u0026#39;t yet been copied by other modders. Torpedoes, deforming mesh damage, armour that works like armour, dynamic fires, leaks, repairs, reloading eva from other vessels in range, land based fires that will heat parts facing it within a range. Missiles and guns that can hit targets well beyond visual range (guns up to 8km and missiles 99km I believe).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWith the many changes to KSP as things accelerated to the 1.0 release I found I had less and less time and/or desire to expand upon and keep peoples interest in the mod - having 2 kids, a full time job and being 40 it was becoming an issue with my private life. In any case this remains as it was at the 0.90 release, no further changes were made except to keep it alive in 1.0.5. This very well may be the last update for Skillful, thanks to all those who used it and enjoyed it - it sure was a blast at times making this!\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nTTFN - ID\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-16T19:20:33Z\u0022 title=\u002211/16/2015 07:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by InfiniteDice\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Acea","CreatedById":98766,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-16T19:39:22Z","Content":"\nSurprised to find Skillful got updated, and I\u0026#39;ll probably miss this mod after KSP 1.1.
