Capacity for 2 Kerbals, and takes a small shuttle vehicle to an 80km LKO orbit with a single stage. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe shuttle is powered by an LV-909 and has 2.9k dV. Plenty to peruse the Kerbin system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose big engines can be little much and put a lot of stress on the craft at full throttle and it can get a bit flippy. But some careful throttling and attention paid to AoA and it\u0027s really not at all that difficult.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can make a variant of the lifter stage if you haven\u0027t unlocked the tech for the biggest rockets yet. A lifter stage of two orange tanks and a Twin Boar with a set of fins will get it mostly there with just the last couple hundred dV to circularize left up to the shuttle. (though it does look a bit ridiculous with the smaller 2.5m tanks and such a large fairing)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis one is pretty much WYSIWYG, nothing fancy here.
