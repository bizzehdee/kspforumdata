Capacity for 2 Kerbals, and takes a small shuttle vehicle to an 80km LKO orbit with a single stage. \n\nThe shuttle is powered by an LV-909 and has 2.9k dV. Plenty to peruse the Kerbin system.\n\nThose big engines can be little much and put a lot of stress on the craft at full throttle and it can get a bit flippy. But some careful throttling and attention paid to AoA and it\u0027s really not at all that difficult.\n\nYou can make a variant of the lifter stage if you haven\u0027t unlocked the tech for the biggest rockets yet. A lifter stage of two orange tanks and a Twin Boar with a set of fins will get it mostly there with just the last couple hundred dV to circularize left up to the shuttle. (though it does look a bit ridiculous with the smaller 2.5m tanks and such a large fairing)\n\nThis one is pretty much WYSIWYG, nothing fancy here. Enjoy!\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

But I wanted it to be a single stage to orbit craft so its just a wee bit over-engineered.\n\nLike I mentioned, you can replace the large lifter section with a couple orange tanks and a twin boar to bring the cost down quite a bit, however it isn\u0027t very aesthetically pleasing in that config. And you\u0027ll have to use the shuttle section to circularize. \n\nSure there are probably better and definitely cheaper ways to get this up there, but this isn\u0027t an efficiency craft, its a balls to the wall, your-grandma-wish-she-had-this-ship-growin\u0027-up kinda craft. get it."},{"CreatedByName":"Columbia","CreatedById":135031,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T12:45:38Z","Content":"Very well-done design!
