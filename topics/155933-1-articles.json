I made the experience myself yesterday when searching for capsule mods, with neither Google nor the forum search feature giving me anything helpful; a few people answered to the thread I made, giving some obvious suggestions of well-known mods that for some reasons I didn\u0027t remember existed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUntil very recently, we used to have a Community Mods and Plugins Library thread which was essentially a thread aiming to gather all mods for KSP for people to be able to find them easily. Very ambitious but equally helpful. This thread was lost along several other add-ons thread in the beginning of January, and as I understand it there is little to no hope of getting it back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I\u0027m wondering how many people would be interested by a new thread continuing this library.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI should be able to do it, but if someone wants to start one themselves, go ahead!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"adsii1970","CreatedById":89014,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-03T14:47:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s a great idea to bring back the library...

A library is useful if you have a vague idea of what you want but don\u0027t know any precise mod name and can\u0027t be asked going through dozens of pages of Add-on Releases.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA library, as I imagine it, would just be a list of mods with links to their threads and a few words explaining what they do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeh, I\u0027ll do it.
