Graphics are lovely. Fuel balance seems interestingly different from KSP1 but there are bugs interfering with gameplay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022?imw=5000\u0026amp;imh=5000\u0026amp;ima=fit\u0026amp;impolicy=Lett\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/2017086996360233421/C840F302FBE71207FF38BACBB91F4C4D1C32540A/?imw=5000\u0026amp;imh=5000\u0026amp;ima=fit\u0026amp;impolicy=Letterbox\u0026amp;imcolor=%23000000\u0026amp;letterbox=false\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have to say I noticed quite a few things that deserve fixing. I am sure intercept devs know this but I will try to be useful by itemising the ones that I encountered as a player and which stuck in my memory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirstly the Kraken is alive and well and living in low Mun orbit. I noticed creeping PE and AP values in low Mun orbit below 20km, also apparent tank draining after lift off to return from Mun, even in timewarp, when engines were shut down by pressing X, which continued until above an altitude of about 20km. This cannot be atmospheric drag from a light atmosphere as the engines were shut down, so there is a bug in the midst of low orbit calcs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCould not double click the Mun to focus on it in map, unlike Kerbin and unlike the tutorial advice, had to right click and select focus for the Mun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso the ship just exploded spontaneously in low orbit when applying time warp during a fairly swift rotation and then coming out of timewarp. Just blew apart, spaghettified. Luckily I was able to reload. Fairings (interstage scallop type) also repeatedly jumped about as they drifted away after separation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI got a vessel recovery tutorial message on landing on the Mun. Surely you should not be able to recover a vessel from the Mun (I didnt try) and the message should only apply on Kerbin?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe navball is illegible at 1080p. Cannot read the numbers properly, they are too small and are pixelating. I would comment there is a lot of navball display area being wasted with thick black empty borders, which we dont need and the navball could probably be \u0026gt;10% bigger if these were removed, the other indicators in the central roundel optimised (moved out and slimmed) and the numbers\u00A0 on the navball given a larger font too. The peripheral shading/dithering on the navball to indicate spherical shadow doesnt work very well as it is obviously pixel sized black dots when the shade of the ball hue needs to be greyed. Wrong effect is being used here imho.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEVA input control settings have the jetpack \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E down button hard coded to left CTRL.
