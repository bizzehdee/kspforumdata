This might not be a factor if we could combine decouplers with the motors above them into a single stage, but as we know there is a decoupler bug that forces us to keep the decouplers in their own stage or risk towing spent empty stages behind us forever. En if it were not for this bug, some might prefer to have the decoupler in it\u0027s own stage so that they can control the start of the motor separately form the staging event that jetisons the lower stage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExpected bahavior: delta-V is listed in the same stage with the motor that provides it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
