The number of messages seems to correlate with the number of scene changes per play session. For example after doing an EVA on Minmus two scene changes occurred (leaving the craft and reboarding) which lead to three messages appearing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022HcY0RI2.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022120.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/HcY0RI2.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
