I have two kerbals in the lander can and one in the command pod. I then launch into a suborbital trajectory and while in space, ditch the fairing, launch escape tower, and attempt to flip the command pod around and dock with the lander. I\u0027ve noticed the following issues which are very repeatable\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) After decoupling the two parts of the craft, I can right click on the docking port of the command pod and \u0022control from here\u0022 but when right clicking on the lander\u0027s docking port, it also says \u0022control from here\u0022 instead of \u0022set as target\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) I can then switch back and forth between the two parts and eventually get both of them appropriately set for \u0022control from here\u0022 on their own docking ports and \u0022set as target\u0022 on the other docking port, but how many times I have to switch back and forth seems inconsistent\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) When I first switch to the lander can, sometimes the navball appears locked in place and no matter what inputs I give, it does not move\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4) Sometimes, when I eventually get them both pointed at each other, the lander will go into an uncontrolled spin. Switching to that craft and turning off \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E allows me to stop the spin, but as soon as I stop providing roll input, it starts swinging and rolling out of control again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQuicksave immediately after decoupling the two halves and then repeated quickloading is required to have a chance at docking the crafts. If the navball appears locked at step 3, the uncontrollable rolling seems gauranteed to happen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nsave file immediately before decoupling can be found here for reproduction:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1q6QfLPvFZcW6_00FyglkiS2MgE3PX0RO?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1q6QfLPvFZcW6_00FyglkiS2MgE3PX0RO?usp=sharing\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
