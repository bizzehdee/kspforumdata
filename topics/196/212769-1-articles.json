They are just completely still not moving at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile trying to intercept a craft I found that while time warping the intercept node is saying the wrong intercept, it just circles between what intercept 1 and 2 were when you started the time warp.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother is that sometimes in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E when you press launch it simply does not launch, no error message or warning, it just doesn\u0027t launch, even if you select a different launchpad or clear debris from every other launchpad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, I turned on infinite propellant and then later turned it off and the next day when I turned it back off and hit apply settings, it turned back on soon after for no reason.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith fairings, if you put something inside one and launch, it sometimes shakes the entire rocket uncontrollably and sometimes stops shaking when you stage, but the payload is often glitched halfway out of the fairing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nManoeuvre nodes give the burn time and everything, however the required deltaV doesn\u0027t decrease while burning, it just acts as if the manoeuvre was made at the current trajectory. For example, if I made a manoeuvre\u00A0 that put me from Kerbin orbit to Munar orbit, then performed it, once I completed the manoeuvre , my trajectory would be correct, but the manoeuvre would be showing the trajectory as if I planned it from already being on a Munar trajectory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeneath the manoeuvre description, where it gives burn time, required \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E and time to stop burning, there is a bar that shows you how long you should burn for, but there is a weird \u00273\u0027 that is below this bar that doesn\u0027t change or have any relevance as far as I can see.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have no idea how some of these got past any amount of testing, if any testing was done at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-02-25T20:22:22Z\u0022 title=\u002202/25/2023 08:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 25, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by tomri207\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eadded some more\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"James Kerman","CreatedById":160462,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-07T17:35:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThread moved from KSP 2 Suggestions and Development to KSP 2 Bug Reports.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
