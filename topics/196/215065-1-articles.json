This is done by using what is known as a curve, which is a way to smoothly \u0022draw a line\u0022 between two or more points.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Ant engine has three of these points. The first point is at 0 atm of atmospheric pressure, and gives an Isp of 330s. The second is at 1 atm (Kerbin sea level), and gives an Isp of 80s. Between these two points, the game engine (Unity) will smoothly increase/decrease your Isp \u2014 and by extension your thrust\u00A0\u2014 to be between these two values when you\u0027re between 0 and 1 atm of pressure. For example, even though only 0 atm and 1 atm have known values, the game will still give you an Isp at 0.5atm, that\u0027s somewhere between the two (I\u0027ll edit in the exact value later once I can properly calculate it). There is also a third point at 3 atm of pressure and 0s Isp.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPart of how the spaces between these points are calculated involves additional information, which I will broadly give the name \u0022tangents\u0022 (these include the in-tangent, out-tangent, in-weight, and out-weight). I personally don\u0027t fully get exactly how these work, so I won\u0027t even try to dive into explaining them thoroughly, but generally their purpose is to define the shape of the curve between the points. There are many possible shapes these tangents can create.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, here is where the issue with the two engines come in. The points and tangents of the Ant and Dawn are defined in such a way that there exists a range where this curve drops below 0 and becomes negative. Effectively, this means that the Isp and thrust of the engine become negative. Throttling up the engine while pointing prograde would make you slow down instead of speed up. This completely violates physics, and is unrealistic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes this actually matter in the slightest? No, not even remotely. These negative thrusts are absolutely negligible (like ~1 newton (not kilonewton) of thrust per engine), do not generate fuel, and use two deep-space engines in atmosphere, so this will have no realistic impact on gameplay in basically any scenario. But I spent 2 hours testing it anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis could be solved by adjusting the tangents so that the curve never goes below 0. Again, I don\u0027t know much about tangents, but if every single other engine in the game is unaffected I\u0027m sure these engines can be fixed too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m probably forgetting something. If you\u0027re confused, ask a question. This isn\u0027t a high-priority bug by any means, but it\u0027s definitely something curious that I don\u0027t think has been noticed before.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
