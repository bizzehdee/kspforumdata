Meaning after undocking, the next second shows the ships being kilometers apart.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIn rare cases, it\u0027s similiar as the previous point but the camera far and stuck from the ship.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThis maybe unrelated to docking ports but after undocking with the ship loosing comnet connection, it spins out of control.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022U4RqxjW.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022120.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://imgur.com/U4RqxjW.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
