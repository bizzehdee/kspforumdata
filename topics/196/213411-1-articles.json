On the very first launch I made with it, looked like it was working, so maybe after 1 launch is gone or it was luck somehow, bc now is impossible. ALSO the way you need to attach a decoupler is very unintuitive, if you just attach the cargo bay as it is, it gets fuse together to the \u0022cargo\u0022. If you open the bay even when it looks like the part inside is in no way attached to the bay it is like 1 piece, if this is intentional is very unintuitive, I had to use 2 decouplers, one to separate the cargo nose from the rocket and one to separate de cargo from the cargo bay, also the second one stayed inside the bay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-02-27T00:04:11Z\u0022 title=\u002202/27/2023 12:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 27, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by AirmanCS\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
