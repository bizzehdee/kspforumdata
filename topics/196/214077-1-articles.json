It makes it very difficult to focus on the rocket and do maneuvers and land. It appears that the camera might be resetting to the center point of the rocket when its on the launch pad. When you play and drop the stages the camera will auto update, but loading the save it seems to revert to that first camera spot.\u00A0 \u00A0Pressing home doesn\u0027t update the camera to the correct spot. Moving the arrow keys is not a viable solution.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
