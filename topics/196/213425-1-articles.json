I would get to the point after docking and had both the Command module and LEM docked and was performing my lunar injection burn. I would start the burn and the craft would bug out and float away from the camera. I loaded my auto save and it did the same thing. I then decided i would just abort the moon landing and follow my free return back to kerbin. As soon as i tried to undock the LEM and CM at kerbin one or both of the vessels would just disappear. I also noticed that after breaking the vessel apart via a decoupler and then docking back to the vessel the struts re-appeared.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
