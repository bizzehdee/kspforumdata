It will also load in a ship that I have in space and act like I\u0027m there. In this state I cannot save my ship and if I try to exit to the launchpad, the button doesn\u0027t work and in the cases it does, it crashes the game while also having the UI still functional in the background but impossible to use. The only workaround I have found is to hope you didn\u0027t make a lot of progress on your ship and exit to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E and reenter the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E to redo anything you did.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA full workaround ( I think) is to go to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E instead of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E when recovering a flight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy specs are:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAMD\u00A0Ryzen 5 3600\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRTX 3060\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2 sticks of 8gb of ram (16gb total)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPS: No mods or anything to change the games functionality, I also run the game at max settings at 1920x1080 if that\u0027s relevant\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
