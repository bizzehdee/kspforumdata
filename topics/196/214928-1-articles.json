At that time, I had fun doing \u0022salvage missions\u0022 by constructing vehicles designed to \u0022nudge\u0022 debris just right to where it would get sucked into Kerbin\u0027s gravity well. By the time all the fancy indicators were added to the NavBall, I had already become pretty proficient at rendezvous and docking. It works pretty well in KSP2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother way is to add a probe core to each stage which makes the stages controllable - you can manually control them long enough to drop them into the gravity well and let Kerbin do the rest. Go to the tracking station and switch back to the craft in orbit to resume your mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIrksome and creates another level of ugh, I know, but it does add fun to the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stephensmat","CreatedById":200752,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-15T01:15:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYup.

One solution that worked for me is deleting the debris through the map, not the tracking center. On the map you can right click each debris object and \u0022Destroy Debris\u0022. Sometimes painstaking if your debris orbit lines up with a ship orbit, so it will be hard to click on the debris as the ship will always be on top.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
