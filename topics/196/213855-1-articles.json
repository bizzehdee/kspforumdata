Then I launched a ship to the mun. I noticed the station had no orbit in the tracking station. When I took control of the station piece again the fuel tanks were empty throttle was up and it was falling out of the sky. I was forced to recover it before it hit the ground. When I left it to orbit kerbin its fuel tanks were almost completely full and the throttle was off solar panels extended and bill in the pilots seat to keep an eye on things until the next piece was launched.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cocoscacao","CreatedById":225696,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-28T19:52:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is, hands down, the most hilarious topic name I\u0027ve seen so far\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pyritin","CreatedById":226592,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-28T22:06:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224247111\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022213855\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221677562724\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022226933\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022thenerdylord\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n16 hours ago, thenerdylord said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nand bill in the pilots seat to keep an eye on things\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell there\u0027s your issue...
