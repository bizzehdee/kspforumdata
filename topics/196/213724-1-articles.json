Time warp at 1x. Thorttle up the engine. Watch the orbit change in map view. Increase time warp. The orbit stops changing. The fuel remaining continues to decrease, i.e. an effective Isp efficiency of zero.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe bug seems to appear arbitarily, so far happening in 3 of 4 sessions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nKSP Version: Early Access, Feb 24\u003Cbr\u003E\nOperating System: Windows 10\u003Cbr\u003E\nCPU: i5-4690K\u003Cbr\u003E\nGPU: GeForce GTX 970\u003Cbr\u003E\nWorkaround: Do not use time warp and thrust at the same time\u003Cbr\u003E\nMods: PhysicsSettings.jsons edit to reduce joint wobble\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
