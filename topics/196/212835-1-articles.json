You probably never expected anyone to do this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I went to launch a ship, saw that there was a \u0022boat\u0022 launch and decided to see what would happen if I launched from there. You can successfully launch a ship from the boat launch but since its a \u0022boat\u0022 it does not get any of the orbital tools once its in orbit. Also if you get into orbit, SAVE, and then load the save it resets the \u0022boat\u0027s\u0022 orbital speed to 0 and sends it plummeting back to the planet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut if you launch from the boat launching area, get into space, and stage it works fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have everything recorded as I decided to record it for the fun of it.
