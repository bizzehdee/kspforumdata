(Blue screens gave no error code).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGranted I am below the minimum specs without a dedicated gpu (11th gen Intel i7), but this is the only time the game has crashed on me, and it has always been at that point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u2019ve seen a few other people experience similar problems (crashes and game freezes) on discord, and they also seem to be at that same point of \u201Cpumping sim once\u201D.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOther than that and the low fps, I\u2019ve really enjoyed my first play through of the game and I look forward to seeing it evolve over the coming months and years. (Also give the sound design team a raise and a fat bonus)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
