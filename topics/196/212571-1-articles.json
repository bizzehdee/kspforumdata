I built a Polar Satellite, a Soviet Jet, and a Bi-Plane... but each time I told the game \u0022Save this vehical\u0022 and I named them unique names and descriptions... it just overwrote the previous. The Bi-Plane is the current survivor.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThere are spots in the forest close to the landing strip that, if you fly low enough to them, makes your plane go stealth-mode with the vegetation. Never seen a Stealth Bi-Plane before but I got to say, it looks dope!\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/392093260648284160/1079163427500609728/image.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMy decouplers will sometimes not decouple... \u003C/a\u003E(\u0026lt;--- Image)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EAn Open Letter to Private Division!\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you so much! I know KSP2 is having a bit of a \u0022Kerbal style launch\u0022 with things breaking and bugs; but I LOVE this game!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried to get into the first KSP, and I just couldn\u0027t make any progress. Even with Scott Manley\u0027s help I just couldn\u0027t get into it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP2 has been totally different! This game has been so wonderful! For the first time in these games I feel like I can imagine what I want to make, and then I can just.... MAKE IT!!!! In the first KSP it felt like everything I built was ultra-utilitarian, Everything had to be perfect, no extra fun stuff, no creativity. Oh sure, I saw people make some wild stuff, but the tools just were not accessible to allow me to use my creativity!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut in KSP2 I built A FREAKING BI-PLANE!!!! It\u0027s SO CUTE! I made a Soviet Fighter Jet with nothing but my mind! I made a Satellite go into polar orbit!!!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI love PAIGE! She\u0027s so cute and helpful!\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI love the animations of all the Kerbals, so many unique personalities!\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI love the countdown to launch!\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI love the rocket sounds!\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI love how shiny the bare metal is without any paint! (that\u0027s what I use for prototype vehicles!)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the first time, I finally feel like I UNDERSTAND Kerbal, I feel like I can actually do what I set my mind to do! It is clear to me that this game is not only a worthy sequel to KSP1, but is made with so much love and passion for these little green dorks! Oh sure, there are bugs, there are features I would love to have, I have some suggestions; But you guys are on the right path and I am so looking forward to everything you have in store!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-02-25T22:15:14Z\u0022 title=\u002202/25/2023 10:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 25, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Mushroom Kerman\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-25T22:57:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoved to Bug Reports\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
