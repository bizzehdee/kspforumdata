After launching and reaching orbit, I separated the return capsule vehicle, which detached the struts as intended. Then I turned it around, and re-docked the mun lander \u0026amp; return capsule docking ports, After docking the struts reappeared, now going through the vehicle, and not connected in straight lines anymore. (Also side bug that is already reported is I cannot undock 2 spacecrafts = auto explosion)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
