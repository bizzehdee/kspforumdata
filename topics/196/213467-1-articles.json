At least, in my save as of a few days ago. It was working for me and it still works for other people, but now this happens. When this bug is in effect, the game returns a blank white square in place of your chosen flag and existing quicksaves and workspaces do not appear to be read by the game. If you quit the game and reload a quicksave that was made when this bug was in effect, it\u0027ll come back just as before. Workspace loading doesn\u0027t work so if you were making a ship when you realised this bug was in effect, you can only load it using quicksaves and will not be able to bring it back into a healthy save. You can view quicksaves that were made with this bug in effect, but when you load it, you can\u0027t come back without a relaunch, hence your creations being stuck and unrecoverable (as far as I know).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://pastebin.com/Yee2YaWa\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://pastebin.com/Yee2YaWa\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://pastebin.com/WhdKdxMs\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://pastebin.com/WhdKdxMs\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
