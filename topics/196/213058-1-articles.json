Even if I go back to the main menu I can\u0027t find my save. The only way I have is to completely restart the game so everything is back but the issue is back very soon (2 time while I took the pics below). For information I have an I7-12700K, RTX 3080, 16GB of ram. Maybe I have too many ships saved (10-15), idk.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks !\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLinks to images:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://ibb.co/bsgdxyN\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://ibb.co/bsgdxyN\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://ibb.co/ZSJ0bws\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://ibb.co/ZSJ0bws\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
