The first video is like the camera is been flipped by 90 degrees and makes the game nearly impossible to play (watch my mouse). \u003Ca href=\u0022https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1045893427432259715/1079319708869857320/Untitled_video_-_Made_with_Clipchamp_9.mp4\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1045893427432259715/1079319708869857320/Untitled_video_-_Made_with_Clipchamp_9.mp4\u003C/a\u003E The second video, the camera stopped rotating the around the vessel and now rotates around itself now. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1045893427432259715/1079319711625527306/Untitled_video_-_Made_with_Clipchamp_10.mp4\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1045893427432259715/1079319711625527306/Untitled_video_-_Made_with_Clipchamp_10.mp4\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0 And finally, the third video is an issue that any coupling I use does not decouple and is stuck to the rocket then makes said rocket spin out of control unless I timewarp to make the stage decouple.\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1045893427432259715/1079323576773115904/Untitled_video_-_Made_with_Clipchamp_11.mp4\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1045893427432259715/1079323576773115904/Untitled_video_-_Made_with_Clipchamp_11.mp4\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"whatsEJstandfor","CreatedById":220814,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-26T09:24:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI might have some workarounds. For the first one, try hitting V to change the camera mode. Hit V to cycle through the modes until you get to Auto: Ground. For the second one, try hitting the Home key; that should recenter the camera on your vehicle. For the third one, this seems to happen when the decoupler is in the same stage as the engine. Try moving the decoupler to its own stage, or decoupling it manually from the Parts Mangler window, before activating the engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
