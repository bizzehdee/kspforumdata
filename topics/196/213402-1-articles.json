I tried a work around by ending the tutorial on the second, then manually loading up the third tutorial in the first section and it works that way, but another 2 loading screens down and it crashes again the same way as before. As I said the work around still works, but it seems a bit odd that the crashing is this consistent. It doesn\u0027t seem to crash if the next step is a video, and it usually freezes between 50-60FPS during loading.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLaptop Specs:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeForce RTX 3050\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n16 GB 3200MHz SODIMM RAM\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n11th Gen Intel Core i5-11400 @ 2.7GHz\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
