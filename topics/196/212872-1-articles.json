The bug causes the vehicle to act like it doesn\u0027t have a command pod or probe even do it has, you can activate the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E and the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E but with no control. The bug starts when you remove a command capsule (in my case the MK-1-3 Gumball) and replace it with a probe RC001S. Took me a day to pinpoint the problem\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
