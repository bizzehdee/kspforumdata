The methalox engine was attached to a small fuel tank, which was attached to a much larger fuel tank through a decoupler. This allowed me to enable/disable fuel crossfeed to enable/disable the engine when I wanted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis works great, except when time warping. If the methalox engine is disabled (no fuel, decoupler crossfeed disabled) and the xenon engines are running, it produces thrust, but as soon as I start time warping with my engines burning, it still uses up my xenon gas supply, but does not produce any thrust (apoapsis does not change).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
