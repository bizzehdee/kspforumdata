If you happen to know what it was, or roughly when in your build it started happening, and you have old saves of the vessel, you can go back to a working version of the vessel and start building from there. If you don\u2019t know when and where the bug happened then you will probably have to start over from scratch. My recommendation is save often as a new workspace name and test often to make sure your craft is not bugged. If it\u2019s bugged then revert to an older save.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-01T07:23:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni think it may have something to do with how i was mounting them. attached one to the like diameter xenon tank and it stayed on. before that i was attaching them in arrays using the structural plates and girders, i think this may be an issue with the structural parts (they should be more... structural).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nim also gonna try rebuilding the ship from scratch. i just didnt have time when i posted the bug. its funny having 20 ion engines just fall off.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-03-01T07:24:46Z\u0022 title=\u002203/01/2023 07:24  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 1, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Nuke\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Draradech","CreatedById":139656,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-01T13:40:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre you using\u00A0\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:#f9f9f9;color:#2d3134;font-size:15px;\u0022\u003EST-Micro-1 (the smallest cube) to attach something on the surface of something else?
