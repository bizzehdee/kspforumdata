I also found that if you landed on the a planet, (I was in EVA at the time) and press F9, (I have no idea what it does exactly but it restarts the whole intro animation with PAIGE) it will end up deleting basically every vehicle, when I opened tracking station, I found all my kerbals which were on \u0022long term missions\u0022 back on kerbin, and all my rockets out in space, gone. I Finally was able to land on the mun for the first time ever, then jeb got frozen, then I pressed f9, and that was a real push away from this game, hoping F9 gets fixed, lovely game, excited to see what you have in store for us next.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
