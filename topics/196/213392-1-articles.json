When you release the space bar and the jetpack stops firing. they stay put as if on an invisible perch. If you move forward, back, or to either side (WASD) then there\u0027s an audible and visual stepping down. The game appears to know they\u0027re not at surface level so gives you the sound effect as if the Kerbal stepped off a curb and on the pavement or whatever.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
