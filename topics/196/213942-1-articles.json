Later I was reading here that you could revert to an earlier save before it bugs out like that and it supposedly fixes it, but it was too late and I had already started a 2nd campaign.\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022border:0px;font-size:1rem;padding:0px 0px 0px 72px;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022border:0px;font-size:1rem;padding:0px 0px 0px 72px;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003E\nProblem:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022border:0px;font-size:1rem;padding:0px 0px 0px 72px;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003E\nOn this new campaign, after playing for a day or so, I am now unable to save, load, or even launch any ships. The only way I was able to revert to an earlier save was by restarting the game and then from the main menu clicking load, but once I loaded any save I was no longer able to save or load anything, except for the pre-built ships (Which popped up but I didn\u0027t select any). When I press save button, either by pressing escape and clicking save or by pressing save on the top right. The UI proceeds as if it\u0027s saving something, but when I go into load there\u0027s no saves to load. I conceded and decided it was time to just start another new campaign, but now I\u0027m unable to even start a new campaign. The UI pops up where I can select a flag and name the campaign, then when I hit start new campaign nothing happens, I clicked continuously on the start new campaign button and then all UI disappeared and I was left watching the Kerbal\u0027s floating in the background of the main menu.\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022border:0px;font-size:1rem;padding:0px 0px 0px 72px;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022border:0px;font-size:1rem;padding:0px 0px 0px 72px;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003E\nWhat I Was Doing When It Happened:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022border:0px;font-size:1rem;padding:0px 0px 0px 72px;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003E\nAfter spending a good amount of time reconstructing a Saturn V with a rover I pressed launch, then realized I forgot to add some struts for stability, so I reverted back to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and then my game was ruined. Once I reverted back to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E my game was running at around 5-11 FPS (Usually I get at least 30 FPS, especially in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E) inside the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, using about 8-10 GB of RAM.
