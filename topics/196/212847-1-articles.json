Autosaves don\u0027t go off, Normal saves don\u0027t save (ironic lol), and quicksaves no longer save or load. Loading the game only works shortly after initially loading and stop working after a little bit; when trying to load the game just freezes and needs an alt\u002Bf4 to close the game. Restarting the game doesn\u0027t fix anything and as of now the only thought that I have is my campaign is completely ruined. My friend has also had the same issue and he ended up restarting the campaign from scratch. I\u0027ve included the KSP2 log and a link to the save folder of mine on google drive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoatBOT","CreatedById":150724,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-26T03:21:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave seen the same issue, for now looks like I may have to start a new save.\u00A0 Have to check if my current craft files can transfer to a new save.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
