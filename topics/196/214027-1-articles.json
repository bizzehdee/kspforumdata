My current set up is placing the fairing below the liquid terrier engine, and moving it down 0.6 meters. I then begin constructing it and attempt to place it flush with the above fuel tank.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen editing the angle of the single segment fairing, I move it up first, and then attempt to move it to the right, the fairing moves a single \u0027step\u0027 upwards before beginning the rightward motion. This behavior repeats when I move the fairing\u0027s top to the right to make it flush, when I attempt to move the fairing back down to fix the height from the last step added, it moves one step to the right.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis repeats in all 4 directions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTLDR:\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhen editing a fairing and switching between directional arrows, the fairing moves one \u0027step\u0027 further in the direction last moved in the editor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWorkaround: For now I place it flush and move it two steps away, and one step back in. This makes the glitch move it the final step back in to make it flush when I go to edit the other segment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
