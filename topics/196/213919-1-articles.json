It seems that when i add more components to\u00A0 new rocket, the occurence seems to become more frequent. If i start a new game and reload the craft that was causing the freezes, all is fine. As soon as I launch more stuff into space, stuff gets buggy. My system has the following specs:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI7 8086k @ 5ghz\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRtx4070ti\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n16gb ram\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1tb NVME ssd (fast)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCould this be a ram issue?
