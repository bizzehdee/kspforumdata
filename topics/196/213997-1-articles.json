But i am trying to find a good payload method. I believe i have found one but seems like there is some hitbox and structural connection problems. One there is obvious space in between parts but just hangs there. *Note i did have 3 xs decouplers on the bottom of engine not shroud*. Also you can tell that the structure pieces are not connected even though i used the the same setup on all of them(used Crtl and used nodes for parts no rotate or sliding), yet they don\u0027t stay connected. In the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E it shows that is can connect, but as soon as you get into the world they are not. And if it is too heavy then why is the other side working as intended if it is symmetrical.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00226CGinhM.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022120.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/6CGinhM.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022DQbj4oD.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022120.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/DQbj4oD.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
