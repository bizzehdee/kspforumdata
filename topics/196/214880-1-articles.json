So I disconnected the main capsule from another fuel tank and then added the fuel tank on top of the other one. Then I tried to place the capsule back on top, but instead of moving the capsule it just duplicated it. To fix it, I just closed and opened the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and that solved it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
