I switched to the tracking center and it was still not moving despite my other stuff orbiting as you would expect. Switching to the bugged craft resolves the issue and it was gone when I switched away from it to the original ship. I am not quite sure yet how to reproduce this bug consistently\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dogywall","CreatedById":217482,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-04-04T23:55:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI get the same bug. I did an apollo style mission and when i get an orbit and check the map screen, I stop moving. The only way to get my orbit back is to use delta v to create a whole new orbit and even then when I go to the map screen it stops. this whole time I cant see my orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
