Mars rover heating device)\u0022\u003ERTG\u003C/abbr\u003E description are overlapping and the long \u0022lore\u0022 descriptions in incomplete even if I press \u0022shift\u0022 (maj for me, but it isn\u0027t tranlated), so consider reducing the font or make the text box scrollable.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo as you can also see, some translation are in the game yet.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd a little detail,\u00A0special characters are not in all the game font so letters with accents (like \u00E9, \u00E0, \u00F9, \u00F4, \u00C9, \u00D6 and all the others), this make so texts weird (like on this picture under \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Radio-isotope Thermo-electric Generator (a.k.a.
