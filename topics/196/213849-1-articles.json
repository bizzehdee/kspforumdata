I have a suspicion that it is due to the vessels burning fuel un-commanded, as when I checked back on the satellite after its orbit had changed, it was out of fuel and in a higher orbit than before. The host vehicle was also in a higher orbit than before, but didn\u0027t seem to drain as much fuel. Both the satellite and host vehicle are unmanned.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nI have managed to reproduce the bug by loading autosave twice; both times the fuel got drained. Most times it happened during time warp.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt is highly possible that I am entirely stupid and simply left the throttle on or something of that nature, but it\u0027s unlikely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022image.png\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/867523732267335700/1079981413216039073/image.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022image.png\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/867523732267335700/1079981413673222144/image.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAbove are the satellite\u0027s details; It was equipped with 570 m/s of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, around 200 of which I used to circularise, and presumably 370 of it used to double the apoapsis height. I used time warp after undocking this satellite to warp my launch vehicle back around to its periapsis so that I could launch another satellite.
