Strangely enough it appears as if I am able to interact with some of the controls. i.e. Throttle, Pause, and sometimes even Staging. The only reason I know I can interact with these elements is due to the audio cues, as the visual is simply the loading screen / transition screen. This screen remains constant, forcing me to restart my game. I have noticed that once it happens to one craft, that craft is then more likely to have it happen again. Sometimes it may still function properly, but a quick revert to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and relaunch may cause the bug again.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP2 (Early Access): v. 0.1.0.0.20892\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003EDevice Specs:\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis device is a Laptop.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOperating System: Windows 11\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n16 GB DDR4 RAM\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIntel Core i7-10870H @ 2.20 GHz (Base Speed)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeForce GTX 3060 (Dedicated Memory: 6GB, Shared Memory: 8GB, GPU Memory 14GB) \u0026lt;- According to Task Manager\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPM911a NVMe Samsung 512GB (SSD)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Suppise","CreatedById":224194,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-26T08:39:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat point of the load does this happen?
