I didn\u0027t think much of it as this is early access and it could just be a visual bug and I save anyways. I then try to launch the craft, but the launch button didn\u0027t work. I spammed the hell out of it but not even waiting 15 minutes had an effect. I then decided to go back to the menu and relaunch my save. I selected single player from the menu, then my save and hit load. The I immediately encountered another problem as the loading screen just sits there with no menu options. This once again stays on your screen forever. I shut down the game through task manager and relaunched the game hoping it would fix it. I launched the games, no issue, selected my save, no issue, and loaded into my save, with a little issue. I was in the middle of a flight that I had started over three hours ago with plenty of saves after the fact. Was obviously upset but the aircraft wasn\u0027t in its final design so I said whatever and tried reverting to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, except the game wouldn\u0027t let me. I was flying hundreds of meters over the ground but was still able to recover my vessel? I did that and still couldn\u0027t revert to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E afterwards. I then was able to go to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E and go to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E through there. I made changes and then the same issue occurred once again. Is my save completely shot or is this just a bug?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWould really like to keep this save as a relic of my KSP 2 adventures so help would be appreciated!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
