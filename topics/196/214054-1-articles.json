Fantastic textures you guys have got by the way and really loving all the different contextual music.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnyway, I\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s to do with having a flag planted on Eve, or maybe just having 4 flags planted, but the game will not load past \u0022Creating vessel\u0022 when loading my saves. Most recent save I can load is final descent into Eve\u0027s Atmosphere. For reference, went Mun - Minmus - Gilly - Eve. I have no idea how to determine what the problem is, no errors or anything, just not loading\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWould love if there is a solution, coz I want to keep going. Managed to actually get over to Moho before I tried to quickload due to a graphical highlighting error which would have looked sucky in a screenshot\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rhydster","CreatedById":226534,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-01T12:46:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor Reference, I found this just after I posted and got excited because I thought it might be a solution, but sadly it didn\u0027t work:\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u0022195096\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed4722027836\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/212319-ksp-2-does-not-open-up-division-dialog-upon-start/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0026amp;comment=4239963\u0026amp;embedComment=4239963\u0026amp;embedDo=findComment#comment-4239963\u0022 style=\u0022height:275px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey do appear to be having a different issue to me, getting stuck on a different loading point.
