Eventually, the ship would just blow up randomly. I even tried restarting my initial maneuver to get to the mun, but my ship still blows up. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m bad at the game or just flat out missing something, but I know for a fact that I can comfortably build a space craft and fly to the Mun in KSP1.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"W2D2","CreatedById":212625,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-01T20:05:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYup kind of sounds like the bug I just experienced, here\u0027s my similar account.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally after fighting all the bugs to get to the Mun... this alone is stupid because on KSP1 it was a breeze, in KSP2 it\u0027s stupidly hard bacause you fly blind with manouvre node dragging that\u0027s as coarse as a freight train and impossible to fine tune.

Lowered periapsis to 15km and then my ship started to spin like a cotton candy machine. Spinning was straight on an axis, so going directly over the north and south of the navball. Pressed 2x warp to straighten out the ship (glad this \u0027feature\u0027 still exists) and when going back to 1x warp it starts rotating again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThings that could be happening are...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMedium reaction wheel bug?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMun physics somehow getting mixed up with Kerbin?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway I thought, lets get rid of my lower stage (which was way overkill to get me there), however the decoupler didn\u0027t decouple the ship, parts flew off and I blew up .... :-(\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOther than that, the game has tons of potential and the graphics are great.
