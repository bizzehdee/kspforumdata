Because it appears the Kerbal spacesuit is missing something... It\u0027s not missing lights - you can see them right there on the suit. It\u0027s missing any way to turn them on (or off). The only action in the Vehicle Actions is for the Jetpack, and when you look in the Parts Manager, there are options for Jetpack Status, Jetpack Thrust, and Plant Flag - but nothing for lights.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile were at it, there is also no way to remove a the helmet - even on Kerbin where the air is presumably just fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-02-26T20:58:15Z\u0022 title=\u002202/26/2023 08:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 26, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by schlosrat\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LezRowl","CreatedById":213344,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-26T21:17:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeems more like a missing feature, and not a bug.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
