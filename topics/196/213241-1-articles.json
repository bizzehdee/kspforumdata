Symmetry doesn\u0027t work with wings, and when a wing is placed, they don\u0027t stick to the craft. Then, when deleted, it\u0027s impossible to spawn a new wing of that type.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Can\u0027t swich between vessels after staging for example, just get the message [observer can\u0027t leave active vessel].\u003Cbr\u003E\n- When reverting to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, sometimes the launch button doesnt work, so you have to quit all the way to the main menu. When this is done the workspace isn\u0027t saved either sometimes.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- When reverting to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, sometimes the craft gets all mutulated and boosters and rockets are placed in weird places where they\u0027re not supposed to be, especially with radialy mounted stuff.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- When EVA, the kerbal can stand on a vehicle that is in freefall. That\u0027s kind of weird.\u003Cbr\u003E\nOther notes that are not necessarliy bugs:\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Joints are way to floppy. But one question, do joints really need to be floppy at all? It ruins performance, and I don\u0027t think anopne would be sad to see them go. One of the first things new KSP-players learn is to turn on auto- strut anyways. It\u0027s not even that realistic, real rockets don\u0027t bend 180 degrees when launching. Maybe concider replacing floppy joints with a system where it instead calculates the stress on the structure based on a moment-arm, and if the moment on the joint exceeds the limit, it just snaps or breaks the part, sending the pieces attached flying their marry ways? I imagine this wound save a lot on performance too.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Stagning-UI is wonky, and really cumbersome. I would really like it if the engines and decouplers and what not actually follow along the mouse when you drag them, so that you can see really clearly where your stage is ending up when you change staging. Right now, you drag a stage, and you get a very slight indication in the form of a line where the stage is going to end up. It just makes staging cumbersome.\u003Cbr\u003E\nNit-picking:\u003Cbr\u003E\n- The pixelated text-font makes some stuff hard to read. It\u0027s really cool in some places, but it\u0027s a bit overused. In the staging UI especially, it would be nice if it was a little clearer and less cluttered.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022color:#dbdbdb;font-size:14px;text-align:left;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003EI like to add the following bugs :\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003EClouds and shadows getting pixelated.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWater surface texture bug, the solid distance texture remains up close with the dynamic water texture put on top of it.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe odd texture pixelisation when flying an aircraft.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe automatic camera starting to roll and glitch out.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003EI have yet to find the auto-strut button in KSP2.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003ENot sure what their IP constraints are in development of KSP2 with the inclusion of KSP1 mods, but a lot of really good additions to the EA version could have been grabbed from the top mods of KSP1. MechJeb2 for instance.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003EFor the pixelation fonts, I get the retro motif that they seem to be going for, however with a game built around hi-res graphics than KSP1 and readability, I\u0027d like to see them clean the font and icons up a bit more.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003Elso trusses cant be moved up,down,left or right, because I am trying to build satellite relays and I am unable to move the truss to the side to balance the aircraft.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003EPayload Fairings doesn\u0027t have inter-stage node so in other words I cant stack relays on to a payload fairing like inn KSP 1 so you have to take 1 relay sat up at a time\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003EI can switch vessels, but if it\u2019s not still, you will get that message.
