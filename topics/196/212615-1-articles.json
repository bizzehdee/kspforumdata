I\u0027ve submitted these through the PD launcher, but I wondered if anyone else has encountered them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst, and this seems to happen even if I revert to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, to launch, or restart the game, the upper stage sticks to the core stage\u0027s decoupler if the upper stage\u0027s engine and the decoupler are in the same stage. In other words, once the core stage is spent, and I try to stage it, the engine cover falls off and the twin engines fire, but the core stage is still stuck to the rest of the vessel, as if the decoupler didn\u0027t decouple. I\u0027ve found that if I place the decoupler in its own stage just before the upper stage\u0027s engines fire, everything seems fine. Likewise if I decouple it from the Parts Mangler before firing the upper stage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022rpd8FIS.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002282.67\u0022 height=\u0022742\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/rpd8FIS.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis one is bizarre and took a lot of trial and error to track down, but it seems to be repeatable. If I load the Kerbal-K2 into the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, and do nothing to it but add four landing legs to the upper stage, the fuel flow breaks. After launch, it will appear normal, but right after the first staging event, the core stage engine starts pulling fuel from the upper stage\u0027s tank. In the screenshots, note how the core stage\u0027s engine has 9.6t total fuel available to it just before staging. And then, right after staging, that suddenly jumps to 12t. And, if we wait for the core stage to expend all its fuel, we\u0027ll find that the upper stage (which can hold 2.4t) is now empty.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Kfh06Tj.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022102.25\u0022 height=\u0022940\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/Kfh06Tj.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00225i3g0g4.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022101.92\u0022 height=\u0022920\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/5i3g0g4.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, and this one is probably unrelated to the Kerbal-K2, but my camera now defaults to Orbital whenever I send a vehicle to the pad or runway. I have to hit V a bunch of times to get it back to Auto: Ground.
