I was working on a shuttle craft and a 747 launcher for the weekly challenge. When I went to connect the shuttle to the 747 craft I did a copy paste first and tried attaching the copied craft to make sure I had an original if anything messed up. On the copied craft I went to adjust the existing fuel lines and the struts and found that when I clicked on one end of strut/fuel line it would disconnect the end from the copy and jump to the original craft as if I was editing that one instead of the copy with one end attached to the original location.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would then have to reattach the strut/fuel line to the original craft and then go back to the copy and add a new strut/fuel line to replace the one that got removed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"darthgently","CreatedById":204885,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-15T02:59:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother possible symptom of grievous scoping errors in the code\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"D4rkFr4g","CreatedById":226949,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-16T05:25:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224259232\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022215061\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221678849143\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022204885\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022darthgently\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 3/14/2023 at 7:59 PM, darthgently said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother possible symptom of grievous scoping errors in the code\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr the copy is just copying the original guid for the original part attachment instead of using the new guid for the pasted part.
