This issue does not occur in every quicksave, but I\u0027ve found the more times I try to take control of a craft or load a quicksave the higher the chance is to corrupt the save. If a save suddenly stops working, so do all other ones taken during the same flight (they are also afflicted by the same bug)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
