I was having such a hard time getting the RC Sparrow to take off. Before I could reach a takeoff airspeed, I\u0027d spin out of control and crash. Eventually I noticed that the controls were inverted; hitting S pulled the elevators down, and hitting W pulled them up. Not only that, but hitting A would make me yaw to starboard, and D would yaw to port. I thought that maybe the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECOL\u003C/abbr\u003E was in front of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E or something, but after fiddling with wing placement and checking to see if the Invert Controls option for those wings were enabled, I couldn\u0027t figure this one out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter some more troubleshooting*, I found that the g*sh d*ng probe core is flipped around. If you remove the probe core, and use Q or E to rotate it 180 degrees, and put it back on, the controls become what you\u0027d expect. It\u0027s still hard to takeoff, but not impossible like it was before, and I found that lowering the friction of the wheels definitely helps.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022AMMfabj.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002285.17\u0022 height=\u0022970\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/AMMfabj.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*Pictured: troubleshooting\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"James Kerman","CreatedById":160462,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-26T10:05:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThread moved from KSP 2 Discussion to KSP 2 Bug Reports.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
