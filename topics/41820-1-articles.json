They won\u0027t snap to as much, so you\u0027ll need to be more skilled to get the dock. You can dock two at the same time but it is not easy. Often times, both will appear to dock but only one will. In this case, you cannot accelerate, or the ship destroys itself. Double and triple docking is hard and requires extreme precision (and patience) to get right.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
