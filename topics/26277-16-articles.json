I see that you\u0027re dynamically calculating the mass of the magazines as bomb count is decremented. Any chance you could just assign the mass to the engine rather than the magazines?

I\u0027m wondering if this is a processor problem. Due to the fact that I\u0027m paranoid about people adding or removing magazines during a mission, when the engine requests a bomb from the MagazineManager, the manager does a re-inventory of the magazines. This might stress a CPU with lower specs than the computer I\u0027m testing on.
