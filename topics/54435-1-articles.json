For example, the current radar altimeter in the pods only really functions at about 500m above ground, from memory. Physics is only normally loaded at a 2.5km distance. As such, it would make some sense to simply have the altimeter switch over (with an indicator, and optional toggle to go back to sea level) to measuring from ground level when one is approximately 2km from the ground, yes? Ideally, it should also detect if the sea level is higher than ground level, and in such a case measure only to sea level as normal (i.e., when you\u0027re flying over the ocean).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Supernovy","CreatedById":29617,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-27T06:18:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe speed gauge on the navball does a similar thing (auto switching over) but can also be toggled, perhaps automatic with the option of toggling would be the best way to go about this?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-27T06:50:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think so, aye.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KvickFlygarn87","CreatedById":76314,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-27T09:05:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022vexx32\u0022 data-cite=\u0022vexx32\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ethe current radar altimeter in the pods only really functions at about 500m above ground\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s 3000.
