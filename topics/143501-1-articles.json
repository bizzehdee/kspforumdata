You can wing it when searching for the best times to execute a flyby, and if you are willing to orbit the sun several times in the process or make several deep-space maneuvers (DSM) you can usually find something better than a direct Kerbin-Jool flight, but there are two tools that can find the most efficient flybys for you.

These find the specific times that you need to leave a planet and flyby each successive planet in order to go from K to J with only one large impulse, the Kerbin departure burn. (You will always need a few small adjustments along the way, but less than 100m/s should do it, and less than 20m/s with practice.) When setting up these flights the most important thing is to arrange the departure and each flyby to occur at the right time, if you do that the rest falls into place, for instance you adjust each flyby as you approach the planet to be in front of or behind the planet as needed to get the next encounter at the right time. Check out the flights below for details.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are numerous paths to get from Kerbin to Jool, here\u0027s a rundown. For comparison, going directly from K to J takes about 2000m/s when starting from a 75x75km Kerbin orbit. You can also go...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nK-Duna-J for about 1950m/s.
