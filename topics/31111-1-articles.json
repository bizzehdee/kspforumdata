You could also possibly start a topic in the How To thread with a screenshot of your craft and the launch vehicle and see what kind of advice you get from some of our more experienced players, if you ever get stuck on that design specifically. We also have a Mission Reports section if you want to keep us updated on your progress as you play.

I got a lucky break in that I was able to make a single manuver from liftoff off of Mun with a single manuver node able to trajectory shoot back toward Home. And then not enough fuel to make a pretty retrograde burn to land on Kerbin, but it was enough to get me into atmo and fall back. I litterally ran out of fuel trying to get it to line up, and almost started to cry. Then I realized that I was losing speed in atmosphere and falling, falling, falling. I popped parachutes and landed somewhere in the middle of the ocean. But, by kerbal, I was home!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow ... I need to learn how to do this without so much luck involved. Landing on the Mun ... the landing part, was insane. I had to re-try it so many times (quicksave = F5, hold F9 to restore) because I kept crashing. I\u0027m going to change my design of my lander and use both mini-rockets and RCS, I think.
