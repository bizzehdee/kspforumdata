Been trying to beat the final boss (kerbals with science equipment to eve surface and back) without the inflatable heat shield or full tech tree unlocked, trying things in sandbox ready for the \u0027real\u0027 try. On my try this evening, I quick saved when my cutes were fully open (when I ditch my heat shields it keeps on taking out some of my ship). On loading this save, my ship random accelerated tearing itself up in the atmosphere, when I ditched the stage it flung me into space at 10million m/s. I ended up having to ditch the attempt and retry.\u00A0 I can not find anyone having anything similar, but I assume it has happened to others? I assume, don\u0027t quick save in the atmosphere?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI may sometime post details of my full mission if anyone will be interested?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, about me, I am a metaller, live in the UK and make AR modules (the bare bones optics inside a headset) for a living and outside of ksp I play jrpgs mainly. I have played a lot of ksp, but not really done a huge amount of interplanetary travel. Last successful mission was landing on moho and back (ignoring the kerbin system). I tend to try things way above my ability level on ksp.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTldr: kraken hit me for the first time today, from the UK, not been on forums for a while.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-23T01:03:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI didn\u0027t know one COULD save while in atmo.
