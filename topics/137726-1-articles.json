The landing gear doesn\u0027t seem robutst enough and causes a potentially fatal wobble on take off/landing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s my basic planes.

Putting the landing gear nearer the CoM makes the initial bounce less and sometimes lands safely, although this ruins stability.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDuring the takeoff run the plane rocks left to right in an increasing oscillation with speed. The landing gear never reads as stressed but at some point it gives up as \u0022overstressed\u0022, especially at close to take off speed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen landing the tiny amount of force they take to break means even a perfect landing is liable to snap off landing gear with catastrophic consequences. This is with landing speed of between 50-60 m/s and vertical speed of less that 5 m/s. If it does land, OK it\u0027s still likely to destroy the landing gear while decellerating. Rough terrain landing is unlikely to be survivable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSettings are usually on default. Turning off suspension is ineffective at stopping the wobble. Biasing friction to the rear appears to delay the onset.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny advice?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-22T15:35:31Z\u0022 title=\u002204/22/2016 03:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 22, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by stormdot5\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MajorNr01","CreatedById":43823,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-22T16:05:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe fixed landing gear is not working at all for me.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI can take off, but I have yet to land any plane with it.

I\u0027ve almost always landed without my fixed landing gear breaking(the exceptions are when i flipped over). You can place the radial parachutes above the center of mass; Your plane will just fall\u00A0straight down. But as i see now, it might be that your wings are too much on the front. Your center of lift should be behind the center of mass, not in the middle or in front. Try also placing your rear landing gear more to the back, this will require more torque to lift the front part up, so it might not happen.
