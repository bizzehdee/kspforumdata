KAC says it is 13 days away, mechjeb says 19, but with a funny twist, I\u0027ve actually got a few smaller probes going with the big ship and some of them it tried to give a departure over a year away on the first try, and then when I tried again later gave them 19 days. Also, all the paths mechjeb has given to the ships go through the mun\u0027s SOI but at such high speed (exit burn is ~1800m/s) their course isn\u0027t altered it\u0027s just totally straight. So i\u0027m not sure what to trust, should I go with the mechjeb manoeuvre or make my own at the time KAC tells me? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond issues, well, it\u0027s not really a problem, just fishing for a bit of advice. According to the DV map i\u0027ve been looking at I should need 9045 m/s to go from Kerbin orbit to Jool orbit, and I currently have enough fuel tanks in tow to give me about 9100 m/s. However, I\u0027ve found on previous interplanetary missions I almost always needed more DV due to ending up on a non-optimum route, soo, how much spare Dv would be sensible to add to the ship?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-25T12:30:02Z\u0022 title=\u002206/25/2014 12:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 25, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Wallace\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-24T16:36:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EProblem 1: I use alexmoon\u0027s excellent \u003Ca href=\u0022http://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Etransfer calculator\u003C/a\u003E.

Then have a look where Laythe is, and see if your orbit gets close to it. I only had to make a small tweak to get a laythe intercept. I then aerobraked again at Laythe for capture, then circularised. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing I did, which I reckon was worth it, was spend ~200m/s correcting my plane at Jool\u0027s equatorial node, just before my aerobrake.

It turned out to be a bit more unstable than I had expected so I had to turn off most of the high thrust engines that were supposed to get it out of orbit fast so it didn\u0027t quite manage it it one burn, it hard to do a second burn with it\u0027s nuclear engines when it was passing the Mun, so the two ships that were supposed to go just after it missed their manoeuvre nodes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt all turned out ok in the end, except the arrival times for 2 ships that set off late are a few hundred days out from the rest. :S \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main ship and one carrying extra vehicles have 6000 DV left and the three ion probes each have about 3000 DV of rocket and 12000 Dv of ion, so I should be able to visit all the muns when I get there. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve realised what my mistake was, I made some notes of DV requirements on some post it notes but I accidentally put the DV from the surface of Kerbin to jool orbit down but labelled it wrong and then I thought it was the Dv from Kerbin orbit to Jool orbit when I came back to it, and I included fuel for breaking so I wouldn\u0027t have to aerobrake \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_ohmy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022:o\u0022\u003E oppses! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll the spare fuel will be useful as I have 2 remote probes and 2 small ships that will attach to the main space station that will need fuel, and I\u0027m sure it will come in useful for the follow up mission to establish the Laythe base, so it went ok in the end, and next time I\u0027ll be sure to write my lil notes a bit more carefully.

I switch half of them off and still only had it on half throttle and it still was close snapping in half at times. The front half has about 8000Dv and performed much better but those 5 tanks still flopped about like a Wacky Waving Inflatable Arm Flailing Tube Man despite being towed from the front. It used over 3000dv on a 1800dv burn from flopping about.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-26T23:02:04Z\u0022 title=\u002206/26/2014 11:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 26, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Wallace\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Emore details, also fixed punctuation.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MarvinKitFox","CreatedById":99545,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-27T17:26:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh.....kay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat look solid, yes it does.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wallace","CreatedById":77574,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-27T19:29:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey, it worked... not well of course, but it worked.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
