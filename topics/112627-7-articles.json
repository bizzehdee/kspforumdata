What are ya thinking of?\n\u003E \n\nWell, it\u0027s a good thing I created a fresh save with 1.0.5, ETT, and Dmagic, Normal difficulty, in order to test ETT again before typing a page or two!  I see that you have made a few changes since I tried it.  Moving the 2HOT into Basic Science makes sense.  You haven\u0027t tweaked any of the experiment values, right?  So the wiki is accurate for those?\n\nPutting a barometer on the pad and recovering it gets 3.6, \u002B1 for Science contract.  This allows 2 nodes: Basic Science, or Propulsion Systems.  In fact you can choose both.  Getting Basic Science seemed like the right thing to do.  2.4 Science from the pad, almost paying for itself.  It\u0027s interesting to note that although we start with a C-16 antenna, it costs 12 EC per packet and the only power we have is the Stayputnik with 10 EC, so we can\u0027t actually use the antenna with those 2 nodes alone.  However, while not obvious, unlocking Propulsion Systems gives a 7.0 EC/sec alternator.  Choosing Science over better engines doesn\u0027t get you stuck, however, so this is fine.\n\nBy the way, could you hide the Universal Storage parts if the user doesn\u0027t have it installed?  It would clean things up a lot.\n\nEDIT:  Continuing my career, the antenna aborts transmission and returns the data when the probe core runs out of battery.  Right-clicking on it lets you toggle this, but it gets very slow to transmit results piece by piece.  I think it\u0027s best to just launch a sounding rocket to 70km using the LV-30 and not waste money on science equipment.  This gets you about 25 Science from various contracts and achievements, so now you can get batteries and do a proper science rocket.  Is this the intended strategy?\n\nEDIT2: I\u0027m an idiot.  I forgot that ETT gives you the radial parachute to start with.  That makes things much easier XD.  With that in mind, perhaps the C-16 antenna should be moved to Basic Science?  You can\u0027t really use it well at the start anyway.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-13T18:59:21Z\u0022 title=\u002201/13/2016 06:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 13, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by lordcirth**"},{"CreatedByName":"Probus","CreatedById":102512,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-13T18:55:22Z","Content":"[@lordcirth](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/137417-lordcirth/) Yeah, I don\u0027t tweak the values of anything other than where they appear in the tech tree.

I am really looking for some good input from you [@inigma](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/69310-inigma/) for the aircraft portion of the tree (including node changes/rearrangements).  I know that will be hard to do without getting my github working properly.\n\nIf anyone happens to know of a good Ubuntu/GitHub program, please drop me a link.  Thanks!\n\nAlso, what does everybody think of the changes I made to the exotic engines and planetary base branches?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-21T12:51:53Z\u0022 title=\u002201/21/2016 12:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 21, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Probus**"},{"CreatedByName":"tees","CreatedById":144295,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-21T20:40:58Z","Content":"Hi \n\nIts is chaka mod compatible ??"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-23T17:43:46Z","Content":"That\u0027s a very nice mod you got there!\n\nHowever, I would like to play it Stock \u002B KIS \u002B KAS \u002B USI-LS.

I rely on Github and Ubuntu for work, but I haven\u0027t had any trouble shunting code back and forth between them (I use git directly).\n\nI happen to like building airplanes and like the idea of this pack, but had some frustrations the last time I used it. From what I recall, there\u0027s really a very large jump in science points between the first node with practically any airplane parts and the next node, which includes a number of parts that I liked and/or used in early-tech designs in the stock game. It might be worth looking at that some, particularly for people without Firespitter, KAX, etc.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-23T17:53:05Z\u0022 title=\u002201/23/2016 05:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 23, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Workable Goblin**"},{"CreatedByName":"legoclone09","CreatedById":142607,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-24T15:25:04Z","Content":"[@Probus](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/102512-probus/) The almighty Nertea has made a new mod, [Kerbal Atomics](https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/1422/Kerbal%20Atomics).

That doesn\u0027t work. Really, it\u0027s not the right path to follow. There is not an official and reliable \u0022stardard\u0022 to follow. And this mod needs someone that has \u0022the big picture\u0022 in his mind, assuring it is respected. And it can only be you.\n\nI think you should use your experience to decide how the game should be (in terms of tech tree) and, based on that, pick few mods u consider should be in the game (or just a partial of the mod) e stick with just those. No less, no more. Your work will be a lot less (especially the maintenance) and the result a lot better. U can also tweak and Whitelisting parts beacause their number (now limited) now permits this. And u can now really work on balancing and progression (one time job).\n\nAs modder u should know u can\u0027t make everyone happy and if u try so, u end to make everyone unhappy ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022;)\u0022) (u included)\n\nLuca"},{"CreatedByName":"lordcirth","CreatedById":137417,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-27T00:03:39Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 5 hours ago, Mods\\_o\\_joy said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Broke all of my saves.\n\u003E \n\nOf course it did.
