I stumbled on KSP. I don\u0027t actually remember how I found this place. A dream? Aliens pointed me here? A vision from God? A blog posting in some corner of the internet? However, I learned of KSP, I quickly downloaded it (I believe it was in the v0.08, there were no struts, no Mun, no orbit map, just your rocket, a steady hand, and some luck) and gave it try. I failed. A lot. And it was fun. Eventually, I made orbit. My first was a orbit around 250k to 55k (I seem to remember the atmosphere being lower then, or I could just be wrong about the altitudes). Unfortunately, as I was beginning to learn more about orbital mechanics, life happened...and I forgot about KSP. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEventually, a few weeks ago, I stumbled on KSP again (again, can\u0027t remember how...let\u0027s go with a vision quest from my spirit guide...or a youtube video), and remembered all the fun I had with it. So I grabbed the full game, and saw Mun, and Minmus, and landing struts, and the big pieces, and...It was wonderful. Rockets continued to explode with brilliance. I found Mechjeb and they began exploding both more and less often (Mechjeb has trouble with some of my designs, and I\u0027m too slow to react). I landed on Minmus and Mun first with Mechjeb, then without. I have crashed more Kerbals into mountainsides on Mun and Minmus than I can count (I\u0027m a terrible judge of speed and distance). I\u0027m excited to be playing again and I\u0027m excited to see where Squad takes the game next.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan\u0027t wait to begin slamming landers in the surface of other planets (I don\u0027t think my judgement of distance or speed will improve much by the next release). It\u0027ll be great.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-23T15:25:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Newt0570","CreatedById":13414,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-23T18:58:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat story reminds me of how I found out about gmod.
