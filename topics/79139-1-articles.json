I try to build with the discarded parts costing the least I can. You can build single stage to orbit craft to stop the loss of debris but they tend to have awful cargo to size/cost ratio\u0027s. You can also try a two stage launch. Go straight up with the first stage and when past 23k detach the second stage which then burns sideways to get orbit all before the first stage drops below 23k again. Once the second stage has a stable orbit and before the first drops below 23k you switch back to the first stage and land it back at KSC.
