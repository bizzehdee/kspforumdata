For those who don\u2019t know, collider components define the shape of an object for the purposes of physical collisions and how objects interact with each other within the game. Optimizing the shapes of the colliders can improve the performance of a game, since there is less computational effort to calculate any interaction between these objects. As KSP has been developed by many different hands, there is some inconsistency on how colliders were shaped for many parts, and so, a collider hunt began to see which parts need some tweaking. Soon, we\u2019ll let you know which parts are going to be fixed, so if you have observations regarding colliders on specific parts, now it\u2019s a good time share.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn designing my mod \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/151443-12x-mk1-cabin-hatch-v020-3-november-2016/\u0026amp;page=1\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Emk1-cabin-hatch\u003C/a\u003E and with the help of users, i noticed that maybe a check for the airlock and ladder could be great too while you are at it, there is some inconstitency, sometime kerbal are really far from the ladder, some hatch are useless ( gameplay purpose?), etc...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Fuy4fqY.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Fuy4fqY.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthe yellow long bar on top is a ladder but unusable, maybe too deep in the part collider? and the side hatch are fakes useless,( i added the green and red colliders myself in my mod , there isn\u0027t anytrhing here in stock)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022WZ8ETjS.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WZ8ETjS.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\non the scientist lab, i think the part collider is too complex and maybe consume too much ressources, the the lkerbal on the laddr also has the rungs in his mouth.\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthat\u0027s my small contribution to help you, keep this amazing game still amazing!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Skalou","CreatedById":133496,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-30T23:22:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nup, because i hope devs will take care about it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"diomedea","CreatedById":93700,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-01T09:44:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBelieve your is an interesting report, could probably win the attention of the devs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWould be great if you filled it with the public bugtracker (\u003Ca href=\u0022http://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/projects/ksp/issues\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/projects/ksp/issues\u003C/a\u003E) as that\u0027s the place where most probably issues will be looked by devs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deddly","CreatedById":62955,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-01T09:54:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/133496-skalou/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022133496\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/133496-skalou/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Skalou\u003C/a\u003E!
