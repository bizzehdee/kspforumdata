And even in the manufacturing process, the largest cost factor isn\u0027t the raw materials to build the rocket, it\u0027s the workers. By reusing rockets, you need less of them, but you still need to maintain a factory and a decent workforce to run it, so you don\u0027t necessarily make huge savings there. And the manufacturing workers are only a small part of your total workforce. The highest salaries are in the R\u0026amp;D and mission control departments. And you are still going to need hundreds of people to do all the logistics, transportation, payload integration, testing, and other administrative work. There is also the cost of maintaining facilities. Launch sites, research centers, factories, mission control centers, aren\u0027t cheap.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, even if the actual hardware is 50% of the total launch cost, the first stage is probably around 70% of that, which would make it 35% of the total launch cost (not the price!). The price of a launch, is $60 million, so to simplify, let\u0027s consider that the cost without reusability is around $50 million, so you save $17 million on each reusable launch. If you reuse your first stage 10 times, it brings the average cost of a launch down to around $36.5 million ((1x50\u002B9x33)/10), which results in saving about 30%.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut that is a highly optimistic estimation. It assumes zero refurb cost, zero transport, and a constant unit price for the actual reusable unit. It also assumes 10 time reuse, which is also optimistic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t forget that the cost of each unit increases as you reduce the number of units produced. If a factory is sized to produce 400 engines/year and you only build 40, then your costs are not optimized. Your fixed costs take a larger part of your total costs and ou also don\u0027t get large volume discounts from your suppliers. So your unit cost increases, which also eats into the savings that you might get compared to launching 400 disposable engines. There is a balance to be found somewhere, and until SpaceX has some real data about the recovery and refurbishing costs in an operational environment, nobody really knows how much reusability will save.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo it\u0027s more likely that in the end, you\u0027re looking at something like the 20% figure I quoted above.
