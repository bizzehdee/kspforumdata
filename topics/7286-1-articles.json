E.g. could you create telescopic landing legs?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Is it possible to attach nodes to the articulating parts of the model and have other components move with it? For example, could you create \\\u0027deployable\\\u0027 engines that start tucked in and extend out when required? Think of the ship at the end of First Contact (the Phoenix) where the warp nacelles deploy once in orbit? 3:25 on this video\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/mZ_Aq0YvBJ0?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- If the above is possible, could fuel lines be attached to the extending engine and be fed from a central tank without snapping... or would both an engine and tank need to be extended at the same time? Alternatively, could the part set to have fuel flowing through it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers 8)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tiberion","CreatedById":8356,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-03-02T14:39:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERotating only, for this part. Someone will likely figure out a way to telescope models via the plugin system, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, the leg part has a separate collider node that rotates with the mesh, and the VAB only recognizes the normal node_collider as an attachment node, and it only covers the hinge of the leg, which doesn\\\u0027t move and is where it attaches to other parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would say that function would have to wait until a more robust animation system is added, since it relies on adding functions to the VAB, which is likely beyond the scope of what user-made plugins can do.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"1909","CreatedById":5178,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-03-02T15:32:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell that\\\u0027s a shame.
