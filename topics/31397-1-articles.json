What if the Apollo program continued... Selena Trouge is the first woman to walk on the Moon on Apollo 21.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E July 20th 1969\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E There it was. A magnificent spacecraft capable of reaching the huge rock that orbited the even larger damp mossy rock. It had finally been confirmed in Lunar Orbit. Selena sat there at her television, in wonder as to how such a thing could be accomplished. An hour or so passed before Selene went back to the television. \u0022The Eagle has landed!\u0022 Selene heard. It was so amazing, the sight. A few minutes later, \u0022That\u0027s One Small Step Frra Man, One Giant Leap Frr Mankind!\u0022 could be heard on nearly every television on Earth. \u0022Momma?\u0022 Selena asked. \u0022Yes sweetie?\u0022 Her Mom looked away from the Television. \u0022I\u0027m going to go there one day.\u0022 She smiled, her missing front tooth adorably visible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E October 4th 1989\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E There she was. Apollo 21. The first Apollo Spacecraft to use a drastically lighter vehicle, with less fuel being required due to the addition of the very new, amazing NERVA (Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle Applications) to the 3rd stage and CSM. It was also the first manned use of the Saturn VII Heavy Lifter. Selena was now 27, and she would be the first woman to land on the moon. She was the mission\u0027s scientist. Expert on the Moon. This would be the first mission to deploy a permanate base for future Lunar expiditions. The new \u0022Altair\u0022 lander spacecraft would be responsible for landing and deploying the base. 2 of the crew would stay on the surface. This being Johnathan and Chad Gotts, The first twins in space. Selena and Richard would return to Earth. A mere two weeks later, Apollo 22 and 23 would be launched, bringing 20 more people along.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E It was only two minutes untill launch. Selena could not have been more exited. She thought back to when she was 7. \u0022I\u0027m sorry, Selena. Almost no one ever goes to space.\u0022 Her mother had said to her on the day of the Apollo 11 Moon landing. She had then become obsessed with space. Especially the Moon. When she was only 10, she had accuratley drawn a Selenograph. The irony is that Selenograph is the actual name for a map of the moon, but Selena did not know that. When she presnted the map as a school project, she was embarassed to find that Selenograph is not \u0022Something you invented, or even named.\u0022 She kept working. She had studied the Apollo missions as much as she could. She marked her selenograph with the locations of all of the Apollo landings. When she went to college, she majored in astronomy and engineering. She kept her physical capabilities up in the hopes that she would become an astronaut. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E And a mere two years ago she did. She flew on an orbital mission to Skylab for resupply. When the spacecraft had an oxygen breach and loss of rocket engines, she had the amazing idea of using the escaping oxygen as a de-orbit thruster. She had to manually hold the spacecraft steady using the oxygen valve as a rotation control. She saved the other two astronauts and splashed down saftley in water. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E And now she is going to the moon. She could feel rumbling in her chair. \u0022 Alright, we are go for flight.\u0022 the radio announced. Selena smiled. \u0022Alright, a few bumps until the Moon.\u0022 She joked. \u0022Ten\u0022 mission control counted down. \u0022Nine.\u0022 Selena braced herself as the fuel started to vent from the rockets. \u0022Three\u0022 \u0022Two\u0022 \u0022ONE!\u0022 \u0022We have liftoff!\u0022 Mission control announced. \u0022The clock is running!\u0022 She shouted on the radio. \u0022We have cleared the tower!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E *a few bumps later*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0022Alright, Huston, we\u0027ve completed all of our flight system checks, over.\u0022 The Apollo 22 spacecraft was in Low Earth Orbit. \u0022Flight, You are go for Lunar Orbit Injection, over.\u0022 Mission control responded. Johnothan clicked some switches and prssed some buttons. The computer turned on, and started plotting the LOI burn. \u0022So uh, guys, what are you all going to do during the wait?\u0022 Selena asked nonchalantly. \u0022I brought up a GameBoy with me.\u0022 Richard said. \u0022Since when do you play video games?\u0022 Chad asked. He was secretly jealous of the handheld gaming system. \u0022Since I was a little kid. I had an Atari.\u0022 He said matter-of-factly. There was a beeping sound. \u0022Alright, 10 seconds untill LOI Burn, brace yourself, it\u0027s time to see what the NERVA can do!\u0022 She was somewhat confused at the men\u0027s discussion of video games, the only games she played were Lunar Lander and Asteroids, and thus was curious how he got an entire Arcade cabinet in his house. The four astronauts were then pushed back in their seats. The burn lasted about a minute. \u0022Alright, John, I hope you can dock this thing.\u0022 Chad said. \u0022Atari Lunar Module Fairing separation complete.\u0022 Richard announced to mission control. \u0022Uh, Rich, did you just say \u0027Atari\u0027\u0022 Mission commander asked. \u0022Ah, *****\u0022 \u0022I mean-\u0022 He chuckled \u0022ALTAIR Lunar Module!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E John took the controls. \u0022I\u0027ve got this.\u0022 He said reassuringly. He tilted the joystick upwards slowly. The spacecraft rotated around. He pressed the KILLROT button to stop the rotation. \u0022Alright.\u0022 he said quietly. \u0022You\u0027ve done this in a simulator 13 times...\u0022 Selena whispered reassuringly. He activated a burst of the RCS thrusters in a backwards direction, so the craft moved towards the Altair lander. \u0022Aaaaand... DOCK!\u0022 The docking probe entered the drouge with a scrape. Richard initiated the Hard Docking procedure. The magnet was activated, the hydraulics pulled the spacecraft together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECht-Cht-Cht-Cht-Cht-Ch\u003Cstrong\u003EtK\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E After some flight systems check, the hatch between the NCSM and the ALM was opened. \u0022Good joob John!\u0022 Rich patted John on the back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Suddenly there was a huge explosion. The NCSM was burst far off course with a leaking oxygen supply. \u0022Damn\u0022 Chad exclaimed. \u0022It was a nuclear explosion.\u0022 Richard said \u0022The NERVA?\u0022 Selena asked. \u0022...Yes.\u0022 Richard reluctantly responded. \u0022Huston? We have a problem.\u0022 Selena yelled on the speaker. \u0022They can\u0027t hear us. The ionisation has ruined communications. We are currently on a Lunar Collision Trajectory.\u0022 John spewed out all of the information the computer gave him. \u0022Can the Altair be powered up?\u0022 Selena asked. \u0022Yes.\u0022 Richard said. They stopped panicking. \u0022Well, Let\u0027s get to work!\u0022 Selena yelled. \u0022What are you planning?\u0022 Chad asked reluctantly. \u0022have you ever heard of Apollo 13? We\u0027ll have to do what Lovell did.\u0022 She responded. \u0022But they had communications with Mission Control, we don\u0027t.\u0022 John said. \u0022You know what? I don\u0027t care what we don\u0027t have, I care about what we DO have!\u0022 Selena shouted. She grew angrier by the second. But soon the ALM was powered up, and she calmed down. \u0022The ALM is undamaged. So is it\u0027s cargo.\u0022 Richard checked and reported. \u0022Well, I guess we\u0027ll have to figure a way to make a space tent built for 2 work for 4.\u0022 Selena said. \u0022What can we do?\u0022 She continued. \u0022Wait.\u0022 Richard said. \u0022That was Nuclear Explosion!\u0022 He excailmed. \u0022I need to do a check for radiation exposure.\u0022 \u0022Alright, but can you do it while we work Rich?\u0022 Selena asked. \u0022Yes.\u0022 Richard got out the Tricorder (Yes, I said Tricorder. NASA named their scanner device the Tricorder for the same reason they named the first space shuttle Enterprise. But in this universe it was the second shuttle and the first one was Constitution and it was OV-100 instead of OV-101 and Enterprise which is still OV-101 it actually flew in space and got re-used and stuff and was awesome.) and did some science scans. For science, you Monster. \u0022Oh no...\u0022 Richard was worried. \u0022I am severley affected. You all are fine, but ME? I have a HUGE risk of cancer. I may even die on the way to the Moon.\u0022 His face was grim. Selena, Chad, and Johnathan did nothing but stare.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022How are we going to land?\u0022 Chad then asked, changing the dire subject to an only slightly less dire one. \u0022Well, If we wait untill the very last minute, we can then burn the engines full throttle right before we hit the ground.\u0022 Selena excaimed, remembering her Lunar Lander high scores. \u0022I call it a \u0027Suicide Burn\u0027\u0022 She explained. \u0022Alright, I\u0027ll start doing some calculations and computer sims, to see if it will work out.\u0022 Richard replied.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*The next day*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The Moon is getting awfully big in the window...\u0022 John said. \u0022Hold on, I\u0027m almost done with these calculations...\u0022 Richard scolded. \u0022Alright, I\u0027ve got a failure rate below 10%. That\u0027s as low as the computer can get it.\u0022 Rich finished. \u0022Ooahh!\u0022 He then moaned. \u0022Maybe you should get some sleep Rich...\u0022 Selena caringly asked of him.\u0022Th-anks...\u0022 He replied. \u0022The radiation exposure is really getting to him.\u0022 Chad frowned. \u0022I fixed the scrubbers for the \u0027space tents\u0027, the new ones weren\u0027t supposed to arrive untill Apollo 22, with the 10 more colonists. They should support 4 people for about 3 months.\u0022 John said. \u0022How\u0027d you do it?\u0022 Selena asked. \u0022I took all of the C02 scrubbers from the NCSM and pshed them into here.\u0022 He said.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESelena floated over to Richard, where he was sleeping. \u0022Rich, come on. I know you can make it.\u0022 She felt so sorry for him. She was the commander of the mission, she should have been the one dying here, not him. \u0022Richard, please don\u0027t die on my watch.\u0022 Selena started to cry. Her tears pooled around her eyes, sticking to her face due to surface tension. She had NEVER seen a person die in her life before. The closest thing to that was her dog, Eagle. He got ran over by Selena\u0027s dad while parking in the driveway. Selena came home from school only minutes later. She had ran over to her father, who was crying himself. \u0022I\u0027m so-o So-or-ry.\u0022 He was sobbing. Selena ran over to her dad. \u0022No. No no no NO!\u0022 She had excaimed. \u0022NOOOOOOO!\u0022 She had yelled. She had sobbed for what seemed like a week. But her grandparents were still alive on Earth, she had never known her great-grandparents, and she had never had to see a person die before. Or even see a dead person that she cared about. But lying there, Richard almost seemed dead. But he was still breathing. Selena kissed Richard on the forehead. Richard and her had gone to college together, to NASA together, and Richard was her commander during the Skylab Resupply Oxygen Leak Deorbit Burn Incident. Now she was the commander, and she thought she would lose him. After all they had been through. She got a towel and wiped off her eyes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJohn went into the ALM, followed by Chad. \u0022I know you\u0027re sad.\u0022 Chad said. \u0022We are too.\u0022 John finished. \u0022But you didn\u0027t know him through college, through NASA.\u0022 She sobbed. She went back to the CM. She sobbered up. \u0022Alright, what is our current status?\u0022 \u0022I sent out a camera pod to inspect the damage to the NCSM, The NERVA has burst, and the Service module itself is ruined. Not even the RCS thrusters work.\u0022 \u0022What about the ALM\u0027s RCS?\u0022 Selena asked. \u0022They do work.\u0022 Chad finished John. \u0022Activate them, we need to use them whenever we need.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERichard came out of the ALM. \u0022Selena.\u0022 He said. \u0022Yes Rich?\u0022 She responded quickly. \u0022I know why we survived the explosion...\u0022 \u0022It was... GOD!\u0022 Rich said. \u0022Are you kidding me?\u0022 Selena responded to such a crazy argument. \u0022I\u0027m just messing with you.\u0022 He gave a smile. \u0022It\u0027s because it was an overheating burst! It wouldn\u0027t have damaged us very much at all!\u0022 Selena stared. \u0022I mean, fatally. We\u0027ve still got a dead elephant here.\u0022 Richard explained.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022So how are you feeling.\u0022 Selena asked shyly. \u0022I feel a bit better after that nap.\u0022 He responded. He then remembered that he was going to die soon. \u0022Ahw who am I kidding? I\u0027m going to die soon. How the hell can I be feeling better.\u0022 He cringed, tears came to his eye. \u0022I... I... I\u0027m sorry I lost you.\u0022 was Selena\u0027s only words. Chad and John stared, they had never seen Selena, or even Richard, for that matter, so emotional. They barley even knew they had a relationship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlas, they did. In college, they had dated. Selena was working on an update to her Selenograph after Apollo 18, and was swamped with other classwork she had to do. Rich had planned on asking her out to dinner. Rich called over to Selena. \u0022Uurgh, what is it, I\u0027ve got SO MUCH WORK to do!\u0022 She had obviously been tired. \u0022Uuh, I was...\u0022 Richard had thought of a way to change his plans, she obviously could not go out today. \u0022Calling to tell you that the president has just decided to begin work on a new kind of spacecraft!\u0022 He finished. \u0022It\u0027s a new Moon lander for Apollo 20.\u0022 He said. \u0022Oh, cool, but I\u0027m REALLY busy right now, can you call back later?\u0022 She hung up the phone. The next day, Richard put on a suit, got some roses, and went right over to Selena\u0027s dorm. He knocked on the door. She had answered it. \u0022Where are you goin\u0027? A funeral?\u0022 She asked. She was obviously less stressed, and her dorm had been cleaner than usual. \u0022Actually...\u0022 He took out the roses. \u0022I was wondering if we could go out to dinner tonight.\u0022 He said, matter-of-factly. Selena smiled. She did have a small crush on Richard, but still valued his frienship, and was afraid of being friendzoned (Although she didn\u0027t know the actual phrase, the action of \u0022Let\u0027s just be friends\u0022 from both boys to girls and girls to boys existed even before that TV show did.) \u0022Alright.\u0022 She smiled even more. They had a wonderful evening, at a neat restaraunt near Cape Kennedy, with the VAB visible out of the window they sat near. The next week, Rich took her out again, and to a moving picture, too! It was the movie, Star Trek: Wrath of Kahn. \u0022I think it was ALOT better than The Motion Picture.\u0022 Rich had commented after the movie. \u0022Oh My GOD! We think JUST alike!\u0022 Selena said, tounge in cheek with how her friends at high school acted around their dates. She chuckled. Their dating went on for almost one year, until they got recruited at NASA, and they deemed it inappropriate to date their co-worker/co-pilot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESelena glanced out of the window. The Moon took up almost all of the view. She remembered when she was in college. She was an amazing artist. Using her selenograph as a reference, she had drawn a picture of the Eagle Lunar Module and Columbus Command/Service Module very close to the Moon. She had shown to no one, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERichard was feeling slightly somewhat rather extremely depressed. He only had at most a week to live. He\u0027d already gone through several doggie bags. The moon was coming up fast, and everyone was preparing for the pre-landing preparations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Alright, John...\u0022 Selena called into the CM from the ALM. \u0022It\u0027s about time to eject the Nuclear Service Module\u0022 \u0022Yes ma\u0027am.\u0022 John responded. He opened up the switch cover, and flipped it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChrt\u003Cstrong\u003ECHINK\u003C/strong\u003E!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Service Module was separated, allowing a full view of the crippled NERVA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Oh no.\u0022 Richard sighed. \u0022My arithmetic was totally wrong. We don\u0027t have enough fuel or thrust to land the ALM with the CM attached.\u0022 \u0022What do you mean?\u0022 Selena asked worryingly. \u0022I did my calculations accounting for the weight of the old style CM, the number I was trained with on Apollo 19, for which I was the backup pilot.\u0022 Richard responded. \u0022We have to jettison the CM.\u0022 Chad cringed as he said it. \u0022We won\u0027t have enough oxygen without the CM\u0027s supply!\u0022 John exclaimed angrily in response to Chad. \u0022Listen. I know we\u0027re in trouble but we can NOT start pointing fingers at ANYBODY for ANY REASON!\u0022 Selena yelled. \u0022Just jett the CM.\u0022 She commanded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECH\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003Etink\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022huh?\u0022 Richard huffed as he pressed the button. \u0022That was odd.\u0022 He said. \u0022What?\u0022 Chad asked. \u0022I was expecting a more dramatic sound.\u0022 He said.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELittle however, did they all know, the Command Module was still attached.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Alright, It\u0027s time to initiate landing procedures.\u0022 Selena said. Richard took the controls on the Altair. \u0022Wait.\u0022 Richard stopped. He looked out of the docking window. \u0022THE CM IS STILL ATTACHED!\u0022 He exclaimed, frantically. \u0022WHAT?!\u0022 Selena exclaimed. \u0022We have five minutes until landing. What are we going to do?\u0022 Chad said, John finished. \u0022I know.\u0022 Richard said. He put on his helmet. \u0022What are you doing?\u0022 Asked Selena. \u0022Saving you all.\u0022 He finished. Selena realized what he was going to do. He was going to manually pry the CM off of the ALM. \u0022You CAN\u0027T do that.\u0022 She said. \u0022That\u0027s an ORDER.\u0022 She finished. \u0022I\u0027m sorry, Selena.\u0022 He went through the airlock before Selena could stop him, and crawled along the ALM. He then made a jump for the CM hatch, where he could jett the CM. He grabbed the handlebar just in time. He got in the Command Module. \u0022I\u0027m doing this for you, Selena.\u0022 He unlocked the docking clamp, and got out again, pulling the handlebar off of the hull, and used it to pry open the docking hatch. He made it, but he then realized he had gotten snagged on the CM\u0027s clamp. He went inside, waiting for his doom. He was going to try to get back to the Altair, but now he couldn\u0027t. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, he realized that there were RCS thrusters on the CM. Very powerful ones for emergency braking on Earth if the CM descended above land. Richard started working on the calculations and timing to try to land with the CM itself. He glanced out the window. The ALM flew past him as it begun to brake. He only had about a minute. He figured it out as best an approximation as he could. He still had hope, even though he was going to die, that he would do it naturally. About a minute later, the ground was comming up extremely fast. He hit the button for emergency landing just slightly too late.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECr\u003Cstrong\u003EASH\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe CM\u0027s heatsheild was shattered, the pod was leaking oxygen into space, and Richard was unconcious. He still had his helmet on, but he would not have much of an air supply left. All of a sudden, the hatch opened. A figure in a heavy space suit looked in the pod. Selena saw the unconcious body of Richard and his suit in the CM. She pulled him out, and the frozen water on Richard\u0027s visor turned to steam. \u0022Damn. He doesn\u0027t have a temperature regulator!\u0022 She said to John and Chad, who were standing behind her. She pulled him to the rover, a small, but nonetheless airtight and air-conditioned vessel, and drove back to the ALM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERichard stirred. \u0022Selena?\u0022 He muttered. \u0022Am I dead?\u0022 He asked. \u0022Not yet Rich.\u0022 Selena smiled. \u0022Your idea to suicide burn with the CM was amazing, and it has saved your life.\u0022 \u0022What do we have?\u0022 He asked. \u0022We have this tiny rover, designed for three, and a maximum distance of 2 miles before recharge. We have Three scientific RTGs, a few power couplings, some scientific instruments, and Chad got the \u0027Space Tents\u0027 up. Johnathan is working on a way to overclock the science kit to produce enough oxygen to sustain us from regolith soil.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter they all got back to the ALM and Base, John was looking at the tricorder. \u0022Hey, wait a minute...\u0022 He slapped the tricorder. \u0022Rich, look at this!\u0022 \u0022You\u0027re not dying!
