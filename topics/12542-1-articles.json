Contrary to popular belief, it seems that a ring of Kerbolar radiation exists at an altitude of approximately 3,000,000 meters from the planet. This ring surrounds the planet KERBIN along a .01 degree inclination and is several kilometers in height. It measures roughly 20,000 meters deep of radiation particles of a particular degree and is about 5,000 meters in height. It is -- as far as we have discovered -- an unbroken ring. Radiation particles in the inner regions of this belt measure anywhere from 3-20MeV of photon particles. Outer regions of this belt, however, seem shockingly more intense. It appears that radiation levels from 25-230MeV exist at certain inclinations and may pose a serious hazard to manned explorers crossing through this belt on the way to the Mun and Minmus. Outside of the \u0027Particulate Ring\u0027, the radiation is even more deadly. Kerbolar flares can easily stop intrepid explorers from making successful landings and long term stays on other celestial bodies. As of yet, Kerbal scientists believe that layers on the spacecraft that measure approximately 3 inches of aluminum may be well enough to stop radiation particles during short term exploration, but the hazards of long term missions have yet to be solved. Following this mission are three more planned to discover more about what we don\\\u0027t know at this time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
