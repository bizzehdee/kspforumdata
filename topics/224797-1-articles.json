They were a marketing company first, and back to a marketing company when they cashed out from gamedev with the IP sale, and their devs went off and over with it. If they did reconstitute their game development portfolio (Terrible idea considering how the industry is treating studios right now) it\u0027d just be all new hands under an existing name, nothing of the old guts preserved.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have to caveat with \u0022as far as I know\u0022 because their website did update as recently as 2022, so at least someone there has involvement enough to keep their site up to date and reason to want it. But goddamn, is it a crusty site. Definitely didn\u0027t retain any native development staff, a website this old school would physically hurt any coders \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-05-10T05:24:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe closest thing we have to old school Squad to work on KSP2 is Floating Origin Interactive, which is HarvesteR\u0027s new studio.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPersonally, I don\u0027t hate the idea of having FOI work on KSP2, because their domain seems to be exactly what KSP2 is missing the most right now.

I don\u0027t know what their financial situation is and how the feelings might have changed.
