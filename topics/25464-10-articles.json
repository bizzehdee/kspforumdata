Another epic drive, but just more of the same. So I decided to experiment with MechJeb\u0027s rover autopilot (or whatever it\u0027s called) that allows you to set a heading and speed that MechJeb will attempt to keep. But right away I ran into some problems because the route out of Hecate Basin toward the northeast has some slopes that the Fido can\u0027t take very fast going head on... so I had to keep manually adjusting the direction of the Fido to keep it moving around ridges.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bRcK8am.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022bRcK8am.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow, the Fido rover heads up the long slope out of Hecate Basin. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHellou: \u0022Hmmm.

Actually, the MechJeb autopilot doesn\u0027t seem to do very well at maintaining the set speed. The Fido would always pick up speed beyond the set limit going down slopes. Maybe MechJeb is trying to control the speed by only changing the forward throttle setting, and not using the brakes at all. So it turned out that I had to constantly monitor the rover anyway and apply brakes on the downslopes to keep from going too fast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WBpYWxL.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022WBpYWxL.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother example of exciting driving is shown below.

His mission was to check out the equipment for use in future exploration. After determining that all the Base equipment was in good working order, he got out to check out the Compact Fido with a test drive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/hhDqH5K.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022hhDqH5K.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKurt drove the Fido the couple kilometers to the impact location of the debris from the heat shield that the Base dropped on its way in. Five large plates survived the impact, along with the fuel tank and decouplers. If he had Nelemy and Aldner here to help (and the cutting/bonding equipment), he could make another shed for the supplies that currently are filling most of the free space inside the Base modules and Fido cockpits. In any case, the Fido handles beautifully, and is quite stable despite its slightly shorter wheelbase (of course, having the torque of two cockpits and an ASAS unit help a lot with that). So Kurt headed back to Base 3.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lBvdRLM.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022lBvdRLM.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKurt: \u0022Kurt to Laythe Base.

Even Aldner hasn\u0027t drive along anything this steep. After coming around a particularly heart-stoppingly steep turn, Kurt came to a less-steep area. Ahead it looked like it was going to get even steeper again... So even though he was still a couple hundred meters from the peak, he decided not to risk it further. So he carefully turned the BirdDog to face down the eastern slope of the mountain, fired up the engine, and did his take-off run.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rUg4QFX.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022rUg4QFX.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/fD8FP1m.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022fD8FP1m.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/q7P0eqD.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022q7P0eqD.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKurt dived the BirdDog down along the slope for about 2,000 meters, then pulled up and away from the mountainside, then gained altitude and headed back to Laythe Base at Fido Bay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/GpN8cUJ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022GpN8cUJ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/o6SnU9X.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022o6SnU9X.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ITvQWbf.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ITvQWbf.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow, Kurt approaches the west coast of Dansen Island.

It still had some fuel/oxidizer in the gold torroidal tanks on top (this is the fuel source used for its deorbit burn, and for hopping the station a little if its refueling ports are not at the right height for docking), and I wondered if it had enough fuel to fly it out of the area. So I made a Save and gave it a few tries. Unfortunately, it only had sufficient fuel to send it less than 2 km away. Plus, if you allow it to crash, it doesn\u0027t all get destroyed, and it leaves a large debris field. Crashing the station into Fido Bay results in more destruction of parts, but the girder segments and large plate survive the splashdown and come bouncing back up. So I guess that could reduce lag somewhat (fewer parts left, further away)... but it\u0027s not something the boys would do, so I\u0027ll just leave the empty GasStation 1 sitting there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/QStnaZR.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022QStnaZR.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lVxzXAQ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022lVxzXAQ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8ly0IGi.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00228ly0IGi.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/iEJcJ6V.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022iEJcJ6V.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENelemy\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd what of Nelemy, sitting partway around Laythe on Aldner Island? His first exploration plan is shown on the map below. He\u0027ll fly south-southeast and explore the islands there (and possibly the ice island) until he runs low on fuel, then return to Aldner Island. After takeoff, he headed up at a steep angle at 2/3 throttle to get to 10 km as fast as possible for the cruise phase. I\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s more fuel efficient to fly upward at a more leisurely pace at 1/3 throttle, or if the quicker boost at 2/3 throttle (then reduce to 1/3 throttle at 10K) is better.

Because of the low angle of the sunlight, it was necessary to stop a few times to let the batteries recharge. Also, Nelemy did not drive back in the direction that he came down from...he set the GasStation on Aldner Island as his target and drove straight north toward that to minimize the distance he\u0027d have to fly once he got to the edge of the ice sheet. Below, Nelemy approached the edge of the ice cap, but stayed clear of the slippery slanted ice that Aldner reported was found there.

Thank Felipe for the NavBall. But Nelemy made good time, flying at almost 12,000 meters, following the pink target marker on the NavBall. Finally the marker for the GasStation 4 showed up, and based on the distance readouts from that, Nelemy cut engines at about 20 km out and glided down. He was trying to land short of the GasStation (where he knew the landing area was good), but he overflew it and came down higher up the slope...and went airborne again as he bumped over the top of a ridge...but settle back down OK about 4 km beyond the GasStation, with 68 units of fuel left (out of the 300 he started with). He drove back down to the GasStation, but decided to put off refueling until morning.

The plan was to drive south and climb the large mountain there...then probably down and over to the basin to the west. Then eventually swing around back to Athena basin and explore the area north of the Lander.

With the older-style medium wheels, the Fido hasn\u0027t got enough traction to go straight up the slope, so this was an exercise in contour driving, following along the slope pointed enough uphill to keep the rover\u0027s speed at about 10 m/s. This gave a vertical ascent speed of about 2 meters per second. The markers off in the distance show that the Fido was 28 km away from the Lander. There were occasionally boulders to stop at and sample. But ice. Just ice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rxZiDc7.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022rxZiDc7.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow, our heroines cross the 5,000 meter elevation mark. The going was a bit slower, vertically. They were rounding a smaller mountain peak toward the shoulder up at the right, from which they would drive to the top of the tall peak seen at the top center of the image.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/iWpXxEJ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022iWpXxEJ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA wonderful resource to have when driving around on Vall is the contour map that was made by Charles Magnuson. You can Google it up if you want the whole map. but below is a section of the map showing the region of Athena Basin. The X marks the location of the Vall Lander, and the tall mountain near the center of the image is the first target of this expedition. Once Emilynn got the Fido up to the shoulder, she still had to contour-drive partway around the west side of the big peak before it flattened out enough that they could just drive straight up to the summit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Mzagyiv.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Mzagyiv.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow, Emilynn and Hellou reach the summit at 7,914 meters. The highest point on Vall is at an elevation of 7,989 meters, but that\u0027s at a location quite a distance away, so this handy mountain peak was just fine at only 76 meters less. A flag was planted. A lot of core samples were drilled. Hellou ran off to sample a boulder...just more of the same stuff found lower down. They spent a day at the summit so that Hellou could do some immediate analysis of the samples.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wmlZTHJ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022wmlZTHJ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ijoHhlY.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ijoHhlY.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHellou: \u0022OK, I think I\u0027ve figured out how the basins on Vall formed.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEmilynn: \u0022Aren\u0027t they just impact features, like the craters on the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHellou: \u0022No. You know that there\u0027s a big ocean under this ice crust, kept liquid by tidal heating of the mantle, right?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEmilynn: \u0022Umm...Yeah...We know that because of...something about the way Vall affects Jool\u0027s magnetic field? Like a conducting shell?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHellou: \u0022Emi! You actually listen to me at times! Yeah. OK...these mountain ranges are like chains of giant icebergs floating on that ocean, with most of their volume underneath...or possibly they even reach deep enough to ground out on the rock mantle. The basins are thinner sheets of ice floating on the ocean. What I\u0027ve found is that the ice here on the mountain lacks the sulfur compounds I found in the ice of the basins. The basins must be located over volcanic hotspots in the underlying rock mantle.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEmilynn: \u0022So...the basins are areas where the ice crust melted from underneath?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHellou: \u0022Yes. The tidal heating of the rock mantle must be uneven. I wish I knew why. Inhomogeneities. But the lack of volcanic heating under this area if why this mountain is here...and why there is less sulfur in the ice here... except for that boulder over there, which is more of that ejecta from some impact that threw a lot of basin ice boulders around this part of Vall.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEmilynn: \u0022Great. So now we head back down?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHellou: \u0022Yeah, I\u0027m done here.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEmilynn: \u0022Well hop in! I\u0027ll drive.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHellou: \u0022Emi...You know our agreement: You drive UP the mountains. I drive DOWN the mountains. I shudder to think how fast you\u0027d get this Fido going on a steep slope.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow, an overview of the mountain (which Hellou named Athena Peak) looking toward the north where the distant marker notes the location of the Vall Lander. The route down that Hellou planned to follow roughly paralled the ridge line that curves along toward the upper left in the image. This gave the minimum slope. Once beyond the steepest slopes, the plan was to veer left and head down into the other basin there. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/quC0yrj.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022quC0yrj.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs they drove down the slope, even Hellou managed to get the rover airborne at several points, much to Emilynn\u0027s delight. The ride was pretty fast and smooth, but constant vigilance was needed because the rover would sometimes start to fishtail a bit, and it had to be pointed back forward. This is the place where having the older-style medium wheels (instead of the newer \u0022gripper\u0022 medium wheels) saved the day: In \u0022simulation tests\u0022 that I\u0027d done when designing the Fido for Vall, I found that the gripper wheels had a tendency to suddenly \u0022snag\u0022 the ground at times...and if that happened when coming downslope at speed, it could cause the rover to wipe out. But the older medium wheels would slide more than snag, so the rover could be driven downhill faster without wiping out...as long as it was kept pointed forward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEmilynn: \u0022Say, Hellou... This VanAllen detector back here keeps beeping. Is it doing that because we are at a higher altitude?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHellou: \u0022No. That happens on Kerbin where you get more cosmic ray exposure when you are higher in the atmosphere, but Vall has no atmosphere, so we wouldn\u0027t see that effect here. But KSC sent a report that Kerbol got a little more active a couple days ago. Some of the high energy particles ejected by Kerbol work their way into Jool\u0027s magnetic field, buzzing back and forth between the magnetic poles like angry bees. What is the detector reading?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEmilynn: \u0022Mmmm...270. Isn\u0027t it normally around 100?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHellou: \u0022Hm. Yeah, that\u0027s even up some from yesterday. Still not high enough to worry about...but let\u0027s keep an eye on it.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KLjjnZD.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022KLjjnZD.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt around 3000 meters elevation, the slope got less hectic, and Hellou was able to point more downhill and head for the new basin, which she named Ishtar Basin. Once they got out onto the more-or-less flats, Hellou let Emilynn take over driving again so that she could examine the samples that she collected at occasional stops as they drove across the basin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/hBQ32zG.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022hBQ32zG.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/v9nTUik.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022v9nTUik.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey also stopped to photograph Tylo passing behind Laythe.

A lovely little piece of basalt.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEmilynn: \u0022What is a rock doing sitting in the middle of this ice basin?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHellou: \u0022Because, my dear Emi, this is a meteorite. Probably a piece of Tylo or Laythe.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEmilynn: \u0022Wait... Rocks can travel from Tylo or Laythe to here?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHellou: \u0022Certainly. The moons of the Jool system are quite close together and have low enough escape velocities that a meteorite impact on one of them could easily knock pieces of their crust out into space where they can wander over to other bodies. I\u0027m just surprised I haven\u0027t found more of these. When I get a chance to do a more detailed analysis, I expect to find some of the Laythe cyanobacteria in these ice samples as well. The Kerbol system in general has such small separations and low planetary escape velocities that panspermia is an almost certainty.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEmilynn: \u0022It is? That doesn\u0027t sound like fun to me.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Fido finally reached the lowest point along its westerly path at an elevation of 711 meters, which Hellou celebrated by collecting some samples, as is her wont to do. The map view below shows the Fido\u0027s position at that time, having traveled 52.8 kilometers from Athena Peak, and located 55.2 kilometers from their Lander base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/csNatJx.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022csNatJx.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/SZ4NqWE.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022SZ4NqWE.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow is an overview of the northern end of Ishtar Basin, looking roughly east-northeast. The dotted trails show the path the Fido took down from Athena Peak to the low point where our heroines set up camp for a day, and the route they later took off to the northeast heading back to Athena Basin. The two basins are separated by a relatively low ridge line.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qNWOtCB.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022qNWOtCB.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact, their route out of Ishtar Basin was the perfect kind of terrain on which to use MechJeb\u0027s rover autopilot. A smooth plain, gently sloping upward for many kilometers. So I let MechJeb do a little driving work for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/uIEgnSB.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022uIEgnSB.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe peak of the ridge separating Ishtar Basin from Athena Basin is not very dramatic, but Emilynn managed to make the Fido \u0022fly\u0022 as little there anyway. The terrain on the other side of the ridge is rougher, but nothing the Fido couldn\u0027t handle easily. Hellou and Emilynn stopped about 26 kilometers north of their lander base. The plan was to do some sampling, and then continue on to the next basin to the northeast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KR9tTKc.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022KR9tTKc.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Vk7CsbB.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Vk7CsbB.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Mq4nNNM.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Mq4nNNM.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut Emilynn and Hellou\u0027s plans were interrupted by a message from Kerbal Space Center:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSC: \u0022KSC Mission Control to Vall Expedition.

Did you copy that transmission?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHellou: \u0022I hear it. How far are we from the Lander?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEmilynn: \u0022About 26 klicks. You want to blast a shelter in the ice back at the Lander instead of here?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHellou: \u0022Sure. I already have the bore holes made there. And there shouldn\u0027t be a big hurry...the ejection velocities of a typical magnitude 5 event should easily give us over a day to prepare. Help me get these samples packed up.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEmilynn: \u0022OK. I can have you back at the Lander in no time driving over this flat terrain.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHellou: \u0022That won\u0027t be necessary.

Vall Expedition out.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo our heroines packed up equipment as the message from KSC continued to drone on for over six minutes before the light-speed lag allowed KSC to acknowledge Hellou\u0027s transmission. Then they headed south at a reasonable speed (for Emilynn).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NaGY8rD.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022NaGY8rD.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEmilynn: \u0022OK, we\u0027re here! What do you need me to do?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHellou: \u0022First I want to transfer the sample cases and data packs to the Lander, just in case. Then I\u0027ll get the charges prepped and in place.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEmilynn: \u0022Roger. Anything else?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHellou: \u0022I\u0027ll need you to position the Fido between the blast holes and the Lander...but that can wait until I get everything set up.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEmilynn: \u0022I\u0027m on it.

Then she double checked the connections and setup. In a little over an hour she was ready to blast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHellou: \u0022OK, Emi. I\u0027ve got everything ready. I need the Fido in place to screen the Lander, just in case.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEmilynn: \u0022Hey, Hellou, I think you should look at this.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHellou: \u0022Where are you at?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEmilynn: \u0022I\u0027m in the command pod. I\u0027ve been trying to monitor the feed from KSC, but I\u0027m not getting a clear signal anymore. I got an image of Kerbol that they sent out...I think you might want to see it.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHellou: \u0022OK, hold on.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHellou hopped on over and into the command pod. She really has gotten much better at handling herself in low-G. Emilynn showed her an image on the computer screen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Bp3T0P0.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Bp3T0P0.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHellou: \u0022I\u0027ve never seen sunspot activity like that. I know that small mass stars like Kerbol often display huge flare activity, but Kerbol is usually comparatively quite. But there are the historical reports about the Great Auroras that haveblanketed the planet every couple centuries...we may be seeing one of those in the making. What\u0027s our phase angle with Kerbin?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEmilynn: \u0022Umm...\u0022 *punches buttons on the navi-comp* \u0022We are 26 degrees ahead of them.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHellou: \u0022Good. Good. It will take that mess longer to rotate toward us. Any contact with KSC?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEmilynn: \u0022I\u0027m getting nothing but hash now. None of the four comsats has a signal either.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHellou: \u0022OK, come on. We blast now. I may even set some other charges later to give us a bigger cave effect off to the side of the hole.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHellou and Emilynn got out of the command pod and over to the Fido before another transmission managed to break through the static.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSC: \u0022KSC Mission Con*static* to Vall Expe*static* *static*trol to Vall Expedition.

I\u0027m on it.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEmilynn flew off via rocket pack directly to the command pod hatch. Hellou was about to follow, but stopped and returned to the Fido to set it for remote control access.
