Pare it down to the bare minimum and you could leave off half the boosters. The Thuds are mainly there for gimbal value (necessary for finless FAR rocketry); it would work without them if you added a few SRBs for launchpad kick.\n\nA single 1.25m stack will get you to orbit, but if you want to put a crewed mission on the Mun it should take at least a few boosters.

I think a size 3 battery and Size3 SAS unit might be nice. Also a size3 RCS tank. \n\nThe reason I say this is on space stations that are built in space, long thin parts are kracken fodder. I use for example a size3 short tank (scale of T200 factor), on a lg docking port that I can remove and replace to supply. (because its not aerodynamic enough to launch into space). It is docked on both sides so I don\u0027t use up a docking port. But if the tanks are excessivley thin, then docking another ship only invites the kraken. \n\nOP: \\* A 3.5m version of the 909 or Poodle\n\nPB666: yep, definitely needed. Should be a three or four engine design. Ihave a scale mod of the poodle size3, 4, 5. \n\nOP: \\* A 2.5m or Mk2 sized mono RAPIER for Mk3 spaceplanes, to avoid spamming the existing RAPIER\n\nPB666: I suppose but I think this would be not commonly used, you should create a scale mod. \n\nOP: \\* KAS-style fuel pipes for refuel on the ground more elegantly than using the Claw and with less bother than struggling to align docking ports\n\nPB666: That would take all the fun out of it. \n\n . . . . . . \n\nOP:\\* A medium-sized rover wheel.\n\nPB666: A wheel, period at Start game. it could be a wheel from a tonka truck.\n\nOP:\\* A radially mounted probe core to help with the vertical-to-horizontal transition when landing rovers\n\nPB666: Use mech-jeb. You can assign probe elements modules to other parts if you don\u0027t like MechJeb, \n\nOP: \\* Boat hulls, pontoons, and rudders, preferrably with retractable, powered wheels in some of them (like Firespitter)\n\nPB666: Like for landing on water.\n\nOP: \\* Some sleeker, sexier lights of several types\n\nPB666: Yes, lights are not aerodynamic they don\u0027t fit flush on the body and you have to tweek them. \n\n.........\n\nOP:\\* 5-way RCS blocks\n\nPB666: yep. When you say 5 way that could mean pentagonal also, but I am sure you meant -x, x, -y, y and z orientations (when -z points in the direction of it mounting surface)\n\nOP:\\* Stack adaptors that hold fuel\n\nPB666: Wow so many already, you can make them on blender, I have made a bunch. I frankly think mine are better than theirs, I say this because when you use the size3 tanks and adapters you end up having a dead space if you don\u0027t use size three parts. It looks kind of half-ar$e.\n\nOP:\\* 5m rocket parts\n\nPB666: Mod.\n\nOP:\\* bigger sepratrons\n\nPB666: Mod.\n\nHaving finally manage to cover the rocket parts per say (spent most of the last few weeks cleaning out my parts and game-data directory and testing the drag issues, I would like to say to the dev team ---- well done.\n\nThe part I find most impressive are the fairings and the openable equipment enclosures. Amazingly you can use one inside the other. I did not find the rockets as unstable as other folks but I have been working on my aero parts for some time. I find there is a cost now for poor design and a reward for better designed and aerodynamic craft. \n\nI am still finding myself having to get used to the new boosters. The good point is they appear to crash less into the launches, the bad point is that you have one more step to worry about in launch, because for smaller rockets (when you use 2 boosters) you will probably need to adjust down the thrust to avoid overspeed on less-well designed rockets. \n\nWhat can be improved. \n\n1. Telescoping mounts. Now with the nice fairings/ instrument bays it would be nice to have telescoping mounts for things like ion drives or test equipment. Even a rotating space station.\n\n2. Wheels (more of them e.g. fixed simple wheels with no power early game)\n\n3. More sophisticate roverbay. (although personally I never make rovers, bad habit from earlier versions where roving did not have much of a payoff)\n\n4. Corner welds. Instead of tacky looking strut connectors it would be nice were we could weld corners at a cost per length. This would give a much stronger bond with lower breaking torque between pieces. \n\n5. The RGS is a multifunction standout, but wouldn\u0027t it be nice if we had a standout (nacell) that was aerodynamic. If find myself at times needing to lower the flex on the upper stages of a launch and I end up having to shove a MGS out into space so that I can add strut-connectors between two peices that are not in each others line of sight. \n\n6. As others have mentioned the recyclable off-world landers have a horizontal cross section that exceeds 3.75 meters across. The most stable landers are at least 5 M side to side, otherwise you end up burning power to keep a craft true and they will not stay true on worlds with heavy gravity. A one to four conversion plate would suffice.\n\n-Solution 1 is to make a plate that has telescoping standout and landing struts. \n\n-Solution 2 is to make 4 and 5 meter parts. \n\n7. Size2 jet engine\n\n8. Radiators . . . . . really . . . . . . . if an engine needs to be cooled there should be aerodynamic parts can be used to radiate. An alternative is a simple plate that does not conduct heat upward. Once a TNR is activated it will produce heat and that heat needs an effective means of dissipating, the expended fuel is extremely radioactive (thats why they keep spent fuel in cooling ponds at nuclear reactors). A better solution in vertical plates on the nozzle of TNR that can slowly dissipate the heat from the nozzle (I know this is oxymoronic since you want the exhaust to retain thermal energy until out of contact with the nozzle) and other parts of the engine. \n\n9. Bases. One aspect of the base is that buildings are disconnected. It would be nice to have a expandable platform in which fuel depots, etc can be plugged in and craft with docking ports mounted on the bottom can dock. In 0.90 I tried this and the ship would never dock no matter how close I got the port. I would lower the landing legs and nothing would happend. It would be nice if the deck had a landing zone, if the four legs of the ship landed in all of four areas the deck would move the ship to center and a docking port would rise up and attach. You could have three types of ports. \n\n10. Off-world VAB package. This would be also nice, could be installed and activated. Tranporting of materials to the factory would then allow one to build ships in space or off-world. #9 could be built as part of an off-world package assembly. \n\n11. Asteroid that cannot be moved but are worthy exploration targets. \n\n12. Telescopes and space observatories designed for LKE and HKE.\n\nAnd I know I will get some complaints, \u0027all this is available in this add-on or mod\u0027, yeah I know."},{"CreatedByName":"Spartwo","CreatedById":58131,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T21:29:31Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Propeller.
