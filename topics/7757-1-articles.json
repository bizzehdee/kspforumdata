I just started learning Blender yesterday. Studio Max is \u0027easier\u0027 because most of the stuff you want is visible to you or in some easy to learn menu. Additionally for the really complex stuff, I had the 4 volume reference set. I do know could sit down in 3DS and manually model a part I wanted to make (manually facing each group of tris) faster than I can even sit through the first 12 \u0027Blender 2.6 Tutorial\u0027 videos on Youtube.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, my first impression is that the interface in Blender is far more powerful. That may be because I have a strong grounding in 3D graphics. It\\\u0027s powerful even to the point of being \u0027offputting\u0027 to learn. I\\\u0027m not sure I care much for the rendering engine itself yet, but that\\\u0027s probably because I haven\\\u0027t explored a single output option, yet.
