However I was left with a question, what exactly happened to Amelia earhart at the end of the movie? according to a few sources she probably turned to dust or crashed due to not being able to fly back to the museum in time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever if that was the case they wouldn\u0027t have gotten to new york at all because the plane they were using had a top speed of 185mph in ideal conditions and the distance between new york and washington is 204 miles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen again this is the same movie that somehow had the wright brothers airplane fly allot further and better than it did in real life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the question remains what happened? Personally I like to think that she made it back, after all a plane and a statue disappearing from a museum would raise some suspicion plus it would be a downer ending if that was the case.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReason why I\u0027m bringing this up is because there\u0027s a new movie coming out and it seems like a fun thing to talk about.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
