Yes. Catchy title eh?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI bring this up here after the concept of\u003Cem\u003E \u0027mod support in KSP II\u003C/em\u003E\u0027 came up in the Exhaust Plume Dev Diary. The question of how\u003Cem\u003E exactly \u003C/em\u003Eand what \u003Cem\u003Eexactly\u003C/em\u003E could/should be left exposed by the developers for modders to play with. This made me wonder if that conversation has been had and those questions asked about modding in general for KSPII. I\u0027ve seen plenty of discussion about what game features people would like to see in KSP2 but nothing specific about what mod authors would like to see.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSPII devs have made very clear their commitment to the modding community for KSP - which is great! A logical and surely useful question would therefore be: What do the mod authors want? Additionally, one could ask: what lessons can be learned from KSP1 modding? What roadblocks did modders find in KSP1 that could have been avoided if the original devs had done things a little differently? What hooks would mod authors like to see left exposed in KSP2 that were not in KSP1? What would mod authors like to be able to do in KSPII that is not possible - for whatever reason - in KSP1? How could KSP2 modding be more powerful, flexible and manageable for authors and users alike? I hope people will understand the spirit if what I\u0027m asking. Please don\u0027t misinterpret this topic as \u0022how did the devs screw up KSP1\u0022 or that I\u0027m somehow demanding/expecting infinite modability of KSP2. I just thought it was a pertinent topic that might be beneficial for everyone to discuss.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome examples of specific things that might be useful to the KSP2 devs to know for example could be:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen developing Scatterer, what things did Blackrack discover that could have made his/hers (????) life easier or Scatterer even better than it already is?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen developing Kopernicus, what did R-T-B learn that might benefit the KSP2 team?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat could Lisius say about developing nightmare mods like Tweakscale that could make it easier?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat could Serbian share that would make indispensable tools like Module Manager better?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo you see what I\u0027m getting at?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust to clarify what I mean by \u0027mod author.\u0027 I mean people who create entirely new entities and functionalities for the game - the Lisius\u0027, Blackracks, R-T-Bs and Neateas of the world; the tool creators; the hardcore code-writing most bodacious modding mofos from outer space.
