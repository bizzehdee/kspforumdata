Let me explain briefly how it works:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach maintenance mission has a \u0022random\u0022 cooldown (anywhere between 30 kerbin days, and 120 days) built into it. The thing is, each time a maintenance mission completes, that cooldown is reset for ALL of them. The contracts are weighted so that certain contracts are more likely to appear than others. If you are seeing mainly Crew Rotations, that\u0027s exactly how it should be. Now that\u0027s not to say the weighting doesn\u0027t need fiddling with, it may well need a rebalance. You\u0027ll have to wait until I get that far in my career though (nearly there) so I can do a proper balancing pass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe weighting works as follows - as mentioned, any time one of these missions are completed the cooldown resets. All times are in Kerbin days.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost Likely: Resupply and Crew Rotation - cooldown 30-120d - weighting 0.8 - if you\u0027ve done a crew rotation and have never seen resupply, then you won\u0027t. It only shows up if you have a supported life support mod installed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext Most likely: Repair/Replace a faulty power module \u0026amp; Do science.

Now, I can use CC to get the amount of a said resource on a vessel (such as LF).

A false negative (ie contract won\u0027t generate).
