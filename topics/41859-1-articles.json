On small scale stuff this isn\u0027t too big a deal, but on larger rockets it starts to become more noticeable. Especially when I try to build elaborate things that connect via docking ports and I find that I\u0027m off by just a few pixels because the height was different on something or other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do hope they eventually add height-snapping (or whatever it\u0027s called) into the game, but until then I\u0027ll settle for a mod if one exists.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToggle vertical snap mode.
