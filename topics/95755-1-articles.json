Today, when I tried to launch a newly created rocket, the fuel lines were not connected (even though they were in the VAB). I reverted to the VAB and they were not connected. I rebuilt the launcher and the same thing happened. I then reloaded the game (2 times) and stopped using open-gl, yet none of those fixed it. I went to a ship that had fuel lines previously attached and launched it, and the ship had fuel lines attached.
