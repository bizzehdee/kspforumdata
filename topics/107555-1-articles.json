Now when I launch it tips over on the launch pad before I can launch? I do not have the science yet to get the support things to hold it up what am I supposed to do? I can get it to launch if I quickly hit z and then space, but it\u0027s still at an angle as it fell slightly. I tried a few things like putting a decoupler on the bottom engine, and adding some small fuel boosters on each side to help balance it on the pad, but it still falls over \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://steamcommunity.com//sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=437592177\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://steamcommunity.com//sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=437592177\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe times I get it to launch and go straight like I want it to, once I hit 10km it also just immediately starts flipping like crazy?

The second stage would flip so I added fins in 3x symetry and it still flipped. Decided to add more drag and added the fins to the upperstage by 4x symetery. That worked, so the extra drag provided by an additional fin solved the problem and the rocket made it to space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also learned not to steer to far away from the prograde marker, keep it within 5 degrees until the upper atmosphere, with the new updates the game is less forgiving.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am noticing in the early career that fins are rather important and less so as you advance, could also just be how I design rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for coming off the pad at an angle I found lowering my boosters enough that they support the rocket on the pad helps.
