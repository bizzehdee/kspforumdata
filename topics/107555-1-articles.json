Now when I launch it tips over on the launch pad before I can launch? I do not have the science yet to get the support things to hold it up what am I supposed to do? I can get it to launch if I quickly hit z and then space, but it\u0027s still at an angle as it fell slightly. I tried a few things like putting a decoupler on the bottom engine, and adding some small fuel boosters on each side to help balance it on the pad, but it still falls over ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif). \n\n[http://steamcommunity.com//sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=437592177](http://steamcommunity.com//sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=437592177)\n\nThe times I get it to launch and go straight like I want it to, once I hit 10km it also just immediately starts flipping like crazy?

Remember to put them at the very bottom of your rocket to increase stability.\n\nAnd I don\u0027t know if you know it but ideal ascent profile has changed since 1.0. Tilt a 5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 at 50 to 100 m/s depending on the rocket, then gradually follow prograde marker until ~25 km where aerodynamics don\u0027t matter anymore"},{"CreatedByName":"Aerindel","CreatedById":109952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T00:49:42Z","Content":"Well, you don\u0027t have any fins or a SAS so how do you expect to control it? Stick some fins on the back end. You also can\u0027t yank rockets over at 10k like you used to. Start your turn very slowly at 1k and turn a few degrees every 1k after that until you hit 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA at about 15-20K \n\nAs for it falling over on the launch pad, that is strange, does it always fall the same direction? Its possible you rotated it by a small fraction on accident. I would rebuild it from scratch and it should balance just fine."},{"CreatedByName":"Bloody_looser","CreatedById":95664,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T00:49:47Z","Content":"You don\u0027t have any parts clipped in it, do you?\n\nAbout flipping rockets - use fins to stabilize them.

The second stage would flip so I added fins in 3x symetry and it still flipped. Decided to add more drag and added the fins to the upperstage by 4x symetery. That worked, so the extra drag provided by an additional fin solved the problem and the rocket made it to space.\n\nI also learned not to steer to far away from the prograde marker, keep it within 5 degrees until the upper atmosphere, with the new updates the game is less forgiving.\n\nI am noticing in the early career that fins are rather important and less so as you advance, could also just be how I design rockets.\n\nAs for coming off the pad at an angle I found lowering my boosters enough that they support the rocket on the pad helps. Until I get the launch stabilizers I hold off on building anything too tall that would only be supported by one rocket motor."},{"CreatedByName":"Sabor","CreatedById":59932,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T01:10:10Z","Content":"Launch clamps are a must. Just put them in the stage above your launch, activate engines, let it stabilize from shaking, detach clamps. Everything falls over for me without them. Whatever you gotta do to unlock them ASAP, do it"},{"CreatedByName":"Aragosnat","CreatedById":60487,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T03:53:04Z","Content":"Yeah. Also make sure that any side boosters are leveled with the ceter one. Had it where the sides ones where lower with no duct-tape which caused the certer to drop. Since it was tall, still tipped over even with fins on it. But, once the sides where leveled with it. No more tipping."},{"CreatedByName":"Gerandar","CreatedById":136705,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T04:01:43Z","Content":"put some fins on it or if you have launch clamps use them also by the picture you dont have SAS turned on when you do have a pilot in the capsule so you turning that on would help too o.o"},{"CreatedByName":"arkie87","CreatedById":103434,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T13:45:30Z","Content":"Your rocket is somehow not placed in the center.

Yes? Why?\n\nI say this because I have seen other people having the same problem on the forums.\n\nAnd if your rocket is tall, CoM is higher so it is less stable on the ground. If it\u0027s wide, then the area on the launchpad (either main engine or radial parts) is greater so it\u0027s more stable, or there can be several points touching the launchpad.\n\nBut really, you can forget about the above as soon as you get launch clamps."}]}
