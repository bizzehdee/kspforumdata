I\u0027ve designed a probe, stored it as a subassembly, and I\u0027m trying to build a cargo bay on the upper stage of my launcher. However, I can\u0027t seem to attach the probe inside the cargo bay. I only get attachment nodes for the ends.\n\nIf I put the end piece on the end of the cargo bay, there\u0027s no node to attach my probe:\n\n![Olj4TLcl.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Olj4TLcl.jpg)\n\nIf I attach the probe, upside down, to the node at the open end of the cargo bay I then can\u0027t attach the nose cone:\n\n![djBMH9Sl.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/djBMH9Sl.jpg)\n\nWhat am I doing wrong? Could it be a mod screwing this up?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-29T08:11:54Z\u0022 title=\u002203/29/2015 08:11  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Hyperlynx**"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-29T07:54:18Z","Content":"Once an attachment node is occupied most of the time you can not attach anything else to it.
