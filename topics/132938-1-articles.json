At HD resolutions the text is just unreadable. I don\u0027t understand why this isn\u0027t considered a high priority for development, and especially not featured now that it has been fully released. I\u0027m hoping I can return KSP because I will not invest in games whose developers haven\u0027t even made the UI scale with game resolution. Frankly, being able to read the text at resolutions higher than 720p is just a common sense thing. There is no community fix to this, it has to be done by the developers. KSP is a great game when it is playable, but it just isn\u0027t when modern resolutions make it unreadable. I hope the developers care enough to read this, but I highly doubt this will ever be fixed.
