Using robotic parts sounds like a good way to deal with alignment issues - just extend and pivot until the two docking parts are aligned. However, when I try, the smaller part that gets docked starts bouncing uncontrollably.

What \u003Cstrong\u003Ecould\u003C/strong\u003E help is: a) not having the stationary mining rig on landing legs, but on girders with grip pads. (I.e. retract the legs after landing.)

I think that is because the restoring force of the robotic parts is not a (badly modeled) spring but the engine power of said part.
