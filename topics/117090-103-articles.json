I was using a mixture of LF and other tanks for a Duna/Mars vehicle because I wanted a more streamlined look (even if it doesn\u0027t matter in the game as is).\n\nThe SAS stuff is odd, and I think my issues were not being up to date on SSTU on my career save (I have a pure, SSTU test build as well).\n\nOne thing is that if the upper stage tanks and SMs have SAS, *and* the command pods have it, then it sort of defeats the purpose of having a SM. Of course in that case you still want SAS for reentry, etc, so redundancy is OK as long as they don\u0027t fight with each other.\n\nFrom a play balance (stock feel), I can see some point in the pilot vs sci/eng kerbal distinction, though I end up throwing probes on everything anyway. One interesting idea for balance that leaves all the \u0022probe\u0022 stuff intact is very low, or nil torque SAS, so that the pod can steer, but MUST use RCS to do so. Then maybe the SM has the flywheel... just throwing stuff out there, I have to go for a hike, will post more tonight."},{"CreatedByName":"blowfish","CreatedById":119688,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-20T19:17:25Z","Content":"[@tater](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/119411-tater/) Couple of things:\n\n1.
