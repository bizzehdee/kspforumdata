This isn\u0027t because refined or processed sugars (including HFCS) are particularly bad compared to other carb sources (despite what some may say) - it\u0027s because these sources tend to have \u003Cem\u003Elots\u003C/em\u003E of carbs, and you need to reduce your total carb intake. As you already recognize you struggle with obesity, you\u0027ve already realized much of your current carbohydrate intake is unnecessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not quite as simple as \u0022cut sugar,\u0022 though it may look like it - you still need a good balance of simple and complex sugars and starches. Simple sugars raise blood glucose more quickly, starches take longer. But starch still has a notable effect. Ultimately it all becomes glucose before it\u0027s used. Hopefully your health providers can refer a dietician; they would be more helpful than any of us in determining an appropriate diet for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote this is good advice for everyone, not just diabetics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing I \u003Cem\u003Ecan\u003C/em\u003E recommend for certain is to avoid between-meal snacks (particularly candy) and cut soda-pop, juice, or juice-like drinks out of your habits. Those are \u003Cem\u003Eloaded\u003C/em\u003E with simple sugars, and it\u0027s a simple step to drastically reduce carb consumption.

I won\u0027t push any particular diet because I\u0027m a firm believer that there is no one diet that\u0027s right for everyone. I\u0027d recommend looking into nutritional info and a few different diets to find one that works for you, as a diet with perfect benefits that you can\u0027t stick to isn\u0027t going to help in the long run as much as any diet that helps that you can stick to, because sadly, this is the rest of your life that you\u0027re talking about.

I had a few meals that were low enough in protein that the first time I lined up one low protein meal with a low-to-medium protein meal in the same day, I didn\u0027t get enough protein and was feeling off during the late evening. Still, I\u0027m losing a pound or two a week most weeks while maintaining decent energy levels and not missing my favorite foods much, which means it will take a long time to get my weight back down where it should be, but after all, it took a good 30 years to gain it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stargate525","CreatedById":53585,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-03T18:53:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022pincushionman\u0022 data-cite=\u0022pincushionman\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAs is probably apparent already, there are two forms of diabetes:\u003Cp\u003EType 1 (\u0022juvenile onset\u0022): Pancreas no longer produces insulin.

Taking more exercise AND eating less sugar and fat will give your muscles a chance to become less insensitive to insulin. Eating less sugar and fat helps, exercise helps, but you really have to do both.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t exercise too heavily at the start: build up the exercise slowly so you have a chance to improve your fitness.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFoods made from unmilled grains are very low-GI and are very useful for treating early-stage type 2 diabetes. Examples are boiled rice, porridge made from whole grains such as rolled oats, and boiled barley are the sort of thing you need to look at.

So look out for traditional cookery books.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt may help to avoid artificial sweeteners.

Some salt in your diet is necessary, but it\u0027s easy to get too much of it, especially if you\u0027re sensitive to it. At least some people have a harder time losing weight if they cut fat out of their diet completely instead of limiting it to a small amount.

The autoantibodies themselves do not cause disease, but the B-cells and plasma cells are attracted to beta-islet cell surface and attract the CD8\u002B T-cells (killer cell phenotype) which kill the islet cells. The how of the B-cell homing to islet cell and cytokine/lymphokine attraction to islet cells has not be fully worked out. Risk factors are maternal (lack of sunlight, excess blood sugar, lack of vitamin D in diet, infection), neonatal (HLA class II antigens, non-HLA autoimmune gene risk factors, birthweight, Age of wheat consumuption onset-dubious, presence of gluten sensitivity \u0027Coeliac disease\u0027, neonatal viral infections of the GI tract including coxsackie virus, enterovirus, influenza, and via coeliac risk rotavirus) and adult (Type II diabetes, obesity, HLA DR3-DQ2/DR4-DQ8 genotype, aracidonate, another autoimmune disease). Conversion of autoantibody profile from one to two specificities predicts future disease and more than two autoantibodies correlates with type 1 diabetes.

They are currently undertaking a large decadal epidemiological study in Europe (largely norther Europe) to find the causes and best treatment strategies for type 1 diabetes. Hopefully we will finally get some answers on the environmental factors that cause this terrible disease. The causes appear at present to run in cycles, with viral infections playing a big wild-card in children, and vitamin-D and sunlight levels in female parents of diabetic children. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther risk factors include saturated fat versus poly-unsaturated (alpha-linoleic acid derivatives) fat in diet. Common to all diabetes appear to be the role of gastrointestinal sensitizing agents such as NSAIDS, wheat and other big 8 allergens, glutamate, benzoate, tartarazine. It is not clear why but elements of the innate immune system may respond to GI stress by sending signals to the ducts that connect to the gall bladder, pancrease and liver and alter their function. This can cause fatigue and make diabetes worse. Bread is a good thing to back off of for several reasons, packaged drinks have alot of benzoate and sugar. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGlucose in its linear form is an aldehyde, it reacts with -NH2 (protein amino moieties) to form schiff bases, and this can cause permanent damage to the bodies non-regenerative tissues (brain, eyes), but also leads into metabolic syndrome. Its damage over time. It also reacts with hemoglobin forming A1C. A1C is a measure of spikey glucose which often occurs because people do not eat regular meals but a large dinner and then go to sleep. The primary goal is to reduce glucose spikes. This means 3 healthy meals and one snack a day. Dinner (classically a big meal) should not be the largest meal, should be low in carbs and should not be eaten 4 hours before sleeping. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExcercise is very effective at treating type 2 diabetes, but if the diet is messed up the individual may feel depressed and not feel like exercising. Chronic subacute inflammation of the bowel is frequently undetected in diabetics and is often the result of a bad diet. Changing the diet increasing vitamin B and omega-3 fats (cold-water fish, flax seed oil and canola oil) increase the energy levels and help to reduce inflammation. In Northern Europe vitamin D also appears to be a common deficiency and this is known to affect risk for 2 forms of diabetes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBread is not as essential as Europeans make it out to be, the Mesolithich peoples of Europe did not eat bread, they lived on Fish meats, hazelnuts, fruits and tubers, compared to their neolithic counterparts they were alot healthier. The bread/Cow diet is suitable for settled peoples but mesolithic peoples need energy because they are constantly moving about. The basic analogy here is that Finland has the highest diabetes rates in the world, particularly type 1, the same peoples on the other side of the border in Russia have 10 fold lower type 1. Finland unfortunately is one of two peoples that have high composite levels of DR3-DQ2 and DR4-DQ8. The other comparable is Jalisco Mexico. Oddly type 1 diabetes in Jalisco is lower, restricted to mainly peoples of European primary descent (DR3-DQ2 bearers largely from Basque) even though the levels of DR4-DQ8 is much higher in mestizo derived and in Europe and the US is DR4-DQ8 is a much higher risk factor for type 1 diabetes. Corn tortillas versus bread. Think global food alternatives. I am fortunate because I was brought up between two food cultures (Mexican and American) and I live close to one of the biggest outdoor food markets in the southern United States. So I can pick the best of food cultures that span the Americas and most of the European foods. I don\u0027t even think about bread anymore, the more you find the good stuff the less you want to eat junk. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhole grains bind the starch up in fiber, it takes time for gut amylases to reach the starch and for the sugars to diffuse out and reach the lamina propria of the small intestine. Wheat flour is 95% starch finely ground, it takes no time in the stomach for amylases to reach the starch and turn it into glucose, the same is true for white rice (99.5% starch). This sugars goes into the blood stream as soon as it finds a surface it can be absorbed through. In essence bread and white rice are akin to eating their dry weight in sugar. The best sources of sugar in whole grains are those with fiber content over 8%, these are whole oats, buckwheat (chopped), and Quinoa. Chopped or nixtzmalized corn (nixtmalized corn has no free sugar) are a cheep alternative. I would not say beans are particularly bad, but refried beans may have the same release rate as wheat flour and alot of saturated fat. But there are lots of alternative grains, chopped malted barley, millet, etc. Just about every culture has a cheap readily available whole grain alternative. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E In other words its not the thing so much as what is done to the thing after it goes into processing, highly processed foods release their payload quickly, and unprocessed foods need the process of diffusion over time to get their goodies out.

The problem is that excessive calories is a tax on the liver. From an excercise point of view the body really wants to burn fat, fat burns in pure O2 but glucose undergoes the alanine cycle and produces lactic acid. So the liver likes to convert sugar to fat and send it off to the muscles in LDL bodies. This ages the liver more rapidly than if one has a balanced diet of protein, fat and carbohydrates. The problem with consuming fat to solve this problem is the cheapest source of fat is animal fat (generally the fat of animals that have been raised in feed lots) and is not healthy because of the high levels of saturation and arachidonate. As long as you are very athletic, meaning you are not accumulating fat, the arachindonate burns. But if you are not this the arachidonate rises and causes inflammation (increasing risk for rhuematoid arthritis and type 1 diabetes), but also increasing risk for prostate cancer and putatively (base on animal studies) breast and ovarian cancers. So there is no fast remedy to deal with excess calories. There is also the believe that steroids can help you pack on muscle and this will help deal with excess calories in the diet. Muscle is made of protein from dietary amino-acids, and for this to work you actually have be be working out before taking them, otherwise all the excess calories are added as weight, a small amount of muscle increase and alot of fat. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suspect the OP had a finding from his doctor that he had borderline Hb A1C. This is a common finding in young people and it will lead to diabetes over years, but it is so easily remedied because the spike of glucose often occurs (even in fit individuals) because they eat something sweet like ice-cream before going to bed. If glucose spikes are the problem (meaning A1C is borderline or high) then simply removing the spikes corrects the problem, its relatively easy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E_However_ as one ages one becomes more susceptible to the effects of glucose, metabolism slows down, and so we also need to eat less. There was a recent study from New Zealand suggesting that at 38 years of age some individuals are aging 3 times faster than others. I suspect that sugar intake is part of this equation. The second easy remedy is to remember that 3 meals a day and a snack, with the lion share of the calories in the breakfast and lunch can really take the head off the spikes. They also make your metabolism work more efficiently and keep the vital organs from aging too fast and declining. Third fat burns in a small stream of sugar, and so if you want the body to burn fat nominally you should not have glucose swinging up to 200mg/dL and then down to 60.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jesrad","CreatedById":49762,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T08:27:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELots of useful info here \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E I\u0027ve not seen mentions of the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://freetheanimal.com/2015/06/enrichment-theory-everything.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Erole of iron enrichment of food in dabetes/obesity trends\u003C/a\u003E though so I thought I\u0027d add it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EExcercise is very effective at treating type 2 diabetes\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually, that hypothesis was tested and \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/20/health/in-study-weight-loss-did-not-prevent-heart-attacks-in-diabetics.html?_r=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eturned out wrong.\u003C/a\u003E Exercize is either not very effective, or not effective at all, depending on the stage of metabolic disorder in the patient.

And increased consumption of lean red meat is sufficient to trip the switch on HC induced depression. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EInsulin resistance\u003C/a\u003E (often patients have already been diagnosed with \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_2\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ediabetes mellitus type 2\u003C/a\u003E) due to \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Epancreatic\u003C/a\u003E damage from \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eiron\u003C/a\u003E deposition\u0022-WP-Hereditary hemochromatosis. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are other conditions also, like polycystic ovary syndrome that one needs to be aware of. So you know, can tell a story of a PCP who tested iron saturation and had a high level but forgot he did the test or tell the patient, and the patient walks into his office 4 years later with a 96% (the limit for ferritin test) saturation and spiralling physiological depression. It goes without saying that if there is another underlying cause for insulin resistance, and exercise and diet are not working the physician and patient should work together to find out what the cause is. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEditorial addition to response: Although I thought the point previously made clear; I should point one area of agreement to Jesrad. For borderline diabetes or prediabetes (people with high A1C and normal fasting glucose), exercise may not be of benefit. Hemoglobin A1C is also seen in athletes and long distance runners, borderline and high A1C with normal fasting glucose is not the fault of lack of exercise although exercise will help to burn fat off the liver that the spike that creates the A1C creates. A1C is indicative of accumulating damage (independent of mitochondrial damage mentioned by Jesrad). This state is almost entirely due to glucose spikes, a result of modern processed foods and drinks and therefore the cause of the spike should be reduced or eliminated from the diet. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe one thing that really does work with diabetes type 2 is dietary adaptation \u003Ca href=\u0022https://scholar.google.fr/scholar?q=low-carbohydrate\u002Bdiabetes\u002Bimprovement\u0026amp;hl=en\u0026amp;as_sdt=0\u0026amp;as_vis=1\u0026amp;oi=scholart\u0026amp;sa=X\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eby eating a lot less carbohydrates\u003C/a\u003E or switching to carbohydrates that are resistant to human digestion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYup, very important detail here. It seems that sustained glycolysis in slight hyperglycemic state with presence of certain (oxydized ?) fatty acids causes cumulative damage to the mitochondria and all kinds of enzymatic machinery around them, that might be the central cause of insulin resistance in muscles (then causing obesity, diabetes type 2, fatty liver, etc.) and onset of Alzheimer\u0027s disease in neurons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut mitochondria can proliferatively replace themselves, there are 50 or so copies per cell, much more in a muscle \u0027cell\u0027. Their are a whole host of problems of burning sugars instead of fats. Lactic acid build up damages neurons and other tissues. Its best to exercise before a meal than after. If you track a long distance runner from the beginning to the end of training for a marathon, the muscles demonstrate they are very good at responding to increase demand. There is an increase of blood flow, increase in myoglobin levels, and increase in mitochondria. The way to get a marathon like muscle mass good at burning fat and indirectly the fat that sugar produces is to excercise. To build muscle however a good source of lean meat is much better for fat, iron and low glucose. You will find yourself however at some outdoor market buying bison meat out of an ice-chest because most of the meat sold at grocery stores is loaded with bad fat (the only exception I can think of trimmed beef heart) and for certain individuals the high levels of arachidonate in in lot fed meat can exacerbate cramping and pain issues. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think I am inclined to follow the believe that a person who regularly engages in vigorous exercise including vigorous walking has a trained muscle that will upon increased demand principally burn fat high, sugar or high fat diet aside. If a person does not reach this level of exercise, their bodies will prefer to burn sugars even if they occasionally vigorously exercise.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-08T16:42:35Z\u0022 title=\u002207/08/2015 04:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by PB666\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
