Basically, I uninstalled the mod, and the following happened:\n\n- Kerbals duplicated on re-entering a vehicle from IVA.\n- Quickloads going major kraken -- everything moved to the centre of the sun.\n- Other instabilities.\n\nSo, I reinstalled the mod, and these problems remained. So, as I luckily use a save back-up system, I restored an earlier save file that had never seen the game in a state where the mod was uninstalled. Still got the problems. This leads me to think that somehow the install had become corrupted, so I verified the files on Steam and it downloaded a couple. Tried again -- same problem. So maybe this has caused another mod to go weird or caused a problem with Module Manager?\n\nThe reason I believe that the problem was caused by this mod is just that there have been no other changes to my install. I played for a bit, closed the game, uninstalled the mod, opened the game and everything\u0027s gone haywire.\n\nI can provide a log file, but it\u0027s four meg.

Switch back to Space-Center, wait 3 hours and go back tu Station EU1. Now the Orientation differs by 40\u00B0 from prograde.\n\u003E \n\nI am not quite sure what you mean, let me restate what I have understood:\n\nYour station is positioned in orbit around Kerbin, at a inclination that differs from 0\u00B0 by quite a lot. It is oriented prograde, you have activated Persistent Rotation in \u0022Rotation\u0022 mode, have set the reference to Kerbin and have \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E enabled. Now you leave the game scene and go to the space center, from where you timewarp a bit, only to retake control of the station. The station does now not have the same orientation anymore.\n\nOk. Here is a little checklist I kindly ask you to go through:\n\n- If you have other mods installed, deactivate them for once and recreate the procedure from before. If it works now, please find the mod that causes the procedure to fail.\n\n- Check the log file after experiencing the bug for exceptions. if you find any, let me know.\n\n- Delete all cfg files in the PersistentRotation\\PluginData folder. Retry the procedure.\n\n- If no bullet point above yielded any information, please make a screenshot of the navball and the orbit before and after the procedure.\n\nI know this takes a bit of time, but I would be really happy to get some help.\n\nI, for myself, tested every case of orbital parameters, timewarps and scene changes imaginable and didn\u0027t run into any problems. That\u0027s why, with this problem, I am dependend on you, [@hraban](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/145453-hraban/). ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"hraban","CreatedById":145453,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-04T12:52:27Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 5 minutes ago, MarkusA380 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I am not quite sure what you mean, let me restate what I have understood:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Your station is positioned in orbit around Kerbin, at a inclination that differs from 0\u00B0 by quite a lot.
