Anything big enough to impart that much acceleration in a single go will most likely kick off massive tectonic activity. The resulting earthquakes on a global scale would prety much flaten our civilization. there might be some survivors of the initial event but dont expect many buildings to remain standing.

The problem with multiple passes is that such an event would be have to happen in stages over a very long time (years), there is also the problem of avoiding other planets. Mercury, Venus and Mars would cause problems, if the event occurs for more than a decade Jupiter would be added to that list to.

To escape, you need to boost it to 42km/s. So you need to pick up 12km/s from a fly-by of the rogue planet. In principle, with point masses, you could get a boost to an arbitrary speed. The rogue just has to move fast enough. But you want the planet intact, and that limits the closest approach distance. The absolute minimum is Roche limit for a liquid body. For rogue of Earth\u0027s mass, that puts you at about 8,000km. The rogue would take up a quarter of the sky at the closest approach if it came that close. But that limit is just enough to prevent Earth from falling apart. You\u0027d still loose a lot of atmosphere, and you are almost guaranteed all sorts of tectonic problems. Fortunately, tidal forces drop really fast with distance.
