I find this kind of stupid, though for the Shuttle it was fine, as \u0022Shuttle 1\u0022 doesn\u0027t sound good, so STS-1 was selected instead, but I find it stupid for NASA to be having an abbreviation for the names of their Orion missions. Orion is as good as a name as Apollo, and I think \u0022Orion 1\u0022 would be perfect, and a bit of a reference to the glory days of Apollo. Also, for example, if the first human mission to Mars is done by NASA, would you think it was fine if we remembered it as \u0022EM-14\u0022 instead of \u0022Orion 14\u0022? It sound stupid, and is nowhere near as good sounding and rememberable as \u0022Apollo 11\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etl;dr: I think \u0022EM\u0022 sounds stupid and \u0022Orion\u0022 sound completely better.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RogueMason","CreatedById":45069,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-15T21:14:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d definitely prefer the likes of \u0027Orion \u003Cem\u003Ex\u003C/em\u003E\u0027 as opposed to \u0027EM \u003Cem\u003Ex\u003C/em\u003E\u0027 as it is more in keeping with what appears to be tradition.
