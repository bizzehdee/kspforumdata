When I played with this mod previously, the first thing I noticed was that you lose that feature. Is that some how wrapped up in how the torque gets manipulated by this mod or are we just stuck with whatever is in the configs of the particular reaction wheel in question?

Yes the dV stays the same, but the Burn time and the MaxTWR\u00A0do not change when you set the LimiterEnd, so glancing at the MaxTWR while you tweak the Thrust setting isn\u0027t really perfect, since the Burn time will alter the amount of fuel you have at the end of the stage.
