The same thing happens to me when I use symmetry. It doesn\u0027t happen when I attach the cargo pods individually. I think this is a bug in Firespitter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@RoverDude - My best guess is that Firespitter gets confused when there is more than one FsTextureSwitch2 module and parts are attached using symmetry. The moduleids are supposed to prevent this but they don\u0027t seem to be working. The editor changes in .90 are probably responsible for the breakage. I spent a couple of hours playing with configs and modifying my persistent without success. I never thought to test what would happen with just one textureswitch module because I was going for a certain look but I bet this problem would disappear. I haven\u0027t noticed this problem with parts with just one module (like the storage tank but I\u0027ll test next time I load up KSP).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit - Tested with the MKS Storage Tanks attached with symmetry and no problem with Firespitter.

I misspoke when I referenced Kontainers rather then Cargo Pods in my post below (I\u0027ve since edited it - whoops). The problem should only exist with parts with multiple FStextureSwitch2 modules like the FTT Cargo Pods (small and large). The Cargo Pods give you three options - Change Cargo, Change Main Texture, and Change Trim Texture. Each of those is handled by a separate texture switch module. Firespitter appears to be getting confused about which module changes what when you attach the cargo pods in symmetry. Which is why the Cargo changes when you change a texture and the textures of the Cargo Pods get out of sync. I pretty sure this is a bug in Firespitter that happened when Squad made changes to the Editor and Symmetry in .90.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-23T21:12:11Z\u0022 title=\u002202/23/2015 09:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Tarheel1999\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T21:15:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActually, I read somewhere that there is a bug with firespitter (or something) where if you have three resources in something (or maybe it was three texture switch options?), things bug out, I think four might be fine?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tarheel1999","CreatedById":123965,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T21:18:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022AcidEric\u0022 data-cite=\u0022AcidEric\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBy download do you mean copy the cfg text into the relevant cfg in my game folder?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can do that or you can just copy and replace the part cfgs into the appropriate directory. The trick is that the \u0022tankcost\u0022 line in the part config file needs to be more than the cost of the resource. So for a tank that holds 9000 rocket parts the tank cost needs to be more than 9000 * 5 (45,000). This is because Squad decided to define tank cost as the cost of a FULL tank and not an empty one. So when you empty a tanks is subtracts the resource amount from the cost of the part. I\u0027m sure most modders would have preferred if they had done it the other way.
