Your center of lift is really close to the center of mass. The CoL doesn\u0027t just need to be \u0027behind\u0027 the CoM, but the larger the distance is between the two, the more stable the plane becomes. And the center of mass will move even further backwards when using fuel. Just move the CoL further backwards to make it more stable."},{"CreatedByName":"Ion Man","CreatedById":138259,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T14:25:45Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Well found the answer myself after extensive research, apparently having multiple engines in a swept wing design with the angled control surfaces causes this issue, now i wonder if this is a bug or intended so no idea where to go from here....\n\nYes,\n\nyour design is unstable in itself. You want to control the aircraft at the back with vertical and horizontal surfaces. Your plane looks like a lifting body, where the control surface is spanning from in front of the COM to Behind of the COM. This results in inconclusive unstable flight.\n\nThe contol surfaces can\u0027t be adjusted individually to the point that makes the plane stable in KSP. In real life, the B2 bomber is fully automatic, fly by wire, algorythm controllend to stay in the air."},{"CreatedByName":"Diabloblaze24","CreatedById":29418,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T05:36:31Z","Content":"Ok thanks for the info just not used to a better aerodynamic model so thought that the CoL only had to just be behind the CoM I see that\u0027s not the case, why is it that i can control the craft fine when SAS is not enabled?"}]}
