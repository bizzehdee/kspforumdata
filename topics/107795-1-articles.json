I am having problems making a vessel that can re-enter properly. Ever since 1.0, and the re-entry heat, I generally only return Kerbals using the one man capsule (The black one you unlock at the very start of the game) or the three man Caupsle, often with nothing more than an appropriately-sized heat shield and a chute on it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I have noticed that the pod has a tendency to not want to properly orient on entry. (With the heat shield facing prograde). This isn\u0027t a problem if I have a pilot and some power to spare, but if I either run out of power or can\u0027t engage SAS due to lack of a pilot or probe body, the pod will orient itself funny as it enters the atmosphere. Sometimes entering pointing straight down rather than at an angle into the airstream, or entering sideways, or of course just tumbling randomly around, leading to the yet-to-be-deployed chute overheating and getting destroyed or the pod itself being destroyed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAreodynamics bug or planned feature?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-06T02:31:40Z\u0022 title=\u002205/06/2015 02:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kuansenhama\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xXIndestructibleEVAXx","CreatedById":110214,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T02:02:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat version are you using? 1.0 or 1.0.1/1.0.2?
