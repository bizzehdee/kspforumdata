It\u0027s the same reason Squad is handing out the DLC for free to those early buyers, as they\u0027re bound to a EULA that worded it ambiguously (yes, they might win each individual court case. But court cases are expensive). What happens when you break the EULA? In most cases, actually, nothing; it\u0027s not worth it for the license holder to take you to court.. What happens when you break the EULA in such a way that it\u0027s causing significant financial damage to the owner of the EULA? They\u0027ll take you to court. It\u0027s not rocket science. And even if it were, given that this is the KSP forum, we can safely discuss it.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThere\u0027s legislation against legal muzzling.
