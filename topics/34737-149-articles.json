Only happens on parts that have been scaled. Upon re-placing the part, it gains mass. Sometimes it gained mass every time I picked up the part off the ship and put it back on, and seemed exponential - ultimately up to millions of tons for something like a landing leg.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Not just a problem with mass readout from MechJeb: crafts that got saved/reloaded, or where parts were picked up and re-placed in symmetry, really did weigh hundreds of thousands of tons and couldn\u0027t take off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI deleted the scale.dll from the MSI folder just to see if that was the problem, and parts now can scale in the VAB and do have the correct masses when picked up / re-attached... will having only the scale.dll from TweakScale cause problems because of referring to MSI\u0027s copy, then? I mean to say that I don\u0027t know how references in DLLs work - is it just necessary for there to be one scale.dll somewhere in gamedata, or does it have to be a copy at a specific location or something like that?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually let me test this, this may be a problem I\u0027m running into with something else.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sirkut","CreatedById":57229,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-24T01:10:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDeleting the scale.dll is fine.
