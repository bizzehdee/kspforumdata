In short, you\u0027ll be asked constantly to allow running a program as root; of course you can setup trusts (or just use root as your default account XD) but you aren\u0027t going to escape UAC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELinux and Windows (as a user desktop) \u0022just are\u0022 they\u0027re not really in a good position to say one is better than the other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELinux \u003Cem\u003Ecan \u003C/em\u003Erun on anything, though various distros are obscenely bloated. The problem with linux is that having no solid foundation (you can remove everything until you get down to the kernel and you probably can remove that as well) cleaning a distro takes considerably more time than just getting the kernel installed with a package manager \u002B networking... then downloading what you really want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce fully setup to exactly how the user likes it; windows and linux, as desktop software, is identical. The only difference is how much restriction you have in getting it to be \u0022how you like it\u0022, linux has restrictions to hell due to relying on the \u0022if you don\u0027t like it, fork it\u0022 methodology. Windows has restrictions due to the \u0022If you don\u0027t like it, we don\u0027t care either!\u0022 methodology... but if we\u0027re going to let linux get away with using non-integrated software (like file managers) we can do the same for windows (a file manager is just a program, so if you don\u0027t like it \u0022download another\u0022 does work for windows.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce the illusion is removed, you realize that the only part of \u0022Windows\u0022 you\u0027re really stuck with is the Window Manager (well, and a bunch of subsystems but it\u0027s the GUI that people really focus on) (and possible the taskbar, though I suspect enough interfaces exist to at least capture the \u0022active foreground tasks\u0022 and make your own.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUltimately, you need a REAL reason to switch OS\u0027. If you think linux will make the computer \u0022run faster\u0022 you\u0027re wrong, you just need to clean up all the junk currently installed and running and the computer will operate as before. (Also, disable some 90% of the currently running services; look them up first but most you don\u0027t need for a typical \u0022at home\u0022 user desktop.) Neither linux, nor windows, will actually make your system \u0022a beast\u0022 it\u0027s all smoke and mirrors tricks people pull to make it seem one is better than the other.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pincushionman","CreatedById":98495,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T07:13:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBefore you ask \u0022what should we do\u0022 with it, you need to decide what you want to \u003Cem\u003EDO\u003C/em\u003E with it.
