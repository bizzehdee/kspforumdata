I\u0027d just like to ask about something weird that\u0027s been happening lately to me, and what mods you guys think could be causing it. Below is a screenshot:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s21.postimg.org/xuuj9zb2v/ksp_bug.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ksp_bug.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see, I clearly have enough electric charge, but when I right-click on the module, it says I don\u0027t. And just like when you normally run out of electric charge, I can\u0027t control my vessel at all. (By the way, the only reason it shows some electric charge was used was because SAS was on and was sucking up a bit of power).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I have quite a few mods installed, so I\u0027m going to attempt to only write the ones down that I think could be related to the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EUniverse Replacer\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EFAR\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EIoncross Crew Support\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EB9 Aerospace\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EDeadly Reentry\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven some of these I really doubt, like B9 Aerospace, FAR, and Deadly Reentry. I\u0027ve tried removing one at a time Universe Replacer and Ioncross Crew Support, and each time the problem didn\u0027t happen. But then again, I still haven\u0027t figured out how to successfully reproduce it each time. One thing I should mention is that KSP is using about 5 gigabytes of RAM, and crashes because of that sometimes. When I remove Universe Replacer, then it works great (because it uses less RAM). But I just don\u0027t think that \u0022not enough electric charge\u0022 could be related to the amount of RAM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance for your help!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUPDATE: I think the problem only happens when I use a probe core for control... if that means anything.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-15T14:13:49Z\u0022 title=\u002210/15/2013 02:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 15, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Andrew Hansen\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Andrew Hansen","CreatedById":82311,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-16T00:00:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo replies? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"astropapi1","CreatedById":57507,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-16T00:18:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMight be ICF or DR.
