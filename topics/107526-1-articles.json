As it is it\u0027s a huge mess and it\u0027s hard to find any mod that hasn\u0027t got any new posts in its thread, especially if you don\u0027t remember its name. The only categorization right now is an unnoticeable and generally not very useful [part] or [plugin]. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it was split into categories the same way Tools and Applications are separated right now, then it could become much more manageable. Every category could have its own prefixes, so looking for a specific mod could be a lot easier. Also I think that would make it easier to notice those new mods that haven\u0027t yet become popular.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould it be done? If it could be done, would it be a mess to move all mods to the correct categories?

Use the advanced search function and \u0022search thread titles only\u0022 for the mod name reliably delivers the correct thread.
