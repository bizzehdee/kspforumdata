People always say that its gone and it doesn\u0027t exist anymore. There has also been some speculation that black holes are like wormholes and can transport you to alternate dimensions or other universes. i support this theory only because matter cant be created or destroyed but only transformed, its a real law look it up. so i want to know your opinions and see if there is anything else possible.
