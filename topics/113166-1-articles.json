People always say that its gone and it doesn\u0027t exist anymore. There has also been some speculation that black holes are like wormholes and can transport you to alternate dimensions or other universes. i support this theory only because matter cant be created or destroyed but only transformed, its a real law look it up. so i want to know your opinions and see if there is anything else possible.

Black holes are also a logically consistent extension of processes resulting in other astronomical bodies which are observable - from Wikipedia:\n\n\u0022In 1931, Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar calculated, using special relativity, that a non-rotating body of electron-degenerate matter above a certain limiting mass (now called the Chandrasekhar limit at 1.4 M\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u0153\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0) has no stable solutions.[15] His arguments were opposed by many of his contemporaries like Eddington and Lev Landau, who argued that some yet unknown mechanism would stop the collapse.[16] They were partly correct: a white dwarf slightly more massive than the Chandrasekhar limit will collapse into a neutron star,[17] which is itself stable because of the Pauli exclusion principle. But in 1939, Robert Oppenheimer and others predicted that neutron stars above approximately 3 M\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u0153\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0 (the Tolman\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153Oppenheimer\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153Volkoff limit) would collapse into black holes for the reasons presented by Chandrasekhar, and concluded that no law of physics was likely to intervene and stop at least some stars from collapsing to black holes.[18]\u0022\n\nFinally, they also account for other observed phenomena as mentioned by ZetaX.\n\nSo, maths, observation and science but not trolling. Black holes might not be real but any alternative explanation for observed phenomena such as, for example, gravitational lensing, will also need to explain and be consistent with a lot of other observations and theory.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-17T18:44:40Z\u0022 title=\u002206/17/2015 06:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KSK**"},{"CreatedByName":"justidutch","CreatedById":99185,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T18:48:41Z","Content":"This is reminding me of Dark Matter.
