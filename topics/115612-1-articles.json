I was wondering if there were any manual recovery mods, because I think it would be fun to create things like trucks or boats in order to recover landed crafts and bring them safely back to the KSC.![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-11T03:35:39Z","Content":"Well, theres the abstract stage recovery mod. Still though, there isn\u0027t a single \u0027recovery mod\u0027 as you describe, but what you describe is easily doable with KIS\u002BKAS and theres a number of mods out there with car and boat models."},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-11T07:19:57Z","Content":"Are you looking for a mod to disable the \u0022recover\u0022 button?
