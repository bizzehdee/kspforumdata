Is this a limitation of low-starred pilots? For reference:\n\nYes I had RCS turned on.\n\nYes I had enough monoprop\n\nCaps Lock (Fine Control) was Off.\n\nThe pod was piloted by Jeb (1 star)\n\nThere were no particle trails coming out of the nozzles when I pressed the buttons, completely unresponsive. WASD still worked and used the RCS for rotation, it was just the translation keys that weren\u0027t doing anything. Even when I entered Docking Mode and used WASD, still no translation."},{"CreatedByName":"impyre","CreatedById":116031,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T03:08:03Z","Content":"That is an interesting problem.

Also maybe check your keybindings for the linear RCS controls? Other than that, must be a bug.

I have never changed it and always used HNJKLI.
