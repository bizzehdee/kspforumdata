Use the attitude error as if it\u0027s altitude, measure turn rate off of how quickly attitude error changes and use that as velocity, and measure change in turn rate over time (Degrees per second squared) and use that in place of your T/W. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECalculate a table that is updated live based off of your (degrees per second squared) multiplied by an aggressiveness factor (0 to 1, zero does not even try and one will fling the controls full force one way until half way there, then full force in reverse to the target, set by user). This table indicates the desired turn rate per attitude error, much in the same way that the landing autopilot specifies a desired velocity per altitude and feeds that value into the translatron. If the current turn rate is below this, it will thrust to increase turn rate. If it is over this, it will thrust to reduce it\u0027s turn rate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously this gets complicated if you change your target attitude, but that can be attributed to user error. Either don\u0027t change your desired attitude so suddenly, or don\u0027t set the aggressiveness factor so high that mechjeb can\u0027t react fast enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, fix the method of attitude change.

Lots of people were complaining about MJ waiting many orbits at low altitude with low warp limits before it reached its transfer window for intercept. And some people were starting at exactly the same altitude as their target, which means it will take infinitely long to catch up! So MJ has to switch to a different orbit in these cases before it can start the main rendezvous process.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA checkbox to prevent this sounds like a good idea though; it will let you rendezvous more efficiently if you have the patience for it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HoY","CreatedById":57294,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-03T17:18:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022The_Duck\u0022 data-cite=\u0022The_Duck\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA checkbox to prevent this sounds like a good idea though; it will let you rendezvous more efficiently if you have the patience for it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d be onboard with that \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Innuce","CreatedById":42593,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-03T18:01:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI used Rendevous Autopilot once or twice.
