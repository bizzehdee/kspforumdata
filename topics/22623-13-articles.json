To change what is on one of the smaller primary or secondary displays press one of the \u0022SDM Shift\u0022 buttons (pridisp refers to the little display marked primary and im sure you can figure out what SeDisp button refers too) then press on of the \u0022Screen display mode select\u0022 buttons.
