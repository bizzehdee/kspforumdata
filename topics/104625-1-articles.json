On the site it said that we\u0027dd get a Steam key. In tiny italic somewhere on the page it said \u0022before xxx date\u0022.\n\nIt has always bugged me that they completely refused to give Steam keys to people like me who bought the game at full price from their shop.\n\nDoes it cost them money to make a Steam key ? Do they just not care about people who requested a Steam key (I did) ?\n\nEvery time I think about it, it just leaves a bad taste in my mouth. In the end, they don\u0027t care, a sale is a sale.
