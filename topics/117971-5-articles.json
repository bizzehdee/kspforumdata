While Kerbals could get by with just a capsule for short duration missions, they would need more supplies and living space for a long duration mission.\n\nPlayers would need to be given an incentive to bring a habitat module with them on longer missions. I would suggest something similar in size and mass to the mobile science lab. There might need to be a few different shapes and sizes of habitat to suit use in stations and ground bases.\n\nAlthough the need to re-supply bases and stations could be added, I imagine that most players would get bored with doing supply runs before very long!

What I\u0027d like to see is some way to convert harvested *Ore* into *Fertilizer*, so a base or ship that\u0027s too far away from Kerbin doesn\u0027t have to depend on resupply launches to keep itself going.\n\nIn the end, we have an LS system that\u0027s not 100% closed - so I can\u0027t simply stack enough parts to make it self-sufficient from the get-go - but also allowing long-term missions at far-away locations such as Joolian moons or Eeloo a possibility to resupply themselves on the spot."},{"CreatedByName":"Joonatan1998","CreatedById":97636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-29T17:32:58Z","Content":"I think if LS uses ISRU system it should have its own resource.\n\nThe ISRU system seems really silly and unfinished because it clearly is designed for more than one resource, but in stock there is only one.
