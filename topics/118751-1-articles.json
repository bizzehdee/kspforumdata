This is a great rocket, delivering the Orion capsule with Service Module flawlessly time after time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpdate 1: Less Parts, less crew, separation of Service Module and Second stage, more range, flies better, more fun, more solar panels arranged more like Orion solar panels (not the circular ones, the four in a cross).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpdate 2: More parts, more crew, closer to scale, this has been reworked and optimised for 100km LKO, originally I went to fix a height issue because I based the SRB height on the 4 segment Shuttle SRB\u0027s not the 5 segment ones planned and used in the test launch, that led to a paint job, a video, lot\u0027s of launches, and sad to say lots of fixes. Stuff you don\u0027t really notice till you test it A LOT. It is now pretty bulletproof, even Mechjeb can fly it to orbit no issues and look good doing it. I recommend a 2 to 3 second delay between stages, especially when filming to give that NASA separation footage. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EParts: 83\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMass: 405t\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeight: 63.1m\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWidth 1: 2.5m\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWidth 2: 3.75\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOperating Instructions\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActivate SAS and RCS (verniers to turn against SRB torque), stage SRB\u0027s and ascend as normal, gravity turn at 100m/s, slowly keep pitching over until at around 70 degrees by 10km. When SRB\u0027s are exhausted stage second seperation. Follow prograde marker until 100km apoapsis is attained. Stage fairing and LAS and then circularise as normal.
