A reaction wheel can only spin so fast and as it gets faster and faster the torque output gets less and less. When the wheels reach maximum speed they are unable to provide any more torque in that direction. At that point you need to use RCS or other methods to dissipate the torque. In KSP they always provided the same amount of power and never spin up. This means you can use KSP reaction wheels for things such as holding attitude in atmosphere and to fight asymmetric thrust. If you tried to do those things IRL the wheels would quickly spin up and you would loose control. Hence any vehicle equipped with reaction wheels would also need RCS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother difference is how much mass they have. You could make IRL reaction wheels have the same power as KSP reaction wheels easily enough, but that would mean powerful motors attached to heavy flywheels. On the most efficient rockets we can expect to make with current fuels you will need at least 8 to 9 pounds of fuel for each pound you put in space. (And I am sure the number is higher than that since I don\u0027t think any rockets we have are near max efficiency for the fuel we have, perhaps someone can let us know.) Since the vehicle will need RCS anyway the reaction wheels can often be left out all together at considerable savings in mass.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StrandedonEarth","CreatedById":89439,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-12T22:29:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure how much more powerful the game RW\u0027s are, but the unrealistic thing about them is that they don\u0027t saturate.
