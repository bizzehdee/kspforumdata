This disables the surface attachment.\n\nUnfortunately it seems that with the way KSP handles the symmetry i destroyed the symmetry be rotating the part by 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0. I will reverse this in the next update to have symmetry again.

There was a bug related with KIS, when you EVAed from a part without IVA the focus stayed on the craft rather than switching to the kerbal. This problem will be gone once and for all when the last IVA finally is made.\n\nAlso a kerbal is not able to stand on a part that is animated. It can\u0027t be controlled and even falls over. It\u0027s like the kerbal got unconscious. My best guess for that is that the game mechanics prevent the kerbal from doing something so there won\u0027t be collision problems..."},{"CreatedByName":"sashan","CreatedById":98897,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-26T15:47:51Z","Content":"Oh, yes, it is a persistent bug that exists always, doesn\u0027t depend if I am controlling kerbal, not, it\u0027s always there.
