If you are serious about capturing a Class E as the base for a station around Duna, I would highly recommend meeting up with it well outside of Kerbin\u0027s SOI. Then, you can adjust it\u0027s inbound Kerbin trajectory such that it crosses around the equator (for correct inclination) and set it up for aero braking. That will save loads of dV on the capture and takes a lot less dV to adjust it\u0027s inbound Kerbin trajectory. If you get lucky enough, you might be able to find an asteroid that is set up such that you can use the Kerbin flyby to slingshot it toward Duna, and bypass setting it up in LKO all together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen capturing it around Kerbin, you can leave it in an elliptical orbit to save fuel when sending it along to Duna. However, if you\u0027re going to to that, you need to make sure the Apoapsis is pointed the right way for a trans-duna injection. Otherwise it won\u0027t help out at all and may, in fact, make it much more difficult.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for asteroid control, you can attach multiple RCS and torque control units via small helper claw ships all around the asteroid. Monopro and electricity are shared all over the ship (including through an asteroid), so that makes it a little easier to keep the part count down with all the extra helper ships (they don\u0027t all need solar panels or RTGs). Distributing RCS makes it easier to control, and adding torque units to them helps distribute the torque load and prevent all bending from going through a single claw.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep in mind, as has been noted, that the claw is quite buggy. Using multiple claws can make things worse. So save often and keep backups. If you run into a problem, don\u0027t be afraid to exit KSP completely, then transfer over a quicksave as your persistent before reloading. Once you hit a claw bug, quickloading generally doesn\u0027t make it go away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBe patient. Moving 3,000t takes a lot of patience and time.

I was thinking about this some more, and the easiest way by far must be to intercept in solar SOI and nudge toward Duna aerocapture. Remember, it costs over 1000dV to go from Kerbin SOI to Duna, and a ship the size of the Kranefly can only give a Class E about 150m/s before needing a refuel. If you pick the right asteroid it should be possible to hit Duna on one tank...IF you pick the right asteroid.

I imagine it would be far less expensive (fuel and ship wise) to push the station infrastructure to Duna and meet the asteroid there, vice capturing around Kerbin, building, then pushing that huge mass out to Duna. I might also consider trying to do the slingshot off of Kerbin, but probably wouldn\u0027t try to speed up station parts to meet it, since it\u0027s likely going faster than I care to push the station parts.

This is precisely why I posted my tutorial about intercepting well outside of Kerbin\u0027s SOI. With a small probe, you can really pour on the dV when leaving Kerbin for the intercept. Even without trying to go excessively fast, you can intercept asteroids in 1/3 to 1/4 of the time compared to waiting until they get into Kerbin\u0027s SOI. That still leaves plenty of time to dispatch a proper mission craft for the job, and know what kind of rock you\u0027ll find when you get there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~Claw\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-05T19:57:58Z\u0022 title=\u002204/05/2015 07:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Claw\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
