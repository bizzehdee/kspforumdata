In 32 Bit they work, but I have one issue which is anoying with planes on Kerbin. It always CTD at least 1 time per flight and I dare this is because of the RAM is running full. I haven\u00B4t had the issue since 1.05 until yesterday and that was because I didn\u00B4t fly a plane in 1.05 until yesterday ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022) \n\nSo I\u00B4ll give the 64Bit another try using the save file buildings = 1 thing in career. I hope to solve the CTD\u00B4s in planes with it, because this is really disturbing.\n\nThnx for the hints!\n\n**EDIT:** I started a new game on KSP64, changed the save file to \u0022all buildings fully upgraded\u0022 (as described by Nookos). For that I enabled \u0022parts entry purchase\u0022, so money hasn\u00B4t become totally worthless. I kept my mods and used the x64unfixer tool (as described in Jim Kernan\u00B4s post below). And have to say, I\u00B4m very pleased with the result yet. It\u00B4s not disturbing me, not to upgrade my HQ by myself at all since I have to pay for science parts. And the rest seems to work like in 32Bit. Can\u00B4t tell if it will fix my plane issues as Jebeddiah Kermanov just had the first rocket flight of his entire life. But I\u00B4m confident about it looking forward to try out. Even if it\u00B4s still there, as long as the 64 bit will not start to do crazy unexpected things anytime, I keep it until 1.1. Thnx comrades also in the name of our great leader  Wladimir Iljitsch Kermanov.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-30T10:16:09Z\u0022 title=\u002212/30/2015 10:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by HUG**"},{"CreatedByName":"HUG","CreatedById":149279,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-30T09:31:02Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On \u200E19\u200E.\u200E10\u200E.\u200E2015 at 2:54 PM, Jim Kernan said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Download [https://github.com/jrodrigv/KSPx64TotalUnfixer/releases](https://github.com/jrodrigv/KSPx64TotalUnfixer/releases)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I think you can place it anywhere, but I placed it inside the Kerbal Space Program directory.\n\u003E \n\nThis hidden little post is really a big deal man, thnx for that !"},{"CreatedByName":"HUG","CreatedById":149279,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-31T00:37:10Z","Content":"uhm...my camera is doing weird things when I fly through 6000m with a rocket (at least I still can\u00B4t tell anything about planes yet).

First open it, search for the lines as follows and change them to exactly as follows:\n\n  **name = ScenarioUpgradeableFacilities  scene = 5, 6, 7, 8  SpaceCenter/LaunchPad  {   lvl = 1  }  SpaceCenter/Runway  {   lvl = 1  }  SpaceCenter/VehicleAssemblyBuilding  {   lvl = 1  }  SpaceCenter/SpaceplaneHangar  {   lvl = 1  }  SpaceCenter/TrackingStation  {   lvl = 1  }  SpaceCenter/AstronautComplex  {   lvl = 1  }  SpaceCenter/MissionControl  {   lvl = 1  }  SpaceCenter/ResearchAndDevelopment  {   lvl = 1  }  SpaceCenter/Administration  {   lvl = 1  }  SpaceCenter/FlagPole  {   lvl = 0**\n\nI recomend to start a new game and go back to main menu right after you see the space center for the very first time. Then do like in description above. Now you have the space center fully upgraded from the beginning. That\u00B4s the bad news, but if you start your career by setting up entry fees for new parts, you need almost as much money as before, when this option turned off but you needed to upgrade facilities. And the bug disappears ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022) That\u00B4s the good news ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022;)\u0022)\n\nFor me this works perfect. But of course it\u00B4s just perfect if you can live with a fully upgraded space center from the beginning on.\n\ncheers\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-07T13:49:53Z\u0022 title=\u002201/07/2016 01:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 7, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by HUG**"},{"CreatedByName":"Wingnutt","CreatedById":146587,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-09T17:13:24Z","Content":"This is working PERFECT for me with MUCH better performance with many mods.\n\nexcept for one MAJOR problem.  \n\nParachutes don\u0027t work.. at all,  cannot arm or deploy them and they do not show up in the staging tree when I add them to a ship..  \n\nAside from this one issue, everything works.  \n\nEDIT:  I have tried it with both realchutes and stock, same result, neither works."},{"CreatedByName":"Wingnutt","CreatedById":146587,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-10T15:03:17Z","Content":"Problem SOLVED!  \n\nIt was FAR causing it, removed it and now Realchutes and regular work fine.  \n\nCant get EVE to work yet though, still messing with it.  \n\nAside from that the game plays --PERFECT--  zero crashes, much higher FPS,  for the first time I can run Real Solar with the highest res textures with no crash, and on top of that I maxxed out all the game settings and its still smooth as glass, it would be a slide show followed by a crash in 32bit\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-10T15:03:41Z\u0022 title=\u002201/10/2016 03:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 10, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Wingnutt**"},{"CreatedByName":"Arugnot","CreatedById":156835,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-11T04:13:50Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 12/26/2015 at 10:47 AM, dresoccer4 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E hi all. i\u0027m trying to run the new Renaissance compilation which is the largest memory hog since Ol\u0027 Bessy the Memory Hog. i did what the OP said and copied the two new files into my KSP directory, but when i go to run, it says\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u0022There should be \u0027KSP\\_Data\u0027 folder next to the executable\u0022\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Of course, the KSP\\_Data folder is just fine and chillin\u0027 in the same spot since 1989.
