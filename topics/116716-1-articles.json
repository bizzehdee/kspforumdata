Sadly this came with a couple of issues. \n\n1. I\u0027m pretty sure my copy of Windows 8.1 is genuine as I got it through [DreamSpark](http://www.dreamspark.com). The thing is, even though I was able to activate the CD-Key I got I don\u0027t get the \u0022Windows Genuine\u0022 logo on the \u0022system\u0022 window. On the other hand I don\u0027t get any of the pirated version errors or messages so I\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s genuine or not.\n\n![MKOyOEc.jpg?!](http://i.imgur.com/MKOyOEc.jpg?!)\n\n2. I tried to install all the available updates (\u003E100) but after a long while (after they seemed to install just fine) I went to check them and about half say they are installed with errors (I\u0027m not 100% sure this would be the proper translation as my windows is Portuguese). Windows tried to install all these updates twice but now they remain with these error messages and windows says all the updates are installed... \n\nHere\u0027s an image of the update list with these \u0022Com Falhas\u0022 (with errors?) messages: [https://](http://i.imgur.com/Wvmv5EX.jpg)[i.imgur.com/Wvmv5EX.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Wvmv5EX.jpg)\n\nHere Windows is telling me there are no new updates: [http://](http://i.imgur.com/vbGVxZ3.jpg)[i.imgur.com/vbGVxZ3.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/vbGVxZ3.jpg)\n\n3. I have no icon inviting me to upgrade to windows 10 even though (a) my computer complies with all system requirements and (![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) update KB3035583 seems to be installed correctly (this one doesn\u0027t have the error I mentioned previously). \n\nI haven\u0027t used my windows live account in ages so I didn\u0027t remember my password and now have to wait 30 days for the reset. I made local accounts for both Windows 8 and Office until I can fix this but I don\u0027t think this relates to these issues. \n\nHere\u0027s the current build that\u0027s having these issues:\n\nCPU: Intel Core 2 Quad 2.4Ghz Q6600 (used)\n\nRAM: 8GB DDR2-800 (2 new modules and 2 used modules)\n\nGPU: Nvidia GeForce GTS 450 1Gb (used)\n\nBoard: Gigabyte GA-P35C-DS3R (used)\n\nSSD: Kingston SSDNow300 120GB (new) \u003C- Windows is installed here\n\nHDD: Some random 350GB Hard Drive (used) \n\nI ran a couple of stress tests including burnin test and everything seems to be just fine. I\u0027ve also tried MS Windows Update fix tool. That found a couple of errors at first. The tool fixed them but the updates continue to not install... \n\nI\u0027d love if someone could help me out with this as it\u0027s killing the \u0022new pc\u0022 joy... \n\nPS: Everything else works flawlessly. I have no errors in no program. Games run smoothly. Steam downloads at an average of 15MB/s (which is great) the computer boots in 20secs (this board doesn\u0027t have an UEFI BIOS) and even though the board only supports SATA2 the SSD has respectable speeds (much better then a mechanical drive). It\u0027s only the updates that are stuck!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-24T10:48:41Z\u0022 title=\u002207/24/2015 10:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Broax**"}]}
