The problem is that 0.17 will not launch, the icon just bounces in the dock and then disappears when I click on it. I installed MonoFramework-MRE-2.10.9_11.macos10.xamarin.x86. I have also tried to launch 0.16, but it exhibits the same behavior. I didn\u0027t have to go through any special steps when I purchased and installed 0.16 so I am confused as to why a celan install of 0.17 does not work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone have any suggestions? I searched the forums and google, but so far have come up empty (but it\u0027s possible I missed something). Thanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
