The only image he could make out was a pitch black room. He reached out for a lightswitch, and when he finally did turn on the lights, he could make out that he wasn\u0027t on Kerbin. He was on a ship, or a station, from the looks of it. He looked at a window, which appeared to be cracked a bit. He saw the sun, but not Kerbin. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E He walked around, trying to find a explanation for the situation. There were two doors around him, one was locked however. He walked over to the unlocked door,and opened it. Inside the room, he could see a computer, a journal, and what looks to be a picture. He looked at the picture, and it was of Gilly. He smiled. The last time he went to Gilly was 20 years ago. He walked to the journal, and read it. He could make out a drawing of some sort of landing capsule, with a drill. The capsule was as wide as a Rockomax Jumbo-64 fuel tank. He could tell. The capsule had some sort of drill, and he suspected it was a mining vessel. He walked to the computer, and saw it contained files. He read the first file. \u0022It is done! The scientists were right. We never anticipated such a success. When the drilling vessel arrives on Gilly, then we will order the KPS-1,to collect the samples.\u0022 Jebediah clicked the next one, and saw a picture of a huge vessel, bigger then any ship that the Kerbals have built before. He was shocked. This wasn\u0027t released to the public. He read the next one. \u0022The KPS-1, or Kerbal Pusher Ship, is designed to carry a prototype nuclear pulse drive. It will carry four, and will be able to go to the Moon in less then a day, probably! We are excited. It also has a artificial intelligence, a computer, to control it. This is our best chance.\u0022 Jebediah smiled, and closed out. He saw a nearby keycard. He grabbed it, and left the room.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Jebediah went to the next door, unlocking it using the keycard, and went inside. He saw two other computers, and turned on one of them. He saw three files. He opened the first one. \u0022The KPS-1 officially launched today. No one knew, but it launched at the second launching center. We know that people will know sooner or later, but hopefully they wont.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJebediah sighed. He read the next file. \u0022We have just worked on a project. It will be a large ship, designed to carry people to a destination. It will have ten prototype nuclear pulse engines. This is exciting. It will be equipped with the same AI as the KPS-1. They will be connected, so Gilly can hopefully be colonized later this year.\u0022 Jebediah read the last one. \u0022Something terribly wrong is going on, we dont know what happened. The KPS-1 crashed into Gilly. We have to halt the colonization mission.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Jebediah was shocked. What could this mean for him? Why is he on this ship? He walked to the next computer. He saw two files. He read the first one. \u0022Gilly is coming towards Kerbin. We can\u0060t stop it. It is going faster then we anticipated. The project.. the ship with the AI.. we learned that the AI is the reason. It is trying to destroy us all. We cannot remove it, we can only hope that it wont stop the project. The project.. the colonization ship.. it will be sent out of the system.\u0022 Jebediah suddenly became pale. He looked at the final file. \u0022We picked our last men. They are in a deep sleep. For now. If they are woken up, it is the AI. If anyone is reading this.. send a signal. Send a signal to the stars, and hope..hope someone helps you.\u0022 Jebediah looked at the final door. He walked to it, and looked out the window. He saw Kerbin. It was like a great desert. The oceans, gone. Jebediah also saw a computer, no files on it, but some kind of communications system. He sent one signal. A signal to the stars.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rhyunix","CreatedById":59383,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-27T18:29:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood story dude!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wrestlingforme","CreatedById":27362,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-27T18:33:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks.
