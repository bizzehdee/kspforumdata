Interstellar ships are indicated to be on a scale far beyond anything we could make now.

I can\u0027t answer that one).

To the point where it can be the main reason for abysmal performance of ships with very high part count. I haven\u0027t heard anything, but we\u0027re hoping Intercept fixed that in KSP2.\u0022\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd presumably there will be other things that they are doing differently/more optimally as well, so it seems the likely ceiling for size and complexity we can go to before running into that level of lag will be drastically higher. Of course, this is KSP, and no matter how much higher the limit is, it will be immediately pushed to. If the limit ended up exponentially higher, that just means\u00A0someone will try and build a megastructure or something (awesome, if it could be done (still probably not)).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
