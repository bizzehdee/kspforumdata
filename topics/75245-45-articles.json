So ignoring line of sight for a min, if you had A and B in perfect orbit parrellel to each other one on one side of the planet and one on the exact opposite side both in a 100km orbit, that would be 200km away from each other. Now of course line of sight means that this wouldn\u0027t work anyway, and I am HORRIBLE at maths so I can\u0027t tell you how to calculate the distance between two ships, but I think you can see it if you target one from the other??\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-24T21:16:39Z\u0022 title=\u002209/24/2014 09:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 24, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by rottielover\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MaxShadow","CreatedById":120868,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-25T02:04:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDamn you\u0027re right, it\u0027s always the same thing \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;.;\u0022\u003E Kerbin\u0027s satellites are pointing towards the active vessel.
