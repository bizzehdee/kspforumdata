Consider that Duna is higher than Kerbin in it\u0027s orbit, and therefore you will be accelerating the whole way. I also don\u0027t see any heat shielded pods on that ship, so aerobraking would be dangerous. \n\nAdmittedly, I don\u0027t even aerobrake coming back from the Mun or Minmus unless I absolutely have to, so I\u0027m not much of an expert on that. I can\u0027t imagine it\u0027d be safe to smack into the atmosphere coming back from another planet, but this *is* KSP.\n\nAlternatively you could take the science from the lander and store it and your kerbals in the hitchhiker container (I think you can do that... maybe..?), ditch the lander, and if that provides enough of a boost to get back and capture into orbit around Kerbin, send up another vehicle to recover the crew and science. This is, of course, assuming there is space in that container."},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T14:50:22Z","Content":"...So you\u0027re actually orbiting Duna retrograde? i.e. westwards, opposite the direction of Duna\u0027s spin, Ike\u0027s orbit, and Duna\u0027s orbit around the sun? Ew, that makes life harder. Just out of curiosity, how did that happen? Anyway, water under the bridge at this point.\n\nI assume that the big red arrow that you\u0027ve drawn from Duna indicates its orbital direction around the sun?\n\nYou want your ejection from the Duna/Ike system to be opposite Duna\u0027s orbital direction, in order to lower your solar periapsis down to Kerbin\u0027s orbit. The fact that you\u0027re orbiting opposite Ike\u0027s direction makes an Ike gravity assist considerably less effective. Offhand I\u0027d say that if you do any Ike assist, you\u0027d want option B, since that gives you the maximal boost opposite Duna\u0027s orbital direction.\n\nHowever, it\u0027s not at all clear to me that you get that much of a benefit (or indeed any benefit at all)-- it would mean giving up a fair amount of Oberth-effect benefit from Duna\u0027s gravity well, which is deeper than Ike\u0027s.\n\nSome more options to consider:\n\nPersonally, I like the idea of ditching the command pod and sending them home in the hitchhiker module. Yes, it means no orbital corrections between Duna and Kerbin. However, a well-executed burn from Duna should have no problem taking you close in to Kerbin where you will have control again (especially if you don\u0027t play around with Ike).\n\nYou could also consider a hybrid approach between \u0022send them home in the hitchhiker\u0022 and \u0022send a rescue mission\u0022: that is, send them home in the hitchhiker with the best burn you can manage from Duna, then launch a \u0022rescue\u0022 mission that intercepts them before they get to Kerbin. The rescue mission wouldn\u0027t even have to match velocity or dock-- it could whizz past at kilometers per second at a distance of a few thousand km, and simply serve as a RemoteTech relay that would give you control over the ship long enough to do a correction burn. It could be small, cheap, unmanned, and (because really light) have a lot of dV.\n\nIn the it\u0027s-so-crazy-it-just-might-work department: You could send them home on EVA. A kerbal\u0027s EVA pack has a ridiculously overpowered dV of several hundred m/s. Launch them in the ship, then when you run out of rocket fuel, they go EVA and complete the boost. Yes, it would be a hassle (you\u0027d have to do it separately for each kerbal, and you won\u0027t have navball or maneuver nodes)... but they\u0027d live forever in legend and song!"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T15:23:51Z","Content":"Skirting Kerbin atmosphere at 52km won\u0027t kill you and while it may not be enough for aerocapture, it should make enough of difference to allow capture within Kerbin\u0027s SOI when braking at periapsis with whatever fuel you have left. Just make sure to make as good Kerbin encounter as you can before losing contact, so that you could cheaply correct for the right periapsis once you restore control. And once captured with atmospheric periapsis, landing is just a matter of time.\n\n(...or maybe send out a relay probe to provide relay for your guys somewhere 2 weeks from Kerbin, so that you could perform the correction then.)\n\n\u0022A\u0022 path is the correct accelerating path.\n\nAlso, before ditching the lander, use up the rest of monoprop for a few more km/s before the proper escape burn. And plan four nodes: 1. Escape Duna, get Ike flyby. That should take most of your delta-V; Oberth effect at Duna low orbit will be much stronger than at Ike flyby. 2. Get a perfect encounter with Ike, 3. get the right escape from Ike (at periapsis) 4. once out of Ike SOI perfect your Kerbin encounter.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-14T15:30:01Z\u0022 title=\u002207/14/2015 03:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sharpy**"},{"CreatedByName":"mhoram","CreatedById":78756,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T15:33:08Z","Content":"From how I understand gravity assists, it is the following:\n\n- Using a type \u0022A\u0022 gravity assist typically increases your orbital energy when you travel prograde\n\n- Using a type \u0022B\u0022 gravity assist typically lowers your orbital energy when you travel prograde\n\nSince you travel retrograde, it becomes difficult to say, if A or B are better. Try plotting nodes and see which one boosts your orbit more.\n\nThe biggest problem I see is timing.\n\nUsing [http://ksp.olex.biz/](http://ksp.olex.biz/) you can get an estimation where Ike should be while you are within it\u0027s SOI (ejection angle ~ 96\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0)\n\nSince you travel retrograde this can not be applied!\n\nThen you time your low-Duna-Burn so that you reach Ike while it is at the stated angle - and try to plan the burn so that after the SOI transitions Duna-\u003EIke-\u003EDuna-\u003EKerbol you reach Kerbin.\n\nThe amount of dV for the low-Duna-burn you have to find by experimenting with the maneuver node.\n\nOptinally a correction-burn at Periapsis while within Ike\u0027s SOI might be necessary.\n\nDepending on the orbit after leaving Ike\u0027s SOI, it might be necessary to adjust the location where you meet Ike on it\u0027s orbit: your periapsis (around Duna) should be at the ejection angle and it\u0027s altitude should match the parking orbit altitude.\n\nNever tried such a maneuver before however - seems like a lot of detail-work is needed to make this work.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-14T16:04:50Z\u0022 title=\u002207/14/2015 04:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by mhoram**\n  \ncorrected statement"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T16:01:06Z","Content":"...wait.

Most of the time you end up with orbits that makes your ship crash on Duna or put you into an even more inclined orbit.\n\nYup, at least the guys in my Eve craft have more than plenty of delta v to go home or even visit/flyby its moon.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E What\u0027s your dV if you toss that lander and leave it in orbit?\n\u003E What\u0027s the dV of the lander if you put all the fuel in it and leave the \u0022transfer stage\u0022 behind?\n\u003E \n\u003E You have 3 guys and seating for 8, toss away some of that extra space and you may have the dV you need.\n\n1) It will be 818 m/s delta v if getting rid of the lander but zero correction-control in Sun SOI (I use Remote Tech mod).\n\n2) Almost zero delta v of the lander because I drained entire oxidizers in the stock transfer tank with nuke. I used up almost whole fuel of lander in the trip of landing and launching.\n\nVery few options, indeed.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E If you do option 2, you can get a super accurate encounter using alexmoons transfer calculator and precise node. when you click on the i next to the delta-v in the calculator, it will give you values you can plug in to precise node and only require very minimal tweaking to get an encounter with kerbin. It is how I do all my encounters.\n\nGood idea. I am going to take a look at it later.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nUm, I just thought of another option, based on your comments. How about this: escape-burn with whole craft directly and dump the transfer stage in mid-course. Then use the monoprop to do corrections into Kerbin\u0027s SOI. Once my guys enter the SOI as if they are an asteroid, I launch a rescue vehicle and get them before they escape the Kerbin SOI.\n\nOr I just get the guys off (with science of course) the asteroid and brake them with their eva monoprop into orbit of Kerbin. Then I rescue them later like those free-person contract.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-15T02:19:55Z\u0022 title=\u002207/15/2015 02:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TaxiService**\n  \nGrammar"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-15T04:24:19Z","Content":"BTW, Kerbin aerocapture/aerobraking correction: 50km shouldn\u0027t hurt you. 55km won\u0027t touch you.\n\nYesterday I whizzed by Kerbin at some 3500m/s through 55km.
