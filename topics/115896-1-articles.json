The fact that you\u0027re orbiting opposite Ike\u0027s direction makes an Ike gravity assist considerably less effective. Offhand I\u0027d say that if you do any Ike assist, you\u0027d want option B, since that gives you the maximal boost opposite Duna\u0027s orbital direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, it\u0027s not at all clear to me that you get that much of a benefit (or indeed any benefit at all)-- it would mean giving up a fair amount of Oberth-effect benefit from Duna\u0027s gravity well, which is deeper than Ike\u0027s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome more options to consider:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I like the idea of ditching the command pod and sending them home in the hitchhiker module. Yes, it means no orbital corrections between Duna and Kerbin. However, a well-executed burn from Duna should have no problem taking you close in to Kerbin where you will have control again (especially if you don\u0027t play around with Ike).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could also consider a hybrid approach between \u0022send them home in the hitchhiker\u0022 and \u0022send a rescue mission\u0022: that is, send them home in the hitchhiker with the best burn you can manage from Duna, then launch a \u0022rescue\u0022 mission that intercepts them before they get to Kerbin. The rescue mission wouldn\u0027t even have to match velocity or dock-- it could whizz past at kilometers per second at a distance of a few thousand km, and simply serve as a RemoteTech relay that would give you control over the ship long enough to do a correction burn. It could be small, cheap, unmanned, and (because really light) have a lot of dV.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the it\u0027s-so-crazy-it-just-might-work department: You could send them home on EVA. A kerbal\u0027s EVA pack has a ridiculously overpowered dV of several hundred m/s. Launch them in the ship, then when you run out of rocket fuel, they go EVA and complete the boost. Yes, it would be a hassle (you\u0027d have to do it separately for each kerbal, and you won\u0027t have navball or maneuver nodes)... but they\u0027d live forever in legend and song!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T15:23:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESkirting Kerbin atmosphere at 52km won\u0027t kill you and while it may not be enough for aerocapture, it should make enough of difference to allow capture within Kerbin\u0027s SOI when braking at periapsis with whatever fuel you have left. Just make sure to make as good Kerbin encounter as you can before losing contact, so that you could cheaply correct for the right periapsis once you restore control. And once captured with atmospheric periapsis, landing is just a matter of time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(...or maybe send out a relay probe to provide relay for your guys somewhere 2 weeks from Kerbin, so that you could perform the correction then.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022A\u0022 path is the correct accelerating path.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, before ditching the lander, use up the rest of monoprop for a few more km/s before the proper escape burn.

I\u0027d move the radar dish from the transfer stage, then cruise home with the 800 dV option.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe dish? There is only the short-range antenna on the transfer stage and I have almost zero oxidizers left. But see below for the feasible solution.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI will admit I totally missed the use of RemoteTech and lack of oxidizer (and I\u0027ve not used LV-Ns enough in 1.0.x to remember offhand that they no longer use oxidizer). However, if you have the dV to get home doesn\u0027t RemoteTech have a \u0022Do this maneuver node when it comes, even though you won\u0027t be in communication range at the time\u0022 function?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBrilliant! I totally forgot about the RT queue of timed tasks. I think my delta-v problem will be solved, with dumping the lander and letting RT running the whole burning business.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ERemember, you can always perform the Scott-Manley-Maneuver :-D That should help.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood find!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
