On a current design of a rocket I have, some of the struts that overheat and break about 30 secs into that stage and upon doing this, my computer instantly shuts down\u00A0and black screens like the power have been cut off. I have successfully used this design where the struts overheat and break without issue but now it crashes ever time without failure.\u00A0I have been testing with many other more demanding games and even tried overclocking gpu and cpu to replicate the results on any other game - no success. Performance of my computer isn\u0027t an issue, running 3 screens at 1920x1080 @ 60hz, with my gpu and cpu only being used 60% to do so. Using Gtx 970, Intel i5 4570, 16GB ram @ default clock speeds\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny ideas? open to trying things to fix this and all help is appreciated\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"diomedea","CreatedById":93700,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-15T14:09:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMhh, have half an idea your issue could be related to thermal part highlighting, as part highlighting is a feature giving issues in recent KSP versions, though never to the point of causing a shut down. You may try if that\u0027s true by choosing to not have thermal highlighting (pause menu, settings, gameplay section). Try also to not have thermal debug colors enabled (F11), or via the console (Mod-F12) in Thermal panel. Can\u0027t think there are issues with your hardware given the performance data you gave. If nothing helps of the above, mind uploading your vessel to allow others to check?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-15T16:29:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/171566-box/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022171566\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/171566-box/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@BOX\u003C/a\u003E, we\u0027re going to need more info on this one, KSP should not even be able to crash your mashing like this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease see this thread.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/83213-stock-support-bug-reporting-guide/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe\u0027ll need the logs from after this occurs, your dxdiag (assuming Windows) and the craft that causes the issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BOX","CreatedById":171566,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-17T22:13:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:rgb(39,42,52);font-family:\u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;letter-spacing:normal;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);float:none;\u0022\u003E\u0022You may try if that\u0027s true by choosing to not have thermal highlighting (pause menu, settings, gameplay section).
