It will stay in space. I have a LKO space station right now, and contracts to build one in mun orbit and minmus orbit. Thus tug will need to be able to haul those out to the moon and back to refuel at the space station. It will also be used to move landers and such around. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone have any designs they\u0027d like to share? I have recently unlocked the atomic engine...but while it does have a higher ISP than any of the chemical engines, but much lower TWR...so I have to use more of them...plus one atomic engine weighs a grip more than one poodle....but you save weight on oxidizer....but youre also going to need to add thermal control....so the question is what\u0027s best practically for my goals, and also a question about how best to use the atomic engines.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-07T21:06:42Z\u0022 title=\u002210/07/2015 09:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by EliasDanger\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Slam_Jones","CreatedById":125101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-07T20:48:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re staying out of the atmosphere, LV-N\u0027s are the best way to go.
