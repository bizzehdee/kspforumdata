The boosters were piloted into dock by little probes on top that were jettisoned and deorbited to reduce part count a little.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom the top is the Gilly lander, two Kethane scanner satellites and Kethane drilling rover assembly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext is the Kethane converting rover, equipped with two KAS winches and connectors to hook up the drilling rover and the manned lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThird in the stack is the manned lander, carrying two Kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFourth is the upper stage of the ship\u0027s core.

It has a combination decoupler and clampotron so the 2 man lander can can dock for the return trip. The design gives some redundancy in case of problems. The fuel in the upper stage could be moved to the lower, then the upper jettisoned and the can docked to the lower - just in case the upper stage engines might not be enough to slow down at Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOperation notes (assuming it doesn\u0027t fold, spindle or mutilate under thrust).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a tanker in a 100KM orbit to top off the fuel and mono before leaving Kerbin. (There\u0027s also a Kethane scanning satellite and a couple of OKTO2\u0027s playing landing beacon on Eve so you may want to kill those and reset the Kethane scan data by editing the file.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe four mainsail boosters should get the ship on its way, staging them should ignite the four core engines. (I had to move the booster engines and their middle decouplers in the staging after docking, and deactivate the core engines.) If they run out of push, stage and continue with the core engines. Probably will want to use TAC fuel balancer or that other pump mod to drain the upper side booster tanks, and to pump out of the mono tanks that\u0027ll drop with the booster engines. Action group 5 toggles the boosters\u0027 quantum struts, but undocking cuts them loose automatically. (If it comes apart, try the Eve Transfer Burn with unbreakable joints turned on. I thought about mounting some quantum struts to connect the sidesaddle boosters to each other...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpon arrival at Eve, get into an orbit high enough so one satellite and the Gilly lander can make it to Gilly. Decouple them and activate their engines manually.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMove to a 100KM orbit around Eve. Deploy the second satellite and scan for a Kethane deposit close to the equator. Altitude of the landing site doesn\u0027t matter due to the Hooligan Labs gas bags on the lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUndock the two rovers, either together or one at a time. Land the converting rover first. It carries a pair of OKTO2 for landing beacons. Make sure to land with gear down to save the wheels from damage. Since this is a Product Testing simulation, staging wasn\u0027t altered on the engine and tank jettison so you\u0027ll have to rearrange to keep the two tanks with the OKTO2 beacons until after driving to a suitably level site for the manned lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe landers\u0027 docking ports are on decouplers so they can be jettisoned. Pop them off after the initial deorbit burn so they\u0027ll go down and you won\u0027t have to delete them later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith both rovers, dump all fuel and jettison the engines and tanks before raising the landing legs. Wheel damage and parts like the KAS winches falling off may happen if you don\u0027t. Also, never raise or lower the landing legs or move the rovers with the solar panels deployed. Under Eve gravity they tend to break. Please note that the rovers have no parachutes. They were tried but for some reason caused extreme instability during the final descent burn and caused MechJeb to do (very) hard landings, breaking landing legs - leaving them stuck extended, breaking wheels and other parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter getting rid of the tanks and engines (except the two with the beacons), find a level-ish place or two, decouple nodes on the OKTO2\u0027s then jettison the remaining two tanks and engines and drive to a safe distance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELand the drilling rover, dump fuel, jettison and drive to a safe distance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo prepare the manned lander. Transfer the fuel from the six upper outer tanks and the upper center tank into empty space in the core tanks. The lander can make it down fully fueled but there\u0027s no need. It was able to land in a test to nearly sea level with about 48% total load.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESet fuel and oxidizer to balance all then land. MechJeb can take it down just fine, completely hands off. Once landed, extend the ladder and go EVA. The first thing to do is repack the two radial chutes on the can. Don\u0027t have to move off the ladder to do so. Now climb down the ladder to the KAS winch and grab the cable. Let go of the ladder and immediately press I to stop the Kerbal from smacking into the ground and going *poof*. Lower gently with K then let go of the cable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlant a flag. (Some hydrangeas and a shrubbery would also liven up the color scheme of Eve.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDrive the rovers near the lander, pick the connectors off the converting rover, mount to the drilling rover and the lander (I stuck one on one of the large drills) and connect up with cables from the two winches. Use Docked mode. Time to drill and fill!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce the lander is refueled, disconnect the KAS cable and return the connector to the rover (just in case you ever come back and don\u0027t want to bring another refueling system). Use the winch to get back up to the ladder. Let go of the cable and fully retract it. Board the can and retract the ladder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStage to jettison the parachutes. (Could also do that immediately after landing, but you want to make sure the rovers won\u0027t get hit!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHit 1 (I do believe it\u0027s 1) to inflate the gas bags and liftoff. Once up to around 1500 meters, stage to jettison the landing legs. Float on up to 20KM before activating Ascent Guidance in MechJeb. (IIRC I used a 60% shape and left the rest automatic, with a 100 KM altitude.) You don\u0027t want to drop below 100 m/sec upward velocity before lighting the engines. Make sure fuel balancer is OFF on all tanks!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt around 24KM, stage to jettison the gas bags then sit back and watch lots of pieces fall off the lander as it rises. If all goes well, what makes it to orbit should have enough fuel to rendezvous with the ship core.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGetting out to Gilly and using the little lander to refuel for the trip back to Kerbin... hasn\u0027t been simulated, except for showing that the satellites and Gilly lander can\u0027t get there from a 100KM Eve orbit. The Gilly lander has been tested for landing on and lifting off Gilly. Should be able to make a few trips per refueling itself. The low gravity and annoyingly high (10KM) 1x warp altitude limit make landings very slow, but liftoffs to orbit are very quick.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t go any farther with this parts monster so I don\u0027t know for certain if it will all hang together and what additional changes might be needed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Camaron","CreatedById":100218,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-10T19:44:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s very sad to build something incredible with too many parts.

Also waiting on DDR3 RAM. Current board is an AM2\u002B with a chipset just one revision too old to unlock extra cores.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuantum struts cause no problems unless mounted on or aimed at tiny, low mass parts like the octagonal struts or cubic octagonal struts, and only when turned on. Aim one quantum strut at one cubic octagonal strut and it makes a low power use way to rigidly lock the rotation of the ship, add to an action group for easy toggling of rotation lock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe strut guns have another issue, when installed across a pair of docking ports assembled in VAB or SPH, they won\u0027t disconnect with a node decouple. They pull the ports back together to dock. Undock and then the strut guns will turn off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 3 in 1 and 2 in 1 docking ports usually have to be commanded to undock 3 or 2 times when docked to another 3 in 1 or 2 in 1 port. I\u0027d like to know how to modify the cfg files so they have one undock button to release all at once. (Not my custom CFGs, found them on the forum.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe RockoOKTOClampo is my own custom part cfg, made because I wanted a way to be able to dock to the front of a transfer vehicle after decoupling from it. After adding the clampotron to the Rockomax decoupler, I figured it would also be good to add bare bones command and control functions so I added those parts from the OKTO2. I\u0027ve been using that almost exclusively in place of the standard decoupler because it adds no extra weight or parts. Makes it easy to send up small deorbitizers to dock with and bring down boosters left in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I suspect was the reason the 3 in 1 docking port came off the top of the can in the first test was a lack of breaking force and breaking torque in the cfg file. The module manager patch will fix that, plus the additional quantum struts. In that test, aside from that one break at the end of the burn it was very solid.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy rovers? Because I couldn\u0027t get anything put together in one lander that could make it down to Eve and get back to orbit. Putting mining, conversion and the manned capsule all in one would have required a much larger and heavier lander than the two rovers and one lander. To do it all in one would start with a craft as big as the manned lander, then pile on the mining and converting equipment, then add even more engines and parachutes... As it is, all that will make it back to Eve orbit is the can and minimal propulsion to rendezvous and dock with the transfer craft. The rest will stay on Eve forever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis way I can drop one rover, move it to a flat-ish area and mark it, then move away a safe distance to bring down the other rover, move it then bring down the lander and move the rovers back for refueling. Using just landers might miss the Kethane or land too far from each other or they could hit one another, depending on how accurate MechJeb decides to be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELess chance of having to repeat parts of the mission when only the manned lander\u0027s landing spot is critical.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt can handle a bit of slope, but if the hatch side is downhill, reboarding the Kerbal can be a problem. In one test I had to move fuel around, lock the downhill legs\u0027 suspension, raise some uphill legs and even dump some fuel to get the winch cable to swing close enough so the ladder could be grabbed. Whew! Kerbal saved! But ohcrap, in a \u0022real\u0022 mission that wouldn\u0027t work because he has to be on the ground to manage the fueling connections and fully fueled it wouldn\u0027t have been possible to tilt the lander enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s when I though of adding the droppable OKTO2\u0027s for beacons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo anyway, if you have a computer with the power to handle a large ship, give this a try.
