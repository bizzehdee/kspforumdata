But doesn\u0027t it just form a new thin layer of atmosphere made of helium like oil on water? I don\u0027t understand why some people suggest helium rigs up in gas giant\u0027s upper atmosphere. When you pour oil into water, the oil doesn\u0027t get flung away, so why would helium?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-01T23:44:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWe don\u0027t get helium from the atmosphere, we get it from reserves trapped along with natural gas deposits, and most of the helium-rich ones are nearly tapped out.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MGUARN","CreatedById":60866,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-02T00:47:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHelium is so light that it basically leaves the atmosphere.Shortest term ...

Solar winds help this because if the gasses are at high altitudes (barely held) but there is insufficient magnetic field to deflect solar winds, then they will get blown off through particle interactions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is suggested as one of the reasons for the stripping of the martian atmosphere. It is fairly clear it was much thicker in the past, and it is believed that one cause for the thinning was internal cooling of the core weakening the planetary magnetic field and causing irregularities. Solar wind would be able to penetrate to lower altitudes, and impart enough energy to gasses to cause them to escape. This sensibly would leave heavier gasses such as carbon dioxide, the current main component of the martian atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbface","CreatedById":58573,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-02T03:10:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThink of it less like oil on water and more like water on skin or something. It evaporates over time, because firstly the higher energy molecules simply fly out, and secondly the wind makes it much easier to blow away.
