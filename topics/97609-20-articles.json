It\u0027s pretty much as bad as kickstarter: Projects are being portrayed, as if this were crowdfunding when in fact, all the failures should by now have taught even those who do not read terms, that it is plain DONATION, rather than funding. Actual funding and investment, put obligations on both parties, and there are rules about transparency.

What you\u0027re on about is people purchasing KSP 1.0 and finding it unsatisfactory - nobody knows what it\u0027ll be like, how many bugs will be present whatever and until they do, they have no right to expect a refund for buying 1.0 because no-one has done that yet - it\u0027s literally impossible to buy KSP 1.0 so expecting a refund from it doesn\u0027t make sense. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re conflating buying an EA game and expecting a refund off of it and buying a full release game and it being too buggy to cope.

When 1.0 drops and people buy it and aren\u0027t satisfied and want a refund, that\u0027s Squads fault for shipping a buggy or whatever release (and for not listening when we say have at least 1 update before then).
