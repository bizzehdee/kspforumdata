Different people define \u0022game\u0022 and \u0022simulator\u0022 differently. I know there have been plenty of pure simulators that have been pushed as games (X-Plane, MS FSX, etc.). But here\u0027s the thing about those: they are advertised as sims first, games next. People know what they\u0027re getting into (in most cases). KSP tends to be advertised as a game first, sim second. In my personal opinion, with KSP in its current state, that\u0027s incorrect.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOkay, sure, there is\u00A0SOME semblance of actual gameplay mechanics outside the required simulation play. However, tell me those gameplay mechanics aren\u0027t half-assed and feel more like after thoughts. I\u0027ve seen plenty of users here on the forum continuously suggestion gameplay changes; there\u0027s good reason for that. (Whether any ideas said users recommend is another argument entirely.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven now with the new features that have been announced, all we\u0027re really getting are tools to facilitate any gameplay mechanics. I\u0027ve yet to see gameplay mechanics beyond the contract system, fund management, and Science/Tech progression. (And you know my opinion on those aspect from my previous paragraph.) There\u0027s no talk about how KSP ITSELF will take advantage of those features as gameplay mechanics. Once again, it\u0027s up to the players and modders to come up with their own \u0022gameplay\u0022 system. That\u0027s fine for something like Sandbox mode, but Career mode is severely lacking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGoing back to those simulators, even THOSE give you something to do, even if it\u0027s just taking off and landing at another airport. There\u0027s an in-built challenge to those sims that can pass a actual gameplay. Trying to land a Boeing 747 in a valley airport. Maybe flying through a storm without veering off-course or losing control. Night-time, instrument-only landing. There\u0027s inherent challenge in those. KSP has none of that (well, very little, I should say). Most of the challenges in KSP are player-induced, especially after you get proficient in the process of chucking large masses into orbit in a (mostly)\u00A0controlled manner. And that can get old quickly. (Not really related, but it seems like Matt Lowne on YouTube is kinda running out of ideas on his own. Well, that\u0027s what it feels like to me, and it\u0027s just one example anyway.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe devs are still working on KSP. For that I am thankful and therefore am willing to be patient. We all know KSP\u0027s state is... non-optimal, to be polite.
