Sometimes it happens straight from the Space Centre when I load up a save. Clicking on any of the buildings does nothing, clicking on the exit button brings up the menu, but then clicking on any of the buttons in the menu just does nothing. I can still move the camera around, but clicking on things just doesn\u0027t work.\n\nOccasionally it happens when I\u0027m piloting a spacecraft. After an hour our so, I\u0027ll notice that I can\u0027t switch spacecraft. I still have full control of the current spacecraft, but clicking on other ships on the map view doesn\u0027t do anything, doesn\u0027t do anything. And once again, all of the buttons on the menu just don\u0027t do anything. Even if I crash the spacecraft, the buttons to return to the space centre just don\u0027t work for some reason, and the only cure is to quit the game using OS keyboard commands.\n\nI\u0027m sorry I can\u0027t give more information on exactly *when* these weird crashes occur, because there isn\u0027t just one particular scenario that causes it, it seems completely random when it will strike!"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-06T19:53:09Z","Content":"Don\u0027t take my word for it because I possibly don\u0027t know what I am saying, but I noticed sometimes the game experience \u0022soft crashes\u0022 - I experience the same symptoms and noticed they tend to happen after a while playing and the memory goes off the roof, but not enough for a hard crash to desktop and generate an error.
