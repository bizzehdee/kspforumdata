Ive installed a clean version of KSP to play with RO and RS. The problem Im having is during launch of any rocket, big or small, i get a stutter ever second or so.. This isnt like the lag that you normally get with larger rockets, its more like a clockwork stutter every second, maybe more like a physics issue?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did some trouble shooting and i think ive routed the problem to RealPlume, when i remove this part of RO the effect has gone. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIve never had performance issues before, even with my heavily modded main version of the game..
