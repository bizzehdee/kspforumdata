The cargoes will be lifted into space by a direct-flow shuttle, the construction of which I don\u0027t really understand.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI know that flying colonies are not in priority until maybe 1.0 release, but it is very interesting and extraordinary way to use gas giants, as Jool and others in different star systems\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
