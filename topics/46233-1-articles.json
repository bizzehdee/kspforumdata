I launched a lander and an orbiter separated by about 30 minutes at departure. Sadly, the orbiter did not make the intercept yet, however it used up a good portion of it\u0027s fuel supply in an attempt to give a second chance at SoI change and capture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe lander was much more successful. I succeeded at adjusting the orbit to use an aerocapture, then performed a few small burns to set up the final orbit and landing. THe landing itself was uneventful. However, I wound up landing on a steep slope, and my lander began to slide downhill at speeds approaching 15 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I hit a bump.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding legs failed, engines and fuel tanks exploded, antennae crushed... it was horrible. It\u0027s my Mars 3 mission: Land, transmit a short bit of info, then fail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next transfer window opens in about 100 days. I\u0027ll be much more prepared.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-17T19:16:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELift-off and landing are two most dangerous parts of any flight.
