The engines where usually below the rocket in the central column, while the fuel was attached radially (one fuel tank per engine is just too much). The ascend curve and stage-timing took a bit of experimentating, but lifting ratio of something like 3 (starting mass) to 1 (mass in orbit) is a league of its own, when compared to rocket-only-approaches.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lohan2008","CreatedById":80945,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-20T12:54:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENod/ Most of us have played with the jet assist.

For those not familiar with the config files, the first number after \u0022key = \u0022 is the atmospheric pressure, the second is the Isp. So at sea level the jet has an Isp of 2000 vs. the rocket\u0027s 320. At zero pressure, the rocket has moved up to 370, and the jet is (theoretically) down to 1000. Theoretically because of course the jet will flameout before it gets to vacuum. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince Isp is your \u0022miles per gallon\u0022 it would seem that the jet engine gets somewhere between approximately 2.5 and 6.5 times as far on a tank of gas. But, it\u0027s actually way better than that - the rocket engine burns fuel and liquid oxygen in about a 9 to 11 ratio, and it has to carry both of them. The jet burns fuel and intake air - and in a 1 to 15 ratio, and it only has to carry the fuel - the air is free (well, you have to have an intake or two). So at sea level for the expenditure of 1 fuel and 15 free intake it generates (1\u002B15 times 2000 =) 32,000 units of thrust. Burning the same amount of carried combined fuel and oxidizer (0.9 fuel \u002B 1.1 liquid oxygen, halved) you get 160 units of thrust. At the (theoretical for the jet) vacuum pressure, the numbers would be 16,000 vs. a whopping 185 units of thrust. So the weight saved using jet fuel to get you your first 600m/s of velocity and 17-18km of altitude (doable with a couple of intakes per engine) is not inconsiderable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe jet fuel expenditure is so low, you probably only need one tank of jet fuel for a handful of jets used as boosters for your rocket. In a \u0022straight up\u0022 flight profile, what you need to do is decide if the weight of fuel saved is worth the extra parts - the weight of the jet engine isn\u0027t a concern if you are jettisoning it like a used booster. For a space plane or some other form of SSTO, the weight is a consideration. But for a space plane, your ascent profile is designed (or it should be) to get you to 20km and 1000m/s before you switch over to rockets, and you will spend a lot more time getting there, so the fuel savings are greater.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, what if you could keep using the same engine in both air breathing (i.e. jet) and closed cycle (rocket) modes and get the advantages of both? That is the idea behind the Reaction Engines Sabre engine that is in development (\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.reactionengines.co.uk/sabre_howworks.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.reactionengines.co.uk/sabre_howworks.html\u003C/a\u003E). At this point I would put a shameless plugin for an addon I\u0027m involved with, but since I\u0027m not sure when it (if?) it will get done, I\u0027ll instead direct you to the B9 Aerospace pack. Buried in the dozens of other parts and pieces are a 1.25m and a 2.5m Sabre jet engine, so if you are one for playing with add ons, it could be the best of both worlds for you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
