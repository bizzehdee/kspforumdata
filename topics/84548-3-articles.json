We all know from playing ksp that you need to burn prograde to your orbit to raise it higher in order to allow the target to catch up to you. I believe the reason why George did this was because time was more important than delta-v - he needed to get them both to the next station asap - burning away from the target would bring them to the station too late and they\u0027ll die anyway - at the point where they are rendezvousing with target George does mention that he\u0027s out of fuel (using it all up on the way there). If you want to get to a target using the least amount of delta-v - do a hoffman transfer. If you need to get to the target asap you thrust full pelt at the thing and hope you can grab hold of something on the station along the way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Sandra\u0027s decent back to Earth. I think George says at one point to just point the capsule to the earth and thrust - its not rocket science. We all know you need to point your ship at your retrograde marker and burn to lower your orbit. Again this will take longer. So he\u0027s right - it isn\u0027t rocket science but thats what he was getting at - Sandra\u0027s character is just a visitor (a tourist you might say) - so she doesn\u0027t know much about orbital mechanics like we do - shes a mission specialist and have a large crew around her to deal with all the spacey stuff. Teaching her about basic orbital mechanics, how to control the rcs on a capsule, point it in the correct direction on a navball, make sure she gets this exact so she doesn\u0027t come in too fast or too slow and burn up or skip out of the atmosphere, teach basic Japanese so she can read the controls - ain\u0027t no-one got time for that! Tell her to point at that big blue planet in front of her and thrust like crazy and that should give her enough radial momentum to get her in to the atmosphere and let drag do the rest of the work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) And lastly the bit that bothered you with George holding on by her boot. If they are in a stable orbit and he\u0027s lower in the orbit by a couple of feet below her then a gentle tug of the rope will bring him up towards her to save him. But, they aren\u0027t in a stable orbit. Iirc they are tethered to a station that has been ripped to shreds. There are still probably small pieces of debris (microscopic) smacking in to the station passing on their momentum on to the craft, there is probably all manner of gasses venting from the rcs, oxygen, water tanks like a sieve so the station is probably accelerating relative to it current vector which is causing drag on sandra and george - I had to do a similar thing last night using KAS to lift a stranded buggy off of mun - it was causing the rocket to buck around like crazy while thrusting - in the end I had to give it a large enough nudge with thrust to bring it in to an elliptic and then dethether it so I can bring the rocket back to some kind of control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t think of anything else regarding Gravity and I think they got so much other stuff so right on it that these things can probably be forgiven anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat really annoys me now that I\u0027ve been playing KSP for a year.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- How hard we make it out IRL to colonise the solar system. Playing KSP I know the hardest part of any mission is the launch - getting enough payload in to low earth orbit. Anything after that is pretty easy. We have docking down with experience from the ISS we can do it with our eyes closed. We can dance with the planet orbits with gravity assists and aerobreaking with every satellite and probe we\u0027ve sent up - just watching what Cassini is doing around Saturn is just amazing as it skirts around each moon with ease. And yet - we haven\u0027t got a colony on the moon or mars - we aren\u0027t flying spaceplanes through Venus or mining asteriods and it annoys me - it annoys me so much that all we need to do is get the payload off of the earth and then send a crew up like we do for the ISS and we\u0027re good to go. The solar system is waiting for us and we\u0027re just sitting on our front porch moping.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-01T07:53:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022psyper\u0022 data-cite=\u0022psyper\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) and 2)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe question remains whether the \u0022jet pack\u0022/capsule has enough dV for such an inefficient maneuver, but I think they deliberately omitted things to 1. keep the drama going and 2. get not to sciency in a field that is not necessarily general knowledge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot going to comment on this again. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIRL launching stuff is the easier part.
