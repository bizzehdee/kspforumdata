Do I still need docking ports on the objects in order to connect them in space? Or are docking ports simply for docking ships and other non station components? Same goes for a fuel tank... Do I need a docking port on the end I want to connect to the station itself if assembling outside the VAB and in orbit?\n\nAlso, if I do need them, and taking a hub for example again, does both the hub and the object I want to connect to it need a docking port, or just one of them?"},{"CreatedByName":"Retread","CreatedById":89946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T16:46:17Z","Content":"Sadly, there is no such thing as on-orbit construction in the stock version of the game, so the only way to join two ships together is by using docking ports.

One had the station hub in the middle. The other connected to the hub. They were controlled by the landercans. The two ships on either side are the escape capsules. They brought up their own docking tubes and will leave them when they leave. The third double-length docking tube came up on the fifth launch. The idea with it is to allow me to dock larger vessels in the future.\n\nIf you look up and down the main body, there are two large docking rings. That will let me switch out larger components later if I need them.
