I manually completed the contract through the debug menu as I had clearly done the contract, so I came here asking for more advice on these satellite contracts; basically, are they borked?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-08T10:57:56Z\u0022 title=\u002205/08/2015 10:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ToTheMun\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AviatOrme","CreatedById":51126,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T10:25:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAre you certain the satellite is travelling in the right direction?
