I manually completed the contract through the debug menu as I had clearly done the contract, so I came here asking for more advice on these satellite contracts; basically, are they borked?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-08T10:57:56Z\u0022 title=\u002205/08/2015 10:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ToTheMun**"},{"CreatedByName":"AviatOrme","CreatedById":51126,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T10:25:26Z","Content":"Are you certain the satellite is travelling in the right direction?

Clockwise (retrograde orbit) and counterclockwise (prograde orbit) are different orbits - check that.\n\nCompare your inclination with the inclination of the desired orbit in the contract specification. Most likely they will differ by ~180 degree."},{"CreatedByName":"Bilfr3d","CreatedById":75448,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T10:57:02Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Are you certain the satellite is travelling in the right direction?
