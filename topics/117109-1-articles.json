Motokid\u0027s directions work perfectly for profile pictures. But you gave directions for profile pictures which is why you don\u0027t see it when posting. To see the image when posting, you need to edit the Avatar.\n\nSo, the directions are pretty much the same. In the top right click \u0022Settings\u0022. On the left is \u0022Edit Profile Picture\u0022 and \u0022Edit Avatar\u0022 (the options are right next to each other). The Profile picture only appears on your profile, and the Avatar only appears next to your posts.\n\nAlso, welcome from your lurker status! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"}]}
