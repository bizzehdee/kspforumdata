A better pilot than myself could probably come in at something ridiculous like 500m and follow the retrograde vector all the way down at 100% burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 9. Lower orbit is better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESteps 10 and 11. The ideal burn would put you into an orbit with the Pe just barely in the atmosphere.
