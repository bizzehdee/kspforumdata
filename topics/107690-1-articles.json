I launched the same rocket with a different pilots assigned to fly it. It seemed to that the more experinced pilots made it easier to control. I am not really sure if I just happened to fly better and kept everything like my speed closer to optimal or pilots actually make it easier to control the more experience they have.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MechaLynx","CreatedById":108866,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T19:07:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know, but I\u0027ve got a slight suspicion that this is actually the case. I made a craft for a Mun flyby in career and practiced with it several times in sandbox (as I do with all career craft) and it flew just fine. I was quite confident I could control it most any time during ascent, but when I tried it in career it flipped over in 3 consecutive launches (the first one killing Valentina \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;.;\u0022\u003E) until I upgraded the fins. By that point I\u0027d made it consistently to orbit over several attempts. I\u0027m still not sure it wasn\u0027t just me messing up though, the margin of error on that one was quite small.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Collector","CreatedById":143154,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T19:09:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThey should just gain the ability to target prograde / retrograde then at a higher level they get radial / anti-radial and normal / anti-normal.
