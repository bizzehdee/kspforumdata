In most cases it is extremely difficult to follow the roads at the KSC. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat if there was a tweakable for the turning radius? Tighter radii would of course be more unstable, and the rovers would roll, but you could also decrease it so you can turn better.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Feradose","CreatedById":111211,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-21T16:47:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah! I would definitely decrease it by 70% (extreme flip carnavals on mun) but, tweakable wheels sound awesome. Maybe we could tweak the power/impact tolerance by 15% or 30% too for increased mass/electric usage so we could have faster rovers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-21T17:02:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETweakables such as turn radius, torque, and suspension would all be nice.
