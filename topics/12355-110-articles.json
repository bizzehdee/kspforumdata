I do not know why MecbJeb does not want to go in a straight line, but it is really annoying.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve had that, too. If you have a probe or any non-kerballed pod, make sure you select \u0022Control From Here\u0022 before you launch. I added an RC-001S pod and selected \u0022Control From Here\u0022 on that which solved the problem. I think the cause was the fact that I had the MJ pod mounted horizontally. I put the probe under a fairing so I couldn\u0027t select it on the pad because it was hidden, so I had to add the redundant RC-001S.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Which now that I read backward, has already been answered. Well, consider it confirmed then. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
