However, this takes a lot of time. Are there other methods of approximating how far I\u0027ll be able to go with the fuel I have? One thing I\u0027ve thought of (not sure it is actually rationale), take my fuel consumption ( which I assume is fuel consumed per second) and divides by remaining fuel, then multiply by max acceleration.
