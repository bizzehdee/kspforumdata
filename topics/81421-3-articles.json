However it has not been updated in quite a few game updates now and it is essentially being held together with duct tape, a very noble and kerbal thing but as mentioned before the new exploding parts feature in KAS is a new but unwanted feature.

Everyone loves to cite bobcat and his parts and I have to admit I used them extensively when I first started but he is gone and probably not going to come back any time soon. There are wonderful modders like yourself roverdude who are making wonderful things but for some reason I see way to many posts comparing your MKS/OKS to HOME and people creating threads and demanding Bobcats rovers get updated.

Which is why I\u0027m pretty passionate about open licensing. None of us are making a living off of this, and none of us will ever be able to monetize KSP plugins (unless we\u0027re lucky enough to get picked up by Squad). And all of us, at some point, will be doing other stuff. It\u0027s reality. There is no harm in open licensing. I occasionally hear people harp about \u0027vision\u0027. My stuff has a clear vision, but if someone came along tomorrow and forked and made a better vision, I\u0027d either roll it back in and expand on it, or let them go forth and rock on. Either way, open is good. And when I can avoid reinventing the wheel, even better \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sp1989","CreatedById":105359,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-26T19:30:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022marce\u0022 data-cite=\u0022marce\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E@RoverDude: sorry for off-topic.
