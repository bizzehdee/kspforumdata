Or the beautiful results from the materials study? No. While these *are* important, the most interesting piece of equipment is usually the camera, and it\u0027s one of the most useful pieces too!\n\nCameras and telescopes have been a big gap in the science system for a while. They would make science less about clicking and more about getting to a good spot to grab a photo that shows lots of features.\n\nHere\u0027s how I think it could work\n\nbecause Nik loves nothing more than speculation\n\nThere would be several different parts. The basic camera (radial-mounted) would take low quality black-and-white pictures. The advanced camera (radial-mounted) would take better, colored pictures. The telescope (about the size of a small fuel tank) would require lots of power, but be able to take pictures from a great distance.\n\nOnce you get into a good spot and position your ship, you snap a photo. The standard science dialog comes up, but now it\u0027s got a picture where the text usually is. You receive science points based on...\n\n- What planet or moon the picture shows (Eeloo gives more than Kerbin)\n\n- The size of the planet or moon in the picture (farther away = harder to see = less SCIENCE)\n\n- Angle of picture (light side of planet is better than dark side)\n\n- Altitude where picture is taken (Surface shots are way moar awesomer than orbital ones, say scientists)\n\n- Quality of picture (Is it colored? How much static is there? Basically camera quality.)\n\nNote: I know some of these would be hard to program. These are only suggestions.\n\nIn addition, pictures could give different antennas a use... better antennas give higher quality when transmitted?\n\nOne last thing. Pictures would also grant reputation, because like I said in the beginning, the public only cares about pictures. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) Taking pictures with your crew in them would greatly inspire the public and give you loads of rep.\n\nSo what do you guys think?"},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-22T00:24:13Z","Content":"I just support stock telescope parts.

Not \u0022points,\u0022 but something you can use.\n\nSimple useful metric for cameras:\n\n1. Add a value for the visual point of view altitude for map view. The farther from Kerbin, the higher alt the map will be at full zoom. Jool, Duna, Dres, for example will only \u0022zoom\u0022 in map view to about what you might see out the window of your pod at the first point the planet renders at all. Utterly useless, in other words. \n\n2. Putting cameras near any world (SoI?) improves the POV altitude based upon the flyby distance, and camera type down to some altitude above current map POV minimum alt.\n\n3. Putting a camera in orbit drops it farther based upon the apoapsis and periapsis, and perhaps the inclination (require an inclined orbit at some level for a mapping mission, not just equatorial). With the better camera, and a high-gain antenna, the POV altitude then starts to improve upon the current situation, and at some level of mapping the map view would become as good as the \u0022real\u0022 view (allowing later players to plan landings on the Mun down to the smallest craters, for example, never really leaving map view if they like)."},{"CreatedByName":"dryer_lint","CreatedById":162541,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-22T22:32:24Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I just support stock telescope parts.

So you might have a few different size lens/mirror arrangements, and then a few different sensors (eg Monochrome Imager, Colour Imager, Spectroscope, etc).

Not unrealistic just different types!(Though I guess you could condense a Newtonian for packaging purposes if you wanted to. And obviously hybrid or other types could also.) But that leads to something they could do with such an idea! 8d Bring that whole world into the game! You could get science in a limited sense from ground and space base telescopes. And maybe money. They could be missions types for money and science. New use for satelites could be putting up telescopic(or other types. IE radar/heat/etc) satellites of various types around the solar system.\n\nAnd obviously the age old reality of cameras and video via telescopes. It could be a video and picture making suite default in the game. Making a deep space video or other observation stuff could be cool. You could watch your own flights leave the planets etc. If there were random events like distant stars exploding and stuff too it would be cool.\n\nEdit: Ok scanning the SS would be good too. I missed that! I always thought it was stupid you had access and info on everything at the start of a game. Even in a Sandbox game it would be nice to have the option to explore. Obviously you could set it to off if you had the option but the option to have it on would also be good. I wonder if that would lead to planet bases!? 8)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-26T19:30:31Z\u0022 title=\u002202/26/2015 07:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela**"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-26T19:50:07Z","Content":"HST is not a Newtonian, it is a Cassegrain.

Still, it seems like a \u0022useful\u0022 role for cameras, though I would still like to see an interaction with map view on a broader level for simple landing operations (fly from the ship POV (external or IVA) exclusively unless you have imaged the landing site ahead of time with cameras/telescopes)."},{"CreatedByName":"Arugela","CreatedById":133381,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-26T20:00:36Z","Content":"Ah, I always thought those counted as a subcategory of Newtonian.
