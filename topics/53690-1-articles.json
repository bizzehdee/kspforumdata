So far I\u0027ve managed to unlock all but one part of the tech tree, and have landed (and returned to orbit) at Duna and have a mission going to Ike. I have a decent grasp of delta-V, aerobreaking, can rendezvous well enough. Am I ready for some tougher mods?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpecifically, I\u0027m looking at Kethane, ISA MapSat, RemoteTech2 and Ferram Aerospace. I think I\u0027m too wussy for Deadly Re-entry and Life Support (maybe later). I want Kethane and and MapSat to give me a reason to keep exploring other planets. I want RemoteTech to give me a reason to put up satellites.

If your moderately good at making proper re-entries you don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t even need heat-shields, you just need parts that you don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t care about in front of the ones you do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/56399-0-22-RemoteTech-2-v1-2-6-November-16-Flight-Computer!\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ERemote Tech 2\u003C/a\u003E will make getting into outer space more difficult and time consuming, and it takes some getting used to. But it does make satellites important and useful. With stock career you will be doing a lot of manned missions within Kerbin SOI just to get the parts you need for the probes. Line of sight and distance are very important factors you will have to pay attention to for this mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/20451-0-22-Ferram-Aerospace-Research-v0-10-Aerodynamics-Fixes-For-Planes-Rockets\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/a\u003E I think will be the hardest one to get used to, I still have no idea how to use the FAR info screens in the VAB or SPH, I haven\u0027t tried to learn about them much though, being lazy \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E. But it will change how you fly, Rockets and planes, very drastically. For instance, if you go straight up and then pitch over to 45 degrees at 10k meters, for your gravity turn, you will very likely break your rocket or it will go out of control. You have to be gentle on the controls and start pitching your rocket almost immediately off the launch pad for efficient and controllable gravity turns. If you have a hard time making planes with stock, then FAR will make it even more difficult unless you have a good understanding of how real aerodynamics work, or you know how to use FAR info screens. Also fairings are pretty much required for anything that doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t have a aerodynamic profile, do not launch a station module sideways or strapped between a bunch of boosters without some sort of air diverting mechanism, because you will crash. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s the bad news, the good news though is worth it IMO. You can save almost 1k to 1.5K of Delta V with a well constructed rocket and a good ascent profile. Flying planes, once you get used to building them, is fun and intuitive and, if designed right, more efficient. Id say this mod out of the bunch you mentioned will be the one that adds the most difficulty, but that also means it gives you the most satisfaction when you succeed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S. If you use autopilots of any type, they likely wont work well with FAR, MJ crashes my rocket every time I use it for launching rockets, Remote Tech 2 flight computer is very difficult to use for in atmosphere functions, and I haven\u0027t tried KOS yet due to knowing nothing about scripting, and not wanting to learn a new complex system right now, lazy again. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.P.S. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022regex\u0022 data-cite=\u0022regex\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf you get FAR and you\u0027re primarily flying rockets you should also get KIDS because FAR makes it much easier to get rockets into orbit.
