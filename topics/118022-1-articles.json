You could try the -force-opengl or -force-d3d11 options and/or reduce the texture resolution setting to reduce the usage but there are a number of memory leaks in the game that will cause the usage to increase over time eventually causing a crash. The only workaround for this is to monitor how much memory KSP is using and restart the game when it gets close to the limit (how close depends on exactly how you are measuring the usage and you should be able to work out a sensible value by watching for when it crashes a few times)."},{"CreatedByName":"Arnpld","CreatedById":149513,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-16T10:54:41Z","Content":"Geez. \n\nSo, the game can\u0027t run without crashes on 32bit version?
