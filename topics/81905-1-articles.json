I just saw a Scott Manley (I\u0027m sure people here have heard of him, I\u0027ve just learned of him, but anyway) video where he does First Contract in two launches. He\u0027s able to get over 200 science after his first mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I think the fact that people can do that is AWESOME... I also feel like if I don\u0027t do that, I\u0027m some how losing the game. (Yet, I don\u0027t want to copy them. I mean, I might try the challenge, but now that I\u0027ve seen it done I don\u0027t know how I can do my own and feel untainted by previous knowledge... that\u0027s a separate issue, and I digress [again])\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, anyway, that\u0027s great... in say Sandbox Mode or pure Science Mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I\u0027d like to have a mode that limits that sort of thing. After all, just because you can collect a bunch of data (in real life, which Kerbal isn\u0027t, but... Its the sort of game where \u0027real life\u0027 actually kind of matters since I\u0027m told (you/the) dev\u0027s aren\u0027t going to put scifi stuff in) doesn\u0027t mean that data can be understood and put into application immediately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESO...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003ESUGGESTION HERE:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like to see a structured mode that slows down science gain for players that choose to play in this mode, and force them to work with older parts and tech for longer. (Hey, you\u0027d only go into this mode if you wanted it!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile it would be great if specific tech was tied to specific science experiments and data types, that for now the science being tied to contracts would be fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, to unlock a new type of engine, the player would have to perform a contract first. To unlock a new nose cone, another contract for that. Also, to prevent players from taking all the contracts at once and getting all the tech, only one contract can be taken at a time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome contracts can give the player access to the tech right away, but they can\u0027t get any more contracts until they complete the one they have.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther contracts will be there to give players access to other contracts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEXAMPLES:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeveral contracts appear in the contract menu. One is to test a new parachute. The player takes the contract and the player gets access to the parachute to perform the test. The other contracts disappear/can\u0027t be taken until the Parachute contract is complete.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would give players access to the parachute right away, yea! However, until they complete the contract they can\u0027t gain access to another part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, player does the parachute test and now the lab geeks want some Goo Data from Mun (or orbit, or whatever). The would then give the player access to the Mysterious Goo container. Yea! But, once again, until the contract is completed no other parts can be unlocked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a while the lab guys decide they\u0027d like to get some Goo Data from the Mun. So, they ask you to head to the Mun and bring back Goo Data. After completing the contract with the Goo on the Mun, the lab guys have another contract to take a Science Lab to the Mun (I forget what its called, the first white round science thingy you get after Goo.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, back to the Mun! (What, weren\u0027t we just there!? Come on lab guys! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E) and this time we\u0027ve taken science from the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen maybe the science guys want to test transmitting data back from the Mun. This could unlock a new mission contract that gives access to probes, but they want to test how well the probe works from Minmus or something.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd so on, and so on... where several contracts are there for the taking, but the tech tree is only unlocked as the contracts are completed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis way, the player can follow the contracts and not worry about collecting every piece of science from every pond in the game... nor do they advance through the tech tree very quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E=-=-=-=\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDISCLAIMER:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI -LOVE- that the other game play modes exist, and I don\u0027t want them to be removed or tinkered with too much (please make them \u0027better\u0027! - Yes - but I don\u0027t want to see Mission Mode replace Science Mode, or Sandbox Mode, etc.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d love to be able to sit down and play KSP through Mission Mode as a giant tutorial, to learn the game... but then once I\u0027ve beat all the missions I could switch to Science Mode where I can design my own missions (as it is now) to unlock the tech tree and do my own experiments and challenges, but then when I feel like I\u0027ve got more of a handle on the game, I can go into Career where I get to do it all gain with a budget.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I like to see added replay value in all games I play and own. -\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the read,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESasuga\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thereaverofdarkness","CreatedById":75673,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-17T01:41:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would only like this if more of the standard parts had low-tech versions available lower in the tech tree, such as structural components, adapters, docking ports, decouplers, and other basics like that. And I think these should definitely be added to the game. It takes far too long to get docking ports in particular, which really annoys me because I build this elaborate space station with early tech to get some science, and I abandon it shortly after it does its first job because now I want a better station but it\u0027s impossible to upgrade it. It also bugs the hell out of me that I can use various high-tech devices like probe cores or jet engines but I still can\u0027t make basic structural fuselages, beams, wings, panels, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would rather enjoy a mode that makes unlocking tech much more difficult. It could even be a difficulty setting rather than a mode unto itself.

I understand what you\u0027re saying, but you might want to stay with science mode if you like to jump to advanced tech early.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI personally am hoping for a slower tech experience with this mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I think that a space station being built and then being out of date matches reality pretty well, and the reason your first station is out of date is because of the science it gets you, right? It gets you a bunch of science and your little Kerbals now understand how to build a better station. Its like, \u0022We built a space station, yea! Look at it, w00t! Man, I learned so much from building that station that if we could do it all over again it would be so much better!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFoot Note: I think the designers should try to strike the balance of fast tech and slow tech, for people who prefer different play styles, by creating different game modes and different options for the various game modes. - You want a fast tech game, and that\u0027s great! I want a slow tech game, and I think that\u0027s great too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
