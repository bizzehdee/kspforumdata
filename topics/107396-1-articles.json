My own words:\n\nAlpha: Not all the functionality and lots of bugs\n\nBeta: All the functionality and lots of bugs\n\nProduction/release: All the functionality and a few trivial bugs \n\nNow, those are business-world stages, they get muddier for gaming. Even in the business world, the stage titles are flexible depending on a lot of things, like marketing dept deadlines (I\u0027m looking at you Oracle). I\u0027m almost certain that Squad will have faced pressures other than just getting the best product out of the door and I have a lot of sympathy for this. \n\nAnd, of course, there are other development lifecycle methods than the simple waterfall three tier model. There aren\u0027t any \u0027rules\u0027 for naming your release stages, it\u0027s just handy to use the labels so others know where things are at. However, they are often useful stages to go through for any kind of software development, if only as milestones to be shared with the interested community. Having these stages also helps to focus where the development effort is being applied. \n\nSo, how does the release of KSP fit this model, because there\u0027s been a lot talk about Alpha v Beta v Production? \n\nWell, we had a long Alpha stage, perhaps everything before 0.9. There was a lot of bugs that slowly got squished and a lot of missing or placeholder functionality. \n\nThen we had the short stage of 0.9 which was declared as Beta. Bit of an oddity this. There was additional functionality but not all of it, with some very major changes (aero etc) still to come but not too many bugs. \n\nFinally we got 1.0. This has all the major functionality originally in scope with some bugs and major tweaking needed. \n\nWe therefore got a typically top-light development. A very long Alpha, then a truncated and seemingly rushed Beta and Production. It got the product out of the door in a useable state and as Jeb might say, \u0022Any landing you walk away from is a good one\u0022. So all well and good. \n\nIf I was to suggest how in an ideal world things might have been improved, I would have extended Beta with at least one more release, 0.95. I\u0027d have put all final functionality in that and then tweaked and bug-fixed it. Then released 1.0 a few weeks after that when the issues with the final functionality were ironed out. Because, as it is, the customers are testing and bug-finding the final release, which unfortunately is not uncommon in the business world either (I\u0027m looking really hard at you now Oracle).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-04T11:00:33Z\u0022 title=\u002205/04/2015 11:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Foxster**"},{"CreatedByName":"gogozerg","CreatedById":127301,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T10:55:53Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m almost certain that Squad will have faced pressures other than just getting the best product out of the door and I have a lot of sympathy for this.\n\nThat\u0027s what I think too, and there are things we don\u0027t know.\n\nFor me, 1.0 is the real beta. Many bugs need to be fixed, Squad will probably fine tune some parameters. Angry people should come back for 1.1.\n\nKSP is not the first game shipped too early..."},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T11:04:26Z","Content":"I think we all (at least those with experience in delivering software) agree on that. It\u0027s also clear that the product was rushed, the QA team itself mentioned that. \n\nThen there is this deal with GOG about the special edition boxed set. Boxed sets require production runs and those are usually tightly scheduled, so maybe that had something to do with it?\n\nI don\u0027t think anyone reasonable had a particular gripe with the sorry state 1.0 was delivered in; a lot of exciting new features were added and it takes some time to sort them out. As you mentioned, in a .9x release. What is upsetting was the decision to go live with this particular release, which pretty much unfolded exactly the way you would expect it to unfold. The new features contained bugs and are unbalanced. Nothing a few weeks of community feedback and bugfixes can\u0027t handle. Of course by then we\u0027re talking about 1.1\n\nThe old rule of \u0022never buy a 1.0 version; wait for others to discover the bugs first\u0022 still seems to apply, although I\u0027m happy to have been playing from .20 onward, but with each release it seems a better and better idea to wait a week before upgrading.

Not too long ago it was just plain arrogant to assume your customers to have constant internet access, and patches were not as frequent, hotfixes only released when functionality was at stake. Now it\u0027s very easy to adapt to consumer input and release patches quite quickly. I think the positive of this is that there\u0027s more consumer input and a quicker reaction to this input, but the downside is that you get sloppier releases under the motto \u0027we can patch it if turns out to be broken\u0027. Include publisher pressure (not an issue with Squad, but it is for a lot of other developers) and you get buggy releases and hasty patches.\n\nI notice this even in my own work, I build interactive installations and when I have the time to work and test on location before the opening I tend to make code that just works and figure out the details on site. If I can\u0027t be present, there\u0027s no on site time to test or the hardware is made by an external party I am way more minute in ruling out any potential problems in the code as it\u0027s not as easy and quick to fix it.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-04T12:01:37Z\u0022 title=\u002205/04/2015 12:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ColourOfFire**"},{"CreatedByName":"fairytalefox","CreatedById":115320,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T12:16:04Z","Content":"It\u0027s not alpha-beta-production.
