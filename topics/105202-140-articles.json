Sometimes, it\u0027s too easy to get focused on trying to design something that will be 100% self sustaining and missing the fact that what you\u0027ve built will last 20 years without any resupply and you only need it for 5 years.\n\u003E \n\nI thought with OKS , there was a way to be able to tap into the warehouse on the planet or something like that?"},{"CreatedByName":"ExplorerKlatt","CreatedById":107424,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-10T22:22:22Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 21 minutes ago, gamerscircle said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I thought with OKS , there was a way to be able to tap into the warehouse on the planet or something like that?\n\u003E \n\nNope. Currently there is no way to make an orbital station completely self sufficient. Keep in mind though that with enough storage an the right parts you can make a station that will take decades to need resupply. \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-12-10T22:23:41Z\u0022 title=\u002212/10/2016 10:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 10, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by ExplorerKlatt**"},{"CreatedByName":"Wyzard","CreatedById":162363,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-11T00:25:43Z","Content":"BTW, I notice that having a kerbal go on EVA, even briefly, resets the \u0022hab\u0022 timer.

I just try to \u0022role play\u0022 my actions such that the spirit of the hab timers are preserved.  Not being able to make it to minmus in just a pod made for a few interesting early game designs.  And for the first time in over 1500 hours of game play, I finally have a play-through where it makes sense to use probes over manned missions."},{"CreatedByName":"Wyzard","CreatedById":162363,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-11T01:16:31Z","Content":"I just did it with a ship returning from the Mun, with nothing else nearby.  It may be relevant that the ship in question has no actual hab module, just a 2-kerbal lander can, so the hab timer was just resetting to its baseline 45 hours (0.25 kerbal-months).  I don\u0027t know if it happens with ships that have actual habitation parts.\n\n(Also BTW, \u0022kerbal-months\u0022 are sort of a weird metric: they\u0027re Earth months (30 days) composed of Kerbin days (6 hours).  A Kerbin month (one orbit of the Mun) is about 6 days.)"}]}
