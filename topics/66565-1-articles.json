One of which is currently stickied over at the Spacecraft exchange. With both of these ships I created customized parts and placed them in a folder under Game Data, which I include when I release a craft. These parts are all just duplicates of stock parts with things like the size, mass, rotation limits/speed, and fuel type changed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis has allowed me to create extremely unique things for this game, however, people seem to be reluctant to download my crafts. I assume this is because of the understandable desire to avoid cluttering up the parts list with parts that are meant for one craft. Even though I change the title of the part and the description at a quick glance it looks just like the stock part, which is confusing. Especially with the robotics, where I tend to have 2\u002B of the same robotic piece, with different speeds/limits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy new project, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/73364-Walking-Flying-Custom-Replica-Mech-Mod\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Efound here\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E, takes this a step further by having user MassDivide design parts from scratch to try and accomplish a 100% replica. Now his parts will be loaded into the game and coded by me so that it works for the craft intended, but will be pretty much useless in any other situation. Hopefully we will be able to build more than one, which means a lot of parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy suggestion is to add a tab, much like the subassemblies, that contains part folders for these highly customized ships. This way they don\u0027t clutter the stock part list, but can still be found if needed. Maybe these parts don\u0027t even load on startup, and are only loaded into the game when the craft is loaded, increasing the load time for the craft, but not the load time for the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, that\u0027s my suggestion. I know it\u0027s dangerously close to \u0022rearranging the parts list\u0022, but it would be huge in helping what I\u0027m trying to accomplish in this game. Which is multiple, fully replicated crafts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for checking it out,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eclown_baby\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-23T14:06:49Z\u0022 title=\u002203/23/2014 02:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 23, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by clown_baby\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
