What if an early way to study star systems we can reach would be some sort of space telescope? There is a lot of data real world space telescopes can gather about stars and exoplanets such as\u00A0 approximate mass, orbit distance, potential composition, etc. So why not have something like this in ksp2?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Yellowburn10","CreatedById":107558,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-13T17:10:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI really wanted something like this in KSP.
