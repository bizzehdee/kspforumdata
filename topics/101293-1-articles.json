No. \n\nCmdr Zeta\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-06T01:08:54Z\u0022 title=\u002203/06/2015 01:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Cdr\\_Zeta**"},{"CreatedByName":"Beale","CreatedById":70533,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-05T17:46:31Z","Content":"....What?"},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-06T21:37:13Z","Content":"I think you\u0027re arguing for some sort of tracking system whereby a derivative mod indicates that it\u0027s a derivative.\n\nYes, the situation with Interstellar is confusing. No, we don\u0027t need to create a whole system to track it, and even if we did, there\u0027d be no good way to enforce it.\n\nThe license for a mod dictates what you can do with it. In many cases, yes, it is completely legal to repackage the mod under a new name, even with new part names, as long as they give proper attribution in the download. The MIT license, GPL, the various CC licenses, and BSD license all allow this.\n\nThis is a good thing; it allows mods with missing authors to continue without their original creator. As an example, I picked up SafeChute after the original author stopped updating it.\n\nYou can license your mod such that people can\u0027t work on it. ISA Mapsat was licensed like this, and when the author stopped updating it, nobody could continue it. Eventually SCANsat was created as a replacement, but for a long time there was no working mapping mod."},{"CreatedByName":"Cdr_Zeta","CreatedById":59015,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-10T11:59:23Z","Content":"Hello,\n\nI am trying to understand the validity of your information.\n\nAll I am saying is that it would be nice to have additional information in the \u0027Manufacturing\u0027 section of the part to show where these MODS come from; I dont think it is fair and I dont think it is right to make MODS look like their their own big and bold, say that you have to have some other MOD to make it work, then have the gaul to put your name in as the SOLE AUTHOR.\n\nRight now I have an unlicensed MOD I just realized in my set; I could just take the model color it up abit, add some code and license it; I have a conscience and couldnt do that; I guess some people dont care.\n\nCollaboration on a MOD is a good thing but it really needs to have a version history attached; most MODS have them such as on Gtihub and you can even add to it but only if the work is original; sometimes that version history is not included as a seperate file; I am just saying it would be nice.\n\nDoing so gives the respect that people deserve - in the download where it belongs, not just in the forums.\n\nCmdr Zeta"},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-10T15:15:02Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Right now I have an unlicensed MOD I just realized in my set; I could just take the model color it up abit, add some code and license it; I have a conscience and couldnt do that; I guess some people dont care.\n\nNope. The lack of license does not give you that right.\n\nAs for the rest of your post it is mostly a question of point of view. There were some post about what some consider \u0022legally right\u0022 versus what other consider \u0022morally right\u0022. Each side has valid arguments and I doubt anyone will switch side on a whim.\n\nThe absurd case (take a mod, change the owner name and nothing else) are often resolved quickly since most modders agree that they are bad and users are not stupid either. Other case generate endless post that rarely change anythings and stops when everyone is tired of repeating the same arguments, or when the mods call for a nuclear strike truce."}]}
