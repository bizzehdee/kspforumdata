The engineering challenges rocket scientists overcame in the space race are endlessly fascinating to me,\u00A0but this Expansion, and KSP in general, only deals with a fraction of those challenges.

I bought KSP on sale for a friend a few years ago. My friend didn\u0027t\u00A0have a lot of disposable income at the time, and still doesn\u0027t now. It\u0027s been a rough few years, and I know KSP has been a great outlet for creativity and stress relief during that time. So, if my friend is interested in the Expansion I\u0027d get it for him without hesitation. Personally,\u00A0supporting Take-Two has zero importance to me, and, while I\u0027m sure Squad is comprised of decent, well-meaning people trying their best\u00A0to do\u00A0good work, the people who made KSP so great have all moved on. At this point I have no idea what the plans are for KSP;\u00A0Take-Two has offered no information of what it wants to do,\u00A0so it\u0027s hard for me to be excited about the future of KSP and feel like it\u0027s anything I\u0027m interested in supporting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs directionless development continues, I continue to lose interest. I remain hopeful that something will be made that takes its inspiration from KSP and makes it even better by having a directed vision from the start and by utilizing the best software possible to go beyond any limitations KSP has. If that comes from Take-Two, great!\u00A0If it comes from someone else at the expense of the Kerbals, great! Heck, if it comes from someone else that might even be ideal. I think I could like a space-software race.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTL;DR - I get the Expansion for free.

So, I\u0027m on the fence about buying the DLC because I want the new parts (and still don\u0027t care about the mission builder stuff), but I\u0027m not sure all these new parts are worth the cost of the DLC. I also feel no obligation to Squad or Take Two to \u0022support\u0022 them and their development of this product by purchasing the DLC, especially after the recent hubub over the new TOS and Privacy Policy. Take Two is a massive company with a lot of cash and plans to supplement that cashflow via microtransactions, so they have no business trying to guilt trip a community like this into funding development of this product as if it was stll an indie title.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was hoping there would be a much bigger backlash within the various KSP communities (here, Reddit, Steam, etc) about moving more of these DLC parts into the 1.4 stock update. Unfortunately that hasn\u0027t happened. Personally, I have no issue with the \u0022historical\u0022 specific parts (like the Apollo LM, Soyuz, etc) being DLC exclusive, but there are a lot of other \u0022basic\u0022 parts (fairings, service modules, etc) I believe should be in the stock game that they are currently fencing off in the DLC. This gives me a sad, because it means I will probably have to pay full price for a DLC that I only care half about. And in doing so, I\u0027ll play right into the hands of a faceless corporation that really doesn\u0027t give two hoots about me as a customer or this community as a whole. They view us as a cash register and they intend to take as much from the till as they can.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-03-05T14:52:45Z\u0022 title=\u002203/05/2018 02:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 5, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Johnny Wishbone\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Espelling\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dafni","CreatedById":149636,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-05T15:20:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/118096-johnny-wishbone/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022118096\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/118096-johnny-wishbone/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Johnny Wishbone\u003C/a\u003E I feel almost exactly the same about this.
