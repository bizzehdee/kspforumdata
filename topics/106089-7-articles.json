When I\u0027ve made the patch I\u0027ve compared the amount of LqdHydrogen/OX for stock tanks and MFT to the values given by Nerteas Fuelswitch patch. Nerteas assumes for stock tanks, that 10 units of LqdHydrogen equals 1 unit of Oxidizer and the resource using is half and half. \n\u003E  Of course for MFT it isn\u0027t exactly the same, e.g. for fuelswitch there is a tank with LqdHydrogen only, but it adds just the value for Oxizider to the value of LqdH2, which makes no sense, when you assume 10x higher \u0022density\u0022. In this case MFT just doubles the amount of LqdH2.\n\u003E \n\u003E First you can change the default basemass to 0.000625 for balance reasons.
