I can get the model finished and textured, but the IVA prop stuff is all new to me, so I was wondering if anyone with some experience fancies picking that part of the project up? As you can see, it\u0027s not an external command seat; I\u0027m using JSITransparentPod. I\u0027ve not seen much \u0027open cockpit\u0027 stuff done this way, so thought I\u0027d give it a go. It can, of course, be easily configured as an external command seat for those that might want it to work that way. Thinking the back ought to be some kind of container or something.. General thoughts welcome!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kujuman","CreatedById":28299,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T16:58:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAre you thinking about making custom IVA props, or just getting the config for them?
