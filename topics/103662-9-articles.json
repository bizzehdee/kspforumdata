Combined with a possibly smaller than 22km physics bubble, it would enable more mission profiles without activating physics for every piece of debris within 22km of the launch pad. Or perhaps there could be some other way of designating a craft as \u0022always loaded.\u0022 A small, massless part? A tweak in the VAB?\n\nAgain: It doesn\u0027t work that way. The distance at which things are loaded is no longer statically limited to a single value. They don\u0027t just blindly bump the distance up to 22.5km, it\u0027s situational now. Vessels are loaded (or not loaded) based on situation."},{"CreatedByName":"Crusher48","CreatedById":135642,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-12T21:08:18Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Again: It doesn\u0027t work that way.

So, if they were on a trajectory from Kerbin to Duna then only one would load at a time, if they were more than 2.5km from each other. If, however, it was a Duna-to-Duna suborbital hop, then yes, they would all stay loaded until they all crashed."},{"CreatedByName":"Linear","CreatedById":26619,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T07:49:31Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E So that way if I launch new modules to the ground base on Duna, I could have the cluster of modules all stay loaded as long as I stay within 22.5 km or so, but the modules on the ground will not load until I get closer because there is no reason to load them?\n\nPhysics bubble range is determined by a vessel\u0027s state (landing, orbit, atmosphere,\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_). It seems like only the atmosphere value is 22.5km now, so landed vessels will still be restricted to 2.5km physics loading.\n\nHowever, the changing of the way the physics loading is handled may mean it is more easily modded."},{"CreatedByName":"swoosh","CreatedById":102244,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T07:57:24Z","Content":"When i read about that bridge between islands... anyone thought about a space elevator with these bubbles?\n\nWait for it... ![:rolleyes:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Nightmare","CreatedById":63118,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T11:58:00Z","Content":"Hm this physics bubble thing makes me thing of strap a probe core and parachute to my booster launch my rocket seperate the booster and have a refund for it after it landed sucsessfull...

Multiple bubbles would mean multiple vessels being under physics simulation simultaneously which is just asking for computers to melt (that is unless I misunderstand what you mean by this)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I would think they eventually have to come to terms with handling such things if they want to do multiplayer.\n\nNot really, multiplayer each physics bubble is locally hosted, only positions need updating. There\u0027s still only a single bubble per player (how they handle synching two players in the same physics region will be a little interesting, but thats about it)"}]}
