I know that unmanned ships need to have a path to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E in order for them to be controlled, and that manned spacecraft can control themselves regardless of whether they have line-of-sight to Kerbin or not. But when controlling unmanned spacecraft, will any Kerbal pilot with a connection do?\u00A0 For example, say I had two spacecraft, one remote controlled, and another with a Kerbal crew, and\u00A0neither of them have a\u00A0path to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E; is it possible to control the unmanned spacecraft using the Kerbal pilots in the manned spacecraft?\u00A0Or do I have to set up relay satellites in order to establish a connection back home before I can control the unmanned satellite?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-01T05:17:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo, you don\u0027t need a connection back to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E.
