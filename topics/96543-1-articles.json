Any way, so why can\u0027t save and go back if I choose when I am trying something?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, instead I\u0027m forced to refly every mission over and over till I get it right: even if it takes 20-30 minutes to get to the hard or questionable point of my flight. It sucks I can\u0027t save and try again from some mid point, but forced to re play from take off.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Remkeau","CreatedById":106783,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-13T08:32:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can use F5 for quicksaving and F9 for quickloading.
