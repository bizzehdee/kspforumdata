Even for passive radiators, you need a really consistent object, in terms of heating coefficient - else, you might get something unexpected. Fairings are designed to be heat-resistant (or so I guess, think of aerodinamic stress), so I\u0027m a bit of wondering how heat would flow to them. Also, fairings are dead mass, the capability of the launcher is reduced if you don\u0027t dispose them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T11:47:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe STS bay doors had radiators fitted to their inner surfaces, they were not themselves radiators though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BriXman","CreatedById":89391,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-13T21:58:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, that\u0027s a project for another day, ey?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
