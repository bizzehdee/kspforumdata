If travelling at the low end of that range the basic jet is more powerful than the turbojet, it\u0027s not until significant speed has been accumulated that the turbojet overtakes it. Could that explain your observations?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketPilot573","CreatedById":62803,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-18T04:07:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI just found out something new about the KSC menu: You can right click on buildings to repair any damage even if it is still operational. It will also list the varying degrees from damage by \u0022Light,\u0022 \u0022Moderate,\u0022 \u0022Critical\u0022 and \u0022Out of service.\u0022 For example, if you destroy 3 out of 4 of the structures around the launch pad (but not the pad itself) then it will be fine, but destroying all 4 of them will render it out of service, even though the concrete pad is untouched. Also the tracking station can still work with one dish broken, but wreck 2 dishes and it\u0027s dead.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ShadowZone","CreatedById":112420,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-18T10:16:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmm... got mixed feelings about 0.25\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E- Exploding buildings.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, they are fun to mess around with. But then the Launchpad implodes from the weight of my rockets, it\u0027s no fun at all - especially if you haven\u0027t unlocked the clamps yet (those help). I often launch 4000 ton vehicles with payloads of 200t or more.

I love the cargo bays. My KR-71 Whitebird now has a hidden VTOL engine. Great looks on the new parts as well. However... I used a lot of wing parts as \u0022decoration\u0022 on some of my deep space cruisers, including the now no longer existing flaps. Well they look like crap now, but that\u0027s the risk of early access / alphas I guess \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E- The economic stuff.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really don\u0027t care about that. I want to build stuff and use it.

Transferring my 32-man crew to my deep space cruiser was a chore before this. However... it seems like hit and miss.

Yes, I use some mods, which may be the cause, but there are no incompatibility warnings and everything worked fine before 0.25 - or at least to a certain degree. Just before writing this, I had 8 crashes over the course of 45 minutes. No fun at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E- Features vs. Performance. \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am no developer... so maybe I misunderstand the entire process of creating this game. But I would really like to see more improvements on the basic performance instead of adding more and more features. I want my \u0026gt;1000 part ships to work smoothly and not to grind my rig to a complete halt. I managed to construct a 1300 ton fuel station in a stable orbit. I cannot use said fuel station because every time I want to guide a ship there and dock, my system throws in the towel. And I can run other high end games (things like Crysis 3 etc.) with no problem at all. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is really my biggest request: Make KSP in such a way that it no longer requires the power of a Tianhe-2 to run smoothly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo here\u0027s what I think: I love the rate of progress, I love the part improvements, I really don\u0027t care about the economic stuff and I still miss significant performance boosts.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-18T17:53:14Z\u0022 title=\u002210/18/2014 05:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 18, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by ShadowZone\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gryphon","CreatedById":58513,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-19T05:25:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUp until now, I would launch and revert, launch and revert, until I got a working spacecraft.
