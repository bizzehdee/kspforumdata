This document is some 250\u002B typed pages with all manner of charts and diagrams in a single PDF file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETotally fascinating stuff! The detail is amazing. I didn\u0027t look for it, but I bet the items from Neil Armstrong\u0027s private stash that were just discovered this week are probably listed in there somewhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome things that caught my eye:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* After playing so much KSP, it really started to make me realize how dumb we Americans are for still using measurements in feet instead of meters, lol.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* I didn\u0027t realize that the Apollo mission orbited the moon in the opposite direction than how they orbited the earth. Is this due to how the moon is tidally locked to Earth, always showing us the same side? I guess I hadn\u0027t given it much thought before, but that might make sense. Should we try to orbit and land on the Mun in KSP in the way?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* It is also interesting how close to the night/day line (is terminus the right word for that?) that they chose for landing. I know they did that for shadow contrast on the terrain during landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* This document is the plan for the mission before it happened, this is not recorded data afterward. The full scale of everything they had to think of and plan for really looks crazy when you see it like this - it really was a huge undertaking and they left nothing to chance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, this was a mesmerizing read for me, I hope you guys find it fun to look through too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-12T20:06:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kelderek\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kelderek\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E* I didn\u0027t realize that the Apollo mission orbited the moon in the opposite direction than how they orbited the earth.

It is less efficient than a standard Hohmann transfer. However, it was tuned in such a way that if the crew decided to skip their lunar capture burn, the spacecraft would simply continue on its way and return to Earth - even intersecting the atmosphere without having to perform a deorbit burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is what saved the lives of the brave men aboard Apollo 13, when they suffered a catastrophic hardware malfunction shortly before entering lunar orbit. Because they were on a \u0022free return\u0022 trajectory, they were able to ride their wrecked craft home despite being unable to operate its main engine. (They did have the use of the lunar module\u0027s engine as backup though, which helped to shorten the trip.)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-12T20:10:44Z\u0022 title=\u002202/12/2015 08:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-12T20:10:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan that figure 8 flight path be simulated in KSP without n-body physics?
