It seems that when MJ is calculating a burn time, it sums up the dV of all engines on a craft, regardless of whether or not they\u0027re activated (or pointing in the right direction). My larger ships tend to consist of several independent modules hooked together (landers, etc.), so a given \u0022ship\u0022 will probably have 8-12 engines in it, most of which are disabled. If you have MJ calculate \u0026amp; execute a node, it and the game properly calculate the dV and place the node, and the game shows a correct burn duration for the number of engines active. However, it appears that MJ is calculating its own burn duration when deciding when to start the burn, and it seems to include all engines on the craft, regardless of whether they\u0027re turned on. This can lead to some pretty significant errors. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome made up numbers for the sake of example: if my large ship has a total of 14 engines, 2 of which are activated for interplanetary insertion, MJ will calculate a 2000 dV burn, which the node display will show as taking 20 minutes. However, MJ does its own internal calculation and decides that if all 14 engines were active (even if they\u0027re pointing in the wrong direction), the burn should only take 5 minutes. Thus, MJ starts the burn at -2:30 rather than -10, potentially offsetting my interplanetary trajectory significantly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt seems the \u0022expected\u0022 behavior of MJ would be to only sum the dV of engines that are activated when the node is created when calculating burn times.

To use it, I need to set the initial parameters of the ejection burn manually (usually in 2 kicks due to typically low interplanetary TWR). After launching into Kerbol SOI, MechJeb2 can take over and perform the expected mid-course plane change maneuver using the fine tune closest approach planner. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, setting up that initial ejection angle is more of a pain than it needs to be. I typically would orbit at least once and use the orbit info window to find where to create the maneuver node for the right angle to prograde, then do the initial kick burn, then set it all up again for the interplanetary burn. Or I could get impatient and eye the ejection angle, only that angle is actually quite important for big burns like Eeloo or Moho (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/27236-Tutorial-Step-by-step-Interplanetary-Hohmann-transfer-guide-and-tips\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/27236-Tutorial-Step-by-step-Interplanetary-Hohmann-transfer-guide-and-tips\u003C/a\u003E).

After all, it calculates the prograde angle in the orbit info window.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I added the ability to show and set it in the maneuver node editor window, like shown here (I\u0027m the probe body setting up a 800 m/s kick burn):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nWMW8WP.png\u0022 alt=\u0022nWMW8WP.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis ends up working really well with the shift time feature, as you can shift by say twice your orbit period and then snap it back to the desired prograde angle to get the optimal ejection angle at the perfect time. For convience with the launch window calculator, you can set the retrograde angle instead (which is just prograde-180). I thought it would be trivial to make, as I could just assume a circular like orbit and have it mostly work. But the results for kick burn orbits were horrendous, so I ended up learning a ton about Kepler orbits and the internal programming interfaces of MechJeb and KSP.
