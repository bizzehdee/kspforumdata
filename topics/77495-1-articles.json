But is Instagram such a good thing? A photo repository which also allows you to add \u0022filters\u0022 when uploading sound great, right? Especially if it\u0027s merged with Facebook, so you get 2 birds at once What could be bad about it? Nothing, right? Wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, I\u0027ll speak as a photographer. Instagram is very, I mean VERY bad for taking photos. It completely ruins your shots. Motion bluff, terrible DOF, terrible focus(most of the times people too lazy to manually select a focus point), terrible lighting and so on. The most annoying thing is that people think that slapping on filters magically makes photos better. Wrong again. The quality of a photo has nothing to do with that. Most of the time(95%) you don\u0027t even need filters. You are better off using your standard camera app on your iPhone or just picking up your DSLR(or a Smple digital cam). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly, Instagram is just a huge pile which is made up by 90% out of trash(this includes terrible selfies, pet photos, meme pics,nails and so on). Not to mention that all of these photos are just bad, they carry no sense, they don\u0027t have a story, or any feeling. They are just a flat layer of pixels stored in some server. If only Instagram was more like Flickr-you have to put effort to share good pictures. It is probably the exact opposite of Instagram. What do you think? Do you like Instagram or hate it?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Felsmak","CreatedById":27187,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-13T17:27:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt looks like an excellent colour blindness simulator.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kinglet","CreatedById":58832,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-13T17:54:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is a place for stupid hopeless people who are desperate to become famous by posting pathetic content.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-13T23:36:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt makes me cringe.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Seret","CreatedById":41409,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-14T06:14:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPeople will be taking bad snaps on their phone with or without Instagram.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceXray","CreatedById":113396,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-14T14:38:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t-even though an iPhone offers very few options for customization, and everything is mostly automatic, it still surprises me how most people think taking photos is so simple-point and press. It doesn\u0027t work like that. It all depends on exposure, focus and so on. I have a few apps that allow me to extend the shutter speed all the way to 30\u002B seconds(a clever software trick where 1s exposures are combined), an app that allows me to lock ISO and shutter speed and more. But that isn\u0027t the main reason. If you removed autofocus on all iPhones, Apple would get spammed with complaints that the camera is broken. Autofocus works 80% of the time-just get the main subject in the center. However, say you want a can if Cola to be sharp, but it is a bit to the right-the camera just focused on the background and the can becomes fuzzy. Many people don\u0027t know you can just tap the can on the screen and focus on it instead of the center of the frame. Heck, you can even lock the exposure on the stock camera! Many people don\u0027t know this, and it can often ruin shots.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EvilotionCR2","CreatedById":27754,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-15T07:05:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s evil.
