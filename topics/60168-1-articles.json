I can understand you wanting to have rockets that look realistic - I\u0027ve gone to great lengths in recreating the form and function of the Apollo vehicles, as well as a Soyuz/Vostok style pod and rocket and a NASA Space Shuttle (no boosters on the tanks here).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPast a certain point, tho, you\u0027re only hurting your own progress. In KSP, like any RL space agency, you have to work within certain tolerances for force exerted on a part, and as in real life the only way to increase the tolerance is to use stronger parts or a more complex arrangement of attachment. Radial decouplers are floppy, weakly-bonded things that are barely good enough to hold a SRB relatively straight, let alone Jumbo tanks with Mainsails on the bottom.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake my advice, experiment with ways to conceal your extra attachments.
