\u00A0I do\u00A0get that there would be some additional knowledge from analyzing a surface sample from the environment it came from. \u00A0But not 5x more. \u00A0And again, this rationale does not hold up for something like temperature readings, which are just data.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-The MPL\u0027s other features (resetting science experiments, enabling KerbNet, and leveling up Kerbals) are fine, and serve to make the MPL kind of a remote hub for your activities, which I think is a good thing. \u00A0But these features aren\u0027t all that useful by themselves, and they don\u0027t have all that much to do with the part being, you know, a science lab.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-I don\u0027t want to sound like I\u0027m opposed to using the lab to get science points. \u00A0I very much want to have a science lab up in space, doing science stuff. \u00A0That just seems like one of the things you should be doing in a space simulator, and it\u0027s one of the main reasons to have a space station or surface base.\u00A0\u00A0The game should reward you for doing this, by providing some (reasonable) output of science or other resources. \u00A0\u00A0Moreover, I want my scientist Kerbals to have a function (resetting experiments is fine, but again, not enough by itself). \u00A0And I want leveling up your scientists to help you in some meaningful way.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll that said, what would be a good method to fix the MPL into something that\u0027s balanced, still useful, and more fun/intuitive to use? \u00A0Frankly, I don\u0027t claim to have a complete answer. \u00A0But here are some suggestions, some or all of which might be involved in a given fix. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Scrap the current \u0022MPL eats experiments, generates a new resource called data, eats the data\u00A0and then poops out massive science points\u0022 mechanic. \u00A0It\u0027s bad. \u00A0Just bad. \u00A0But at least, cut the output back to something more reasonable, and remove the repeatability in different labs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Use the lab\u00A0as a means to get most or\u00A0all\u00A0\u00A0the \u0022recover\u0022 value of experiments without having to send them back to Kerbin manually (I think the lab did something like this in the early versions?). \u00A0Maybe scale the recovery value to the experience level of the scientists operating it. \u00A0\u00A0This goes with the idea that the MPL is not \u0022better\u0022 at science than the folks back home; it\u0027s just more convenient. \u00A0To make this function meaningful, they might have to decrease radio transmission values relative to fully recovered values. \u00A0That is fine by me, again especially for goo and the other physical data samples. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Perhaps provide a small science bonus for analyzing the physical samples in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E or biome in which they were found. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Offer contracts to go out and get a particular sample from a particular biome, and take it back to an MPL for testing. \u00A0This makes a lot of sense - suppose the Kerbin State University just got a grant to test the soil for the Mun\u0027s East Crater for the presence of isoexplodium or something, and they want you to help out. \u00A0These contracts could reward you with both cash and fairly significant amounts of science. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-When \u0022launch a space station\u0022 contracts require a science lab, require it to be manned by scientists. \u00A0This would be a more significant issue for stations outside Kerbin\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-It\u0027s probably fine to leave the other auxiliary functions of the MPL as is. \u00A0They\u0027re just not that big of a deal. \u00A0It might make more sense to limit the level-up function to scientists, but on the other hand it\u00A0might be odd if there were no comparable level-up methods for the other classes. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI still feel like there\u0027s something missing, though. \u00A0I would like to have a reason to put my Kerbals up there and have them sit around sciencing, like on the ISS. \u00A0And none of my suggestions get to that all that well. \u00A0But maybe that\u0027s just an inherent problem when time is basically unlimited unless you\u0027re using a life support mod of whatnot. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSorry for the lengthy rant. \u00A0Feel free to add any other ideas for rehabilitating this poor misunderstood\u00A0part!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Allocthonous","CreatedById":169833,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-20T06:16:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou make some good points.
