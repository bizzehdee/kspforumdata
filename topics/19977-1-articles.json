You can integrate any other challenges into this if you want, basically the idea is to accomplish cool things such as efficiently gliding craft and possibly something that can exist in Jool\u0027s atmoshpere. This makes the rules pretty simple.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERules:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaintain a static elevation while traveling in orbit or in the air above the surface of a planet or celestial body. i.e. maintain a vertical velocity of no more than (and preferably less than) \u002B/- 5 m/s for atleast a minute while maintaining momentum in the forward direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI still need to try the gasbag mod with Jool, but here is an example of a probe I made that is cruising gently on the SUPER thick atmosphere of Eve at 10 m/s while dropping at a rate of less than 1 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
