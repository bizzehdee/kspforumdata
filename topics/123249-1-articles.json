Once you have that down you should have a good enough understanding to start to bring other elements in. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou may even find that you develop the skills and instead of just going for patched conics, you want to try a full n-body simulation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, if you want patched conics, \u003Ca href=\u0022http://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=19710007291\u0026amp;qs=Ns%3DLoaded-Date%7C0%26N%3D4294795459\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis NASA document\u003C/a\u003E may help you out.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-17T23:06:40Z\u0022 title=\u002210/17/2015 11:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Steel\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Legendary Emu","CreatedById":71911,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-19T21:07:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks a bundle for helping me out, Steel.
