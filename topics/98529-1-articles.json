It\u0027s a refueling station in circular orbit around Kerbin. Command, habitat and science modules allow for up to 14 kerbonauts. My favorite part about it is the color-coded docking ports, so ships can be told to dock in north green, or south red, or west blue, or some other combination of direction and color. This was done before I had the docking port indicator mod, so all the docking was done by hand. Needless to say, I learned a lot about docking, especially how to recover from a misalignment while panicking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/4UZp5\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
