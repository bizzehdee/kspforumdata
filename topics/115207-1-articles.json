At least not when it comes to drag, it works more often than not for re-entry heat.\n\nThe one exception where KSP understands parts being behind each other is when they are assembled as a stack. Which is a pretty common exception, I grant that. Still, KSP doesn\u0027t look any further than the nearest neighbour in the stack. In the picture above, the booster\u0027s drag is modified by the octagonal strut, but not by the nosecone.\n\nAll radially attached parts will always have their full drag. So the sepratrons as pictured will have just the same drag as if they were attached to the side of the booster. Clipping them to mostly sit below the surface won\u0027t help, either."},{"CreatedByName":"steve_v","CreatedById":69272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T00:33:13Z","Content":"Unless of course you use FAR, in which case it\u0027s the actual shape of the resulting rocket that matters.\n\nStock aero takes quite a few shortcuts, as seen in the above explanation."}]}
