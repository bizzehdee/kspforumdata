My battery was at the very top of the orbiters service module (just below the dummy payload) and didn\u0027t suffer any problems. I\u0027ll try moving the SAS up there. Then I\u0027ll try to fix the orbiter modules problem of not packing enough thrust to stabilize the orbit in time to prevent it from becoming a not orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-27T01:22:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESAS works best near the top of the rocket.
