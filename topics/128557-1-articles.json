For me it\u0027s probably the decision to waste all my mono propellant and dock with my space station while flying to minmus to put down a mobile base. I did that because I didn\u0027t have the fuel to get to minmus so I decided to go to the station and waste my mono prop because the station had 1000\u002B of it so I could refuel both fuel and mono propellant.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Commander Zoom","CreatedById":8333,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-25T01:32:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSent out my Jool mission, consisting of three ships and three tankers carrying the return fuel for the one that was coming back... and then two more little rockets with stuff I\u0027d forgotten / thought of only after putting the first three together.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Triop","CreatedById":145841,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-25T04:53:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Ch1\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EWhat is something you did that was last minute ?\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/h1\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGoing to the toilet during a mission ?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Francois424","CreatedById":98138,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-25T11:15:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was testing my Minmus rover like there was no tomorrow.\u00A0 Then noticed I was rolling around 70m/s (small plan wheels) and heading on a 35% slope.\u00A0 I held my finger on \u0022H\u0022 and before you know it I was in Minmus orbit !\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot like I planned it, but I figured, why not.\u00A0\u00A0 I know I have an awesome rover for 1.1... assuming wheels keep the same rigidity vs speed vs suspension.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"luizopiloto","CreatedById":97503,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-25T16:08:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLast minute reaction to counter a malfunction... you know... that bug when cargo bays sometimes stow control surfaces... my spaceplane started to get unstable during reentry, then I realized the left elevon was locked and was not in neutral position.

I was using my highly successful rocket that has just enough DeltaV with very little room for error to go to go there. Seriously. The rocket was meant to be my first Mun rocket with a lot of room for error. This was this rocket\u0027s stretch. This is the farthest it would go, on a good day. It took my landing stage just to get to orbit. So while I was descending into the Atmosphere, I was burning off the last of my fuel with the parachute open. It was working great, until I ran out of fuel. At that point I was sure my Duna mission would surely fail and my Kerbals would be killed to death. I sat and hoped that the chutes would do something magical and slow the velocity to where I could just survive it. I had already kicked up the deployment altitude to it\u0027s max. If you don\u0027t know, chutes may be amazing on other planets, but not Duna. Nope. Duna hates chutes. They\u0027ll get you there, but you better hope you have some powered decent to go along with them chutes, or you won\u0027t be returning to space today. Of course, during building the rocket I took into account everything, except I overlooked one thing. I brought a chute. A single chute. That\u0027s not going to cut it. So I sat that, sure I was going to die. Then I had a stroke of brilliance. Ditch the landing stage! That will reduce the overall mass of the craft that the chute had to pull. There I was, glaring into the velocity meter dropping, \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003Edropping\u003C/span\u003E, \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003Edropping\u003C/span\u003E, \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003Edrop\u003C/span\u003E- \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:72px;\u0022\u003EOH SHI- \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo as it turns out, despite by efforts of ditching the landing stage, the ground would still be very muchbelow me, and it would be even more below me as time passed. Another thing I overlooked. But hey! I survived! Maybe it\u0027s the heatshield that broke my fall. I\u0027m sure it was rough on the Kerbals, they nearly died.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo I got out and planet a good ol\u0027 flag. I only returned to that planet once. But that time everything fell perfectly into plan. Just enough DeltaV, none wasted. The landing sequence has become standard.
