Some of the orbits I want to learn how to do are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Sun-synchronous. I\u0027m not sure if there\u0027s a polar and non-polar sun-synch orbit, but basically it\u0027s an orbit where it passes over the same spot on the ground once a day at noon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Orbit \u0027rotation\u0027. I don\u0027t know what this one is called exactly. Suppose you have a 100km circular orbit at 30\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 inclination that crosses the equator at 0\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0E and 180\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0E and you want to change it to a 100km circular orbit at 30\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 inclination that crosses the equator at 50\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0W and 130\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0E. Basically, you\u0027re \u0027rotating\u0027 the orbit around the planet by 50\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0. How do you set up that orbital maneuver?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Molniya orbit. I might be able to guess how to do one from the wiki article, but I want to know if there\u0027s any special steps needed to convert it to KerbalPhysics\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u017E\u00C2\u00A2. It\u0027s basically a little brother to the geo-synch orbit where it spends most, but not all of it\u0027s orbit above one part of the planet. It\u0027s highly elliptical with a low periapsis to accomplish this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Munar slingshotting/slingshotting in general. I want to be able to do this consistently to get a boost out of the system instead of relying on blind luck. I\u0027ve also seen orbits where when you\u0027re coming in from Kerbol orbit to Duna, and Ike slingshots you into a very nice orbit around the planet without much \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACV spent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Free-return trajectory. It\u0027s what the Apollo missions used. I can get to the Mun without even thinking about it now, but I can\u0027t figure out where/how much to burn to get that nice slingshot back into a Kerbin orbit with a periapsis below 70km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you know how to do these, or could point me towards a tutorial that explains, I\u0027d appreciate it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kimberly","CreatedById":71980,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-12T16:42:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1) Sun-synchronous orbits aren\u0027t possible because the planets have no axial tilt and are perfect spheres. You can make an orbit with the same length as the solar day (6 hours and 50 seconds), but the solar time you pass over a spot will change because of Kerbin\u0027s orbit around the sun. In the real world, the bulge around the equator and axial tilt are used to \u0022correct\u0022 orbits so they stay sun-synchronous.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) I think you need to burn radially or anti-radially...not sure though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Molniya orbits are not useful in KSP because there is no Soviet Russia to pass over. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E If you want continuous coverage of the polar regions, you might as well put three satellites into a perfectly polar orbit, instead of using two satellites per pole in a highly eccentric orbit. If you want coverage of the sub-polar regions, than an equatorial orbit will do just fine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) It takes experience to do this well by eye, but really, it\u0027s a matter of dragging the maneuver nodes around until you get something you like. With practice you\u0027ll need to spend less time fidgeting with them. Keep in mind that even if a slingshot isn\u0027t perfect, you can do a burn near a planet to correct the way it is slingshotting you, which might still mean you profit in delta-V. Use a second maneuver node to predict what this burn should be like.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Use maneuver nodes to plan a burn when you are about 1/4th of an orbit (90 degrees) away from the Moon. Fidget with the node so you don\u0027t crash into the moon, but instead do a pass closeby with a nice little loop before being flung back to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
