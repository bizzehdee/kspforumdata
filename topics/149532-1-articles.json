It was a great place to stargaze, one of Michael\u2019s favorite things to do in the evenings. Sometimes, Grandad Baer came out with him, even though he wasn\u2019t particularly interested. Tonight, Michael was alone and the Moon was high in the sky, giving of its brilliant light for the billions of people on planet Earth to enjoy.

The lights hesitated to turn on, it flickered for a couple seconds, and came on, just barely lighting the whole room.

Dust gathered in every corner and every surface of the room. It was Grandpa\u2019s job to dust the house every few weeks, but he was busy all that month tending to the farm.

Sometimes, he made models off of what he drew. He started off with small things like small solid rocket boosters capable of reaching miles into the air. He actually built most of them, launching them off in the pasture. Some of them came down relatively near the launch site, some of them were never seen again, and some simply just blew up in midair.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0They were all called Hornet rockets. He designed, built, tested, and launched six iterations of the Hornets. The only one he hadn\u2019t launched was the Hornet Mk 7, which was capable of reaching altitudes of up to 9 miles and speeds of up to over 600 miles an hour. He had tested them at a static-test rig at the edge of the pasture. He would bolt the rocket body to the ground so it wouldn\u2019t go anywhere and fired the engine, testing the capabilities of it. So far, he\u2019s only tested a Mk 7 engine, and it burned for nearly a minute.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0He started designing different liquid fuel rocket engines. These ran on fluids like pure alcohol and liquid oxygen, among other things. These ran on hypergolic fuels, which combust when put into contact. Hypergolic fuels use an actual fuel and an oxidizer, which combust together out of the nozzle of an engine.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0The first ones he designed used furfuryl alcohol, or catalytically reduced furfural, as fuel and IRFNA, or Red Fuming Nitric Acid, as oxidizer. They had no need to be ignited and once pumped together, they combust. The combination of furfuryl alcohol and IRFNA were used for early rocketry and just recently for sounding rockets, and both are attainable (but not necessarily easily), so they were the obvious choices to use.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0Michael flipped to the first empty page in his notebook which there wasn\u2019t many of them left. He wasn\u2019t exactly planning to design anything; he was just waiting for his grandparents to go to sleep. They were older people, so they normally fell asleep earlier than most people do, normally about 9 at night. He normally waited about thirty minutes after they both went to bed when he was sure they were fast asleep. He would sneak out of the house to the old barn which was his designated Vehicle Assembly Building. When the newer barn was built just a couple years before, Grandad Baer let Michael use it for whatever he wanted.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0In the old barn were multiple power tools and building equipment, like band saws and belt sanders, that Michael had saved up for years to buy with his own money. Sometimes, Grandad Baer would buy them for Michael for Christmas, his birthday, or whenever he was feeling generous. Most of the time though, Michael had to spend his own money to buy them which he got for working on the farm or selling things from door to door.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0The loud sounds of the power tools probably wouldn\u2019t wake up his grandparents, but just in case they did, Michael saved up for sound-proof padding to be put on the walls and doors of the barn that could be easily put up or taken down. Although his grandparents could probably sleep through a whole entire nuclear war, he took no chances. If he was caught staying up all night, let alone sneaking out of the house after dark, he would never hear the end of it. But his grandparents could never stay mad at him, they made sure to treat him well after his parents\u2019 deaths. Even though those events didn\u2019t effect Michael at any way, he appreciated how his grandparents thought of him like that.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0As he was doodling a nuclear-powered Mars spacecraft, Grandad opened the door. \u201CG\u2019night, Skipper,\u201D he said.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u201CDon\u2019t stay up too much later, okay, Mike?\u201D said his grandma.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0He said goodnight back to them and gave his grandma a hug.

He kept sketching the spacecraft, which to him was coming out quite nicely. He was putting on the finishing touches like windows and radiators when his clock said 9:50. He crept over to his door and opened it just a crack. He stuck his head out and listened; his grandparents\u2019 loud snoring was reverberating around the hall, even when their door was closed.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0He grabbed his notebook, a flashlight, and his sweatshirt with him, because it sometimes gets cold in the old barn. Michael wouldn\u2019t do something like this on a night before school, the school year would be starting later than it normally would due to a dangerous termite problem. The floors, stairs, and the doors in the house made too much noise, so he would be going out the window.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0He didn\u2019t have any rope and the ground was too far down to just jump, it would be a miracle of he didn\u2019t break his legs if he actually tried. The best idea (if there actually was one in a situation like that) was to slide down the lamp post. He grabbed some gloves, too, and put them on.

Light flooded the room. He pushed himself over the ledge and closed the window behind him, like he did all summer. He pushed off of the ledge, twisted around in midair, and grabbed onto the pole. The friction in his gloves made his fall slow, but still fast enough to hurt a little on the impact with the ground.

From there, he clicked on the flashlight. It didn\u2019t light up right away, but after giving it a few good whacks on his palm, the light flickered on. It wasn\u2019t very bright, but it lit up the front of the old barn.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0It was mostly brown except for the parts where the paint was peeling off. One of its large main doors was ajar, but not much. The two smaller doors next to it, the ones Michael used to enter and exit, were closed. The tin sign on the small doors saying \u2018\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u2019 in painted letters reflected back the light. Its high-sloping roofs were missing a few shingles. Several crooked pipes were sticking out of the roof, used for steam-powered heaters when it was being use. In the winters, Michael used them sometimes.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0The flattened hay crunched underneath his feet. When he lived with his parents when he was younger, being outside at night frightened him, it made him feel like someone was watching him. In his grandparents\u2019 town and especially in the farm areas, crime was low, so he had nothing to be afraid of there. He reached the old barn and slid open the old metal door, trying to make the least amount of noise as possible.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0He reached around the corner with his gloved hands and flicked on the old switch. This time, the light came on with ease. Small lights hanging from the ceiling all down the barn lit up the whole entire building. He used the small portion of the right side of the building to build the Hornets. The roof on that part was much lower than the rest of the building (except the left side that was exactly the same); it was used for stables when the barn was actually being used. He would use the larger middle part of the barn for much larger projects.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0Smaller lights on support posts used to separate from the middle portion lit up the right area as well. On a long table sat his latest project, the Hornet Mk 7. All it was at the moment was a long 7-foot tube. Bits of metal, screws, a drill, and a propane welding torch sat on the table alongside it. He still had a lot to build on it.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0Left to the table was a band saw. It helped him cut wooden fins and nosecones for earlier Hornet models, but after the Mk 5 he switched to aluminum as his main building material rather than hard cardboard tubes and balsa wood. Now he used a saber saw and sometimes a torch to cut the aluminum parts.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0Next to the band saw was the belt sander. He didn\u2019t use it much either, but only for fine-tuning and putting the finishing touches on parts newly-cut aluminum parts. He used it to trim off jagged metal on the edges of fins and to cut down on any lopsided parts of nosecones. Next to it was a much older, rusty belt sander that finally broke down about four months prior.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0Again, next to the broken belt sander was the welding table. He gotten it as a birthday present. He waited to start building the Mk 6s (the first rockets he used made of aluminum) until he got the table, which he specifically asked for after finishing the Mk 5s. He used it to weld different parts together like the fins, engine mounts, and launch lugs. Although he wasn\u2019t very good at it and sometimes needed Grandad Baer\u2019s assistance, he did it mostly himself.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0The last piece of machinery in the barn lied next to the welding table. It was a hydraulic metal shaping machine. He used it to bend the aluminum sheets into many different shapes like nosecones. It could bend the metal sheets into 90 degree angles, cones, and cylinders; in fact, Michael used it to create the body tubes for the Mk 6s and 7s. He came close a couple times to crushing his fingers, but he didn\u2019t tell Grandad that.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0On the far wall were all the past rockets he had built from the Mk 1 to the Mk 6. They all ran on solid fuel motors. Several of them were charred, twisted, and bent. Some of their paint was peeling off. The Mk 4 on display was actually a remake of the original one, which had exploded in a large fireball midair, which caused Michael to have to go through some trouble with the FAA. He got it all sorted out, though, and he could launch the Hornets again after about a month.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0The farthest to the left was the dinky little Mk 1. It was only about 3 feet in height and 2.5 inches in diameter. The bottom of its fins were charred from engine fire. The tip of its nosecone was slightly chipped and bent from lawn-darting into the ground after a slight parachute failure. Luckily, it was just a test flight and no cameras were onboard, which sat in the camera platform just below the nosecone. Its top altitude was 1.4 miles during the same test flight.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0Next to it was the slightly larger Mk 2. It was two feet taller and carried a much bigger engine. Because of its much larger weight compared to the Mk 1, its diameter was 3 inches to accommodate a much wider parachute. Like the Mk 1, not all of its flights were perfect. It had an 80 percent success rate out of its 5 flights. It too had a camera platform. Because of its increased burn time from its nearly 3-foot-tall engine, insulation had to be put in around the engine platform. Its top altitude was 2.8 miles.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0Then there was the Mk 3. It was the first Hornet iteration to use side boosters. Its main stage was a Hornet Mk 2 and its boosters were Mk 1-sized tubes with no nosecones, it did create a bit of atmospheric drag, but it was needed for effective staging. It staged by black powder destroying the top support struts by simply just blowing up. After that, the bottom support struts would just slip away and the boosters would fall back to Earth without parachutes. Its top altitude was 5.2 miles.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0The Mk 4 was the most troublesome of the Hornet rockets. It had the highest failure rate of 60 percent in just 5 flights. It was a two stage rocket with no boosters. The bottom stage was similar to the Mk 2 and the second stage was derived from the Mk 1. Both stages had parachutes to safely bring them back down to Earth to be reused. He had learned his lesson on using parachutes on whatever he planned to fall back to Earth after one of the boosters from the Mk 3 nearly fell on someone\u2019s house. Another got picked up by a hard breeze and thrown onto the roof of a drug store, threatening the structural integrity of its roof. Its highest altitude was 5.3 miles.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12pt;line-height:115%;\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0The Mk 5 was the last one to be made from cardboard and wood. It was a Mk 3 derived rocket but with 4 boosters. These boosters had parachutes and nosecones on them so they could land safely and be reused. On one flight, 3 of the boosters separated prematurely sending the rocket into a spin and creating a spiral of smoke in midair.

The Mk 7 engines were completely remade to be much lighter. The normally PVC exterior of the engine was replaced by a more lightweight but stronger plastic, capable of experiencing intense heat without melting.

Like the Mk 1, not all of its flights were perfect. It had an 80 percent success rate out of its 5 flights. It too had a camera platform.

It was the first Hornet iteration to use side boosters. Its main stage was a Hornet Mk 2 and its boosters were Mk 1-sized tubes with no nosecones, it did create a bit of atmospheric drag, but it was needed for effective staging. It staged by black powder destroying the top support struts by simply just blowing up. After that, the bottom support struts would just slip away and the boosters would fall back to Earth without parachutes.

It had the highest failure rate of 60 percent in just 5 flights. It was a two stage rocket with no boosters. The bottom stage was similar to the Mk 2 and the second stage was derived from the Mk 1. Both stages had parachutes to safely bring them back down to Earth to be reused. He had learned his lesson on using parachutes on whatever he planned to fall back to Earth after one of the boosters from the Mk 3 nearly fell on someone\u2019s house.
