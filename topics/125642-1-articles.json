And there\u0026#39;s no way to turn them off; they\u0026#39;re a constant power drain, like a probe core except thirstier.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe folding panels draw power, too, except that there the player has control: when you retract the panels, they stop working [I]and[/I] they stop drawing power. But there\u0026#39;s no similar option with the static panels.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0026#39;d love to have a way to turn the static panels on/off (i.e. give them a right-click \u0022toggle\u0022 button, which you can put in action groups).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n(Alternatively, they could be tweaked so that their power consumption is tied to the amount of active radiating that they actually do: i.e. when nothing\u0026#39;s hot and there\u0026#39;s nothing to radiate, they don\u0026#39;t take electricity. But I kinda prefer the toggle option myself.)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThoughts?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[HR][/HR]\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso: Would love to know how moddable this is. I tried looking at the part config for a folding radiator versus a static one. Here\u0026#39;s what I found:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[LIST]\u003Cbr\u003E\n[*]All radiators (static and folding) have a [B]ModuleActiveRadiator[/B] that specifies the behavior, including the amount of electricity it draws. But there doesn\u0026#39;t appear to be any property that specifies any way to turn it on or off.\u003Cbr\u003E\n[*]The folding radiators (but not the static one) have a [B]ModuleDeployableRadiator[/B] that just has the folding-related info in it.\u003Cbr\u003E\n[/LIST]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI note that the active radiators have actions available: \u0022Extend Radiator,\u0022 \u0022Retract Radiator\u0022; plus \u0022Toggle Radiator\u0022 in the action-group UI. Those strings don\u0026#39;t show up anywhere in the config files. So my hypothesis is that ModuleDeployableRadiator is hard-coded to behave that way, and influences the behavior of ModuleActiveRadiator? Are there any flags that would allow me to alter ModuleActiveRadiator to make it toggle-able? Or, alternatively, any flags on ModuleDeployableRadiator so that I could apply it to the static panels with different language (e.g. \u0022activate\u0022 rather than \u0022extend\u0022)? Or is this all very hard-coded and there\u0026#39;s nowhere to get a toehold?\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-16T18:26:41Z\u0022 title=\u002211/16/2015 06:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Snark\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-16T18:35:33Z","Content":"\nSomething is always hot.
