LiquidFuel (which I assume is kerosene) - LiquidOxygen is middle-tier fuel, best for first stages and boosters as it provides maximum thrust at expence of Isp. But both LiquidH2 and LiquidOxygen are not useable in propulsion for the probes and vessels since they boil-off over time, while LiquidFuel/Oxidizer don\u0027t.

They can also be partially filled or left empty (I think). There is also an option to auto-fill with whatever the attached engine needs. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA big addition is the way LH2 works, it is NOT that efficient volume-wise (quite high consumption), but VERY efficient weight-wise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - you must take this into account when building rockets as you will much more in the way of tankage when using LH2 but, counter-intuitively, the weight penalty will be lower.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis matches real life as LH2 is technically a great fuel but you run into problems with the size of useful fuel tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis gives the realistic effect in-game of using \u0022LiquidFuel\u0022 for most conventional purposes, but LH2 comes into its own for long cruise phases where the volume penalty isn\u0027t so bad and the weight advantage is very useful. Hydrocarbon (kerosene) based \u0022LiquidFuel\u0022 would also have a greater thrust (especially in-atmosphere) due to the higher mass-flow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E --------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen adding to missioncontroller I think you might want to consider the following:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELiquidfuel and oxidiser can be kept stock, so that is nice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen pricing LH2 take into account:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E It is very light.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E It is generally consumed quite fast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Gives a high Isp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo folks are going to need to take a large volume of LH2 but probably not as much mass of it (as compared to LiquidFuel).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELO2 is straight-up a better oxidiser than \u0022oxidiser\u0022 so should be priced accordingly \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - you can build a high-thrust, low consumption rocket using LiquidFuel and LO2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - or you can build a very efficient LO2/LH2 rocket \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E (that will need a lot of LH2 but not much in the way of LO2)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think LO2 is going to be the \u0022golden fuel\u0022 here so should be quite expensive - \u0022How much LO2 can I afford for this mission\u0022 should be what Im made to think about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENuclear engines come bundled with \u0022nuclearfuel\u0022 so their price can probably stay as-is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E ---------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETL:DR\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt adds 3 new fuels: LO2, LH2 and \u0022nuclearfuel\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022nuclearfuel\u0022 can probably be largely ignored.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELH2 - bulky but light.
