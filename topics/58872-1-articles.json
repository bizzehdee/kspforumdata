Are you using multiple rotors? Are you centering the center of thrust to your CoM? Are your firespitter blades pointing in the correct direction? Some firespitter rotors have arrows that need to be pointing forward and some tail rotors need to be facing left or pointing down. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is not on the realistic side, but try adding reaction wheels for better controllability. The SAS is pretty good at compensating for small deviations in CoT/CoM placement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe show some pictures, that could help a little more.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Biker Joe","CreatedById":82495,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-07T11:59:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes by multirotor I mean multiple rotors, like quadcopters and such but my designs never work, I tried adding some reaction wheels but no good, maybe I have to go over my designs more, I didn\u0027t pos any pictures cos they don\u0027t work!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
