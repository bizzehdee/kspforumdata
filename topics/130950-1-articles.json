So why not use them for trajectory calculations? You can upgrade one of the buildings that allow for trajectory calculations if a scientist is in there. The higher the level the more accurate,\u00A0efficient and optional trajectories that you will get. Also a higher level means faster results (or having more than one). Scientist can only work out trajectories for places that you have already explored; meaning you still have to have fun exploring.

During a re-entry, when out of range of a commsat, or when they second-long delay becomes a problem, the only way to control probes would be via manuever nodes. You plot a maneuver node, and the probe does it automatically. But you can only do manuever nodes. Maybe a suicide-burn button for landings, but that\u0027s it. Otherwise you control with lightspeed delay (actually 1/10 lightspeed due to the small scale solar system). The comms delay could be toggled in game settings when starting a new save game, so you don\u0027t\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ehave\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0to deal with it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s where pilots come in. They don\u0027t have a control blackout when re-entering, when behind the Mun, or when out at Eeloo. They also have no control delay. A Spacecraft with a trained pilot can fly the ship anywhere with no regard to pre-planning. Plus landings are a lot easier when you have more control. Pilots can also act as a tracking station for probes, extending their range (in the Jool system if you have probes, you have to wait several minutes for a control input to be taken, but if you have a mothership at Laythe and a probe at Bop you will only have a few seconds of delay) and controlling them remotely. (This mechanic is already going to be implemented in 1.1, just without the control delay mechanic. The important part is control delay.) That is how to truly make Kerbal pilots much better than probes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Armisael","CreatedById":152425,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-30T17:58:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222386383\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022130950\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221454173422\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002270807\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022regex\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n52 minutes ago, regex said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes anyone know how NASA or ESA or POCKOCMOC trains their astronauts? \u00A0Are there\u00A0clear divisions like these or does everyone learn how to do everything? \u00A0I would think that space is not the kind of environment where one divvies up the training so clearly; if something goes wrong you would want anyone to be able to save the mission. \u00A0If there are any specialties I would imagine they would be between non-essential tasks like what kind of experiments are run during the mission, not between vital tasks like performing repairs or piloting a spacecraft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/postsecondary/features/F_Astronaut_Requirements.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ENASA has three classes: Commander and Pilot, Mission Specialist, and Payload specialist.\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Andem","CreatedById":155578,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-31T00:35:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222386383\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022130950\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221454173422\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002270807\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022regex\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n7 hours ago, regex said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes anyone know how NASA or ESA or POCKOCMOC trains their astronauts? \u00A0Are there\u00A0clear divisions like these or does everyone learn how to do everything? \u00A0I would think that space is not the kind of environment where one divvies up the training so clearly; if something goes wrong you would want anyone to be able to save the mission. \u00A0If there are any specialties I would imagine they would be between non-essential tasks like what kind of experiments are run during the mission, not between vital tasks like performing repairs or piloting a spacecraft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbal classes just smack of a feature waiting for an actual use. \u00A0Right now they sideline a lot of early game work and experience.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTypically people have two specialties, e.g., Engineer/Botonist, Commander/Geologist, Doctor/EVA Expert, Chemist/Physicist, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AbacusWizard","CreatedById":116476,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-31T11:57:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222386907\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022130950\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221454200554\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022155578\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Andem\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n11 hours ago, Andem said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTypically people have two specialties, e.g., Engineer/Botonist, Commander/Geologist, Doctor/EVA Expert, Chemist/Physicist, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThose specific pairings sound awfully familiar.
