(Not sure if you need an antenna or not for this..) After that, you always have access to the data (map overlay). I believe you actually get some science from this too. So once you run a scan, you don\u0027t need the scanner anymore.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe narrow-band scanner is different, that one needs to be in orbit to function.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the M700 Survey Scanner, I usually attach it to a docking port. Once the scan has completed, I jettison (undock) the scanner and let it float away. Saves a little weight, but honestly the device is quite large and makes my vessels look goofy, which is the real reason I get rid of it as soon as I can.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"manek22","CreatedById":99501,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-05T05:45:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks guys.
