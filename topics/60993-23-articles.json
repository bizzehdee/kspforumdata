Oh, and I think a good placeholder IVA would be porkjet\u0027s TMA-1 Orbital Orb. It has a very similar design. Oh, and for the Lima, that\u0027s very awesome. But just a tip, try to make a different coloured onion/lemon to go with it. And maybe add some long antennae to place instead of solar panels like with the Soyuz 7K-T series. And maybe make a set of Probe/Drogue style docking ports, and if its possible make it so that only the male and female ports can dock with each other, and not the same with each other. This mod is looking very good Orion. When it comes to stock-alike, you are the best, and the fact that you are just a beginner amazes me with the skill you\u0027ve picked up. This is one of my favorite mods. Thanks for the work that you\u0027ve put in so we all can enjoy moar parts to lob kerbals into space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I just remembered! You should make launch clamps like the ones that they have at Baikonour! That would top the Soyuz! Perfect!
