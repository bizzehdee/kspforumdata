It will help you understand my predicament and what I\\\u0027m trying to achieve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth are the same situation, just different angled screenshots.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the first image you\\\u0027ll see a small triangle formed by the 3 orbital displays.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 form a 4 quadrant grid with a polar and equatorial orbit (the gray ones)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe third one, the active and blue orbit, is the one I\\\u0027m trying to correct. It should be on a 45\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003E orbit, maybe a little off with my experimental corrections from earlier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimply put, I want it\\\u0027s orbit to meet/cross-over at the same point the other two meet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know I need to burn directly perpendicular to my velocity, and at a point that causes a sort-of teer-totter effect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI put an arrow to the point I believe I need to burn at (correct me if I\\\u0027m wrong).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy thought is that I want to burn south, but it should also be perpendicular to Kerbin, correct?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo when I point my craft at 180\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003E (south), is that perpendicular to Kerbin at the given location I wish to burn at?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr do I need to adjust my inclination to about 45\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003E to make myself perpendicular to Kerbin?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs an after-thought, couldn\\\u0027t I just point my ship directly between the Apo/Peri markers and that would put my ship perpendicular, no?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-05T04:38:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027m just gonna go with a hench here and say you need to burn East (090) on the exact opposite side of the planet from the first screenshot, at the intersection point of the orbits on the reverse side of the planet. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to \u0027between\u0027 Ap and Pe, be careful; you\\\u0027re dealing with three dimensions, not two... so there\\\u0027re two possible interpretations for \u0027between\u0027 Ap and Pe. One is facing towards and away from Kerbin, and the other is between them on the horizon of the navball. The latter is what you want, but it will probably prove difficult to attain an exact middle.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tarmenius","CreatedById":16990,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-05T05:48:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ydoow\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Ydoow\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy thought is that I want to burn south, but it should also be perpendicular to Kerbin, correct?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo when I point my craft at 180\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003E (south), is that perpendicular to Kerbin at the given location I wish to burn at?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think you\\\u0027ve pretty much got it right already, though I would add that when you point 180\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003E (at the loaction your arrow indicates) it should also be level with the aritficial horizon in the Navball.
