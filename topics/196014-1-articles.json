Even if you allow for it to be regenerated, it\u0027s one more resource to keep track of, and losing a ship due to some life support problem seems like the most anticlimactic thing ever. I don\u0027t strictly oppose it, but I don\u0027t think it\u0027s necessary and it doesn\u0027t add to the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nColonies only make sense if they grow. So population being a factor makes sense. Yes, not strictly necessary, as you can make colony growth be purely industrial, but I think it actually adds something to a career-style game. Colonies you\u0027ve established early on have time to grow and become more prominent. And that\u0027s a good way to mark progression through the game. It\u0027s rewarding, and therefore, a good mechanic. Again, just because a mechanic is good doesn\u0027t mean it has to be in any particular game, but it\u0027s worth discussing at very least.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd if we\u0027re saying that population growth is a factor, then there need to be rules for it. Like I said, the simplest thing is to simply have exponential growth and have population increase until you hit the limit afforded by amount of habitat space built. It\u0027s simple, it requires no special planning beyond hab space, and it gets the job done.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen I suggest the second option with complex dynamics, I by no means want to see it turned into Sims. There\u0027s reason I brought up Dwarf Fortress, where player has rather minimal impact on these things. And in a game like KSP, I would suggest having no impact at all. It\u0027s just a mechanic that happens in the background. Since you have the data, it could be fun to add little text descriptions for individuals and what they\u0027ve been up to, but this would have no gameplay impact. The way such a simulation does impact gameplay is that it lets you introduce some additional parameters beyond just hab space that influence base growth and also requires a larger initial population, which means you can\u0027t start a colony by just bringing a couple of kerbals on a rocket and waiting long enough in time warp. You\u0027d have to actually organize at least a few colony ship flights, possibly through some automation system similar to the cargo routes that have been mentioned.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd yes, there are ways to get that second effect through just coming up with a pop growth formula with enough tuning parameters. But a simple rules-based simulation is a much more fun to achieve some complex behaviors without having to write anything complex and fits the theme of the game better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll in all, this is all about you building a base the way you want, while still having a sense of progression, as the population grows and you can expand your base. Whether mechanics for growth are very simple or very complex, the level of interaction is still about placing buildings and delivering resources necessary to do so, which is what KSP2 gameplay seems to be all about.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith all of the above said, absolutely, sandbox should still be a thing, and even if there is population growth mechanic that limits colony growth in career-style game, in sand box, that shouldn\u0027t be a factor. You should simply be allowed to place whatever modules you want for your bases and that\u0027s that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pandaman","CreatedById":130621,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-03T15:20:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPresumably, as there are male and female kerbals, some form of \u0027interaction\u0027 between them would be required for population growth, as is the case with most life on Earth.\u00A0 So it would seem sensible for it\u00A0to be linked in some way to the\u00A0proportions of each gender\u00A0and\u00A0overall population level\u00A0without any need to consider the actual \u0027method\u0027 (beyond forum users\u0027 curiosity of course).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-08-03T16:43:05Z\u0022 title=\u002208/03/2020 04:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 3, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by pandaman\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-03T16:39:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis looked like a bad joke at first but since serious discussion arose there\u0027s no reason not to feed it ^^\u003Cbr\u003E\nA multi-part response:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA: The best headcanon I\u0027ve heard so far regarding Kerbal reproductive biology is, as mentioned above, based on spores. The green mat covering most of Kerbin\u0027s land is not in fact very short grass or moss but the stage in which Kerbalkind spends most of its time. In order to spread, it releases fruiting bodies that, over the eons, have become increasingly sophisticated to the point where they became mobile and intelligent. Like any fruiting body, they have a primordial calling to spread as far as possible from the source organism to ensure a maximum rate of spread and plenty of room for new growth. Thus every Kerbal feels a deep instinctive desire to, before its life is over, travel as far from home as it can, or failing that ensure another Kerbal\u0027s safe journey - hence Kerbalkind\u0027s enthusiasm for space travel even when great risks arise. When a Kerbal does die, it explodes, releasing a puff of brownish dust that contains spores that can grow into more green mat and eventually lead to the birth of more Kerbals. Existing as part of the green mat for most of their lives also explains how Kerbals seem to regularly spring up out of nowhere despite scant sign of any civilization on Kerbin\u0027s surface.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI may have embellished this unconsciously xP\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nB: If Kerbals do reproduce sexually, I\u0027m about 99% sure it\u0027s by facing each other, them both doing a silly looking dance and turning around, and then one of them squatting and poofing a giant egg that after a few seconds hatches into a miniature Kerbal with a disproportionately large head and pair of eyeballs. \u003Cem\u003EYes I\u0027m calling you out, EA/Maxis\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nC: I thought it\u0027d freak me out or that I\u0027d object due to being attached to the idea of Kerbals having lidless or chameleon-like eyes, but no, actually I think the eye lids make the Kerbals significantly cuter and more expressive.
