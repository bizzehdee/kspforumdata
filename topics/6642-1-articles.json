As soon as I tip it over from vertical, the thing goes into an insane head over heels tumbling. No (reasonable) amount of RCS thrusters can keep it under control. I end up either throttling down and fighting it out, or ditching the offending stage before it\\\u0027s depleted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I ask you, rocket scientists. What causes this, and how do I avoid it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs it a weight distribution thing? (i.e. - lots of empty tanks on top) Is it a matter of speed? (i.e. - velocity, momentum, all that good stuff) Or am I just a terrible pilot?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kosmo-not","CreatedById":14082,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-02-14T02:29:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPut some vectored thrust LFEs on it.

Heavily weight-biased towards the bottom, virtually no weight in the middle, and somewhat heavy again at the top. When turned horizontal (that is, perpendicular to gravity), the bottom section of this bowling pin carries more kinetic energy, causing the structure to begin a tumble in that direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProposed solution:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA fuel distribution system that draws fuel at an equal rate from both the top at the bottom and delivers it to the vehicle\\\u0027s center of gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[EDIT] - Actually, since you\\\u0027ll be pumping fuel from the bottom towards the center (to the distribution manifold) \u003Cstrong\u003Eand\u003C/strong\u003E from the center towards the bottom (to the engine), you\\\u0027ll need to pump fuel from the bottom even faster.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kosmo-not","CreatedById":14082,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-02-14T03:39:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECould you post your craft file here?
