panels is going to have a preferred orientation.\u00A0 Large stations may not be able to turn well, or would tear themselves apart if they tried.\u00A0 If you are docking with something unpowered (such as that solar station that you forgot to return\u00A0to the correct orientation, or to which you are delivering a battery pack because the demand was greater than the power supply), then it
