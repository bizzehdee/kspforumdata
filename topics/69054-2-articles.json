The part loads properly (0.24 win), and I can place it with no ill effects. I do not have a button which allows me to access a GUI. Do I have to to create .cfg files for every size I want, or is something just keeping the GUI button from being shown? Also, when I downloaded the package, there is a Kotysoft folder which contains folder structure, but is empty, maybe it shouldn\u0027t be?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is the full log: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B51D0goiPm7JUG9RNTNLQlFrNkE/edit?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0B51D0goiPm7JUG9RNTNLQlFrNkE/edit?usp=sharing\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are lines that seem relevant:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E[ERR 19:22:57.321] AssemblyLoader: Exception loading \u0027NRAP\u0027: System.Reflection.ReflectionTypeLoadException: The classes in the module cannot be loaded.\u003Cbr\u003E  at (wrapper managed-to-native) System.Reflection.Assembly:GetTypes (bool)\u003Cbr\u003E  at System.Reflection.Assembly.GetTypes () [0x00000] in \u0026lt;filename unknown\u0026gt;:0 \u003Cbr\u003E  at AssemblyLoader.LoadAssemblies () [0x00000] in \u0026lt;filename unknown\u0026gt;:0 \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAdditional information about this exception:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E System.TypeLoadException: Could not load type \u0027IPartCostModifier\u0027 from assembly \u0027Assembly-CSharp, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null\u0027.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E System.TypeLoadException: Could not load type \u0027\u0026lt;\u0026gt;c__DisplayClassf\u0027 from assembly \u0027NRAP, Version=1.5.5324.40306, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null\u0027.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is the Mod list:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E  000_Toolbar\u003Cbr\u003E  AIES_Aerospace\u003Cbr\u003E  DRE\u003Cbr\u003E  FASA\u003Cbr\u003E  GameData\u003Cbr\u003E  JSI\u003Cbr\u003E  KER\u003Cbr\u003E  KWRocketry\u003Cbr\u003E  MagicSmokeIndustries\u003Cbr\u003E  NEAR\u003Cbr\u003E  NearFutureConstruction\u003Cbr\u003E  NearFutureSpacecraft\u003Cbr\u003E  NovaPunchEngines\u003Cbr\u003E  NRAP\u003Cbr\u003E  Procedural Parts\u002BFairings\u003Cbr\u003E  SCANsatRPM\u003Cbr\u003E  TAC\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-01T00:02:41Z\u0022 title=\u002208/01/2014 12:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 1, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by saabstory88\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
