When I write a chapter in Emiko Station, I usually start it with a small quote from a song or classic novel...

The text is in Arial, but I do the quote using Comic Sans MS.\u003Cfont face=\u0022Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\u0022\u003E However... I chimed in from my phone the other day, and I noticed the quote is in a much fancier font... some sort of pretty cursive. While I don\u0027t have a problem with this, it\u0027s got me wondering... why would the font be different? Is it my phone?
