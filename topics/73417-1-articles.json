Really, if you could use the docking port for Phase 3, that would help (since you allow claw with penalty in phase 2).

So if I\u0027m going to do a stock challenge, I have to capture and return a satellite basically without ever attaching it to my craft (well, I suppose I can take the claw penalty on return). But then I have to transfer it to another craft, without attaching to it, and launch it again?\u003Cp\u003ESure, I\u0027ve done the first part repeatedly (capture and return without a claw or docking port). But if you\u0027re going for \u0022realism,\u0022 I\u0027d say it\u0027s pretty unrealistic to think that people aren\u0027t going to attach said satellite to the new craft, but it must dangle on whatever surface you set it on. Sure, I get why you wouldn\u0027t crush onto a new satellite with a claw like device (not that I have many choices with stock). But why can\u0027t you use a docking port as a decoupler substitute? I\u0027m pretty sure \u0022real world\u0022 reuse wouldn\u0027t be restricted from bolting it onto the new craft. I somehow doubt people would be happy with letting a billion dollar satellite free float inside some sort of cage. Plus you have to get pretty creative in stock to lift stuff to begin with, since there are no hinges or that sort of thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd while you can capture pretty easy in stock, the problem if you don\u0027t allow a connection is that it takes for freaking ever to get somewhere because when you time warp they separate. So you\u0027re stuck with the option of no time warp and literally waiting the half hour, or time warp and do the whole capture operation again (which is a real bear on the night side). Nor can I warp during the relaunch. I know Kasuha suggested this, but it\u0027s a god awful pain when you can only time warp 10-15 minutes at a time, then you have to course correct so the two craft don\u0027t get multiple km apart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo part clipping?

Because in real world, it is not considered safe to transport a satellite without fixing it before applying acceleration to it. Yet in this challenge, OP prohibits any stock ways of fixing a satellite (docking and Claw). But you are free to fix it with a mod part which essentially does the same thing. Makes sense? Nope. Not in realism sense, not in game mechanic sense, it\u0027s just arbitrary rule imposed on the challenge because OP does not like the Claw.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. You may NOT use any clampotrons of any size.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course I have no problems deorbiting and reorbiting a satellite without physically tying it with a ship.
