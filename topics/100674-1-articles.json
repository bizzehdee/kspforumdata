It\u0027s really annoying to have to try to remember all their titles byor quit your flight, visit the staff building, view the title, and then re-control the craft just to find the kerbal with the desired position to perform a job specific action. I have a space station with over 20 kerbals and it\u0027s a chore to try to find an engineer whenever something like a solar panel accidentally breaks. Please add this to the game it would save a lot of headaches and just plain makes sense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust make it so the little kerbal IVA window in the lower right would say like:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Jebediah Kerman\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0022Pilot\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T03:41:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think you can get your Kerbals job title from the map view.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit : yeah, I just fired the game up for the first time in weeks just to confirm.
