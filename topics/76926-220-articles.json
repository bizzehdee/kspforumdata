The simplest solution seems to be reinstating the ability to fire a gun via the right click menu (which I believe would also provide the ability to bind it to an action group) as I think used to be the case in earlier versions of BDA. It may not get used very often, but it still has its place even if we ignore the KOS thing for a moment: if a craft only has a few different weapons, then sometimes assigning them individually to action groups is going to be quicker/more convenient than cycling through them. From that point of view, the KOS compatability that also comes from this solution is a bonus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternatively, a fire button for a selected gun (to complement the one for missiles) in the weapon manager would also work for KOS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf KOS were able to provide a generic keypress input (as mused by Steven), that would also be a workaround. But it\u0027s not ideal, because then the KOS program needs to know which button the user has assigned as fire (or the user has to edit the KOS script). Plus, the keypress event would have to go to the correct vessel... ie, the one the KOS CPU is running on. I don\u0027t think it would by default, since the keypress will almost certainly be sent to the active (focused) vessel by KSP. But then that would defeat the purpose of the solution, ie, providing the ability for non-focused, KOS controlled craft to fire their BDA weapons.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-12T17:51:26Z\u0022 title=\u002209/12/2015 05:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by allmhuran\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BahamutoD","CreatedById":72433,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-12T18:13:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eallmhuran\u003C/strong\u003E, unfortunately, it was never the case that guns had action groups or right-click menu buttons for firing.
