As a rule, aerodynamic losses are vastly overestimated by almost every player, perhaps partly in thanks to the extremely visible mach and shock heating effects KSP features. If my ship is on fire going up, they reason, the game must be telling me that I\u0027m doing it wrong. But that is not so. On a normal gravity turn launch, about 70% of your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E goes towards orbital velocity, about 26% goes to gravity, about 3% goes towards aerodynamic losses, and the last missing percent goes towards too much manual steering.

efficient vertical ascent is when you\u0027re climbing at terminal velocity.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0 In other words, you want your rocket to be climbing at the same speed

was an \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003EOLD-aero\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E thing, and stopped being true when we went to the new aero.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nActually, that\u0027s not the case.\u00A0 \u0022Climb at terminal velocity\u0022 was true before 1.0, and is still true post-1.0.\u00A0 The change to aerodynamic drag calculation didn\u0027t affect that fundamental principle.\u00A0 What it changed was, \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ejust what IS the terminal velocity\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 Used to be that it was a simple number based on altitude, regardless of ship design-- and it was really low, so you needed to care about it a lot.\u00A0 (Terminal velocity at Kerbin sea level was only around 100 m/s.)\u00A0 Now it depends on the size and shape of your rocket, and in general tends to be a lot higher than it was-- especially if you have a rocket that\u0027s reasonably streamlined.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd the terminal velocity gets higher in a hurry as the atmosphere gets thinner.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat this means, in practical terms, is that unless you have an insanely high \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E or a very ungainly/draggy rocket design, your rocket never \u0022catches up\u0022 to its terminal velocity-- it simply doesn\u0027t have the oomph.\u00A0 There\u0027s a good chance that a well-designed rocket already has a terminal velocity of 200 m/s or more, just sitting on the launch pad; and by the time it has accelerated to 200 m/s, it\u0027s at an altitude where the terminal velocity is already considerably higher than 200 m/s, and so forth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn other words:\u00A0 your rocket is always moving slower than terminal velocity, which means it\u0027s always better to be going faster than you are, which means burn full-throttle right off the pad and keep it that way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-18T17:00:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs above ^^\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGoing as

exceeding terminal velocity may be more of a practical concern.\u00A0 Terminal velocity is considerably lower than on Kerbin (yes, the gravity\u0027s 70% more, but the atmosphere is \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Efive times\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E thicker), and you have to climb vertically for a \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ereally long way\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E before you

during the first 15 km or so of your ascent.\u00A0 If your ship\u0027s local \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E is 2 during a vertical ascent, then it will

Goddard problem thread from \u003Cem\u003Ewaaaay\u003C/em\u003E back in the day. Posted by Doc Evo, as I recall. That was fun... though I always preferred the drag races (i.e, minimum time to a specified altitude). Somewhat counterintuitively, with those, you \u003Cem\u003Edid\u003C/em\u003E want long coast times simply because it let you get a higher \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E earlier -- and an extra m/s a second after launch is worth a lot more than an extra m/s a second before you cross the altitude marker.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMight be interesting to resurrect that, adjusted for KSP\u0027s new atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Padishar","CreatedById":97386,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-19T08:14:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222856266\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022152201\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221479540468\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u00222982\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022foamyesque\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n22 minutes ago, foamyesque said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMight be interesting to resurrect that, adjusted for KSP\u0027s new atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBack in the day, you got a higher altitude from a pod and hammer if you turned the thrust limiter down. \u00A0This is no longer the case, it really is quite difficult now to go fast enough for the drag to make a difference. \u00A0Aerodynamic stability is the main problem with going fast now, e.g. the vessel in the Goddard thread I linked above will flip once the engine burns out if you launch at full throttle and the extra drag will kill the altitude, but throttling down before mach 1 and keeping the throttle low until you get above 10k before flooring it again will get you out of the atmosphere now where it was\u00A0very hard to get above 62k back in KSP 1.0.4.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdding a bit more payload mass, e.g. a few extra stack batteries, should reduce the altitude it gets to and may make it less flip happy. \u00A0But this may also result in full throttle getting a higher altitude so it may need more drag to keep it interesting...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"foamyesque","CreatedById":2982,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-19T08:23:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222856275\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022152201\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221479543254\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002297386\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Padishar\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nJust now, Padishar said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBack in the day, you got a higher altitude from a pod and hammer if you turned the thrust limiter down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou and I have different ideas of \u0022back in the day\u0022, I think. :v\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/USku9Yt.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022USku9Yt.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
