It will write out its broken idea of what\u0027s in the vessel and then it\u0027s stuck that way. Instead force KSP to quit without saving to the persistence file You do this by NOT using the menus to exit. Don\u0027t quit nicely or it might save as you back out to the space center and then to the main menu. Instead do a forced hard quit externally (i.e. using the Task Manager in Windows or a \u0022kill -9\u0022 in Linux or Mac.) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESECOND: Just get rid of the entire memory context of the vessel in the save file.\\\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis will have the effect of making the vessel \u0022forget\u0022 all its variables, although it will still have all the files on its hard drive. But in so doing it will also avoid the bug that\u0027s been preventing the ship from loading properly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s how: In your persistence save file there is a section for the vessel that has the KOS part on it.

Preloading, as it were. That seems a lot nicer when playing (I can not count the times I typed\u003Cem\u003E copy prog from 0.\u003C/em\u003E ... \u003Cem\u003Erun prog.\u003C/em\u003E) and it is also realistic. A craft that shuts down due to an error or some other unforeseen circumstance should really try to run its software, possible extend antennas and phone home. Now, when you reboot, you are just dead in the water.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the craft is able to phone home, it could even automatically access a script containing new programs/scripts to run. Pretty much like the real thing. I am just not really sure about how you can preload anything on startup, because that is where the repeatedly typing in your program names starts to count after a while.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would of course be really nice if scripts could run while unloaded. I think of geostationary stationkeeping or long, long journeys. Having the craft look after itself would be ideal, as babysitting the geosync of my satellites is not my favorite hobby and warp adds to the problem quickly. That is at the same time a big hurdle. How is kOS ever going to run different ships at the same time, with physics (on rails it\u0027s hard for kOS to do anything) and without player supervision? I suspect that KSP is going to throw a royal fit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, if the workload could be properly offloaded to seperate cores the problem would be pretty much solved - unless you run many more ships. That would, however, probably mean that physics also have to be offloaded and I am not sure that is even possible.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
