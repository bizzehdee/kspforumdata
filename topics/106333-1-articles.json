My third try went up much too straight to start with and then I over-compensated and flipped it again. My fourth got into orbit but having used up way more fuel than my first try as I\u0027d had to fight it all the way up to keep it semi-stable. So the take-away lesson for me of all of this was that whatever changes get made to the way stock parts handle is always less of a hazard to my missions than my own ability to forget essential parts! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"timsfitz","CreatedById":104387,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T18:12:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m having a blast with 1.0.
