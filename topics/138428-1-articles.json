Theis was very usefull in 1.05 but since 1.1 it makes wheels blocked and \u0022engine inoperative\u0022. Woth to mention I carefully placed these batteries not to touch the wheel even when turned. It\u0027s safe amount of space to let the suspension work too. The change made my already deployed\u00A0rover useless. Any space is valuable and I miss the one between the wheels and the rover\u0027s body.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/263835074970473584/B11F98DB6C8D3D745D2D7592358A15DD784097FC/\u0022 alt=\u0022B11F98DB6C8D3D745D2D7592358A15DD784097FC\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAbove is my rover with bateries placed on its sides. It\u0027s not the best angle of view but the batteries and wheels are well separated. No wheel can roll nor turn, however.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wallygator","CreatedById":97357,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-29T07:18:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgreed.
