But as of the latest update, I seem to run into what appears to be the \u0022Hell Kraken\u0022 all the time. I\u0027m wondering if anyone has any tips on how to avoid it? This is the best/most consistent fact pattern I\u0027ve found that triggers the Kraken: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELately I\u0027ve been trying to plant flags on the remaining bodies that I have not yet visited with a Kerbal (Tylo \u0026amp; Laythe--Eve also, but I\u0027m on hold with that one until I get the other two), and both require big spacecraft. I\u0027ve been sending two ships with each mission (one that is the lander, one that is a refueler), and I send them both through the same launch window. After I get the ships on a Jool trajectory, I need to switch back and forth between them so that they both are on target for a close Jool encounter. It seems like the switching back and forth between the two craft (either through the Map view \u0022switch to\u0022 function, or through the space center tracking station) combined with the size of the craft is what causes the Kraken to appear, but I\u0027m not sure. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I \u003Cem\u003Ethink\u003C/em\u003E it is the Hell Kraken, but it could be something else. Basically, it happens immediately when I switch to the craft. The screen goes black and the altitude gauge goes insane, and either ends up on 666,666 or n/a/n. Then when I switch back to the space center, the screen there is black as well. I have to completely close out of the game and reopen it to play again. And when I do that, the ship that I was switching to when the kraken attacked is no longer in the tracking station (although if I quicksave before I switch to a ship, it will reappear... but often the kraken will immediately attack thereafter). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do everything stock. No mods, no part clipping, nothing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI understand the game is still in alpha, so I\u0027m not meaning to complain. I just want to know if anyone has any suggestions on how to avoid the Kraken. I really want to finish off the solar system with a landing on Tylo/Laythe/Eve (without stranding my poor kerbals), but I can\u0027t do it without giant ships, and the giant ships call the Kraken. Any suggestions are welcome.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Silverchain","CreatedById":83000,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-20T21:36:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s the Kraken, yeah, in one of its more typical appearances. It struck one of my ships recently, quite a large one, when I switched to it, so I think you\u0027re right in your suspicion, but I\u0027ve had no problem *crosses fingers* with other big ships so there may be more to it than that.

The Hell Kraken can only be appeased temporarily. It demands a steady stream of Kerbal sacrifices or it gets hungry and starts eating stuff you care about. So at least once a week, you must offer up a graysuit. Walk him out to the KSC Monolith and smite him with Whack-a-Kerbal. Put him in a rocket that\u0027s rigged to explode. Put several hitchhikers of graysuits on your interplanetary ships and toss one out the airlock every week.
