What you are looking for is called the [Collocation Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collocation_method). Very frequently, the numerical solution will use a Collocation Method as a single step in an implicit RK scheme. But if you are working with compact space and you expect polynomial of sufficient degree to be a good approximation to true solution, you can just collocate the entire space and do this in one go.\n\nUnfortunately, general collocation method requires solving a non-linear optimization problem. However, in a special case where you are solving y\u0027(x) = f(x), the collocation can be solved analytically. But then you are really just doing numerical integration and your analytical solution is the quadrature rule for your collocation points.\n\nFor solutions approximated with polynomials, Gauss-Legendre quadrature points are a good choice for collocation points."},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T12:46:36Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Lol...

Actually, almost all of them are this ugly. There is also a field called Differential Galois Theory that came from deciding if some diff. eq. has a nice solution. An example would be f\u0027\u0027 \u002B x\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B7f = 0 whose nontrivial solutions cannot be expressed using \u002B, -, \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B7, /, exp, and integral signs (note that by these we already have ^, sin, cos, log, etc.).\n\nEven integration can be hard. There is an algorithm by Risch that can find the integral of an elementary function in terms of elementary functions if it exists (while also being able to decide if no such thing exists). For example there are no elementary functions whose derivatives are e^(-x\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2) or x^x by Liouville\u0027s theorem."},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T15:22:11Z","Content":"I must just be missing what the OP was asking or what you folks are talking about.\n\n I was under the impression that he was talking about estimating the slope of a curve at a point through interpolation.
