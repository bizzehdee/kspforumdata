So if you\u0027ve already turned in enough experiments to get half of the possible science for that experiment in that region done, the amount of initial science for your next experiment of that type in that region will be half as much as your first one. In theory, this means that you can never get the amount of science remaining down to zero. Once you start rounding numbers, either intentionally or just as floating point errors, it does become possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, using actual data from in game, doing materials science on the launch pad and radioing it in:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou start with a maximum possible science return from that experiment at that location of 10.5 units of science. The percentage of that that you could get from a recovery is just a tad over 71%, so your first experiment will return 7.5 science if recovered, 20% of that, or 1.5 if radioed in. Assuming you radio it in, now there\u0027s only 9 points of science available, and 71% of that is 6.4, so that\u0027s the value of the experiment the second time, or 1.3 if radioed in. Radio that in, and now we\u0027re down to 7.7 science remaining. 71% of that is 5.5, so that\u0027s the value of the experiment the third time. This continues until you stop, probably somewhere around 57 total transmissions, depending on how the rounding goes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, some of you mathematically inclined people are might already be seeing a different way to view this. A materials science experiment leaves 29% of the unknown science if recovered, or 85.8% of the unknown science if radioed in. This basically means that you can look at it this way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etotal science earned by materials science experiment on the launchpad = 10.5 - (10.5 * 0.29^(number of times recovered) * 0.858^(number of times radioed in))\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll notice that since we\u0027re just multiplying each of the factors, it\u0027s commutative. So if you\u0027ve done X recoveries and Y radioing it in, it doesn\u0027t matter what order you\u0027ve done them in, you\u0027ll be at the same place (barring the ever present rounding errors). You might also notice that at a 20% return plus diminishing returns, it takes just about 8 transmitted experiments to return the same science as one recovered materials science experiment, regardless of how much science that one recovery got.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis isn\u0027t to say that these same numbers can be plugged into any experiment in any location. For example, one recovered mystery goo experiment only returns about 55% of the available science, so the diminishing returns don\u0027t kick in as fast. If transmitted however, the experiment loses less value, and diminishing returns winds up kicking in faster. At the other extreme, a gravity scan reading returns over 90% of the available science if recovered, so the diminishing returns kick in even faster in the case of recovery on that one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact, atmospheric analysis, between high total yields and limited losses due to transmission, can be ground out in eight transmissions to the point that the available science rounds down to zero. All the other experiments fall between these two ranges, except for Crew Reports, which take about 5 transmissions to hit zero available, due to the 0% loss because of transmissions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRender","CreatedById":10651,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-26T03:05:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0022fastest\u0022 way to get science (ie. takes the least game time) is to get docking ports and all science experiments besides the PresMat unlocked, then perform a multiple-land-and-return mission to the Mun.
