Similarly, landing in water is a very different experience to landing on dry land, as the effects of lithobreaking are no longer a thing. The actual landing site of the stage is also somewhat required - distance from KSC determines recover value.

This rule changes when you reach orbit.... anything you jettison in orbit technically is still moving when you go 2.5km away from it, however there are no physics to track other than position at that point, since it\u0027s not interacting with an atmosphere.

The first attempt managed a water landing, but I don\u0027t think the stage was in condition for reuse. Maybe next time. (\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2014/02/spacex-crs-3-landing-legs-plan-first-stage-recovery-ambitions/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2014/02/spacex-crs-3-landing-legs-plan-first-stage-recovery-ambitions/\u003C/a\u003E). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would make a great high-tree technical ability: \u0022Recovery and Re-usability\u0022. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way I see it, it would work like this: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. All jettisoned debris without a control function is 100% lost, as it is currently (I think), until the Recovery tech is researched. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Once the tech is researched, two things happen: i) you get a new part, the \u0022auto chute\u0022 which can be used to slow the decent of jettisoned parts, and ii) the acceleration survival rating of all parts in the tree are increased by, let\u0027s say, 20%, due to better hardening and engineering. If the number of chutes installed is sufficient to get the jettisoned assembly under the lowest acceleration rating in the jettisoned part list, the part is automatically salvaged. Penalties for distance from KSC remain. In addition: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E a. Any part whose acceleration rating is violated is destroyed 100% and the remainder are penalized 15% each for collateral damage due to the failed part (you get a report explaining what happened).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E b. Part trajectories during reentry are estimated based on an assumed wind resistance acting as a gravity vector, so they don\u0027t drain processor (is this possible? I don\u0027t know, maybe). The intent would be to realistically estimate the reentry location without having to do a full physics simulation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E c. Parts landing in water get no landing damage penalty. Parts landing on plains get a 10% landing damage penalty. Parts landing on desert, ice, or mountains get a 20% landing damage penalty. Parts landing on rugged mountains get a 50% landing damage penalty. Landing physics are thus handled procedurally, not through physics simulation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E d. The difficulty of recovering thin liquid fuel tanks would be handled by giving them very unforgiving g-force survival ratings. Solid boosters, struts and frames, and other gear would have more robust ratings and so the auto-chute would work very well for them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. There could be a \u0022Recovery and Reusibility II\u0022 tech, that would i) boost your part acceleration rating further and ii) give you a new module, similar to a control pod, but radially attachable and very light. It would automatically cause jettisoned liquid tanks/rockets to attempt a restart/landing, let\u0027s say with 75% success. But you\u0027d have to jettison them with at least 5% fuel remaining, and the tank would have to have landing legs installed unless the landing was in water. That would close the loop and allow the player to attempt to reproduce SpaceX\u0027s feat. Again, the landing location estimate would be procedural, not physics based, and the damage/recovery value would be computed statistically per the overview above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn reality, managing hardware costs are a huge part of running a space program, so this would allow/encourage realistically low contract payouts and would force the player to spend a considerable amount of forethought planning her reuse and recovery opportunities, which is very true-to-life. Because the recovery value/survivability percentages are quite adjustable as I\u0027ve laid them out, this scheme could be play tested against several possible difficulty metrics, and could be adjusted for novices and experts in future releases. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps something like this will make it into the beta.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lysergic","CreatedById":69762,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-05T16:10:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf it lands in water it\u0027s not really ever reusable again.

Personally I think it\u0027s a lot easier: because history.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUp to .24 there really was no value in any debris. With asparagus designs you\u0027d easily be shedding hundreds of parts each launch, and littering Kerbin\u0027s surface had no real value but would slow the game down in the long run. So the obvious solution: if it\u0027s shedded during launch and doesn\u0027t have a command unit, it\u0027s debris, and you don\u0027t need it. So it gets deleted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn-orbit debris is different because it has entertainment value (Kessler syndrome, cleanup missions) and besides that, not every command-less object in orbit is regarded \u0022debris\u0022 by the player (think fuel tanks for refueling, etc).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think it\u0027s something Squad really touched at the .24 release, not realizing that most players have spontaneously morphed into Scrooge McMizers and want to recover every last strut (god forbid you\u0027d run out) even though you really won\u0027t run into funding problems if you don\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally I just make the same launch vehicles as I did in the past, with maybe a few more SRB\u0027s instead of asparagus boosters, but I\u0027m not trying to recover any ditched stages. And after a few days of game time I\u0027m at $5M.

The chances of metal fatigue or any other flaw in the tank walls is too great. There are also lots of fuel lines to purge and clean. I\u0027m betting that they will cut the engines off and reuse them separately rather than relaunch the entire stage. At a minimum they will have to disassemble lots of stuff to repeat the standard inspections that all parts go through during assembly. SpaceX has made it to orbit despite single-engine cutouts, as did Apollo 13\u0027s launch. So the insurance people will probably insist that the first \u0022used\u0022 engines fly alongside new ones to guard against total failure.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"goldenpsp","CreatedById":113874,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-05T20:28:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eeasy answer?
