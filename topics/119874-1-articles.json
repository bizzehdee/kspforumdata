Right click on him, and ITS BOB, but bob and Valentina are both in their seats. i switched to him and was able to float around for a bit using his pack, contemplating what to do with him. When the mun and his craft that was floating near him suddenly disappeared, moving the camera around was very glitchy, and i could only see kerbin and the sun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGoing into the map looked the exact same as out of it, no patched conics or anything. I switched back to his craft containing the original and saw bob2 slowly floating away, mun and everything restored, switching back to bob2 and everything glitches out again. now bob2 is stuck orbiting around the mun, and seeming to be completely useless.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will probably just send another ship to... deal with... bob2 and continue with my original mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI remember seeing another thread about a guy having this same problem except with his mun base.

You have been graced by the Kraken!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn seriousness, this happens and there\u0027s not much to do about it. Often, you get GameState errors caused by issues with loading crafts into the so-called \u0027rendered worldspace\u0027, often caused by the game not properly saving the craft when it was un-rendered. There\u0027s not much to do, sadly, aside from hoping it doesn\u0027t happen again. If it becomes too regular, try reinstalling the game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Senormeens","CreatedById":145344,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-02T18:10:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah the ship i sent to mun was supposed to visit multiple biomes, but every single time i re-entered the pod another clones appeared. so i walked away from that career save for a bit a messed about in sandbox.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehopefully i don\u0027t have to uninstall then re install, i wouldn\u0027t be impossible, but it would take some time to put everything back into the game, I\u0027ve got a lot of saves and mods installed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-02T19:32:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Senormeens\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Senormeens\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027ve got a lot of saves and mods installed.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn that case, I\u0027ll move this where it might get better attention.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Claw\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
