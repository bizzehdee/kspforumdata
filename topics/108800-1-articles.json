This is simply not the case. Any wobbles you experience are the result of either 1) a weak, wobbly rocket, or 2) a bad harmonic in the ratio of available control force vs. external force resulting in a dynamically unstable, self-reinforcing oscillation. Assuming you build a rigid rocket, then the problem is #2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo matter what means of attitude control you have on your rocket (torque, fins, RCS), it only operates in 2 situations. First is to change the rocket\u0027s orientation by your control inputs. Second, when SAS is on, is to counter whatever outside forces are trying to point the rocket in a different direction from what you want. It\u0027s this latter that can sometimes results in bad oscillations when you don\u0027t have enough control authority for SAS to react fast enough to shifting external forces, so it usually gets out of phase and thus the rocket wobbles more and more. The solution is to add more control authority in whatever form you think would work best in that particular flight regime. Torque, RCS, or fins.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote: I typically put reactions wheels on each stage of my rockets, and also put RCS tanks on the transfer stage and thrusters on all lower stages.
