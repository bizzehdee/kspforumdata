For instance, whenever we were working in a potentially contaminated area, we had to wear paper overalls so we didn\u0027t get radioactive contamination on our clothes. After use, we put them in a hamper, and the contents of the hamper were compressed into bales. These are technically radioactive waste, because potentially they have some very low-level contamination on them. In areas where there was contamination, but also the risk of cracking your head of something, we wore \u0022bump hats\u0022, basically reinforced baseball caps. These were washed in the active laundry, and all the run-off from the washing machines there, as well as any drains and even toilets inside the reactor building is classed as radioactive waste, just to be on the safe side. Every time I used the toilet, I was effectively producing about 4 litres of \u0022radioactive waste\u0022. In reality, you could probably go up to any of this stuff, roll around on it, lick it, whatever, and the only ill-effects you\u0027d experience would be if you were daft enough to do that to the toilet water.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Intermediate- and High-level waste is the stuff you don\u0027t particularly want to be around. Unfortunately there\u0027s too much of it to launch into space (several hundred thousand tonnes, we\u0027ve probably only put a few thousand tonnes in orbit throughout history, and you need far more delta-V to reach the sun). That said, its activity is decreasing all of the time, and in terms of volume, there\u0027s about 30,000 m^3 of it. That\u0027s a factor of a billion smaller than the Baltic Sea, a factor of a few hundred billion smaller than the Atlantic Ocean. I think encase it in glass, bury it in a subduction zone in the sea bed, and even if it does ever escape, it will be so diluted that it won\u0027t be a problem anyway. There\u0027s simply not enough of it to make radioactive volcanoes as somebody in a previous post suggested. Put it this way, natural radioactive decay of elements in the earth produces about 25,000 GW of energy. That\u0027s compared to 570GW of energy generated by all the world\u0027s power stations (\u003Ca href=\u0022http://bit.ly/1jMAlms\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://bit.ly/1jMAlms\u003C/a\u003E). Spent nuclear fuel produces about 10kW per tonne one year after removal from a reactor, so basically we\u0027re talking about already sitting on as much radioactivity as 2.5 billion tonnes of high level nuclear waste, just from natural sources.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Simon Ross","CreatedById":82582,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-23T16:59:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI favour the Larry Niven solution...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConvert the nuclear waste into a glassy solid\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlace it in a pile in the middle of a desert\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlace a fence around the pile with a warning \u0027Cross this fence and you will die\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProblem solved\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
