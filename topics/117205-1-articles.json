I always found this thingies somewhat eerie and strange - I mean, lithium fusion, about 20\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C to 150\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C surface temperature (do they have a surface at all?), and they looked (in FE2, that is) kind of scary - I\u0027m not a physics buff, and informations about brown dwarfs are relatively sparse and uncertain. So my main questions are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat happens at the end of a \u0022life circle\u0022 of brown dwarfs? Some sort of nova? Do they just burn out, leaving a big lump of material floating around whatever whereever?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow they may freaking look like?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre planets orbiting brown dwarfs possibly capable of sustaining life as we know it?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"_Augustus_","CreatedById":115084,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T21:14:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThey don\u0027t die.

They burn like a coal, starting out at their brightest and hottest. After a few billion years, they slowly fade into darkness, like White Dwarfs. They cannot have life on anything orbiting them, as they are way too cold even at its hottest. When they die, they just become gas giants flying around their native galaxy, waiting for its nearest black hole to suck them up. It is slightly possible that they get pulled into a star system and become a huge planet.\n"}]}
