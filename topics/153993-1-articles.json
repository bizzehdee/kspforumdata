Workshop, smelter, reactor, rocketparts silo, metalore mining unit and one launchpad were sent from Kerbin, but the rest of the base was built by the base. I\u0027ve been using it to launch Duna and Eve missions, and when Minmus gets into position I\u0027ll be using it for an asteroid capture mission too. Aside from specialty equipment like reactors, electric engines and spacecraft that are required by contract to have been built at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, I am now building pretty much everything here. Those Duna and Eve missions (which will both be setting up ore mining facilities and fuel converters\u00A0at their destinations) barely put a dent in my 8,000,000 Vessel Funds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis being my first Extraplanetary Launchpads base to actually\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ework\u003C/em\u003E, I\u0027m really pleased with it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deddly","CreatedById":62955,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-25T08:49:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell done!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was going to move this to the \u0022What I did in KSP today\u0022 thread, but I noticed that some others have already posted there after your post, and I didn\u0027t want it to get lost.
