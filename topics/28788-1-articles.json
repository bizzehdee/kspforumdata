I know this is a brand new site, so I\u0027d like to point out some rough edges I see.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wouldn\u0027t recommend having the user right-click and save. That is extra steps for lazy users who can\u0027t be bothered to read, look at web sites for just pretty pictures, and on a personal note, I\u0027m easily annoyed with the type of coding on sites that make the me work for what I want. Instead, I\u0027d suggest looking up methods to force the file to download. You obviously have the craft file sitting either in a file or a database, but, you can get your code to send the craft file as something that is downloadable. Instead of linking directly to the file, have your HREF point to a server script (PHP I\u0027m assuming) that\u0027ll identify the file or record based on the URL, and have actual code spit the raw data to the client as a downloadable file. I can\u0027t remember the exact code (Its at work and its been a about a year since I had to do something like that) but its adding two headers to the HTTP response that tells the client that what the server is providing is supposed to be a download. You CAN force an HTML file to be downloaded by changing headers in the response. The two headers is to indicate to the web client the type of file to be sent, as well as what the file name should be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext, if you\u0027re going to be looking for users to enter a password, and you\u0027re looking for wide spread use, you\u0027d better look into getting SSL and appropriate certs going at least for form submissions. Depending on the kind of access you have (I use 000webhost.com as well) you can get a signed cert for free, but the user is still going to be given a warning about the self signed status. I know this because I have two sites that have self-signed certificates, but they\u0027re my sites on my local computers here in my basement that I access remotely, and I think I can trust me. So even though the cert is self-signed, SSL will work which encrypts the data between whatever computer I\u0027m at, and the server. Having a self signed cert and having the browser throw a warning at a user is better than plain HTTP form requests, simply because of the way SSL works. But throwing that warning may throw a lot of users for a loop and just not bother going to your site again. Looking at the registration page HTML code, you\u0027re not referring to a secure page for your submit, so, anything sent is sent via clear text. The form request is a simple \u0022post\u0022, and I don\u0027t see any client side scripting either in this script, or that references any other JS/VBScript that does any kind of encryption. Its been a while since I\u0027ve logged into 000webhost.com and I never bothered to request a private cert. IIRC though, you can upgrade the account and get the cert, but I don\u0027t remember what kind of hoops you have to jump through or what the costs were.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo unfortunately, even though you can provide us with the code you use to protect the data on the servers, the data transferred from my client to your server apparently is not encrypted. What your server side code does with the form submission at that point doesn\u0027t matter because the information I\u0027ve provided has already been passed over the net in clear text. Its great that the data may be encrypted in a database, but, for really private information, I\u0027d rather not have the database encrypted, but the transmission of data over public lines BE encrypted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m getting tired, so, going my Kerbals to bed under a Mainsail.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BeefTenderloin","CreatedById":25612,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-24T16:06:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022alephzorg\u0022 data-cite=\u0022alephzorg\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ewhy use this instead of spaceport?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Espaceport is for mods not ****ing craft files hrrrrrrrrrrrrggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zatie12","CreatedById":57823,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-24T16:07:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022HavinAlmassi\u0022 data-cite=\u0022HavinAlmassi\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENot trying to troll... but wouldn\u0027t sending us the code you use to encrypt personal details thereby negate your security?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECode used to encrypt most SSL or secure data over the internet is open source.
