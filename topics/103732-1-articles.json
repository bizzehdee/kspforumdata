Sure the light tanks and T-34s do have sloped armor but that can be defeated with the right cannon and positioning. Historically the Russian tanks did have the advantage, on paper, but due to poor training and communications were inferior to the Panzers. And heavy tanks like KV-1 were nearly immune to early war Panzers and KV-1s should be OP defensively anyway!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn-game, good gunnery and observation skills on the part of the player make Russian tanks easy to knock out.. and I dislike that KV-1s are matched up with Tigers early in the mid game. Instead of complaining the Tiger is OP I just devised tactics against it like disabling the gun which is quite easy to hit, then let teammates deal with it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI play American steel mostly, for the extremely fun AAMGs and certain US tanks seem to be incredibly durable and some early war ones are so weird they are fun to brawl around with. Later on, Shermans are sweet tanks, despite their well known weaknesses, and good Sherman drivers are a force to reckon with in both WT and World of Tanks. I prefer the pace of War Thunder, yes, it\u0027s slow, but that\u0027s how tank battles play out - play smart and stay hull down.
