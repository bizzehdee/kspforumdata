If 7 hats were available, allocated so that 1 pink, 2 green, and 5 blue gerbils get hats, now that percentage has increased to 50%, simply due to the fact that more organs are available.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-18T22:24:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E There is actually a bit of that, but it\\\u0027s just due simple genetics.

The cells in all organs express a wide range of glycoproteins and lipoproteins on their surfaces, and these vary from person to person. If immune cells detect an unfamiliar tissue-type they attack it. If you put an organ with the wrong tissue-type into a person then there will be rejection. Immunosuppressants help by reducing the rejection so you can allow some mismatch between donor and recipient, but get it too badly wrong and they won\\\u0027t do a thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome organs express fewer tissue-type factors than others, so blood can be very widely donated (if the white cells are filtered out), livers will work in a wide range of people, lungs need to be carefully matched, and bone marrow needs to be EXTREMELY carefully matched.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPeople of different ethnicity have different ranges of tissues types, which makes it very much harder to match organs and recipients from different ethnic groups. There is some overlap, so a small percentage of donations are cross-ethnic, but the majority of transplant recipients will get an organ from a person of the same ethnicity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a particular shortage of bone-marrow transplants for black kids with leukaemia, which is especially sad given that bone-marrow can be donated through live donation - that is, you don\\\u0027t need to die to donate it, you can walk in, have a small procedure and walk out that evening. It\\\u0027s more uncomfortable than donating blood, but nowhere near as uncomfortable having toothache!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESadly, people of mixed race have especial difficulty. A great many children with leukaemia receive bone-marrow from a close relative such as a parent or sibling. However, people of mixed race have extremely widely varied tissue types, and a child can end up with a mix of tissue types that are too much unlike their parents or siblings for them to receive bone marrow from them. They actually have a better chance of getting marrow from a total stranger who, by sheer chance, matches their mix of tissue types - but only if that total stranger has signed up to a register of potential marrow donors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is the main reason behind that NHS advert.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want a long read, go to: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transplant_rejection\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transplant_rejection\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ydoow","CreatedById":10165,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-19T01:35:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RedDwarfIV\u0022 data-cite=\u0022RedDwarfIV\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts just unnescessary.
