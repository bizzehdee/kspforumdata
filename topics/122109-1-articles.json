I\u0027ve been playing KSP since 1.0. Love it. Been trying to narrow down what mods I want to settle on for a long term career. I\u0027m very interested in Real Solar System, but I created a new game with RSS and Realism Overhaul and all that...but all the new engines and parts and game play mechanics is too much for me. So, anyone have suggestions on the best mods to use with RSS in a career mode without realism overhaul. Will the realism progression career work ok with more stock-alike parts and no realism overhaul? Or would other career contract packs work okay in RSS without real progression or overhaul? Just looking for thoughts or advice for the best career experience I can manage. If I should downgrade the solar system a bit for a better experience, I\u0027d be willing to do that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-01T21:23:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMoved over to General Add-on Affairs, the place for all your mod-related questions.

Does it automatically adjust them so contracts to Duna become contracts to Mars, or do you need to have specific contract packs for the real solar system?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-01T22:04:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou may have to adjust contracts. Might be better, if you want to upscale, to use something like 64K, although I\u0027m still not entirely sure how that will end up working with career (the Module Manager script will still apply, and will likely be a lot of fun as well). Realism Overhaul uses another mod called Realistic Progression Zero to handle career mode.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EliasDanger","CreatedById":151803,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-01T22:04:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI suppose I could do what I just did, which was try it.
