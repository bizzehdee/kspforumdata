Could we get one \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ededicated\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E person or team of modders that can actually finish the mod?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHonestly, I think we should have just a space shuttle mod. You know what the mod would be? The space shuttle alongside of space shuttle stuff. Preferably, the mod would also stay updated and you wouldn\u0027t have to install 7 other mods for it to work. It would also be nice to not have to install a patch just to get past the loading screen.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSorry for this rather short rant, but I\u0027m just tired of mod makers making these shuttle mods and just walking away from them. This forum \u003Cs\u003Eneeds \u003C/s\u003Edeserves a \u003Cs\u003Ehero\u003C/s\u003E modder who would be dedicated to maintaining a shuttle mod.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nEdit: I suppose I should go ahead and restate what I am trying to say, as people are taking this the wrong way, which is understandable. I\u0027m not trying to call these mod makers lazy, nor am I trying to attack mod creators. My point is that the space shuttle mods on the \u0022market\u0022 are either unorganized or not attended to.The only shuttle mod I see that\u0027s the closest to working doesn\u0027t work and the forum post is written in comic sans, without capital letters. I suppose that\u0027s just one of the things that bother me.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI digress, however. To sum it all up, I\u0027m slightly frustrated with the amount of shuttle mods. You try to go to one forum post, then get redirected to a development thread, then to the main thread, then to a download.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe message for shuttle mod makers: Please organize. That\u0027s all. No personal attacks and no non-personal attacks from my end.

I will now write about my experience.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe boot up went smooth, no issues. I started my modded save and, to be honest, expected some issues. Eh. I kinda got some issues. Everything was there! Perfect! You know, except for the orbiter. Ouch. Maybe I replaced the wrong file? The forum post says to place the file in a directory that doesn\u0027t exist, so I found a folder that had a file with the same name and threw it in there. Experimentation to come later. Anyway, I decided since there was no orbiter I would just make the launcher. I grabbed the ET and tried to put some boosters on it. Now, it says \u0022with decoupler\u0022, but that name is a damn liar. I did some experimentation. Tried to mount it on a normal decoupler. Nope. Tried to attach it with a structural element. Nope. I was pretty much out of ideas. I placed down a structural element and hoped for the best. Ayyyy, it worked! I made it to where it decoupled the structural element with the booster. Then I threw a nose cone on top, which is conveniently placed under the \u0022engines\u0022 tab. Great. Then I figured out that there is a custom made booster decoupler. *Sigh* I made that revision, set up staging and put it on the launchpad. Sounds are great! Flew nice! Decouplers perfectly! Parachute works. I like it.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, sorry MikeNZ. I was wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
