I hope I can make some positive contributions to the community and have some fan with you guys.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow for my question: I tried to add a signature and an avatar to my profile, but apparently I don\u0027t have the forum permissions for that. I bought the game through Steam, so maybe I\u0027m using the wrong login here or do I have to PM someone asking for this kind of permission?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, thanks in advance for your help.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Golden Clock Industries","CreatedById":64435,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-27T01:53:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums! Unfortunately, I do not know enough myself about the signatures (As you can see by the text under my name, and the pink field in my sig), but I\u0027m sure you will find someone else with far more experience than I.

A lot of the instructions might not make sense until you\u0027ve given the missions a few tries, but it\u0027s very rewarding if you keep at it. Don\u0027t be afraid to post questions about building and flying your vehicles in the How To forums as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy landings!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-27T14:23:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
