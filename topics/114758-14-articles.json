It does not even have alpha. Maybe you have problems with them because they have normal-map. \n\nAs for normal maps just don\u0027t scale them. They are veeeery sensitive to scaling and compresssion artifacts.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-31T06:51:10Z\u0022 title=\u002207/31/2015 06:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Nils277**"},{"CreatedByName":"Ewypig","CreatedById":149140,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T22:17:48Z","Content":"Unfortunately, the mod doesn\u0027t seem to be working for me at all. ![;.;](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif) The parts are not in the VAB or the SHP.
