I\u0027ve been to Minmus and back twice already using Scott Manley\u0027s tips. But getting to the Mun has been a headache. I\u0027ve stranded Jebediah because his rocket fell over. I managed to get a two command pod reduce ship to land upright in the moon..... About 100km from Jeb. So Rescue 2 I managed to get within 4kms of Jeb. So any tips on pin point landings? right now I have Jeb running across the 4km to get to rescue 2. I\u0027d like to avoid that in the future as it seems it takes a kerbal 2 minutes to run 0.1 kms\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-31T06:35:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPractice. In 3 tries you got a (unflyable, but survived) landing, landed really far away, and then landed closer. A 4th landing could be all you need.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, F5 does a quick save. Do that in orbit around Mun and then do your landing, paying attention to the results of your actions. If you land near Jeb, great. If you don\u0027t, hold F9 for a second or two and reload your quick save so you can try again, using what you learned to get closer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had lots of multi-kilometer \u0022close enough\u0022 landings before I got it. These days I pretty frequently land on the docking port at my Minmus Kethane base. Or at least I did before upgrading to .22. I\u0027m getting close to having a new base and I fully expect I\u0027ll be landing on a docking port there soon.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xacktar","CreatedById":88876,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-31T07:38:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou could wait a while until you have rover parts(wheels, ect) then build a rover to cover the distance.
