The downside of that is that your airplane needs to keep up with the, say, 7800 m/s velocity of your crane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E gets you back to the main problem of spaceflight in the first place: the problem is not going to space (altitude), it\u0027s staying there (velocity).

Saying you got that far. Kerbarts right though your better off just firing rockets at that point. Also.. how would the hook react to moving at 7800m/s in atmosphere? The drag alone from that would pull the crane out of orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NASAFanboy","CreatedById":57300,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-18T21:14:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDarn it, wrong thread.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWas mean\u0027t for another one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease delete this post.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-18T21:30:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo essentially a big ass tower with an elevator, going to 300 km height?
