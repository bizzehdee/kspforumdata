They are not usable, not functional, and an absolute waste of my time to model/texture/work on, not to mention absolutely torturous to actually work on (seriously, modeling tools where never designed for interior spaces/shapes, only exteriors).  I never use IVA view and really have no intentions on doing so in the future.  (IF there was some sort of \u0027free-look\u0027 IVA where you could actually move the kerb\u0027s head around, AND they didn\u0027t have such a giant forehead making most windows useless, AND the helmets were smaller so that you could reasonably fit the crew inside the capsules, I might have a different view on it)\n\nI\u0027m more than willing to take submissions for IVA models, and/or PRs to add placeholders to the existing parts that lack them, but I\u0027m going to spend zero of my own time on it.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 11/25/2017 at 2:28 PM, Jimbodiah said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Yep, it won\u0027t all be possible.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E For my personal use I would not want engines on the parts so I can add 3rd party engines that I tend to use more, mainly NF Propulsion (I lovz my scifi).\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Maybe just have a scalable (change diameter but keep size ratio) apollo and orion SM to start with? That way you can chose fuelcell vs panels by chosing the model and adjust the diameter to match the pod. For my personal use I patched a 2.5m version of the orion capsule and SM for a 3-man setup just because it looks more modern and has panels. Maybe that is an initial option until you work out something better?\n\u003E \n\nI\u0027m really against having any sort of scale-able SM.  Unless you want -very- simple textures, and no external accessories (no handrails, no antenna, no solar... so basically just a fuel tank with some \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003Ercs\u003C/abbr\u003E on it...).\n\n(No, I have absolutely no intentions of making ETS \u0027short\u0027 Apollo SM\u0027s, at least not with that texturing style; if they exist, it will be as a standard fuel tank; want the ETS stuff?  Go play with BDB...).\n\nThis is why I asked how you would propose making a modular \u0027Orion-SM\u0027 part?  I really don\u0027t see it as being possible.  It is a specific shape and visual style... any change to it and it is no longer an \u0027Orion-SM\u0027, but something completely different.

Using the ability to recolor parts, it might have a set of switchable textures that match the default terrain textures on the various worlds. This being closer to the desired look than my poor attempt above:\n\n![3printed-lunar-base.jpg](http://www.kurzweilai.net/images/3printed-lunar-base.jpg)\n\nThe parts might in fact look like 1/2 versions of the expandable parts, resulting in a quonset hut looking structure, that then gets the dirt model added on top upon expansion.

The IVA view could actually show just the structure of the buried crew habitat. Just to give a feeling of the size of it.\n\u003E \n\nThat\u0027s true. \n\nRegardless of the underground part, the bit I was suggesting was merely an *actual* part, sitting on the surface, that happens to look like a pile of dirt. Ideally it would have at least a flat \u0022hard point\u0022 on the top, so that an antenna, cupola, etc might be placed there."},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-28T01:51:50Z","Content":"Spent pretty much all of my working / dev time yesterday to make this possible:\n\n![i41qr6y.png](https://i.imgur.com/i41qr6y.png)\n\n![KTPV3RY.png](https://i.imgur.com/KTPV3RY.png)\n\nNote the important bit, the \u0027retract panels\u0027 button...\n\nAnd because  [@RedParadize](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/129285-redparadize/) gave me an idea....\n\n![yKitr0Z.png](https://i.imgur.com/yKitr0Z.png)\n\n(which doesn\u0027t actually work like you would think because stock aero / drag cubes really suck; it flies heat shield-end backwards, sadly, even with the giant draggy wings sticking out)\n\nStill a very buggy mess, and probably another 10-15 hours work to straighten it all out.  Was not kidding when I said it would be painful to implement because the module was never designed for the feature.

That\u0027s fantastic! Thank you so much!  I might have a idea to make it behave with stock aero, I imagine the drag cube is calculated around part colider? If yes, it probably only see the base, so increasing the angularDrag and maximum\\_drag might do it. If not, I will try make a part with the heat shield included, that or a base plate. Since I now I feel guilty of wasting your time, let me do these test myself to redeem myself!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-11-28T02:08:14Z\u0022 title=\u002211/28/2017 02:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 28, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by RedParadize**"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-28T02:24:47Z","Content":"Will this at least be possibly useful to you later?
