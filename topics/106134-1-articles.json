It will gradually generate science over time based on what science it currently has inside of it. In the long run this will produce more science than if you had retrieved/transmitted the experiments normally.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn order to put science inside it collect science as normal, then have a kerbal take the data from the part containing it and put it inside the science lab.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nAssailant","CreatedById":38911,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T23:38:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe science lab can hold up to 500 \u0022data\u0022, which it slowly multiplies into science by doing \u0022research\u0022. To do research, you must first collect data (EVA reports, experiments, surface samples) and have a kerbal take them to the ship that has the science lab attached. Then, when you right click on the ship and \u0022review data\u0022, there will be an option to place the data into the lab (a green beaker above the blue transmit option in the window). If you have two scientists in the lab, you can then right-click on it and start the research.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt will tell you how much science will be generated per-day (more data, more science per day), and the lab can only research 500 science before it can be transmitted. The data will be consumed, but at a slower rate than the science is generated (I\u0027m not sure on the conversion rate, but I got 500 science by going from 500 to 400 data). It takes a decent amount of time to transmit the data, so be sure to have a lot of power available to your lab.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy two stations orbiting the Mun and Minmus were able to finish out the tech tree in my career game before I even went to another planet. I just used small landers to bring back samples and reports from the surface while my stations processed the data in their labs. Much easier than putting a large base on the surface. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt.

I\u0027m not sure if other factors come into play either, yet. When I tried using two 0-level kerbal scientists with data, I had something like a .01 or .02 sci/day rate.
