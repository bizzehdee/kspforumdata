At first i was like duh look at this , it looks horrible, then i read about it and the way it came to be and i still hesitated. yesterday I gave into it and downloaded the demo and let me tell you, for someone who isn\u0027t really into sci-fi or simulators as much as rpgs that demo got me hooked, and haven\u0027t stopped playing it since, as soon as i get the required money i shall contribute to the developers by buying the game for sure, I know that the fan base is fantastic! i saw ships so AMAZING i cried a little, like that mass effect ship?! Though i heard it got taken down for some reason, I hope to see such amazing things inthe future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is abahnur and I love you all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ealso here is my first succesful orbiting, tough no fuel : c\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img196/9154/6xwp.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00226xwp.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CCKinnison","CreatedById":71439,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-03T18:33:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome!

Point the capsule retrograde to get that little boost from the separation. Do that at apogee to lower the paragee into the atmosphere. If not, he can try to space jump back to Kerbal. If not, send up a rescue craft or change his name to Major Tong.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AbahnuR","CreatedById":73201,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-04T07:59:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EXD hehe yeah in the end he crashed ( just his rocket, i saved him in time ) in to one of my wreckage..yeah i know what are the chanches.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-04T20:01:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
