Twas a time before even I was anything more than a byte, floating through the cyber\u00E6ther. Twas a time when reputation was implemented only very recently, and there were hitherto many unknowns in the whole process.\n\n(sips tea)\n\nBut the moderators, the omniscient, overseeing moderators, were there, and thus made it their mission to find if reputation could be made negative.\n\nAnd so, the account of Green Iron Crown was born, as nothing more than a Test. A Test of reputation, of integers, and of likes.\n\nBut Green Iron Crown did not go unnoticed. A member of this very forum gave Green Iron Crown a *like*! Soon, a game was made out of giving Green Iron Crown likes and dislikes, pitting moderator against forum member, in a race to see Green Iron Crown\u0027s total reputation!\n\n(dramatic tea sipping)\n\nIn the end, the mighty moderators prevailed! They had proven that reputation  *could*  be made negative! And, his purpose fulfilled, Green Iron Crown was deleted.\n\nThat is the story of Green Iron Crown, as I have heard it said.\n\n(By the way, this is all what I\u0027ve read off of other threads. I wasn\u0027t actually there at the time, so if I goofed up a fact, feel free to correct me.)"},{"CreatedByName":"StrandedonEarth","CreatedById":89439,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-26T02:38:03Z","Content":"I say, old chap, this is a jolly good thread!"}]}
