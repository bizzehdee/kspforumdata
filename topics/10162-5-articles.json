Twas a time before even I was anything more than a byte, floating through the cyber\u00E6ther. Twas a time when reputation was implemented only very recently, and there were hitherto many unknowns in the whole process.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(sips tea)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the moderators, the omniscient, overseeing moderators, were there, and thus made it their mission to find if reputation could be made negative.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd so, the account of Green Iron Crown was born, as nothing more than a Test. A Test of reputation, of integers, and of likes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut Green Iron Crown did not go unnoticed. A member of this very forum gave Green Iron Crown a \u003Cem\u003Elike\u003C/em\u003E! Soon, a game was made out of giving Green Iron Crown likes and dislikes, pitting moderator against forum member, in a race to see Green Iron Crown\u0027s total reputation!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(dramatic tea sipping)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the end, the mighty moderators prevailed! They had proven that reputation \u003Cem\u003E could \u003C/em\u003E be made negative!
