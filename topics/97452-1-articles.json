When the mod is not in there, the game loads, but the framerate is too low to be playable (like 4 or 5 fps). So the conclusion is that I NEED ATM with the amount of mods that I have and the relatively low-speed (6gb RAM) system I am running on, but for some reason it is messing up my system. I looked in the appropriate folder for a error log, but none was found. \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EIf you have any questions, let me know.

Reason is that ATM will make a cache file with converted textures, so when you run game second time whole loading is lot faster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my case with \u0022only\u0022 37 mods it was close to one hour with first launch.
