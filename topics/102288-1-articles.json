Jeb approves of dropping things on purpose. A powered descent will give you the most control, you can treat it as if it had no atmosphere for most purposes... of course it will increase the fuel requirement though. I generally use drag and chutes to slow me down until I have a periapse beneath the surface, and then use engines for more control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I do rely on chutes, I use multiple chute stages for Duna. The first stage of chutes has *way* more drag than I need for landing, to help grab the thin upper atmosphere and slow my horizontal velocity. Once I have less horizontal velocity than vertical velocity, I cut the first stage chutes loose and deploy the second stage. The second stage provides less drag (to avoid ripping them off), but plenty to land safely. By timing when I activate each stage, I can usually put it down pretty close to where I\u0027m aiming. RCS or small engines can help adjust beyond that point if necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
