Every so often, check that gauge to see how close you are to the deck; it\u0027ll give you a good estimate of how much further down you have to go (e.g. if your altimeter says 3500 and the radar altimeter says you\u0027re 1500 above the deck, you know the deck\u0027s somewhere around 2000).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen it\u0027s just a matter of watching your speed. Until you get good at it, begin a braking burn at about 8000 meters; you\u0027re trying to get your velocity down to about zero. Be sure to follow the retrograde marker. Start cutting back on the throttle to about 2/3 when you\u0027re at \u0026lt;100 m/s and to 1/3 when you get to \u0026lt;50. Throttle it to about the second or third notch to maintain your speed when the retrograde marker is about to go vertical. Deploy your landing legs and touch down at less than ten m/s or you\u0027ll definitely break something.

You do this by clicking on the velocity indicator, this will toggle between orbit/surface/target(if you have a target set).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you leave navball on orbit mode you\u0027re in for a nasty surprise when you get near the surface and it automatically switch to surface mode. You may think you\u0027re falling down to a vertical landing according to your orbit mode navball and the map may look like you\u0027re falling straight down, but when you near the surface and that navball auto-switch happens you will suddenly realise you\u0027re actually moving laterally across the surface. On some bodies (Ike for example, due to tidal locking and hence its fast rotation) this lateral velocity is significant and you may not have the time to kill it before you slam into the surface at shallow angle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason is because the thing you\u0027re trying to land on is rotating! Orbit mode measures your speed against the centre of the body you\u0027re orbiting while surface mode measures the speed against the surface. To land without any lateral movement on the surface you must match the velocity of the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFunnily enough NASA once made the same mistake during Project Mercury. They had the Mercury spacecraft to perform a retroburn but forgot compensate for the fact that the Earth will rotate under the spacecraft during the re-entry (ie, the exact same thing as \u0022forgot to switch to surface mode\u0022 in KSP) and as the result the capsule missed the intended recovery site by quite some distance.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alistone","CreatedById":60032,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-01T01:08:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERemember downward facing lights for nightside landings (and a power supply for them).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemember parachutes for the trip home\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemember to verify your landing legs and ladder with a test landing on Kerbin before you try your munshot.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"(An Original Name)","CreatedById":53457,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-01T01:31:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mufasa\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Mufasa\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EPretty much this, my first few landers I crashed into the Mun because I was trying to eyeball my landing (noob move).
