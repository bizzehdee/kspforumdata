I got them for the Shenzhou, but the re-entry capsule isn\u0027t showing up. And specifically that. All the other parts are appearing, but not the capsule. Same is with other mods, certain very specific parts will be missing from the game, like the engine mount on DECQ\u0027s Shuttle mod. Does anyone know what is happening and if i can fix it? if so, Thanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: Re-installed ICSP, entry module was fine and appeared but now the orbital module just vanished.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-03-07T17:23:10Z\u0022 title=\u002203/07/2020 05:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 7, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by LoltheVI\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ETested and new updates to topic.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
