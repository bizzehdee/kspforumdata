Re-entered with the three person pod, a very thin Fuel Tanks Plus tank underneath, a stock heatshield and two Twitch engines on the sides. And two RealChute radial chutes. Anyway every time before the pod would normally lose a great deal of speed under about 15,000m, the friction flames would cease and I would happily deploy chutes at around 5,000m which would open at 500m and I would land safely. This time the pod DID NOT lose any speed at all and slammed into the ground at 1500m/s. I think something is broken here. I was burning retro with the Twitch engines the entire time, but regardless of this the pod should have slowed down A LOT under 15,000m, but this time it just kept doing, with friction flames and everything, until it hit the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood thing I replaced Jeb with a random she-Kerbal I wanted to level up so Jeb still lives.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-10T22:07:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMoved to modded support, maybe someones run into the same thing, but if you could provide your save file (put it on dropbox) it\u0027d help.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vat21s","CreatedById":34187,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-11T09:08:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat version of FAR are you using?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m having the same issue.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nansuchao","CreatedById":135151,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-11T10:59:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt seems like a missed voxelization of the vessel.

I now used only the pod with stock chutes for reentry. My camera loses focus of the rocket when it crosses 6000m on ascent, it\u0027s as if the camera lags behind the rocket. I reach 200,000m, decouple everything and reenter with only the pod, heatshield and chutes. The pod slows down to 300-ish m/s by the time it gets to 10,000m but then after 6000m again loses focus and just drops dead to the ground, despite deploying chutes.
