It was less safe with not escape tower, crew on the side rather then top of the highly flammable/explosive fuel/ox tanks, large solid fuel boosters. It could only haul a 1/5-1/6 of the cargo to orbit and could not bring cargo beyond LEO. Worse off either with or without development cost counted the Space Shuttle turned out to be TWICE as expensive per lbs to orbit as the Saturn V. Sure had the space shuttle worked as promised with 50 flights a year per shuttle and all, then its cost would have been low enough to make it worth it but as it turn out it did not fly much more per year then its predecessor and because it was a far more complex and costly machine ended up costing more. How the engineers and adminstators at the time could claimed such turn over and safety was possible with the shuttle was possible is amazing: it was either a bold face lie or pure unadulterated delusion, or most likely a combination of both. Richard Feynmann\u0027s comments post Challanger is all to clear on this: \u0022For a successful technology, reality must take precedence over public relations, for nature cannot be fooled.\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the end of the Apollo program they had already made Apollo capsules that could have held 5 people, potential 6 (at the sacrifice of cargo) and studies to enlarge the capsule to hold even more. Saturn V could and did launch a space station, and just 5 of such launched could have assembled a station of weight equal to or greater then IST, compared to 50\u002B shuttle flights! There was even plans to make a skylab II by reusing a S-II stage of the Saturn V after depleting it of fuel to get to orbit to make a habitable 10 m in diameter gigantic space station that would have weighed over 100 tons and had the habitable volume of over 4-5 skylabs or 2 international space stations! There was much study into making downgraded Saturn V that would have skipped on the second stage, and reduced the number of engines on the first stage to 4 or 3 depending on engine upgrades and had a lift capacity of ~45 tons perfect for launching a Apollo command module plus \u002B20 tons of cargo to orbit. Such a \u0022Saturn IV/III\u0022 could have hauled modules to a spacestation just like the shuttle. In fact the only thing the Saturn V could not do was return large amounts of cargo from orbit, a capacity which was not needed much anyway, unmanned Apollo could have returned 1-3 tons of pressurized cargo but no unpressurised cargo. In exchange the Saturn V could (did) haul mission straight to the moon and could have thrown 45 tons to earth escape, potentially to Mars. Upgrades to the Saturn V F1 engine was already available by the end of the Apollo program that combined with extensions to each stage could have raised the life capacity from ~120 tons to 137, 145 and 160 tons to LEO or over 60 tons to Earth Escape. Even LEO capacities beyond 200 tons with solid fuel boosters attached were examined and optional all that was needed was the funding. Thus a whole family of rockets could have been built off the same assembly line with a range of capacities that could have fit different mission, many of which far beyond anything the space shuttle could have done. All that was needed was instead of wasting the money on developing and building the space shuttle, focusing it instead on keeping the Saturn V assembly alive and diversifying it functions plus continued manned exploration of the moon and beyond, for the same price! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in short the space shuttle ruined us, it was the wrong decision to drop billions of dollars in infrastructure invested in the Saturn V to gamble it all on the space shuttle, we lost that bet, all of humanity in fact. The space shuttle convinced everyone that space travel for humans is too expensive and too unsafe, robotic missions have faired better but will ultimately lead to the obsolescence of humans in space and thus trapping humanity on earth forever until our eventual extinction. Because we did not build an initial foot hold in space for humanity over the last decades, we may never now. thus quite possible the Space Shuttle is the greatest failure for humanity EVER.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Temstar","CreatedById":24430,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-10T01:40:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHindsight is 20/20, so some leeway should be given to the original decision to go for the shuttle.
