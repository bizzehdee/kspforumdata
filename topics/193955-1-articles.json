By default, when you \u003Cstrong\u003Edon\u0027t\u003C/strong\u003E have a communications link to a control point, you can use the probe core\u0027s autopilot modes like point prograde/retrograde and toggle thrust on (full) and off. When you \u003Cstrong\u003Edo \u003C/strong\u003Ehave a communications link, you can pilot it manually.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut what about signal delay? Provided I have a direct connection from Kerbin to Duna, the signal still has to travel at \u003Cem\u003Eleast \u003C/em\u003E7 billion meters, and at the speed of light that is 23 seconds of lag. That\u0027s too much latency to manually pilot a landing, I say!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would seem complex maneuvers would have to be pre-programmed and flown completely on autopilot. Communication links would be for sending data back and for giving probes general instructions like \u0022stay in orbit\u0022 or \u0022go ahead with your pre-programmed landing sequence in 2 hours\u0022. Losing communications relay while manually piloting your landing and being switched to the limited mode seems to make the least sense of all. Not saying I hate it -- it serves a gameplay purpose.
