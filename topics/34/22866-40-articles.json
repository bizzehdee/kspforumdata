I\u0027m saying its easier to make a sub than a battleship now (Who would of imagined this all happening in KSP of all games!). It just really urked me that you just went ahead and focused more on that side project than what people, at least the way I perceived it, wanted something else. It would be a different story if you had just released it without, you know, making a poll, which was pretty much pointless by the looks of it. Really, why have a poll if you are just going to go ahead and make what you want? I\u0027m not at all saying your required to appease the fans all the time, but I would assume that the whole point of the poll was to see what the fans really wanted, and after being open forever with no real definite closing date or cut off (another odd issue to be found), it seemed to be almost disregarded entirely. Even when Naval Aircraft parts was winning the polls by a longshot, you were posting update pictures about subs. Even when weapons was pulling ahead, and currently maintaining a lead, you release some sub parts and a missile.
