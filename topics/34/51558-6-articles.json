This mod adds filters to every source. That\u0027s why part count and mods have an effect on performance here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* The plugin creates up to 3 audio filters for every audio source loaded within the scene and adjusts them every frame. This is a big hit to performance, coupled with the above. This can be fixed with a smart bit of code to silence most parts and manipulate only the most relevant (loudest). I haven\u0027t really thought about how to do this because I was hoping some bugs in KSP got fixed before I tackled this again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Filters are adjusted inline with the frame updating in no particular order with what other mods may be doing.
