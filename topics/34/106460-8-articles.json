I don\u0027t know how that engine performs in a 1.25m scale, but I would imagine it\u0027s heat production will outstrip the 1.25m AHMS ability to soak and dissipate the heat even with radiators. You could try tweakscaling down the 2.5m AHMS to go with it, but I don\u0027t know if that will work either.\n\nThe thermal washer helps keep the heat contained to the engine block of the ship, but I suppose it is not entirely necessary. Heat sinks are just blocks of metal that heat up via conduction, so if you find the AHMS and radiators are regularly getting hot enough to start glowing (they are around 1000k when they do that, to let you know you\u0027re pushing it), it might help to have it.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-05T14:39:11Z\u0022 title=\u002201/05/2016 02:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 5, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Randazzo**"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-08T21:08:34Z","Content":"Quick question - is this mod just about parts, or it enforces its own heat managing?
