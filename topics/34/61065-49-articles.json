I\u0027m a bit reluctant to do this for a few reasons: First it\u0027s a tedious task, no fun at all from a programmers point of view. Second we need a migration path. And then there is a chance for new bugs that will cause data loss.

I\u0027m not sure what vers of KSP you are on but I noticed after .25 on my x64 linux that some mods don\u0027t work right on first install. Just randomly uninstalling then re-installing them worked. Toolbar 1.7.7 didn\u0027t work for me at all for a while, then one day I redownloaded it, just curious and it worked. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt might be something else entirely, Im no expert. However I do think at this point this mod needs to integrate into the persistence file. Kerbal Alarm clock finally did.
