If EL could be reworked so player can attach KAS/KIS AS/B containers to EL platform (or to be more precise an assembly module) it could churn out whatever parts are needed. From my non-developer standpoint this much may be possible without too much (re)coding. However, this method of manufacture (mass repetition or chain of different singular parts) has to have an build menu window that will enable player to order multiple items that can be then manufactured either in strict order or by skipping down the order list until available resources match the ordered item.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOpinions ?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-12T23:55:22Z\u0022 title=\u002205/12/2015 11:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by fatcargo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Ebutter fingers\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T00:27:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Efatcargo - there\u0027s a mod out there that does transform rocketparts into KIS container contents, something something workshop (forgot the name)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Destroyer","CreatedById":36109,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T05:36:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi!

Once I installed \u003Cem\u003ECivilian Population\u003C/em\u003E, the bug reappeared. That was rather odd, I thought, since I had previously checked whether it was \u003Cem\u003ECP\u003C/em\u003E that was causing the bug in the first place, and came to the conclusion that it, in fact, was not. I decided to remove \u003Cem\u003EEL\u003C/em\u003E to see if that would change anything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESurprisingly enough, the bug once again disappeared (\u003Cem\u003ECP\u003C/em\u003E installed, \u003Cem\u003EEL\u003C/em\u003E removed). I did a few more tests, and came to the realization that the two mods interfere with each other (which I find ironic, given that the two mods supplement each other).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis leads me to turn, once again, to you, \u003Cstrong\u003Etaniwha\u003C/strong\u003E, in a desperate cry for help. Is there anything at all, that you can do about this? (the mods seem to share 2 files: \u003Cem\u003EKSPAPIExtensions.dll\u003C/em\u003E and\u003Cem\u003E Launchpad.dll\u003C/em\u003E, if that helps in any way).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EP.S.\u003C/em\u003E I will post the bug on \u003Cem\u003ECP\u003C/em\u003E thread, but I doubt the author will do anything about it soon enough, as he stated he was taking a break.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSPAPIExtensions is ok to have mulitple copies of(it checks when KSP starts to use the latest version of all version in the gamedata directory). but Launchpad is a EPL file, Id definitely say that is where your issue is coming from, and its an issue that the Civilian population dev would have to address.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Did you try just deleteing the launchpad.dll from the CP directory?
