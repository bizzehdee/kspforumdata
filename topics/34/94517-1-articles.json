The issue is in the lack of a significant body. I have always maintained that the \u0022body\u0022 of a kerbal is little more than a \u0022hub\u0022 of some sort for the attachment of their limbs. The rest of the inner \u0022body\u0022 is then contained within the cranial cavity. One theory that I like is that they breathe through their eyes, which seem to be lidless. If this is true, then reproduction must either happen within the cranium as well, or the kerbal might be an egg-layer. Also, considering there are very few differences between the male and female kerbal, if indeed there \u003Cem\u003Eare\u003C/em\u003E any physical attributes to differentiate them besides their preference in aesthetics, the issue of genetic diversity becomes an important question. One thought is that every kerbal has the dormant genes to produce an unlimited number of variations, or we must assume that some sort of \u0022exchange\u0022 is made in which either one or the other kerbal (we cannot assume that they even \u003Cem\u003Ehave\u003C/em\u003E a specific sexual-physical orientation that is always used to produce the offspring) combines the elements within their own body and generates a new kerbal as the output, or that an \u0022egg\u0022 of some sort is then given the opposing genetic material and absorbs it before hardening for the growth period (think fish laying eggs, and then \u0022spraying\u0022 the genetic data over the eggs.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the latter rings true, then one \u0022production\u0022 kerbal could receive the genetic diversity data from a number of donor kerbals and spread the new data between a number of potential kerbal \u0022eggs\u0022 to ensure the stability of the bloodline. The question that comes to mind is this: do kerbals \u0022mate\u0022 at all and, if so, do they mate for life or do they mate as a social activity?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuestions within questions, and no answers to speak of.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rabidninjawombat","CreatedById":108889,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-27T20:52:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022dbmorpher\u0022 data-cite=\u0022dbmorpher\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ECould you post your source file please?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Source Code is in the download. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf its all cool with your Strideknight I was gonna make a new part to use with your plugin \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wanted to integrate it into MKS, so that it uses a significant amount of recourses used in MKS.

I would suspect that this would include a rudimentary form of genetic memory, allowing the new kerbal to not only share attributes from the parent, but also come pre-packaged with some of the skills that the parent possessed, minus the experience which would have to be experienced first hand by the new organism. As for genetic exchange, the... um... Floral Seeding Room?... would have the secondary purpose of gathering donations from other kerbals who are unwilling or unable to produce seedlings (Kerbal-Kones? okay, now we\u0027re getting ridiculous) but wish to help maintain the genetic diversity of the species. Kerbals who are ready to produce the next generation have only to enter the pod (hey, some plants produce a pod for their seeds, so it kinda fits as a name for the room... \u003Cem\u003Efocus Gaalidas.... that\u0027s not the point we\u0027re making here...\u003C/em\u003E) and activate an exchange program and wait for the seedling production process to complete while enjoying a nice hibernation for a few days or so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot only would this help repopulate an off-world colony, but could also help with air-recycling systems.
