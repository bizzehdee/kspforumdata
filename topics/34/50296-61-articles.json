Back again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo after some deliberate testing, I have at least narrowed down the part in question that seems to be giving me heartache, the Huey Main Rotor I have from the KAX pack. Essentially what seems to be happening is after activating the part, the rotors start to spin, which from the dev Keptin states actually rotates physical rotors. So the problem I talked about before, the flight was relatively slow, no more than maybe 50-70m/s surface, but the rotor was set to 100%. The rotor itself without any throttle seems to reach very hot, so this issue can occur on the ground as far as I know, but I haven\u0027t tested that. However I should mention as I did with the others, Firespitter propellers don\u0027t seem to have any issues with heating, regardless of throttle, and I\u0027m not sure they are physically rotating, as they don\u0027t heat up unless throttle is applied... any ideas?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Drew Kerman","CreatedById":103177,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-26T13:27:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eanyone ride an asteroid into Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere?
