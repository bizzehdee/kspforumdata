I\u0027ve tried to build a few things in your style and while I\u0027m happy with the design the drag on the wings always hurts. If I use the pWing as a panel it forces the aerodynamic forces to the inside and not down the piece like a normal wing.

Also double your control surfaces (place them one on top of each other) this will help alot with control when operating your pwing craft.  Add nose cones inside of your craft this will certainly reduce some of the drag, fairings work even better but are difficult to use i had success with Procedural Parts nose cones as well. Keep in mind symmetry is very important if u leave a wing/panel angled u have to compensate for that with a pwing angled in the opposite direction or u will end up with huge aero issues such as ur crafts having a clear tendency to nose down or up. Another important thing, sometimes, some pwings crafts will promptly explode on the runway, if they do it is worth reverting to launch sometimes that fixes it."}]}
