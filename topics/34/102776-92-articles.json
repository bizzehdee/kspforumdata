Although there was certainly artistic license taken in some cases, for the most part I tried to make sure there was real life justification behind what we did.  For instance, we have a couple celestial bodies with methane lakes and another with a liquid nitrogen ocean.  For those I made certain the temperature and atmospheric pressure on those bodies was adequate to support those liquids on the surface.  There are a few things we did that are borderline, but if something was way out of the realm of possibility, we didn\u0027t do it.  We tried to balance realism with just making it cool and fun.  Both GPP and JNSQ lean more toward realism than does stock KSP.  The things in stock that have always bugged me for not being very realistic were fixed in JNSQ.\n\nI can see the logic behind what was done in New Horizons, and for the most part it make sense.  I\u0027m not going to criticize it for not being realistic because it was never intended to be ultra realistic.  It\u0027s a *simple* reorganization of the stock bodies to provide something new and different.  In that regard it succeeds wonderfully.\n\nIt goes without saying that if a body is moved from the outer system to the inner solar system, or vice versa, its temperature and atmosphere is going to change.  But the original designer wasn\u0027t concerned with that.  He just wanted to take a body that everyone knew and was familiar with and put it in a different location.  No other changes where made other than the relocation.  I find no fault with that, it served a purpose.  But now that I\u0027m redoing the atmospheres in a more realistic manner, some of the issues that were previously ignored are starting to surface.\n\nBy the way, I\u0027m changing the atmospheres via a patch file rather than editing the original configs.  That way if somebody wants to play New Horizons using the legacy atmospheres, they can just delete my file and it will go back to the way it was.  (Though there are a few things in the original configs that should be fixed regardless.)  \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-01-04T06:36:10Z\u0022 title=\u002201/04/2020 06:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 4, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by OhioBob**"},{"CreatedByName":"AVaughan","CreatedById":152784,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-01-04T09:17:22Z","Content":"Would it make sense to raise lower solar radiation flux a little, and to compensate add methane/CO2 to Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere to give it a greenhouse effect?
