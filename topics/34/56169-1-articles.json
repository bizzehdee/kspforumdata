I\u0027m not sure what \u0022Average Thrust Position\u0022 does, but based on skimming the code, it looks like you simulate the engine cylinder by cylinder?It might be worthwhile to have the draw of resources to be smoothed out the same way, as it\u0027s pretty jumpy at the moment. RPM will increase when a cylinder fires and RPM decreases due to \u0022power loss\u0022. I think I understand enough of what the code is doing to realize that this is a potentially major overhaul, but having power be based on RPM allows other options, like residual power after engine failure, providing incentive to windmill a failed engine etc.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKujuman, Nice pic! I\u0027m glad you like it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll try to answer your items here. Average thrust position is what allows you to fly with one engine on the wing and the other two engines off (in your tri-plane, fokker or ford? hehe). Without it, you\u0027d spin around and have a bad day.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI agree the resource display is choppy, but don\u0027t worry the usage rate is good.

Again my goal was to make something more engaging and slightly more realistic. I felt this was a good compromise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is some residual power, it doesn\u0027t flat-line the power output between each firing. I had issues with jumpy power so I added code to smooth the delivery out. Incentive to windmill can also be that with an ICE engine if you notice an oil leak, you\u0027ll want to shut it off before it runs out, seizing or total engine destruction can take place.
