It is not much, but it adds a couple of tons of payload it\u0027s able to lift using Puddles when resized to size4.

It is made of thin (4mm) aluminum sheets, contains steel hydraulic cylinders, accumulators and machinery, heavy reaction wheel, fuel tanks and so on. Yet it weights only 24.8t without fuels. It is ~78kg per cubic meter. Less dense then most of plastic foams!

Yes, stock parts are not big enough, they are limited to size3, and you\u0027re talking about size4 part. But, as we may guess, it\u0027s temporary -- KSP is developing rapidly and the Squad adds new parts. There are also many mods that provide such parts already.

About storage space: if you park your car into a garage which will still have some space to the right of the car, to the left, a little above and a little behind... and the summed volume of these spaces will, in theory, be enough to park another car there, will you actually be able to park another one? You see, the hangar volume (and the used percentage) is calculated only for reference. The actual storage algorithm considers geometries of a hangar and stored vessels.
