And since this is a \u0022NAV Ball\u0022 mod I figure I may as well ask for this to be included in it, as this info should have been displayed here in vanilla KSP in my opinion. Also just because it is available in other mods does not mean it should not be included. if implemented in this way it does not detract from anything, if you do not want to use it, just ignore it, as it will be just another display in the cycle that this window already cycles with.
