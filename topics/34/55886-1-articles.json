I approached AIES as an engineer that already had the stock parts and was trying to fill in gaps and specialized needs - particularly around the constraints that RT2 imposes. So there\u0027s a dedicated ascent antenna, there\u0027s a few that are light/low power (seemingly overpowered) to serve as fallback comm links, but can\u0027t transmit science. There\u0027s a small moderate power deployable omni antenna that has exceptionally long range (can do Mun-Kerbin) but shows up very late in the tech tree, so when you\u0027re building your big geostationary nets and doing more interesting things, you don\u0027t need to put quite so much effort into same-SOI communications. It\u0027s too late to make Mun missions easier, because they\u0027ll already be easy, but it makes setting up that Jool relay easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll be looking at the LLL parts with the same eye. They\u0027re typically better suited for ground use or large manned craft, so I\u0027ll probably look more at high power consumption/high science throughput. We\u0027ll see what .23 does to that part of the game next week. I know some players choose their antenna more for aesthetics, but I think it\u0027s good to have a variety of functionality to choose across as well. I don\u0027t want that big ground station at the north pole limited to science transfer at the same rate as some ship sending data back from Pol that presumably is very sensitive to power throughput.
