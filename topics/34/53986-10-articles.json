I\u0027m using the @PART[*]:HAS[#CrewCapacity[1]] approach so I can cover all pods and not have to explicitly support each and every new pod that comes out. I\u0027m also using this approach to create a .cfg for adding TAC Life Support to pods that don\u0027t already support it (to allow for specific pods to be defined with different values for food/water etc... since that doesn\u0027t feel like it should always be the same across the board -- what if someone wants to make a food-engorged rescue module?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will definitely post my little collection of .cfgs once I get these last bits hammered out (minus any .cfgs I got from NathanKell that\u0027ll be included in the next RO release anyways).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENathanKell: Consider moving the LifeSupportModule additions in the FASA.cfg entries since not everyone uses the same life support mod.
