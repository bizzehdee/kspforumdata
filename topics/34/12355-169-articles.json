In order to increase the precision of the simulation the simulation\u0027s time step is now variable, depending on how long it takes, (with a view to being able to do at least 5 simulations per second) If you have a fast computer then you will get a shorter timestep (and hence a more accurate simulation) and as you get closer to landing the simulation comes to an end sooner, and so takes less time and so becomes more accurate. However, now I think about it, the simulation times out after a certain number of time steps, so if your computer is fast, and the timestep is small then it could time out before the simulation lands / aerobreak completes. I did my development on a rubbish old laptop as I do not have lots of money for a swankie fast machine, so I have not been able to test that situation.
