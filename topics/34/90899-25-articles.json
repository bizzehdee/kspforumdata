The thrust it produces as far as making the ship move is negligible.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is all based on how we move the krakensbane frame with your ship in it.

I mean is there a way to make the single-part transforming warp drive at this link function like the warp drive from your mod? I think it was originally made for Interstellar ages ago, but I don\u0027t like all the crazy fuels that mod adds. I like the way you warp drive functions better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/43839-0-25-KSP-Interstellar-(Magnetic-Nozzles-ISRU-Revamp)-Version-0-13/page144?p=685428#post685428\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/43839-0-25-KSP-Interstellar-(Magnetic-Nozzles-ISRU-Revamp)-Version-0-13/page144?p=685428#post685428\u003C/a\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPart download here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download/ewkw5zkzuss6s2h/WarpDrive2.7z\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www./download/ewkw5zkzuss6s2h/WarpDrive2.7z\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceLaunchSystem","CreatedById":125698,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-18T01:50:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Arron Rift\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Arron Rift\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/US1FiTvP5eU?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI stumbled on this craft, and I was wondering: Could this warp drive me made to work just like yours does?

I don\u0027t think you need to worry about permissions unless you plan to distribute your modifications. Even then I think you can even tell people the steps to then modify their own copies, as long as you don\u0027t give it to them directly. For example, I never really liked the octopuses on the Hooligan Labs blimps, so I went in and managed to photoshop them all out without issues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETell me how it goes, I may like some help modifying mine if it works, I don\u0027t have much experience with config files \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
