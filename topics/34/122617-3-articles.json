Throw the part into the wagon (or attach it to the back of the flatbed) and take it wherever it needs to go to be constructed. I was literally salvaging my spent supply transport landers and combining them to construct new rockets. The 2.5m parts tend to be pretty heavy, but so long as the fuel tanks are empty you can KAS construct most things with 3-4 kerbals.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESounds cool. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E I have some ideas beyond rovers that will fit the Buffalo nicely and facilitate more rapid planetary travel..\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Angelo Kerman","CreatedById":106975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-17T02:12:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELatest version is \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/Angel-125/Buffalo/releases/tag/v0.1.3\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eavailable here\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m out for the weekend, enjoy! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E0.1.3\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith this update, the Buffalo also gets some new additions; some mini RCS motors (with sound effects!) and a couple of animated arms (static animations, sorry) to help with asteroid exploration.

Sorry, no custom wheels- yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENew parts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Added the 5-Way Mini RCS Thruster. This is particularly helpful for exploration craft maneuvering around large objects like asteroids. It even has sound effects! You can change the volume or disable the sound effects by opening the Settings window. To do that, press Mod B simultaneously (Mod is the Modifier key, which defaults to Alt on Windows).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Added the Buffalo Grappler Arm. Just like the stock Advanced Grabbing Unit, the Grappler Arm is useful for grabbing things like asteroids.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Added the Asteroid Resource Composition Scanner (ARCS). This arm works like the stock Surface Scanning Module, but only for asteroids. However, it tells you the entire composition of an asteroid instead of just its Ore content. Simply right-click on the part and click Scan Asteroid to get its composition.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBuffalo Crew Cab \u0026amp; Wagon\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The integrated solar panels are now more durable.
