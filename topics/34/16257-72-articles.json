To solve my issue, I decided to make a couple quick fixes for version 0.5.0.1 that address the most annoying compatibility problems with 0.21.1:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Flight computer now recognizes all new reaction wheel modules when calculating available torque. This will allow the flight controller to properly control your rockets without burning away all your RCS. Note that the flight computer does not actually calculate the available torque in the direction it plans to rotate, but rather it averages the pitch, yaw, and roll power of the reaction wheel module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- KSP default SAS and Flight Computer KillRot can now be toggled independently. Flight Computer KillRot is now only enabled by pressing the GUI button (SAS shortcut key will only toggle default KSP SAS).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe code is hosted on \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/alexcraig/RemoteTech\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EGitHub\u003C/a\u003E.

I\u0027m still pretty sure the problem isn\u0027t in my code. I believe the issue is actually something to do with the probe compatibility patch from the original post, and some sort of issue with ModuleManager. Check if the \u0022Remote Control\u0022 and \u0022SAS-Equipped\u0022 flags are being displayed on the same text line on your pod pieces in the ship builder. If this is the case, the stock game is not recognizing that your ship is SAS-Equipped because ModuleManager has mangled the flag name. I never noticed this because my ships tend to feature the inline reaction wheels, which wouldn\u0027t be affected by this. In any case, using your provided configs and probe compatibility patch my SAS works as intended (\u0022T\u0022 toggles stock SAS, KillRot is entirely separate and is enabled if the GUI button is highlighted green).
