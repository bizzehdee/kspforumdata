I guess the problem is that you\u0027re storing data on the kerbal\u0027s main object, whereas the norm for other mods seems to be to create their own data structure and store their specific information there.

It doesn\u0027t affect galactic radiation or parts radiation. Planets also have simplified magnetospheres that reduce radiation when flying low over them.

The question is: imagine I just made a 80 days trip and am ready to return the crew back to the ground.\u00A0 I move the two kerbals to the escape capsule and detach it, leaving the rest of the spacecraft behind (and with it, it\u0027s roomy interior space).

I haven\u0027t tested DF a lot, so let me know if you encounter any issues.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Kerbal Health is built around Health Points; days counter is there just for your convenience. So in your example the kerbals have lost 80% of their \u0022health buffer\u0022\u00A0by\u00A0the time the counter says 20 days. If the small capsule allows for 2 days stay only for a healthy kerbal, it will therefore allow 20% x 2 days = 0.4 days = 2 hours 24 minutes for these two guys.
