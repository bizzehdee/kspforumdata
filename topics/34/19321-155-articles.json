That is the very definition of what it is to cheat. It\u0027s to do something dishonest to gain advantage over someone else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, in the case of your post, simply not using FAR\u0027s aerodynamic model and instead using that of the stock game is not cheating. Maybe, at most, you could suggest that such a person is depriving themselves of a \u0022full\u0022 experience, whatever you might consider that to be, but that is highly, highly, subjective. The notion of cheating is not subjective, because it is used in context of an unfair advantage being gained through dishonest/deceitful means over another person, where a fair playing field, as it were, was expected. By saying that someone simply not using FAR is therefore cheating is wildly inaccurate. Hell, you could say the very reverse, that using FAR is actually \u0022cheating\u0022 because it significantly reduces delta-v necessary to reach orbit, and be just as wrong. For someone to cheat, there had to be established rules that that person is breaking in order to gain unfair advantage over other persons. An analogy: An athlete who arranges that their weights be replaces with look-alike versions that are lighter in a weightlifting competition, such that their recorded lift was in reality less than the weight recorded, is cheating. A person who does the very same at home outside that context, is not cheating. Maybe they\u0027re being a little silly yes, by patting themselves on the back for lifting fake weights, but they are not cheating. Depriving themselves of more meaningful exercise or a particular accomplishment through honest means, but not cheating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe notion of cheating in KSP should only be brought-up in relation to challenges or competitions where two (or more) persons directly compete against each other. \u003Cstrong\u003EThen\u003C/strong\u003E it may be accurate to assert that one person using FAR, or not, is cheating, especially if the rules of such a competition or challenge explicitly prohibit, or require, the use of FAR, respectively. Outside of that context, anyone claiming that anything is \u0022cheating\u0022 doesn\u0027t know the meaning of the word, and/or is not articulating their meaning adequately.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-23T22:23:57Z\u0022 title=\u002204/23/2014 10:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 23, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by phoenix_ca\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Read have Read","CreatedById":60863,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-24T05:30:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Long Telus Mobility bay ladder is generating 90kN of drag at mach 1.5, while the much larger surface mount ladder above it only generates 20kN of drag.

First I used my usual descent path, can\u0027t tell you to be exact but it is usually quite steep... The heat shield seems to generate almost NO drag, and it takes A LONG time for the drag to build up so that by the time the drag builds to around 15kn the craft has already crashed into the ground, So I tried a very gentle descent to build up as much drag as possible, started from 150km and set periapsis to 30km, that time the shielding couldn\u0027t take the heat and blew up then the rest blew up from heat, third time I tried again from 150km and set periapsis to 15km, this time it did slow down but was still going at around 1600m/s when entering the lower atmosphere, the heat shielding blew up THEN i noticed whats been happening! The heat shield generates almost no drag, and the 2 mystery goo containers apparently generate 20kn each.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason my whole craft is exploding and I can\u0027t seem to land the ship is \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA. The shielding isn\u0027t generating enough drag \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand B. When the shielding explodes, the shock from going from almost no drag, to the drag of the mk1 causes the G forces to explode everything... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo is this an issue I need to get fixed on FAR\u0027s end or on DE\u0027s end? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks a bunch \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ferram4","CreatedById":21328,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-24T22:08:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELet me guess, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/20451-0-23-5-Ferram-Aerospace-Research-v0-13-1-4-11-14?p=1090707\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1090707\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Esomething like this?\u003C/a\u003E You shouldn\u0027t have a heat shield attached to the Mk1 pod, it already has a built-in one.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"crimsonknight3","CreatedById":33086,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-24T22:15:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ferram4\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ferram4\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ELet me guess, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/20451-0-23-5-Ferram-Aerospace-Research-v0-13-1-4-11-14?p=1090707\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1090707\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Esomething like this?\u003C/a\u003E You shouldn\u0027t have a heat shield attached to the Mk1 pod, it already has a built-in one.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah that probably is the issue, I have it attached too flush (Just checked). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, for \u0022Shouldn\u0027t have a heat shield attached\u0022, IF I DIDN\u0027T attach a heat shield, my Mystery goo pods always explode, so even though the pod itself is fine, my science would be gone and I don\u0027t know how to get around it other than by attaching a second shield.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the quick reply \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ferram4","CreatedById":21328,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-24T22:39:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ve got a Kerbal on board, yes?
