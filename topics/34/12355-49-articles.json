I target Duna, then use the maneuver planner to set a Hohmann transfer to target. I don\u0027t really care about this node -- it\u0027s basically just a placeholder for the eventual final transfer node. What it does, though, is provide a node in the future at roughly the proper time for a transfer. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext, I fire up the helpful warp helper. I go to \u0022warp to next maneuver node\u0022... and set the lead time to be an hour. Then, warp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I do two things. First, you DELETE the transfer node. You don\u0027t need or want it. Then, you launch into your desired orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you\u0027re in your desired Kerbin orbit, bring up the maneuver planner (make sure you\u0027re still targeting Duna or whatever planet you\u0027re transferring to), and set a new Hohmann transfer to target. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVoila, your time to the node should be some number less than an hour. (For me, it\u0027s usually been about 45 minutes or so.) Which takes far less time to warp to at 50x. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is basically like using Protractor to wait until the theta is right; you\u0027re just letting MechJeb do all the work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-30T20:00:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks, that\u0027s a great tip !\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RuBisCO","CreatedById":59540,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-30T20:25:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMechJeb 2 has trouble landing on Gilly probably because Gilly terrain map is km above its \u0022surface\u0022.
