In the first image you can see the side with a very rough terrain profile. Don\u0027t try to land the big 3.25 m diameter bunker in there you will be bouncing off the bumpy asteroid surface all day. The second image shows the other side of the same asteroid. The big wide relatively flat and smooth terrain on this side is perfect for attaching the large bunker part. I put 4 RCS pods around the edge of the bunker and then just flew it in to land by itself. That seemed to be easier than pressing it against the asteroid while it was attached to a larger craft. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/KtLFW\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

Since I try to make contact at about the same m/s as a docking (0.15-0.2 m/s), there shouldn\u0027t be any \u0022stress fractures\u0022 from the connection. But don\u0027t rule that out -- as you said, the stock grabbers have their own problems, and I\u0027ve had breakages in docking ports from otherwise gentle bumps. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving any remaining sideways residual motion might be \u0022tearing\u0022 at the joints without us realizing it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BananaDealer","CreatedById":60684,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-09T03:09:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmmm...
