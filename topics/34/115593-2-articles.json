I may add a little greeble to the sloped part of the EUS, but I am planning a normal map to add a little extra detail. The interstage will have a normal map to add stringers, which may not be accurate but I think will add a little to the part. Here are a couple of renders:\n\nStacked:\n\n![WJsBuzy.png](http://i.imgur.com/WJsBuzy.png)\n\nFull EUS:\n\n![4d8SzMy.png](http://i.imgur.com/4d8SzMy.png)\n\nThe fairing plate is not pictured, but will be fully compatible with stock procedural fairings. I\u0027m going to test the plate with an extra floating top node for attaching the Orion as a few pictures I\u0027ve seen show an ability to house cargo beneath the Orion in the Block IB configuration as was done with the Apollo Saturn V stack. I\u0027m hoping that this node will not complicate using the plate to encapsulate cargo for Block II configurations so that the one part can be used for both vehicles. If it causes too many problems, then I will simply add a second plate strictly for cargo launches.\n\n**@AppleDavidJeans:** I tried a MechJeb ascent with the SLS craft provided in the download and was able to get the desired performance. I turned off everything in the ascent guidance module (including Auto-Staging and Auto Warp) and left the ascent path at the default values for the Automatic Altitude turn (turn starts at 3.5 km or velocity of 98.9 m/s and turn end at 60km) with the exception of the Turn shape, which I set at 25%. It flies to a 100km apoapsis with a little propellant remaining in the Core Stage and after it cuts the engines I stage away the core, LAS, and SM fairings and then warp to apoapsis where it performs the circularization burn leaving plenty of propellant in the ICPS for a free-return TMI burn with some propellant left over (not much but there was some).\n\nOn the SM \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00E2\u20AC v, I figured out what was going on. I updated the config for the SM, but not the craft files, so the provided craft is still using the old fuel load values. I\u0027ll post a quick update soon with an updated craft file and a with the data transmission ability added to the Orion CM.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-14T05:04:32Z\u0022 title=\u002207/14/2015 05:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TheShadow1138**"},{"CreatedByName":"Helmut_AUT","CreatedById":147762,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T10:14:44Z","Content":"Just saying thanks for this mod.

The nose cone will be a separate part with built-in separation motors, and of course the engines will be separate parts. I also forgot to mention before the F-1B is a 2.5m engine (it does stick out a tiny bit farther in a couple of places) so it should be good for lifting rather heavy 2.5m rockets.\n\n![Vym30BM.png](http://i.imgur.com/Vym30BM.png)\n\nThe booster itself is 3.25m in diameter, the reason for this will be apparent shortly. In looking for images of the proposed liquid boosters I found an image:\n\n![Z81.jpg](http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Z81.jpg)\n\nThat image shows the booster topped by an Ares I second stage and the Orion spacecraft. I had already considered making the Ares I upper stage (as I effectively have the Ares I first stage already released) since it would be at most three more parts. I further decided that the Ares I upper stage, should I make it, would have to be 3.25m in diameter because that was the diameter I chose for the widest part of the Orion spacecraft (the Ares I upper stage was to have conformed to the Orion\u0027s largest diameter, i.e. no bulges). So, I have decided that the update that includes the Block IB/II SLS components will also include the Ares I upper stage tank, J-2X engine, and a 3.25m interstage decoupler.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-16T05:09:12Z\u0022 title=\u002207/16/2015 05:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TheShadow1138**\n  \nadded Liquid booster render"},{"CreatedByName":"TheShadow1138","CreatedById":53694,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-17T02:33:01Z","Content":"Another quick progress render of the untextured J-2X next to the more detailed J-2 engine I made for my Saturn V animation:\n\n![xNOh4fs.png](http://i.imgur.com/xNOh4fs.png)\n\nThe J-2X is made with a 1.25m mounting plate."},{"CreatedByName":"komodo","CreatedById":102065,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-17T21:27:20Z","Content":"Looking Good!

This could be due to a mistake in where I have copied the effects from another engine. I have looked over the definitions multiple times and cannot find an error, but I\u0027ll keep looking.\n\nThe other issue is with the Ares I upper stage. If I set it on top of the 5-segemtn SRB, in the Ares I configuration, it will not survive a pitch maneuver at any velocity.

I set the initial numbers for the Black Paladins such that the Isp would yield the same burn time as the 5-segment SRBs, when in fact their burn time is faster so they were giving too much of a push (by Core Stage burnout, pitched well below the horizon, the apoapsis was above 100km).\n\nI haven\u0027t tested the liquid booster configuration as of yet, but I have tested the liquid boosters (LRB) in its proposed crew launch vehicle first stage with an Ares I upper stage (called the Anhur I upper stage in-game). With the right application of throttle it will easily place the Orion with little headache into a 100km orbit. The biggest thing surrounding the LRBs is the lack of mass data. I was able to calculate a propellant amount based on the thrust of the F-1Bs, their Isp, and using a burn time equal to the 5-segment SRBs (though I should probably scale it back to the same burn time as the Black Paladins), and then just picked a seemingly reasonable dry mass.\n\nWe now come to the biggest issue I\u0027ve had thus far with these new parts: the Ares I launcher. As I stated before the vehicle would not survive a pitch maneuver, as the SRM gimbaled and pitched the upper stage would not pitch at the same rate and be drug along. Once the pitch maneuver was stopped, the upper stage would continue pitching over until it began to bend almost, or completely, in half. Initially this would cause the vehicle to break up, but after I realized that the breakingForce and breakingTorque numbers were rather small and increased them it would simply bend and force the whole vehicle into a retrograde burn position nose down engine up. In short, all that did was keep the rocket from snapping in half. I have also tried turning down the \u0022angularDrag\u0022 parameter, which may have helped some, but not enough to make a difference. Thinking about it right now, when I replace the Orion spacecraft with something else of similar mass, but smaller diameter, this doesn\u0027t happen, or at least is controllable enough to made it to first stage burnout.\n\nI\u0027m going to make sure that the Block II SLS is more balanced that it seems to be at the moment, and once I\u0027m at that point I\u0027ll release the new parts, even if the Ares I still doesn\u0027t fly right. Or, I could release the Ares I upper stage parts so people can test it out for themselves and maybe help me find what\u0027s going wrong.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-01T02:07:44Z\u0022 title=\u002212/01/2015 02:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TheShadow1138**"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T17:11:26Z","Content":"I had similar pitch-over stability problems when I was designing my Orion-inspired parts.

I left the drag on the CM, SM, and ICPS at stock values, only the adapters and stuff had drag reduced.\n\u003E To the LAS/BPC I added (any lower and it would overheat and explode during ascent....):\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E     [TABLE=\u0022class: highlight tab-size js-file-line-container\u0022][TR][TD=\u0022class: blob-code blob-code-inner js-file-line\u0022]MODULE[/TD][/TR][TR][TD=\u0022class: blob-code blob-code-inner js-file-line\u0022]{[/TD][/TR][TR][TD=\u0022class: blob-code blob-code-inner js-file-line\u0022]    name = ModuleDragModifier[/TD][/TR][TR][TD=\u0022class: blob-code blob-code-inner js-file-line\u0022]    dragCubeName = Default[/TD][/TR][TR][TD=\u0022class: blob-code blob-code-inner js-file-line\u0022]    dragModifier = 0.5[/TD][/TR][TR][TD=\u0022class: blob-code blob-code-inner js-file-line\u0022]}[/TD][/TR][/TABLE]\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E and all of the structural adapters got:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E     [TABLE=\u0022class: highlight tab-size js-file-line-container\u0022][TR][TD=\u0022class: blob-code blob-code-inner js-file-line\u0022]MODULE[/TD][/TR][TR][TD=\u0022class: blob-code blob-code-inner js-file-line\u0022]{[/TD][/TR][TR][TD=\u0022class: blob-code blob-code-inner js-file-line\u0022]    name = ModuleDragModifier[/TD][/TR][TR][TD=\u0022class: blob-code blob-code-inner js-file-line\u0022]    dragCubeName = Default[/TD][/TR][TR][TD=\u0022class: blob-code blob-code-inner js-file-line\u0022]    dragModifier = 0.1[/TD][/TR][TR][TD=\u0022class: blob-code blob-code-inner js-file-line\u0022]}[/TD][/TR][/TABLE]\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Seemed to solve the initial problem for me.

I figured it would probably turn out to be either a drag or mass distribution issue, or at least I hope it turns out that way. Yeah, I thought I had read where those parameters (maxDrag/minDrag/angularDrag) had been put into disuse with the updated aerodynamics.

Shadowmage\u0027s suggestion does seem to have helped. When the Ares I upper stage is stacked on the SLS liquid boosters there is no longer any perceptible wobble. The Ares I, however, continues to persist in its wobble. With the thrust limited to 45% of full thrust ti develops a nasty wobble when flying straight up when it gets above 500 m/s, and it flips around at any pitch angle early on in the ascent around 100 m/s.

It seems that the adapter part was causing the problem, and I have no idea why (unless being a larger diameter at the top than at the bottom has an affect on a part\u0027s behavior). The realization came when I re-exported the Ares I upper stage from Unity to return it to its unaltered original state (I had changed the diameter of the collider in an attempt to fix the issue) and was testing it with the liquid booster first stage.
