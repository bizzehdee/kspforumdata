This is not a leak, this is on purpose, and those chunks will still be used. The memory is allocated and not released because otherwise you\u0027d all be complaining about hitching during voxelization because of the garbage collector. All of my tests indicate that the only memory leak I can find is a steady 10-20MB leak every editor -\u0026gt; flight -\u0026gt; editor cycle, which can be reproduced using a purely stock game. In addition, maximum memory usage of chunks on a FAR-default-settings install is capped at ~63 MB total, ever. If you\u0027re leaking above that, it\u0027s not me, it\u0027s the stock game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, yes, I just heard about the save file madness, I\u0027ll fix that.

Given how tall the pod is and the small size of the shield, this seems about right for a hyper-aggressive reentry to me.

Are you sure the total heat absorbed isn\u0027t that of the craft in total. Because I have not been talking about heat absorption, I have been talking about ablator used, and the higher the temps, the more ablator will be used, as natural convection isn\u0027t enough to lose the heat to the atmosphere. Thus bringing me back to, shallow angle = less ablator used, as the over all temps are lower, and more heat is lost to the atmosphere instead of the ablator, where as steep angle = more ablator, as the temps are higher, and less of it gets to be dissipated in the atmosphere, and those more needs to be dissipated through the ablator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf what I\u0027m saying is still wrong, then something very fundamental is wrong with my understand of physics (I will admit, its very rudimentary, so this is very likely), and doesn\u0027t explain how going in at shallow angles = less ablator used, and steep angles = more ablator used.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mockingking","CreatedById":6738,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T21:50:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022blub01\u0022 data-cite=\u0022blub01\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027d like to use FAR\u0027s better aerodynamics model, but my knowledge about aerodynamics is.. limited to say at best. is there a guide explaining how it works somewhere?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis, please.
