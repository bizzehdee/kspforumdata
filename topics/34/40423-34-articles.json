I actually bought KSP at version .18 after watching it for awhile because they introduced docking. It was and has continued to be the most important aspect of gameplay for me, as I end up building all of my larger vessels piece-by-piece in space. I would align my vessels North-South or another cardinal direction to set a \u0027known\u0027 alignment axis, but it always seemed like that one key piece of information was missing. The first versions of DPAI simply provided this single piece of information (well, that plus roll), and what a world of difference it made for me. I actually had DPAI up and working for personal use for a couple of weeks before deciding to release it publicly, not expecting many people would know what is was for, know how to use it, or care. Boy was I in for a surprise! Anyway, thanks for sharing. Hearing how it helps people always provides nice motivation for continuing to expand the mod \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-----------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I\u0027m assuming no news is good news, yes?

Well done.\u003Cp\u003EWondering, Would it be possible to write a patch for RPM so that it (RPM) used your names for the docking ports, instead of the default (confusing) ones?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA patch, no. That would have to be done from within RPM. I could figure it out and create a pull request for them to implement. But in all honesty I don\u0027t see myself releasing anything other than a bugfix until May/June due to time limitations. if that\u0027s something you\u0027d like to see, I would recommend bringing it up on the RPM thread and suggesting the feature to moarDV.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ricardo79\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Ricardo79\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI know that shouldn\u0027t be an issue about memory.
