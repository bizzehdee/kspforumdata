A few times, I managed to knock a simple explorer plane together, but when I click launch, instead of giving me a list of sites to choose from, it launches automatically (I see the game loading a runway)... and then it becomes unresponsive.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003EYou didn\u0027t promise anything for Win64, but I\u0027m running the game on OSX 10.9.3 Mavericks.

The reason I ask is that I want to use this but I am trying to reduce the footprint of the all-in-one down to just a few bases that I want for things like polar orbit launches, or convenient runways near a biome - but cut out the ones Im not using, in terms of resources loaded and used. It would be nice to have these individually managed, with a basic set of shared assets in Kerbal Konstructs being the primary install, then install by base. For example, if I wanted only the current KSC and the old KSC and the north pole, I\u0027d install (Via CKAN - I can do the netkan for them if these are hosted on KerbalStuff or Github) via CKAN checkboxes, KerbalKonstructs, KerbinSide-KSC, KerbinSide-OldKSC and KerbinSide-NorthPole (the latter 2 having a dependency on the former). This way only the bases Im using will get loaded, saving me resources and RAM. Meta- type things (like the fuel tanks) would stay the same, but some of the other mods would split up geographically.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould this be too complex? Or could I do this by going in and pruning the files for bases Im not using and likely never will use (like if I had been in the Navy and never wanted to see an aircraft carrier ever again even in a game)?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-20T08:10:22Z\u0022 title=\u002206/20/2015 08:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Murdabenne\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlphaAsh","CreatedById":105348,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T12:09:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Murdabenne\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Murdabenne\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E... words ...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s very slow progress, but KK is going to have support for something much like this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe concept is: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlayer A makes a cool base.

The rest got expanded. The number of assets on screen determines the number of draw-calls to the GPU.
