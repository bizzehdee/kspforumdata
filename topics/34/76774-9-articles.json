I\u0027ve recently done a nice map for the new oxygen-atmosphere moon of Cleathe (It needs one). If you don\u0027t like the idea of adding moons to this planet, you can add it as separate planet for the existing star systems... There\u0027s map and heightmap inside, use the map as colourmap too, and the normal map can be flat (If you need it, I can make one).
