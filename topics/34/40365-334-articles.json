Therefore, a new science experiment could be enabled with the IR telescope which is an Object Discovery experiment. It would enlarge the space in which asteroids are currently spawned. At present, it seems that they only spawn between Kerbin and Duna. This experiment could provide a means to spawn them either further out OR if you have the telescope in a different region of the Kerbol system, it would spawn the asteroids out there. So, if you had the space telescope in the orbit of Duna, you could start spawning rocks between in near-Duna orbits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBonus points if you can spawn even larger asteroids since KSPI technologies are probably the only things capable of moving such large rocks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuper-duper bonus science experiments with the IR telescope are to run an asteroid into Jool.

The thing is, they have been relying on reactors to power them since they are high part count ships and the multiple MW receivers really lag my comp down. It\u0027s a shame since I have such a nice MW Network. It wouldn\u0027t be such an issue if Infernal worked and I could just use 2 swiveling receivers.. and if I had a better computer. I think now with all of the angle calculations on the different receivers, and having the opening and closing animations going my framerate drops to about 30%. It also makes limiting power with the \u0022reception\u0022 slider a bit of a hassle. I have about 600GW of power in my near Kerbin network so I try to keep it regulated. Thermal receivers work perfectly fine with my framerate. \u003Cp\u003E So, I was thinking what is needed is an omnidirectional MW in line receiver (or near omnidirectional like the thermal receiver). It would be still be based in reality, and in fact could look really cool. Like a crystal prism with a solid (glowing?) center. Or maybe have it fold out? Maybe it would pick up certain axes better from different angles. It would cut down on on-screen animations and part count. It would have to be high up on the tech tree maybe experimental electrics or antimatter power. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I don\u0027t have the skills to make this and I wouldn\u0027t know if FractalUK would have the time, or even be interested, but it would be amazing if somebody were to agree with me and be able to do this.
