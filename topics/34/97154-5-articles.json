For example the max pitch is set to 20 degrees and the minimum is set to -20 degrees and the max vertical velocity is set to 10 m/s and -10 m/s. at 0 degrees (flatly oriented) the vertical velocity attempts to rest at 0. at a 20 degree pitch the vertical velocity rests at 10 m/s. at -20 degrees the velocity rests at -10 m/s. at 10 degrees the vertical velocity goes to 5 m/s because the angle is half of it\u0027s max so the velocity is half of its max.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E That\u0027s all, thanks for reading. i hope you implement these abilities. it would make piloting huge hovering vehicles much easier, especially those that must maintain a certain pitch and roll like heli-carriers, so that other vehicles don\u0027t fall off. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S. the multiple instances of the system, I believe, is a good idea. it would make take off and landing on a larger hovering vehicle certainly easier and I believe that my computer could easily handle many instances of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk, thanks again.

The \u0022full control\u0022 option would take, as suggested by the name, full control of the engines assigned to be under it(the option), with an alternate throttle assigned to those engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe throttle would be set to 100% so the thrust limiters your system works with would have all the thrust it needs to work. the user, then, could control vertical velocity with those engines and still steer with the main engines forward/backward/whatever direction, without worry of falling out of the sky when throttled down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure I understand your proposal. Could you post a picture or a .craft file of the vessel in question and describe which engines you want to control differently and how in particular? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Blarggnugget\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Blarggnugget\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnother suggestion would be pitch based altitude control where pitching up, while this option is active, would cause the upward engines to increase in power and attempt to make the craft ascend. this would also affect pitching down where doing so would not propel the craft down but decrease the thrust so the craft descended in a slower controlled manner. another addition to this option would be max pitch control, if you so choose to add, and max ascent/descent velocity control where when the user pitches up the maximum upward velocity that can be achieved is set, and anywhere within the min/max pitch that the user can rotate is a gradient of the max upward/downward velocity. For example the max pitch is set to 20 degrees and the minimum is set to -20 degrees and the max vertical velocity is set to 10 m/s and -10 m/s. at 0 degrees (flatly oriented) the vertical velocity attempts to rest at 0. at a 20 degree pitch the vertical velocity rests at 10 m/s. at -20 degrees the velocity rests at -10 m/s. at 10 degrees the vertical velocity goes to 5 m/s because the angle is half of it\u0027s max so the velocity is half of its max.\u003Cp\u003E That\u0027s all, thanks for reading. i hope you implement these abilities. it would make piloting huge hovering vehicles much easier, especially those that must maintain a certain pitch and roll like heli-carriers, so that other vehicles don\u0027t fall off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo basically you propose the same mechanism that exists now with the MainThrottle that controls vertical speed, but instead of the MT you want to use Pitch value.
