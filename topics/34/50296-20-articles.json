DRE works fine in my tests, even on hard mode. I don\u0027t use RSS, but think it is totally OK by itself. But the combination of both DRE and RSS is lethal. Now, that makes totally sense: spacefaring from Kerbin is much easier than from Earth. The re-entry speed of 5500m/s you measured is totally within the range of speeds for ICBMs IRL.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I don\u0027t think IRL it would be possible to use a ICBM to deploy cargo. The warheads can arrive intact because optimized in size and profile so to cut through atmosphere at extreme speed, actually almost insensitive to drag (drag would increase CEP, Circular Error Probability). Your payload however isn\u0027t designed to sustain lithobraking at Mach 10 or more, so you want to decelerate before. The best way to decelerate at such speed is by aerobraking, but to do so properly your reentry profile must be shallow, while ICBM warheads go down deep. Problem is, with any suborbital profile you don\u0027t get a shallow reentry: to do so you need to get to orbital speed, then go retrograde more or less when over the antipode of the place you want to \u0022hit\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nothke","CreatedById":51185,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-03T03:51:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ferram4\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ferram4\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E@nothke: \u003C/strong\u003EThat looks about right for a bow shock in Mach ~1.4 flow; try to make the shock tend towards the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mach_angle\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMach angle\u003C/a\u003E as it heads away from the craft, and make it a little tighter around the object.\u003Cp\u003EAs an idea of what you should be going for:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBullet shadowgraph, Mach ~1.5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApollo capsule CFD simulation, 14 degree AoA, Mach 4.9\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMercury capsule shadowgraph, Mach ~3\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat you have is a good starting point, but it needs a little bit of tweaking; perhaps an animation that is set to vary with Mach number could be used for this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI used a similar Schlieren shadowgraph (this one \u003Ca href=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/23/Blunt_body_reentry_shapes.png/709px-Blunt_body_reentry_shapes.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/23/Blunt_body_reentry_shapes.png/709px-Blunt_body_reentry_shapes.png\u003C/a\u003E) and \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/images/content/671874main_Testing%20of%20MEDLI%20Plug%20I_full.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Earc jet tests footage\u003C/a\u003E for the curvature. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/images/content/255960main_A-28916-3ratio_946-710.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/images/content/255960main_A-28916-3ratio_946-710.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe trick is that I didn\u0027t write any plugin =) I just made a \u0022shadow\u0022 mesh that is just in front of the heatshield.
