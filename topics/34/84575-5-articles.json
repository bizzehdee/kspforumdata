It will create an *active* GameObject and the RDNode and RDTech unity script init functions Awake and Start will get called. But those functions expect the correct values to already be set.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou have to new GameObject(\u0022newnode\u0022), then inactivate it, then AddComponent\u0026lt;RDNode\u0026gt; and AddComponent\u0026lt;RDTech\u0026gt;. Then set at least the prefab field. Now you have a working mostly blank GameObject to instantiate off of for your new nodes and you are free to setup those classes before calling setActive(true) on the instantiated objects. Also, because the RDNode init relies on RDTech being initialized first (a ksp bug, imo), you have to call the RDTech\u0027s start function before activating the GameObjects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, the classes are *clean* if you follow this procedure. You don\u0027t have to worry about what is hiding behind a half used object. All that is set is what you set, and you get to set it before unity inits the object. This is a major departure between TechManager and TreeLoader and is a big part of why my code is short and to the point. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ereturn Array.Find\u0026lt;RDNode\u0026gt; (AssetBase.RnDTechTree.GetTreeNodes(), x =\u0026gt; x.gameObject.name == \u0022node0_start\u0022);\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis never worked for me.

I don\u0027t remember if I made that change before or after figuring out the clean node creation procedure, it might not be necessary. The start node (or any stock node) is really only needed for the prefab and transform fields. If those have the same value both ways, then either way would be fine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConsider extending TechManager to derive the relevant properties from your ConfigNode system rather than extending ATC to create new nodes.
