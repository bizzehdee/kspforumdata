I took a look at the source, and if I\u0027m reading correctly, it\u0027s dividing the total delta V (of the total burn or the max the current stage allows - which is a very cool feature) by the average acceleration based on start and end masses. While that would be a better approximation than what the game does (which is equivalent to delta V divided by current acceleration), it\u0027s still the wrong answer. But I\u0027m not even seeing those results in the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, if I set up a node for a 2000m/s burn with a 284.395t ship using 20 nuke engines, KE shows a total burn time of 7m 54.0s, with a half burn time of 3m 57.0s. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApplying the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation shows that the burn would actually result in a final mass of 220.474t. That makes the starting acceleration 1200 / 284.395 = 4.219m/s^2, and the ending acceleration 1200 / 220.474 = 5.443m/s^2, for an average of 4.831m/s^2. Using the logic I\u0027m seeing in the source, that means it should be showing a total burn time of 2000 / 4.831 = 413.98s = 6m 53.98s. That\u0027s more than a minute off from what\u0027s showing in KE. The correct burn time, calculated from the rocket equation, is 418.47s, with half the delta V accomplished in 222.53s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know where the source of the error is, but I do have a suggestion for improving the result regardless. Assuming a correct mass delta figure can be retrieved from the vessel simulation (i.e. end mass minus start mass, the difference being fuel burned), that can be divided by the fuel consumption rate of the engines to calculate the correct time. The consumption rate (by mass) is simply thrust / Isp * 9.82. It doesn\u0027t matter what fuel type it is, either, as specific impulse is related to the mass of the fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in my example, 20 nuke engines have a thrust of 1200kN and a specific impulse of 800s, which means the consumption rate is 1200 / 800 * 9.82 = .15275t/sec. The mass delta for the example burn is 63.921t, which can be determined with a direct calculation (mass - mass * exp(-dV / (Isp * 9.82))) or a simulation (I wrote one into my burn time calculator, as a sanity check, that updates every millisecond and gets the same answer), so presumably the vessel simulator in KE will expose that information somewhere. Total time is then 63.921 / .15275 = 418.47s.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cybutek","CreatedById":32393,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-10T15:58:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks Thanny for looking into the problem and your detailed example.
