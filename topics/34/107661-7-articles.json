The situations you mentioned were once removed, but then it came out that it is possible to be landed in a water biome and splashed in a land biome.  You may need to tell the completionist to take a Valium, but the fact remains that all of those situations exist and can be found in the game.  For example, there are places where the ground dips below 0m; these always have water, but may not have a water biome.  That\u0027s how you get \u0027splashed in mountains\u0027, for example.

I really would not like it if I had to manually keep track of all the science in my career games!  \n\n(Also thank you to [@Bodrick](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/124114-bodrick/) for creating the mod in the first place - if he is still around).  \n\nNow I do have a question that is related to development as I\u0027ve recently become a modder myself:  \n\n[x]-Science has a class TextureHelper that provides a method to simplify loading of textures from embedded resources.  \n\nI tried to replicate what that method does, but I can\u0027t figure out the code on [Line 22](https://github.com/thewebbooth/KSP-X-Science/blob/master/X-Science/TextureHelper.cs#L22)\n\n    var iconStream = Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().GetManifestResourceStream(resource).ReadToEnd();\n\nMonoDevelop complains that *System.IO.Stream* does not have a *ReadToEnd()* method - and of course there is no such method according to the .net documentation.  \n\nHowever there is a *ReadToEnd()* method in the *StreamReader* class, but that isn\u0027t referenced in the code as far as I can tell and \u003Cfont face=\u0022Consolas\u0022\u003E \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EGetManifestResourceStream\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003E(string) \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/font\u003Eis supposed to return a Stream, not a StreamReader.\n\nSo how is that line of code even compiling? According to the commit comment of the class, that code is from Bodrick, but maybe you could help me to understand how this works.  \n\nI really just want to load a small .png file for a \u0022settings\u0022 button similar to the one found in [x] Science! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"Z-Key Aerospace","CreatedById":138926,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-27T16:39:56Z","Content":"Have a look at the file StreamEx.cs - The *ReadToEnd() function is in there.*"},{"CreatedByName":"Aerospike","CreatedById":159274,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-28T09:39:54Z","Content":"\\*facepalm\\*  \n\nI feel really stupid right now for not discovering that class on my own.
