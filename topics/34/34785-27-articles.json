I want to know what\u0027s new since things have definitely changed.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGoing through the commit list (like Ezriilc said), here\u0027s the things I came up with (I really should keep track of this):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELand button now clearly is a toggle instead of just saying \u0022Land/Release\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERe-enable parsing of SI suffixes, so you can use them, but don\u0027t print things in SI format (so you\u0027ll never see them if you don\u0027t type them in)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMassive GUI overhaul, lots of things changed internally here, but not much outwardly (except things like small X button instead of big close one)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIntegrated help system (hovering over labels shows text beneath the window, instead of having a huge help window). Help window got re-purposed to be the about window.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverhauled the teleportation system of the lander, hopefully less explodey.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMade resources be individual sliders instead of \u0022refill all\u0022 button.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbility to save planet locations (persists across restarts).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- the following is in the Beta builds -\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdded a HyperEdit button to the top right (where the resources/etc stuff is), so you don\u0027t have to hit alt-h anymore (but alt-h is still enabled)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERe-added the Copy To Kerbin planet editor button (it got lost in the giant UI overhaul).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESave window positions after you close them, so they open in the same spot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDisallow multiple windows of the same type (after the UI overhaul, you could open 50 hyperedit windows, heh)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ezriilc","CreatedById":34556,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-24T22:37:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESweet!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve copied that to the GitHub Wiki, and I\u0027ll try to keep it updated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/Ezriilc/HyperEdit/wiki\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/Ezriilc/HyperEdit/wiki\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ziff","CreatedById":27566,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-25T18:18:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ezriilc\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Ezriilc\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou could try again with no other mods to be sure, but I\u0027ve never heard of HyperEdit causing this before, so I doubt it.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemoved all the mods, it worked.
