MC biggest flaw is the fact that its a plugin. And can be massively miss-used by the player to cheat the system. And in the end its really up to the player if they want to have fun... Or cheat the system and ruin that fun. Like I said in the first post of this thread.. I pretty much know every single exploit there is to MC. Its up to the player to have some constraints. I could spend weeks of development time plugging these exploits (lots of code rewrites), or trust in the player to make there own choices. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stargate525","CreatedById":53585,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-26T20:29:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI suppose that\u0027s fair.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan I request that the high orbit satellites are actually high orbit?
