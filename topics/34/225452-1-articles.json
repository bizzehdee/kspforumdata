Turns out that from the bottom or the top, Mk2 spaceplane parts are almost three times draggier than 5m tanks of equivalent length in the same orientation (tested at Mach 2.3), despite having less than half the exposed area. Even stranger, in this orientation Mk2 cargo bays actually become significantly less draggy when opened, even though their exposed area increases.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022f0xPzDn.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002276.43\u0022 height=\u0022733\u0022 width=\u0022959\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/f0xPzDn.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt turns out that the default drag cube calculation is extraordinarily bad at providing reasonable drag coefficients for flat, wing-shaped parts. This causes the supposedly aerodynamic stock Mk2 parts to be some of the worst parts you could ever use for spaceplane building, as any pitch away from prograde will destroy their aerodynamic performance. They\u0027re also just extremely hollow, with fuel capacity akin to 1.25m parts, while having a volume more than twice as large.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut this problem could also easily be resolved. With some changes, these parts can be given drag that is much more appropriate for their size and shape. And we\u0027re not talking huge changes here, just making their top/bottom face drag coefficient comparable to those of the cylindrical tanks. Their fuel contents and mass can also be tweaked to be somewhat closer to the rest of the available parts. In total, this mod tries to give them body drag comparable to that of 1.875m tanks, and fuel contents of about 160% that of same length 1.25 tanks, while maintaining the same mass fraction that they already had. This makes them not strictly superior to any of the already existing parts, while giving them their own niche as a high-temperature tolerant fuselage part that sacrifices a small amount of space and mass for this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe difference these small tweaks make to aircraft handling is staggering. Glide slopes are much improved, and spaceplanes become much less flip happy during re-entry. Mk2-based spaceplanes become much more comparable in size and performance to basic fuel tank based space planes. You can finally design pretty Mk2 based spaceplanes without compromising on performance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EUsage:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSimply copy the contents of the GameData folder of the mod into your GameData folder, or install it via \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E.
