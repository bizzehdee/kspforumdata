Turns out that from the bottom or the top, Mk2 spaceplane parts are almost three times draggier than 5m tanks of equivalent length in the same orientation (tested at Mach 2.3), despite having less than half the exposed area. Even stranger, in this orientation Mk2 cargo bays actually become significantly less draggy when opened, even though their exposed area increases.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022f0xPzDn.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002276.43\u0022 height=\u0022733\u0022 width=\u0022959\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/f0xPzDn.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt turns out that the default drag cube calculation is extraordinarily bad at providing reasonable drag coefficients for flat, wing-shaped parts. This causes the supposedly aerodynamic stock Mk2 parts to be some of the worst parts you could ever use for spaceplane building, as any pitch away from prograde will destroy their aerodynamic performance. They\u0027re also just extremely hollow, with fuel capacity akin to 1.25m parts, while having a volume more than twice as large.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut this problem could also easily be resolved. With some changes, these parts can be given drag that is much more appropriate for their size and shape. And we\u0027re not talking huge changes here, just making their top/bottom face drag coefficient comparable to those of the cylindrical tanks. Their fuel contents and mass can also be tweaked to be somewhat closer to the rest of the available parts. In total, this mod tries to give them body drag comparable to that of 1.875m tanks, and fuel contents of about 160% that of same length 1.25 tanks, while maintaining the same mass fraction that they already had. This makes them not strictly superior to any of the already existing parts, while giving them their own niche as a high-temperature tolerant fuselage part that sacrifices a small amount of space and mass for this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe difference these small tweaks make to aircraft handling is staggering. Glide slopes are much improved, and spaceplanes become much less flip happy during re-entry. Mk2-based spaceplanes become much more comparable in size and performance to basic fuel tank based space planes. You can finally design pretty Mk2 based spaceplanes without compromising on performance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EUsage:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSimply copy the contents of the GameData folder of the mod into your GameData folder, or install it via \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E.

I am curious how you encountered less lift. Each component should be generating exactly the same amount of lift as it did previously, so maybe you got caught off guard by the fuel tanks having gotten significantly heavier? It shouldn\u0027t be harder than stock stats wise, but aircraft will need ~40% less fuel tanks for the same amount of fuel storage.

These could be easier without this mod, as the extra drag resulting from the usually forward-located Mk2 components would push them upwards. Of course, this came at the expense of this drag effect getting significantly stronger with Mach number compared to the rest of the parts, which would often cause Mk2 spaceplanes which are stable at like 2000m/s during reentry to become utterly unstable at a 3000m/s reentry at the same angles of attack.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CensoredUsername","CreatedById":234317,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-07-18T11:59:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224408466\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022225452\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221721232099\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022193797\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DVQuill\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n19 hours ago, DVQuill said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is great, thank you! That said, I find it interesting that this has been brought up many times since at least 2016, but no changes were ever made. The numbers suggest that this was indeed a bug, but the lack of change/update suggests that these parts are working as intended. Although I suppose it\u0027s also possible that there was never any real desire by the devs to fix the issue. Very curious.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHonestly, it\u0027s just the drag system being very simplistic. It works kinda, but don\u0027t expect it to do anything intelligent or semi-realistic.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThere\u0027s some funny edge cases like a sphere moving in the XY direction of its model having about 40% more drag than a sphere moving directly in the X direction. An aligned flat plate having basically no drag, but a flat plate at a 30 degree angle having about 50% the drag of a flat plate that is perpendicular to the flow direction. Anything that\u0027s slightly pointier than a cylinder has basically no drag, anything less pointy than a cylinder having significantly more drag. The latter effect being so strong that if you were to take a sphere, and only keep like the flattest part facing the flow in the centre while removing the rest, it\u0027d still have more drag than the full sphere, even though you just only removed geometry. Attaching things via nodes does remove some drag, but this doesn\u0027t actually check for the attached area, just the projected area of the entire part attached. I.e. you can mount 10 1.25 to 2.5m adapters in a row, all facing the same direction, and all but the first and last of them will cause no drag if prograde.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027d be nice to adjust the full system so things like this mod wouldn\u0027t be necessary, but such changes would mess with the balance of the game so much it\u0027d be hard to oversee. It\u0027s also just hard to create a performant solution that still offers predictable behaviour for gameplay. Real aerodynamics are hard.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CensoredUsername","CreatedById":234317,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-07-18T23:08:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\njust a warning: a mistake slipped into the M2X shock cone drag cube making it really draggy.
