You might have better chance to get proper answer in tweakscale thread.

People who maintain this mod can\u0027t get those because original author of those parts is out of reach. Without it, noone can provide proper fix.\n\n3. I don\u0027t know of any. Roverdude made some construction parts pack that is similar to IR parts, but much more simpler and with other goals in mind than IR provide. Maybe some other moder that is good with creating meshes and have some love for this mod can create more parts, but for now we can only hope for it.\n\nYour main issue most probably can be solved by editing config files, to increase stiffnes and scale them larger or smaller to your preference. It is not too hard, but it has been a while since I messed with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E patches for my own personal purpose and I no longer recall exact commands from top of my head.
