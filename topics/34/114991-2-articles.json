I find it surprising if this was AmpYear as it uses ScenarioModules. KSP loads and unloads ScenarioModules at each Scene change (EG. go to flight, go to KSC, go to tracking station, etc). Each time this happens you see the AmpYear log messages about it saving and loading it\u0027s settings into the persistent.sfs save file.\n\nThe first error log message is not very helpful, it appears to be an internal KSP error loading vessel info. There is probably something else going on here in the log further up.\n\nThe second error log message is an error with DistantObject Enhancements mod. But this again is probably a symptom of something else going on.\n\nAs for removing AmpYear and having issues, this may be because removing any mod will cause issues with vessels in your save file.\n\nIn the case of AmpYear, it adds a module to all command pods/probe cores. Which would be persisted into your save file. Removing the mod and loading up would cause unexpected results.\n\nI can have a look at your log file to rule out any issues with AmpYear but I would need your entire log.

Thanks for the input. Currently the low warning window is shown when the threshhold is reached when in Flight. It is not shown again until the EC on your vessel goes back above the threshhold and then runs back down below the threshhold again.  \n\nWhen you say you want to see it once. How long is once? So for each vessel it appears only once and once only never again? - Ever?  \n\nWhat I could do is create a button in the GUI window that allows you to turn the warning on or off for each vessel. With a default of ON. When the threshhold is reached the warning would appear. You could then turn if OFF completely and it would never appear again until you turn it back on. ??"},{"CreatedByName":"speedwaystar","CreatedById":153092,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-23T23:35:15Z","Content":"for example, if i\u0027m on a munar orbit and go into penumbra and end up on reserve power, i have to manually reenable timewarp repeatedly before i come out of shadow and my batteries recharge, because ampyear is turning timewarp off every time it reaches (from memory) about 50x warp to post the \u0022not enough power\u0022 warning. ideally it should kick me out of timewarp once for the warning, and then leave me alone to timewarp out of the mun\u0027s shadow."},{"CreatedByName":"speedwaystar","CreatedById":153092,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-24T00:45:30Z","Content":"another question--sorry if this has already been answered. various parts report odd power-drain stats in the VAB (but show correct stats once launched). for example, the Mk1-2 command pod with no attachments shows 18 power consumption in the VAB and 0.175 (AmpYear\u0027s system drain) on the launchpad. is it possible to rectify this, or at least arrive at a close approximation?"},{"CreatedByName":"JPLRepo","CreatedById":114736,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-24T00:58:21Z","Content":"[quote name=\u0027speedwaystar\u0027]another question--sorry if this has already been answered. various parts report odd power-drain stats in the VAB (but show correct stats once launched). for example, the Mk1-2 command pod with no attachments shows 18 power consumption in the VAB and 0.175 (AmpYear\u0027s system drain) on the launchpad. is it possible to rectify this, or at least arrive at a close approximation?[/QUOTE]  \n\nThat\u0027s because in VAB it shows the maximum power use with SAS on, and fully operating, etc. In flight it shows actual usage.  \n\nI will lokk at perhaps a VAB option to show base power consumption or max power consumption.  \n\nThe same occurs for other parts like resource converters, etc. In VAB it shows max usage.  \n\n[COLOR=\u0022silver\u0022][SIZE=1]- - - Updated - - -[/SIZE][/COLOR]  \n\n[quote name=\u0027speedwaystar\u0027]for example, if i\u0027m on a munar orbit and go into penumbra and end up on reserve power, i have to manually reenable timewarp repeatedly before i come out of shadow and my batteries recharge, because ampyear is turning timewarp off every time it reaches (from memory) about 50x warp to post the \u0022not enough power\u0022 warning. ideally it should kick me out of timewarp once for the warning, and then leave me alone to timewarp out of the mun\u0027s shadow.[/QUOTE]  \n\nI understand, but it shouldn\u0027t be doing what you describe as the warning/halt warp should occur as soon as you drop below the threshold that you set in the settings and shouldn\u0027t occur againuntil the vessels power goes back over the threshhold again.  \n\nI\u0027ll investigate because what you are describing should be how it currently should be working."},{"CreatedByName":"speedwaystar","CreatedById":153092,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-24T02:18:29Z","Content":"i\u0027ll double check exactly what\u0027s happening re: the warp warnings also.  \n\ncouple more suggestions/requests:  \n\n\\* add a display showing time until batteries run out at current drain (the addon is called AmpYear after all :D). this would be hugely helpful at the design stage to ensure sufficient battery grunt to run the vehicle\u0027s loadout during the expected periods of darkness.   \n\n\\* as an added convenience, but of lesser priority: i believe fusebox (which i haven\u0027t used) had a tool which calculated hours of darkness in orbit around various bodies and when landed on the surface. is this easy to add?  \n\nall with a view to saving the buttons on my calculator from being ground to powder :D"},{"CreatedByName":"JPLRepo","CreatedById":114736,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-25T09:31:22Z","Content":"[quote name=\u0027speedwaystar\u0027]i\u0027ll double check exactly what\u0027s happening re: the warp warnings also.  \n\ncouple more suggestions/requests:  \n\n\\* add a display showing time until batteries run out at current drain (the addon is called AmpYear after all :D). this would be hugely helpful at the design stage to ensure sufficient battery grunt to run the vehicle\u0027s loadout during the expected periods of darkness.   \n\n[/QUOTE]  \n\nCould be done, but the trick here is, is it supposed to take into account current EC production (Solar panels, etc).
