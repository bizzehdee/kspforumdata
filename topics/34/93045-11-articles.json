Basically, they unlock ridiculously early, so I recommend that if you use them, make yourself wait for a later node when you think you should unlock them. They are too massive for general use in the beginning, anyways.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and I would also like to say that this mod is suprisingly well balanced. Its extremely difficult, and a touch finicky at times, but if you love realism, you will not be able to get enough of this.
