It seems that orbital velocities increase so damn much that the default parameters do not cut it in this case. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhatever the problem is, it does exist in vanilla OPM (with FAR) - the deceleration is much higher than it should be. I reach about 5 g at 303km height, that is 900m below the boundary to space, and obviously way too much. It does not kill any kerbals however, since the orbital velocity is cute and fluffy and at no point enough to even drain a single point of ablative shielding away before you lost all your velocity. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of those issues go away when running without FAR; at that point reentry behaves as expected both in vanilla OPM and in 6.4x. OPM So basically, what we seem to have here is a FAR incompatibility - probably some value that FAR dislikes. Most likely I am just restating what Borisbee already found out, but maybe it helps nonetheless.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoing the same reentry profile (DRE, FAR, 64K, hyperediting into the edge of the atmosphere) on Jool [like 21km/s initially] displays no such effects, so we should be able to find out what changes are responsible and revert those.

It seems that orbital velocities increase so damn much that the default parameters do not cut it in this case. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhatever the problem is, it does exist in vanilla OPM (with FAR) - the deceleration is much higher than it should be. I reach about 5 g at 303km height, that is 900m below the boundary to space, and obviously way too much. It does not kill any kerbals however, since the orbital velocity is cute and fluffy and at no point enough to even drain a single point of ablative shielding away before you lost all your velocity. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of those issues go away when running without FAR; at that point reentry behaves as expected both in vanilla OPM and in 6.4x.
