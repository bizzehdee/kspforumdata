Sorry for that in advance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere a several problems, causing most joy I got sucked out of me. First of all, I\u0027m not used to Unity at all, even thought it isn\u0027t the the biggest pain in the arse.. It\u0027s squads code. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDevelopers might understand this, players I guess not, but I\u0027m going to try to explain it anyway; Unity just doesn\u0027t care, every exception often nullreference objects, just get ignored (aka \u0022catched\u0022). I guess this is a good thing, it keeps the game from crashing, but the lack of a debugger means you often don\u0027t know what happend, ending up you (=the developer) just guessing, using all kind\u0027s of error checking everywhere... I can live with that, but the squad code just pisses me off, there is no documentation at all, (Hey, I can\u0027t blame them for a game still in development... but then again if 0.26.. eeh \u003Cstrong\u003E0.99\u003C/strong\u003E is feature complete.. perhaps they will work on it. ). Most of my complains has to do with bugs, and you can find plenty with the pristine release. Add some mods, and you don\u0027t know what is causing this, good luck finding it. The fact that the game takes ages to load because everything is loaded at start.. and if you want other mod compatability you need to load another mod-set of .. sure 700 MB (I\u0027m looking at you helldiver \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E ), and if only you could add some parameter to the executable, so you can skip all menu and jump right into a save file.... I\u0027m sure most developers will like that. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe animation system is weird an clunky, Unity causes this, but Squad doesn\u0027t provide it to mod developers (nor do I know if they can, I believe most is generated by unity, either way the have direct acces so they don\u0027t need it, mod developers don\u0027t have that. ), for things like grabbing a ladder I need to know if there is a ladder, and know how the animation is run.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe KFSMEvent system.. well it\u0027s just ass, and I don\u0027t get it. Sometimes an \u0022event\u0022 you need is in there, sometime it don\u0027t. (causing more bugs). With now way of knowing if the \u0022event\u0022 you need is in there, except the last one, I need to add a try/catch so it doesn\u0027t thow an exception, if it does, it will just in effect disable the entire mod (and cause problems in other mods), I sad \u0022event\u0022, because it\u0027s not the kind most programmers talk about. Squad doesn\u0027t use events, at least public ones, but they should. It guessing it will make many mod developers happy. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is no code avaible to the developer to know what objects is close (please tell me if there is. ). I know it excist, because they use it for ... well, for knowing when to grab the ladder. However, again they don\u0027t create a method for it, most likely they do it like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003Evoid handleEventKeys(object sender, SomeEventArgs){\u003Cbr\u003Eif ( key == config.ladderKey )\u003Cbr\u003E{ \u003Cbr\u003E*code for finding the object and grabbing it.  \u003Cbr\u003E}\u003Cbr\u003E}\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand I guess that is fine, unless you are a mod developer and need the same behavior. \u0022solutions\u0022 can be creating your own method for doing this, more bugs will slip in here. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey world matrix in the game is not a usual kind of game x,y,z world (I\u0027m not talkin about left or right coordinate system either), it clever and twisted: basicly you don\u0027t move the character, you move the universe. It kinda happend when Kerbal became a 3d game (yes, it was a 2d game ones ) and not many games allow you to go to another freaking planet.. so they needed a way of moving around this world, and if you ever tried it yourself you will find that if you character is a HUGE distance from the world center ( position 0,0,0 ) you will see objects pop/in, chitter, al kinds of weirdness because of rounding errors and the fact compiler programmers are insane... well welcome to rounding errors. Don\u0027t believe me, try this: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/66597482/Downloads/KSP/Screenshots/insaneprogrammers.png\u0022 alt=\u0022insaneprogrammers.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, some smart cookie at Squad fixed this by moving the universe, every (to me unknown) distance the world \u0022resets\u0022, moving the THAN current location of the vessel, to the worldposition (0,0,0). It introduced the kraken and other things, but also allowed us to explore without to much weirdness! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I need to know where this magic relative point is, if keeps moving around, and I can\u0027t catch it, producing a lot of bugs (in my code.) To save the position walking pattern, I need to know where it is. An AI to pathway yourself around an area is difficult enough in newtonian physics, but right now for me it sure feels like a einstein physics and Schr\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00B6dinger\u0027s cat paradox. It nice thought, and the planet renderer complexity shows they are not stupid. (I\u0027m talking about pictures of an old blog of Harverster, talking about version before 0.7, can\u0027t seem to find it.) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe is also problem of unknown calculations or constants, for example I need some of that to force the kerbal to follow you, like the walking speed on the current planet. You expect it is like something as;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003Edouble geeForce = FlightGlobals.currentMainBody.GeeASL;\u003Cbr\u003E...\u003Cbr\u003Espeed *= eva.runSpeed;\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003Espeed *= geeForce; \u003Cbr\u003Eeva.Animate(AnimationState.Run);\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt works, it\u0027s just not the same as internaly used. That is reflecting in the fact they walk faster than you on the Mun and slower on Gilly ), Also the fact you see an animation command, is telling you, the animations are not automatic (except some like falling) and shows you most likey just just put animation code like that between (e.keycode = whateverkey). Logical, I always done it like that, but just in this case I need just that piece to make sure they aren\u0027t \u0022off\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome code is just weird, In my case the configuration saving goes before the loading of the configuration!!, so it will just override your configuration with a nice clean configuration file with no data at all, because it wasn\u0027t loaded yet. I never know why this happend, arround this point I got to much frustrated to enjoy it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wanted to inject it into the kerbal config (in persistance) because it will insure it get saved with the associated kerbal and if people decide they don\u0027t care about KerbalFollower and delete it, the next time the data will not be read, and thus on saving will not be there anymore. Because of that, I used another way of saving plugin data, it uses a weird squad written I/O part to save the file (more on that later).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hoped by using github, I could get at least one developer to work with me to expained on it, because of another major flaw: myself. I\u0027m not perfect and to be honest, don\u0027t care to be perfect in kerbal modding because I\u0027ve a life outside it, and I can\u0027t justify investing more time into something I enjoy less and less working around bugs instead of working on features.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you read this far, I might sound negative towards Squad, and in some ways I am, but most of them I don\u0027t, I will blame unity for a lot.. I keep on hoping they will improve the engine.. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.nl/2010/04/alot-is-better-than-you-at-everything.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ealot\u003C/a\u003E! We on the forums are hopefully enjoying the game, but it\u0027s developed by a weird creature. This might just be plane wrong of saying of me, but Squad didn\u0027t start with gaming, but \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.squad.com.mx/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eadvertising\u003C/a\u003E. At first the game didn\u0027t had any modding capabilities, at all, until they where \u003Cstrong\u003Eforced\u003C/strong\u003E because the game got hacked to support it.. They got the point and used it clever, adding some mods capabilities from that point and advertised that way.. but the codebase doesn\u0027t reflect that in most parts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, they where afraid (and good call in my opinion) that people abuse modding to spread virusses or expose your naketh pictures to the world... Or something like that, Not wanting to cause that, they wrote there own I/O handler so at least people can\u0027t write outside of the kerbal directory, and made a rule that all mods must have full open source ( sadly, most people think it reflects the dynamic library, it doesn\u0027t, it can still contain virusses and exposing your personal information ). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey tried, but you can still do stuff most game developers that allow for modding will never allow you to do, like extract model data from the game.. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/66597482/Downloads/KSP/Screenshots/kerbalExtracted.png\u0022 alt=\u0022kerbalExtracted.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/66597482/Downloads/KSP/Screenshots/kerbalExtracted2.png\u0022 alt=\u0022kerbalExtracted2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote: This is in fact not allowed from Squad, and they could kick my ass for it. \u003Cstrong\u003ENo don\u0027t ask me for content, \u003C/strong\u003E unless your Squad, than I will fork over the code so you can block it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etldr: In short, i\u0027m a little burned modding the game, all the weirdness to the game and the average iq on the forum does however keep me enjoying playing the game.
