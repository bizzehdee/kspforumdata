Hence the flickering if the radius multiplier in cloud_layers.cfg gets too low. I\u0027ve had success with yargnit\u0027s suggestion of 1.003 and 1.004. Note you will also have to edit common.cfg and change the LOD switch ranges to about 2000 each or you won\u0027t get clouds on the surface / at low altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDarthVader: 300km is the minimum for an orbit that doesn\u0027t, in real life, degrade incredibly quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECaptain Party: Depends on your TWR. You want to start your turn at no more than 100m/s velocity, so whatever altitude that occurs at. Also, you want to set your shape and end height based on your TWR later on--if you\u0027re trying for single stage, you want something maybe like 40 or 50% and end height 80-100? If you have a low-TWR upper stage, you might want more like 60-70% and end height maybe 160km? Maybe even a final turn angle of \u0026gt;0? It really depends.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emetaphor: while I have not yet had time to switch to pressureCurves for atmosphers, all scale heights are correct to the best of my (and Medieval Nerd, who did the research for me!)\u0027s knowledge. The issue with Venus/Eve\u0027s pressure, however, is as ferram says, that\u0027s why I went with the KSP stock 5x instead of the real life 92x. With a pressure curve we could get around that.* Note that Jupiter\u0027s atmosphere never really ends, it shifts smoothly into liquid. The surface is set at the \u0022conventional\u0022 base of the atmosphere, where pressure = 10 bar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eferram: the pressure curve, since it has a determined end point, will not get clamped by \u0022\u0026lt;=1E-6 means 0\u0022 IIRC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom what I\u0027ve been able to determine, the actual expression for atmopsheric pressure (when useLegacyAtmosphere is true) is, contrary to the KSP wiki, this: atmosphereMultiplier * (e * staticPressureASL)^(-alt_in_km/scaleHeight). It cuts to 0 when pressure is \u0026lt; 1E-6. However, the 1E-6 cutoff is applied BEFORE atmosphereMultiplier is applied, which is the source of the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStarwaster: Yes, there is a temperatureCurve for bodies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eli7in6: I\u0027ve been using a flat 10x multiplier, which seems to work ok, but your approach sounds much better. Given that RemoteTech2 source/configs are GPLv2, and ranges are already in the form of ModuleManager patches (not even the original part CFGs) I think it\u0027s fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EiVG, asmi, re: paging. All you need to do, I think, is replace the existing heightmap PQSMod with one that pages the heightmap; it keeps a static cache, into which is read texture data (to avoid Unity/KSP garbage collection BS you\u0027d have to overwrite rather than delete and (C#-version-of)malloc), and if a texture page is out of cache you read it and kick something. I\u0027m sure your (asmi\u0027s) is way more cool and complex, but it should totally be doable. That\u0027s just for height data; dunno how to deal with normal maps.
