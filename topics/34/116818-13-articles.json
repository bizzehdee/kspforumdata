I know that Principia aims to implement orbital decay but not yet, isn\u0027t it?\n\u003E \n\nHello there!\n\nHonestly I have not tried the two, but since KSP has a limited number of orbit changing functions I would assume this would be compatible for now. However in the 1.6.0 release of Orbital Decay, the two will not be compatible; with Principia effectively doing very similar things but in a somewhat more complex way!\n\nAs for 1.6.0 progress,\n\nAlthough slow, I have been working on the NBody version, having some big problems so far but the framework is in place, hopefully once I can manage to accurately build the eccentricity, longitude of ascending node, argument of periapsis and mean anomaly from state vectors I will have working version. Of course I am having to do a great deal of simplification to bust lag (especially during timewarp), in the meantime however, if progress is still show by this time next week, I shall release 1.5.2 for KSP 1.1.3, this will include some FPS improvements for the UI, some UI filtering and afew more additions I was saving for the 1.6.0.\n\nIf anyone has any experience in State vector orbital representation or more important the conversion factors for the different position/ coordinate systems in KSP please get in touch!\n\nAt the moment the two body problem is pretty much solved, but the 3 body and thus n body problem still requires alot of work. As for new conics.... well that should fall into place once I can generate the orbit predictions accurately.. - Matlab would be pretty useful right now!\n\nI am leaving the body perturbations until last (so as to not further complicate the nbody simulator!)\n\nSo in short, 1.5.2 for KSP 1.1.3 next week if I get really bogged down with this!

Also the icons seem slightly misfitted, - the closest I could find from the Stock folder! I will find some more fitting for 1.5.3! \n\nAnother plaguing issue is the quickload vessel orbit update issue, e.g quicksaving before a moon landing, crashing accidentally and reloading causing the vessel to reload at a position closer to the moon not equal to the quicksave position can be a pest, but can be remedied by deleting the cfg entry for the vessel in the VesselData.cfg file prior to quickloading. This will reload the vessel at the correct position at the time of the quicksave! This will be fixed in 1.5.3! \n\nAs for 1.6.0; NBody is a real pain, in theory the process should be simple but I think afew days off and a complete NBody rewrite is in order to sort things out! In the meantime I will reduce the Github issue list and bring out a 1.5.3 with fixes for the issues above, some more mascon and yarkovsky fixes and a lifting of the atmosphere decay height limit (currently at 1000Km) so expect your small light geostationary satellites to decay in about 700 years! \n\nI will also be taking some time off to further develop the SCS plugin and work on a new mod I have had in the pipeline for afew months, and hopefully a revamp of my maritime missions contract pack since [@Fengist](%7B___base_url___%7D/index.php?/profile/78435-fengist/) has returned! \n\nWhitecat106 ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"M4ssler","CreatedById":164016,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-26T03:53:26Z","Content":"Good morning. \n\nCan i use this mod with outer planets?"},{"CreatedByName":"Whitecat106","CreatedById":140086,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-26T15:43:16Z","Content":"Hello there [@M4ssler](%7B___base_url___%7D/index.php?/profile/164016-m4ssler/), I believe everything should work fine with Outer Planets, decay might be quite high around Sarnus for example, but everything should work. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"ebigunso","CreatedById":113229,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-27T11:33:29Z","Content":"I found the notifications for when a satellite has decayed is a little too subtle, being shown on screen for only brief moments.\n\nIf you could make it so that notifications pop up in the notifications tab of the game, that would certainly help."},{"CreatedByName":"Whitecat106","CreatedById":140086,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-27T13:10:50Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, ebigunso said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I found the notifications for when a satellite has decayed is a little too subtle, being shown on screen for only brief moments.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E If you could make it so that notifications pop up in the notifications tab of the game, that would certainly help.\n\u003E \n\nGood idea!

I launched a small satellite to LEO\u2014about 250km altitude. However, while the Orbital Decay window seems to suggest that the orbit *will* decay, and indeed it does update over a period of time regarding time until decay, decay rate and other information, the orbit itself does not change at all. The Player.log doesn\u0027t show any exceptions or abnormality regarding the mod. And I have to say, everything *but* the actual changes in orbit height function pretty well. I get the feeling it may have to do with the tracking station not yet updated and hence patched conics not available, but I don\u0027t know. Would you like me to acquire the Player.log file regardless?\n\nThe second issue is that when I click on \u0022Toggle Decay Rate Breakdown,\u0022 a window showing the following line appears:\n\n    WARNING: Error detected, this is a MasCon issue.\n\nIt also asks me to put down the vessel latitude/longitude on the forums and inform you. But quite frankly that window appears no matter what orbit I\u0027m in. Any latitude or longitude will result in its appearance. What does it mean?\n\n[I have attached a screenshot here of the Orbital Decay window.](http://imgur.com/4TXBZHy)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-07-28T09:40:33Z\u0022 title=\u002207/28/2016 09:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 28, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Syzygy\u03A3E**"},{"CreatedByName":"baldamundo","CreatedById":138417,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-29T15:50:31Z","Content":"What\u0027s the performance footprint of this mod like these days?"},{"CreatedByName":"h0yer","CreatedById":112042,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-01T06:38:58Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 29.7.2016 at 5:50 PM, baldamundo said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E What\u0027s the performance footprint of this mod like these days?\n\u003E \n\nMinimal, if you don\u0027t let accumulate too much debris in your LEO/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E, all of it (fairings / uppers tages @ orbital velocities) should decay nicely without taking too much CPU.

I knew there was something else I had to include for the update! Anyway for now I shall leave the solution next to the download button on the first page, everything abit too messy at the moment for a 1.5.3, but 1.6.0 is coming.\n\nSo far 1.6.0 features include:\n\n- NBody Simulation: will be completed for the next merge on Github, this may result in some lag at high timewarp but hopefully I have found a solution to cut down lag by reducing orbit simulation samples (at the cost of some accuracy) during exceptionally high timewarp (so the biggest issue will be full timewarp in an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E-\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E game). This NBody perturbation will only effect vessels that are a sufficient distance away from a planet,- purely for the sake of performance at the moment, e.g a small wiggle in a closely orbiting space station isnt really worth 1/2 a FPS, whereas a vessel with an eccentric orbit beyond the hill sphere of a moon of the Jupiter system is much more interesting and worth while; that being said the true performance impact will become apparent when I release a 1.6.0 testing version for everyone to try out and give some feedback! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022) Station keeping will prevent n body perturbations, but will require a lot more fuel - pretty essential for rendezvous. \n\n- NBody conics, the code is pretty much there in the most recent Github update, the maths and the logic works... but for some reason the lines are a squiggly mess in the corner of the tracking station... this should surely be the easy bit... not to worry! This is my main goal at the moment, since the code for predicting the vessel positions used to generate the orbital path lines is pretty much identical to the actual vessel perturbation code. - When one works the other should too and with a visible path I can better check that everything is predicting correctly. The biggest issue at the moment is just putting things in the right type of coordinates (WorldSpace, ScaledSpace, RelativePositions and World Positions etc).\n\n- \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E-\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E UI: Contains information on your vessel, how long it would take to decay and how much station keeping fuel would be required for a duration etc etc - Plan your missions easier! - 50% complete, just need to add station keeping info etc.\n\n- Quick Load fixes: Stops that annoying bug I mentioned a few posts back!\n\n- User alerts: More visible, better timed alerts about when a vessel is running out of fuel, about to decay and has decayed. Maybe an alert for 50% station keeping fuel remaining?\n\n- Automatic force disabling of the Orbital Drift Compensation setting.\n\n- Map overlays for Hill Spheres and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s, (nice togglable circular lines around bodies so you can visually see intersections (needs the NBody conics to draw lines correctly first!).\n\nYou can check out progress at the github, any assistance would be appreciated, especially with the conics drawing in the MapView. Its been a while working all of this out but I think everything is finally coming together abit more. I will not put up a .dll yet since the NBody perturbation equations need yet another rebuild (See Github issue #77 comments), so at the moment timewarp can cause the orbit to break entirely. Once conics are fixed I will rebuild the NBody code (pretty quick fix actually) and release a test .dll for everyone to try out the new features. Again, NBody will be completely optional because I know how much more complicated it can make interplanetary transfers etc...\n\nAny more issues that anyone can find, please let me know and I will add them to the 1.6.0 list.\n\nWhitecat106 ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"M4ssler","CreatedById":164016,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-02T17:26:32Z","Content":"Hello @all,\n\nis there any guide how to use it. the button for enable station keeping i found ;-)\n\nBut what does toggle nobdy breakdown and toggle decay rate breakdown.
