One would need a really huge amount of emitters to reliably get moderately sized rocket into orbit. Maybe if we could get dedicated, tight beam emitters with autotracking feature? But that\u0027s for Kerbin. On low gravity bodies it would be much more useful. I can see myself launching a nuclear powered emitter, landing it on Mun or Minmus on a big, equatorial kethane deposit.

Every basic Aegletes 2 you use is capable of getting about 262KN with liquid fuel at sea level, the upgraded versions can obviously get more. A pair of Aegletes installed at three or four strategic locations on Kerbin (say: west of KSC, island runway and continent east of KSC, maybe with a supplementary floating site) should get you Mainsail levels of thrust at nuclear engine specific impulses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt does take a bit of setting up but it will let you get a significant increase in payload fraction going on. Should be good for that on low gravity bodies too, that said, optimal launch trajectories on low gravity bodies tend to be flatter which mean increasing need for multiple reactor and power beaming emplacements.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GabrielG.A.B.Fonseca\u0022 data-cite=\u0022GabrielG.A.B.Fonseca\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFractal, what about some Eeloo ISRU?
