This is my plugin, that enhances the realism of Kerbal Space Program. In the real world people have limits. One from much is acceleration due to gravity (G-Force). When i played KSP, I said, Kerman is immortal. Falling from a great height survived, extreme G-Force survived and this plugin fixes this.\n\n**Screenshots: (first image is screen from game, second left is time-life (sec) of G-Force on Vessel, third right is time-life (sec) of G-Force on EVA**\n\n![ZFlQCKF.png](http://i.imgur.com/ZFlQCKF.png)\n![ES1XUsK.gif](http://i.imgur.com/ES1XUsK.gif)![9fGUvPC.gif](http://i.imgur.com/9fGUvPC.gif)\n\n\u0022Kerbal Space Program/GameData/GForce/Plugins/PluginData/GForce/config.xml\u0022 is configuration file.

Kerbals have human-like G-force tolerance, which means they can survive 5Gs for about 16 minutes, 10 Gs for 1 minute, 20Gs for 3.75 seconds, and 30\u002B Gs for less than three quarters of a second. The tracker is reset when G load \u003C 5.\n\nDRE has a timer, and it\u0027s more detailed.
