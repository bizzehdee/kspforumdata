You think I know what I\u0027m doing! Unfortunately, I really don\u0027t.\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d love to make it require sunlight. I assume if I look at configs for some photoelectric panels I could figure out how, but I\u0027m totally new to this and haven\u0027t done that yet. No, at the moment I\u0027ve just wholesale copied the conversion module from the TAC carbon scrubber and pasted it into the .cfg for the greenhouse, then changed the input and output resources. It doesn\u0027t even need to be unfolded to do conversion because I don\u0027t even know how to do that yet. But I\u0027ll keep working on it and once I\u0027m not embarrassed by it I\u0027ll post the .cfg if people are interested. Seriously though, the modular Kolonization mod is probably more worthy of peoples\u0027 attention. I posted my comment half hoping to spark a discussion of what appropriate conversion rates for waste-\u0026gt;food might be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t had any trouble launching the inflatable greenhouse. Is there some issue with it that others have encountered? The vessel that I built it into had two greenhouses and two habitat modules and I managed to fit it all into a KW expanded 2.5 m fairing, so it was pretty easy to launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MeCripp\u0022 data-cite=\u0022MeCripp\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ETo add light as a RESOURCE you can try some thing like And add light as 1 of INPUT_RESOURCE for your food.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I\u0027ve tried adding the solar panel functionality to the greenhouse in the past, that part worked when I tested it on the ground, but when launching, some weird physics breaking stuff happened at around 7km altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t know as much as I know now but I suspect errors must have been generated that I didn\u0027t see.
