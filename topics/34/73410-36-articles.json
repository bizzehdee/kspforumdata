I\u0027m going to just freeze what I have in the repo and go from there. Also, as it seems ModuleRCSFX is no longer needed (it\u0027s essentially replaced by new stock functionality), that will be dropped as a dependancy. But it also means I\u0027ll need to double-check on how that needs to be accounted for in the configs. In addition, Svm240\u0027s RealPlume configs will be included, and they should activate if Real Plume is installed. There is no dependency on Real Plume, but since RF made the move to use a new module your effects still might be lacking on any non-MEFX-derived engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe biggest change will be the install location. I\u0027ve moved the stockalike configs to their own folder in /GameData/ per NathanKell\u0027s suggestion. It\u0027ll make it easier to install/uninstall and much easier to troubleshoot. CKAN will get updated once the release is made. If you\u0027re using the dev version from the repo right now, then you\u0027re already set.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, this isn\u0027t technically v1.0.5 ready yet, since this is just a config set for RealFuels.
