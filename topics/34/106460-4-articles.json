It seems to occur at a certain threshold of mods, but I have no idea why it wouldn\u0027t be broken from the get-go. I tried several different config setups but nothing worked, and a look in the ATM thread shows a lot of issues going on right now. Best I could do was make new blanks in DDS format. They\u0027re slightly larger but still only bytes. New release version should be available for download now. I\u0027d delete your texture cache just in case, but after that and a fresh install of HeatManagement, everything should be hunky dory.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-04T06:57:47Z\u0022 title=\u002206/04/2015 06:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Randazzo**"},{"CreatedByName":"rasta013","CreatedById":140002,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T19:30:48Z","Content":"The new DDS blanks works flawlessly and as a side note, yeah, I run a TON of mods - 105\u002B at last count so I run into all kinds of weird things on a regular basis.

I\u0027d turn off the temperature indicators (F10) if you have them on, since they start flashing like mad before the LV-Ns or heatsinks are even halfway to overheating. You don\u0027t need to worry about it until you see the overheat bar in the staging area show up, and it will usually fill about three quarters of the way before it slows down significantly. \n\nThe radiators glow only faintly until they hit about 900 degrees, and that would require the heatsink to be well over 1000. If you feel so inclined, you can turn on thermal data in the right-click menus via the Alt\u002Bf12 options. Go to physics, then thermal, then click the aforementioned box. This will show you actual temps on your parts. \n\nThis is my best guess without seeing it happen, I\u0027m not getting the same behavior so I can\u0027t say for certain what the issue is.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Thank you for making this mod.

Even after you shut off the engine, that heat continues to dissipate and heat up things around it. Did you have a heatsink or AHMS unit on the ship? Using just thermal washers and radiators is not advised. Together they may slightly delay the explosion, but without a heatsink to absorb heat or an AHMS to get rid of it, terrible things can happen. \n\nJust out of curiosity, since you said insulators and radiators without mention of a heatsink, are you using [Heat Control](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/124391-1-02-Heat-Control-Manage-your-ship-s-heat!) parts?
