If I may be so bold I would suggest that you re-skin the habitation module at the same time to make it look less like a fuel tank , perhaps instead spreading the portholes longitudinally and giving it an all over sheet metal skin. The only thing I can see that might be missing is the solar panels , which are a bit tricky I know. Perhaps you could texture circular ones onto the outside of the Support module? A ring of panels around the thickest part of the station would look about right I think.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@Warringer: It does look a bit like the MOL doesnt it? When I was doing the research for my thread in the request thread I came across a few early space station concepts on both sides of the Iron curtain. I eventually pumped for the early Salyut models because they were actually launched , but truth be told there are several possible prototypes. As well as the helpfully tube-like MOL , Big Gemini (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Gemini\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Gemini\u003C/a\u003E) was considered , as was the Russian TKS FB (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TKS_spacecraft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TKS_spacecraft\u003C/a\u003E). Both of these have advantages from our perspective in as much that they were intended to be launched with their crews already aboard and with the return capsules secured in a nose-first position. On the downside , they were not intended as long-duration space-stations in their own right , look less like a \u0027Space Station\u0027 , and were never launched in real life. Of course , this doesn\u0027t stop us from looking for inspiration here. ;D\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"j516mt","CreatedById":5852,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-09-11T16:35:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes the fuel in all three tanks get used by the engine below the reverse tricoupler?
