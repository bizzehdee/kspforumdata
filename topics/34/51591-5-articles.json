Right now, I\u0027m organising a lander to rdv with the mothership around the Mun - the lander has a Comm 16 and can\u0027t reach Kerbin, the mothership (well, it\u0027s basically a fuel tank and a lab) has an 88-88 dish.

But, since they don\u0027t have any cases where that happens it seems like the rest of the experiment system doesn\u0027t do a great job of handling things when CanTransmit() returns false. Sometimes experiments are lost forever. Sometimes they appear to get stuck in the transmitter\u0027s queue, and will actually transmit if you manually start a transmission later.

Back in the days of the first manned spaceflights, NASA was not dependent upon space-based infrastructure to talk to their pilots, but also had more than a 10 minute window to do so while they whizzed over Texas every hour or two. They used \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manned_Space_Flight_Network\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Esurface-based infrastructure\u003C/a\u003E to effect these early communications. The Apollo missions going all the way to the Moon also used surface-based infrastructure. IMO it\u0027s unreasonable to assume that the Kerbals do not have similar capacities even at the very start of a career save.\u003Cp\u003EWere I to add such a limitation, I probably would actually not allow any artificial point on Kerbin to act as a relay. Instead, I\u0027d require that an antenna be installed suitably close to KSC as \u0022the KSC relay\u0022, and thus require the player to develop every single point of communications infrastructure -- even the \u0022home base\u0022 antenna. But, IMO, that is not a fun or interesting requirement. Sending suborbital missions comprising an antenna on a parachute isn\u0027t challenging enough to be a fun task, and doesn\u0027t really contribute to the development of a meaningful skillset in terms of gameplay. If it\u0027s not well-founded in the \u0022reality\u0022 of the game world, isn\u0027t fun, and isn\u0027t educational, it\u0027s just busywork for its own sake.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI welcome discussion on this topic.

I have a science station in orbit around the Mun with a manned rover that goes down to the surface to collect science and return to the station. The rover only has a communitron 16 on it, and thought I would need to wait for the science station to pass overhead to relay transmissions back to Kerbin. I happened to land near my first unmanned probe I sent to the Mun. I waited for the station to pass overhead to transmit a crew report, and when I did, it relayed through the old probe instead of the station. They were both in the Northwest Crater. While there wasn\u0027t clear LOS between the two, it was close enough that I figured the mod couldn\u0027t quite tell. Now the rover has moved on and is over 100km away and there definitely is no LOS between the two, yet it continues to relay through this probe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe view from above:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/hcRnSPs.png\u0022 alt=\u0022hcRnSPs.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe view rotated to line the two craft up to show there is no way they have LOS:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/27QeefC.png\u0022 alt=\u002227QeefC.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"toadicus","CreatedById":67745,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-15T15:32:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe LOS code has a 5% \u0022grace\u0022 figure in it to make satellite constellations easier with stock tools. That is, line of sight will be granted when the distance from the center of a body to the line ended by both relays is greater than 95% of the radius of the body. On Mun, that should mean that two vehicles at \u0022zero\u0022 level on the surface can contact each other from about 127 km apart, or more if the antennas are raised above the surface. Also, terrain is not considered whatsoever: if one antenna is up on the highlands a few kilometers above \u0022zero\u0022 level, you\u0027ll get even more distance out of the grace number. Considering terrain is complicated and expensive from a calculations standpoint, and pretty much completely useless for orbiting vessels, so at this point I\u0027m not planning to add such a function.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI \u003Cem\u003Ewill\u003C/em\u003E make the grace figure configurable in config.xml in the next release, though, so you can make things tougher on yourself. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
