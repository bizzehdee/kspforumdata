A player controlling a probe/sat currently above the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn - intended as a relay for crafts in it\u0027s shadow - can see the connection to their main network around Kerbin, because those satellites have AV as a target. As far as I know there is no way to see why the connection is made (is it targeted? inside a cone? due to active vessel?). Once he switches to the vessel behind the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn - which would now need that relay - he get\u0027s no connection and doesn\u0027t know why. He\u0027s not told \u0022Active Vessel: no line of sight\u0022, \u0022Out of range\u0022 or anything else along those lines. All this could be in a tooltip (if KSP allows that) or drawn as text next to satellites (with a new button in the lower-right corner to toggle this). As a more minimalist and less intrusive alternative, color-coding the relay-satellite-icons (and potentially the lines to the target) could also work.

And I was wondering if there are plans, even if they\u0027re far off, to improve the flight computer to the point where using kOS wouldn\u0027t be necessary for more advanced planned piloting, or if it\u0027s going to be left as is for now. \u003Cp\u003EI ask because I\u0027ve looked into kOS and it\u0027s not really my cup of tea, but on the other hand, l\u0027d like to be able to play with signal delay enabled as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe intent of the flight computer was to make RemoteTech playable without forcing players to download an autopilot mod.

We\u0027re planning to make the current features more reliable (which I agree is badly needed), but we\u0027re not currently planning to add anything as complex as, say, automated landings.

Take the example from my last post, if the probe is behind the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn, it should automatically route via the relay-satellite because it\u0027s inside a cone. I have told the sats around Kerbin to connect to whatever I\u0027m trying to control, so trying a little harder would seem reasonable. This would allow relays to use \u0027Active Vessel\u0027 instead of always having to manually target cones at wherever I\u0027m operating at. This is not a big deal, I\u0027m just explaining it in more detail as I remember that I was \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E surprised when I learned that active vessel would only establish a direct connection and not just act as if the dish was just aimed at the active vessel (i.e. cone targeting).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a side note: I\u0027d love to have even directly targeted connections work with a cone, because in reality they would. You just point the dish in some direction, if a signal comes from that direction it\u0027ll be received (provided it\u0027s the right frequency and stuff, but we don\u0027t model that [yet?] \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E ). But I can understand how that would probably start causing performance problems on large or huge networks, especially with the fixed cone behavior giving more potential targets. Finding connections and routes for signals should stay relatively cheap, the game has enough stuff to do after all...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy second issue isn\u0027t one: On the page before my post \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/83305-Development-Resumed-RemoteTech-2?p=1248994\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1248994\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Esomeone said\u003C/a\u003E it didn\u0027t work outside SoI, so I took their word for it (as I haven\u0027t used it since the 1.x days and thought it might\u0027ve been changed since then).
