Radially attached to that are 2 RTGs, 2 pairs of 3m radial SAS units arranged fore and aft, and 6 Vernor thrusters for docking translation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven when full, it handles like a dream, never runs out of power, and can dock to anything that has a Clamp-O-Tron Sr. docking port.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt takes a little bit of fuel from the 3m tank to get to my standard 125km circular 0deg parking orbit, but once it\u0027s up there it has 6km of delta-V without anything docked to it. Having more fuel is the best backup plan provided you have enough thrust to take advantage of it in a timely fashion, so I decided to send one of these out to Duna along with my first interplanetary mission in 0.24 as \u0022Plan B\u0022 in case something\u0027s off with my orbital maneuvers, and to provide enough fuel to ensure that I can get the guy back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat interplanetary mission also launches on a Saturn-V variant, with the 3rd stage\u0027s engine replaced by quad LV-N engines. I call that stage the \u0022S-IVN\u0022 both because its a nuclear S-IV stage and because it has IV(aka 4) LV-N engines on it. The lander is a single stage direct ascent design, and the S-IVN has something like 9000 m/s dV with the lander attached and fully fueled, without drawing on the landers fuel. The lander has ~2500\u002B m/s worth of dV all by itself, and can re-dock to the S-IVN after landing via Sr. docking ports on the top of the S-IVN and lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo be honest, I didn\u0027t take cost into much consideration on either vessel, even tho I\u0027m in Carreer mode, because firstly I don\u0027t believe in stranding Kerbals if possible, and secondly I don\u0027t expect to be disposing of the S-IVN or lander anytime soon so their costs can be amortized over several missions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lei07","CreatedById":110324,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-28T17:14:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks Kyle, I do love the paint jobs on those 3.75s.
