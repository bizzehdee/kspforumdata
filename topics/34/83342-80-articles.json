What you\u0027re calling the \u0022practice effect\u0022 I call the \u0022build effect\u0022. Same difference, but I\u0027ll use the latter since that\u0027s what I\u0027m used to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe way times are calculated is a bit confusing because it isn\u0027t a linear combination based on the parts. Each part contributes a small amount to the total \u0022Effective Cost\u0022 (where the amount is defined by the EffectivePartFormula), then the total \u0022Effective Cost\u0022 is processed into a build time. The precise way that works is defined by the Preset, but from here on out I\u0027ll assume you\u0027re using the Default Preset.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhere the Build Effect comes into play is in determining the Effective Cost of a part. By default that\u0027s\u00A0\u0022min([C]/(\u003Cem\u003E\u00A0\u003C/em\u003E[ I]\u002B ([ B]*([ U]\u002B1))), [C])\u0022. Translated to words that says: either the dry cost, or the dry cost divided by the sum of the Inventory Effect and the Build Effect times the number of times the part has been built \u002B1, whichever is smaller. The Inventory Effect is 0 if the part isn\u0027t stored in the inventory, or 100 otherwise. The version of the build effect is defined to be 1 in the Preset. tracks how many times the part has been built before now (more on that in a second). We can basically reduce that to \u0022[C]/([ B]\u002B1)\u0022 which shows that every time you use a part that has been used before, the effective cost is reduced. The first few builds have a much bigger effect than later ones. You might then assume that using the exact same parts 4 times will reduce the build time to 1/4 of normal, but the final formula (the BPFormula) has a square root in it, so the final build time will only be 1/2 of normal. You need 16 builds to get to 1/4. Also, due to the weighting\u00A0non-used parts contribute way higher to the overall build time, so adding a gravioli detector or other new piece of equipment to a build can have a huge effect on the times.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe way the data is stored is just \u0022part name : count\u0022. Every time you\u00A0finish\u00A0a build of a vessel, all the unique parts are found and their tracker is increased by one. So if you build a 1000 part ship out of hitchhiker containers that will only count as one build and won\u0027t be very useful. That tracker doesn\u0027t care about how you arrange the parts, or if you\u0027ve used them before, all it does is increase the number by one. That number is the one that\u0027s grabbed by the variable above. The tracker also doesn\u0027t care if the part came from the inventory (the inventory is an almost identical system that\u0027s just \u0022part name : count\u0022 and doesn\u0027t track any additional data). The rationale for it being when finished is that the engineers have done 99% of the required work by then so they\u0027re familiar with how to put the pieces together again in the future. That also lets you build and scrap vessels when you have down time just to build up the inventory and the Build Effect tracker, for essentially free.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs you can guess from the simplistic setup of the tracker, everything is shared. In fact, as soon as a build completes any other builds have their build times recalculated to represent the new experience gain, so you\u0027ll see those ones speed up if they used common parts. I guess that answers number 5 as well. Note that the amount of time reduced is proportional to the amount completed, so it\u0027s most beneficial for something that just started building (closer to 0% the better). If something was 95% of the way done it won\u0027t magically be finished, but instead that remaining 5% might be reduced to more like 4%.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only ways to speed up rollout are to build as small as possible (mass-wise. Build times are cost based, rollout is mass based) or use the smallest launchpad you can. If you\u0027re launching a 10 ton rocket, use a level 0 pad and your rollout/reconditioning will be super fast. That\u0027s all defined by the Preset as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cs\u003E(wow, the formatting got way screwed up.

First off I\u0027d like to say that I love all the features that this mod implements, especially the simulated flight aspect. It has worked fine for the past month I\u0027ve been using it, but just a couple hours ago, something really weird happened. I was setting the parameters for a simulated flight, and was filling in the \u0022length of simulation\u0022 blank. I went to put in \u00221hr\u0022, but accidentally didn\u0027t put the \u0022h\u0022, and the GUI immediately closed to this little rectangle. On the debug menu it says \u0022format exception: unknown character: r\u0022 so it obviously had a problem with that. Every single thing else works perfectly fine still, I can build a craft, research tech, and they all go smoothly, but now, as soon as i try to click the \u0022simulation\u0022 button, the GUI comes up as a thin rectangle that I can\u0027t do anything with. It\u0027s hard to explain, but hopefully the pictures help.
