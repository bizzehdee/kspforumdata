Instead, it\u0027s usually an afterthought that doesn\u0027t get much attention until the shape of the cockpit model has already been settled, at which point it\u0027s too late.

While on the Standard cockpit it kinda worked out, on the inline cockpit I estimated things wrongly. In my defense, Kerbals have such damn large heads, it makes it difficult to place them in a narrow cockpit, with their eyes high enough to see below the horizon, and not clip into the ceiling with their big heads.

Not what I was hoping to hear tho X). I have the growing suspicion this could actually be a problem with SP\u002B. But how? The wings are pretty much an exact copy of the stock equivalents, nothing new or special about them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFound an old album where I actually have this with stock parts on screenshots. This was even before I started modding, maybe 0.21 or so, and unfortunetely the log doesn\u0027t say anything about \u0027collided with launchpad\u0027 so idk if its the same bug. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/Yzj22#19\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/Yzj22#19\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Uml\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCx\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Uml\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCx\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eman, i love this pack. the only things left would be (bigger) landing gear and some air brakes.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis will definetly happen.
