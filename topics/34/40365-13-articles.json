I was able to get my personal mods to work just fine with yours before this latest update. Now, however, I have no idea what I\u0027m doing wrong. What energy source needs to be applied to the Warp Drive for it to work now? Before, I simply made my reactors generate Megajoules to power the drive. But, since you\u0027ve changed the requirements, and none of the parts or cfgs I\u0027ve looked at seem to indicate what kind of energy the Warp Drives use to generate \u0022ExoticMatter\u0022 for use, I\u0027m absolutely lost. I\u0027ve tried making my generators create every type of energy I could think of, VacuumPlasma, ThermalPower, Megajoules, even ExoticMatter, but none of them seem to work.\u003Cp\u003ECould you please enlighten me as to what I\u0027d need to have my reactors generate, or what I need to add to their CFGs, in order to power and run the Warp Drives?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey still use Megajoules to generate the ExoticNatter, problem is the new resource system I added actively manages resources in a rather complicated way. The problem I\u0027ve found with the stock resource system is that if you have different parts adding and taking away different quantities of resources - especially non-specific quantities e.g. in the case of the warp drive using spare Megajoules to generate ExoticMatter. My new resource system uses a resource manager to control these problems, it means that a single part does all the adding and taking away of resources rather than allowing race conditions to develop. It\u0027s extremely efficient but less than ideal for compatibility.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou therefore have three options:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Easiest - Make whatever part you are using just generate ExoticMatter to fill up the Warp Drive directly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) (Might not work) Add an electric generator or microwave power receiver to your ship, you don\u0027t need to attach a reactor or power it, its presence will create the resource manager. Since the warp drive is supposed to be careful about not drawing too much power, this may not work, since the resource manager won\u0027t know about your supply.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Hardest but most effective: You can make your parts use the resource manager code and integrate it fully into the mod. This is relatively easy to do, you only need to add a few lines of code, but obviously requires some level of C# programming knowledge.
