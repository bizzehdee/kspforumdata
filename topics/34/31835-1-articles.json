Why that proprietary product?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA: Plain and simple answer is that product does formatting better. I tried with Google Docs and then wanted to punch a hole in my screen. And no.. I don\u0027t have anger management issues, which is why this is surprising.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQ: Are macros enabled?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA: ABSOLUTELY NOT.

There isn\u0027t anything fancy going on in here that\u0027d warrant anything more. It apparently is also capable of working under OpenOffice (Just downloaded and tested in 3.4.1). The looks are off, but it functions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQ: I don\u0027t have this proprietary product!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA: I can\u0027t help you there, so download and install OpenOffice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQ: My antivirus is screaming about this!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA: Either trust your instinct, or ignore it. A lot of AV software complains when you try to download something that isn\u0027t archived, or throw a warning at you and make it sound like Armageddon. I can provide an XML file (Plain text) that will import into some spreadsheet applications, but I can\u0027t assure you that it will work 100%.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tek_604","CreatedById":59699,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-09T09:09:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is quite handy!
