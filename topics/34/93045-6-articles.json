Doing similar in .90 I was able to end the mission with around 50 science. Not bad for such a cheap rocket (with no heatshield, it cant survive re-entry). I take that and unlock the orbital rocketry tears and launch a sputnik like probe to orbit for my second which gave me enough to unlock the capsule/heatshield. For my third mission I orbited a human. For the next missions I used the heatshield to enable mystery goo stuff to survive re-entry.
