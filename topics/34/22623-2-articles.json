I would advise instructing Telemachus to listen on port 80 via the configuration file then attempting to connect from your iPhone without specifying a port. I would be interested to know if the graphs actually work on the iPhone, however the remote control pages should operate as they are much simpler. If that does not work, try connecting to the visualisations not through the landing page, as iOS Safari is extremely picky about HTML errors, in fact ...
