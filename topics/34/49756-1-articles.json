Just point towards that marker, and you\u0027ll be perfectly set up for docking; once you\u0027re oriented, the rest of the docking can be done using translation controls only.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTypically, this plugin allows you to dock by looking at nothing but the navball, never switching vessels, and saving tremendous amounts of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe mod is designed to be minimalistic, and feel as close to stock as possible; all it does is add that red marker. It therefore has almost zero memory/framerate impact and hasn\u0027t caused a single crash (that I know of). It is also part-free, i.e. it will automatically work with all vessels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe marker color and texture can be changed via config file (recommended for colorblind people); see the readme file for details.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor a long time, I knew that docking needed just \u003Cem\u003Esomething\u003C/em\u003E to make it less annoying; some kind of additional rendered line on screen, but I never really knew what precisely it was - until I discovered \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/43901\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003ENavyFish\u0027s awesome Docking Port Alignment Indicator mod\u003C/a\u003E. It gave me the whole idea for this mod, and I wish to thank him for that. However, the plugin had too many features for my taste; it opened an additional window, and displayed a lot of redundant information that is already in the navball. By that time, kitoban had already written his \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/50524\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Eequally awesome Enhanced Navball mod\u003C/a\u003E, so I had everything I needed: The idea, and example code that shows how to draw markers to the navball; I wish to thank kitoban for his pioneering work in that field.
