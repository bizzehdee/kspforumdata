I have no idea if this compound exists or even could exists, but since we\u0027re talking about a magic substance that produces all manner of fuels, I didn\u0027t worry too much. Based on that formula, I did some chemistry to figure out what amounts of various fuels would come out. So, 1 molecule of karbonite after conversion produces 1 molecule of methane (CH4) and 1 molecule of LOX (O2). All of the units/masses should be \u0022correct\u0022. And, any fuels that could not come from this (such as He) are not included. Most of my data came from Wikipedia.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly one fuel comes out at a time. I had previously worked out multiple fuels per conversion, but it seemed overly complicated. Plus, the default RF config for Kethane does one fuel at a time as well, so I figured I\u0027d follow that.

I have a couple thoughts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the most complicating factor is, for each fuel, what are you going to make with the leftovers? For the hydrocarbons, it\u0027s pretty obvious you want O2, and you may as well make H2 with any leftover hydrogen and N2 with any leftover nitrogen. But for Aerozine? You\u0027re going to make something like HTP or O2, both of which are pretty useless to you in 99.99% of cases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand, there\u0027s no downside if you do set up the configs to produce something out of the leftovers -- they\u0027ll just bleed off and the player will never see them if he doesn\u0027t have a tank to store them (and if he doesn\u0027t have a tank to store them he likely doesn\u0027t care). Ultimately, we\u0027re limited by the UI. There is only so much space for buttons to turn the refinery/distiller on and off, so we can only have so many choices available.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExtra thoughts: the reactions that produce H2, N2, and O2 should definitely all be the same reaction. You\u0027re just splitting the entire molecule apart and recombining everything diatomically. i.e make N2, get H2 and O2, make O2, get H2 and N2, etc. I say, save the making methane for the methane reaction, and let the methane reaction give you extra O2. Also, splitting Karbonite into methane, oxygen, and nitrogen as a one-stop shop for fuel, oxidizer, and monoprop is pretty damn cool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etl;dr for bipropellants, yes when possible, otherwise, maybe where it makes sense.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-23T02:59:09Z\u0022 title=\u002208/23/2014 02:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 23, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by lordkrike\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lordkrike","CreatedById":75091,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-23T03:28:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHad 30 more minutes to think about it and wanted to rephrase a little.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen making bipropellant fuels, you should definitely get the oxidier if possible.

However, Karbonite doesn\u0027t seem to support atmospheric resource gathering at the moment, and so in the meantime if we were to create a fractional distiller part to make xenon and helium from IntakeAir, it would be at fixed ratios in all atmospheres (unless you can think of a clever way to make it happen).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m going to write up some configs for atmospheric resource definitions to add to the pack. They can\u0027t hurt, and they\u0027ll probably be useful in the future. I\u0027ll submit a pull request when I\u0027m done finding realistic values for the different atmospheres.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lordkrike","CreatedById":75091,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-24T14:09:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI submitted a pull request.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDue to the high ratios of organic compounds in Jupiter\u0027s and Venus\u0027 atmospheres, it \u003Cem\u003Emay\u003C/em\u003E be possible to sustain indefinite flight using Karbonite-fueled engines on Eve and Jool... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Raptor831","CreatedById":68286,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-24T14:46:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022lordkrike\u0022 data-cite=\u0022lordkrike\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI submitted a pull request.\u003Cp\u003EDue to the high ratios of organic compounds in Jupiter\u0027s and Venus\u0027 atmospheres, it \u003Cem\u003Emay\u003C/em\u003E be possible to sustain indefinite flight using Karbonite-fueled engines on Eve and Jool... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomeone\u0027s been busy. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E The only thing is that Karbonite \u003Cstrong\u003Edoes\u003C/strong\u003E have some atmospheric definitions already included, and it does have atmospheric scoops out of the box.
