Maximum scan range: 500m. Can be turned on and off from EVA. Can be radially attached. Proposed size: 8.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPortable Kethane Rig: Basically a smaller and lighter version of the radial Kethane drill, coupled with a small container for Kethane. Horrendously slow mining speed, and can\u0027t actually work unless it has a solar panel or some other electricity source attached to it. Proposed size: 30.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPortable Kethane Converter: A highly inefficient, but very compact Kethane Converter. Can basically only trickle-convert Kethane, but still does it. Proposed size: 16.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe above setup allows an emergency trickle-refuel station to be built, using the contents of a single 80-point KAS container, or two 40-point containers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBroken into two containers, this would be:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1st container: 30p Kethane Rig, 10p 1x6 solar panel array\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2nd container: 16p Converter, 8p Detector, 2x8p Pipe Connectors\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPresumably, a Kerbal would make trips, either on foot, on RCS, or on a mini-rover (depending on what survived the (crash)landing), carrying the Detector, to find a Kethane deposit, and would then deliver the two containers to the site.

A Solar Panel, and both the Detector and Converter are plugged into it, giving the contraption enough power storage, power production, and kethane storage to function.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, presumably, pipe connectors would be used to connect the converter to some form of container for the required type of fuel, preferably to the craft that needs refueling directly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr some other implementation of the idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, an emergency, lightweight, and compact, universal Kethane-powered refueling system, that can be either taken along with a lander, or delivered to a stranded craft via a probe.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-22T20:14:55Z\u0022 title=\u002210/22/2013 08:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 22, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Sean Mirrsen\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"melak47","CreatedById":49055,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-22T20:52:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022automcdonough\u0022 data-cite=\u0022automcdonough\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eah, ok i\u0027ll reload next time.

It carried a Magnet, Anchor, Connector port and a Grappling Hook before. On this vehicle, if I release the winch between the trailer and truck, the ground disappears and everything falls to the centre of Kerbin.

You pretty much can\u0027t link 2 things with the winch without docking them, else you have a very big chance they\u0027ll collide. That chance is there anyway, but if they\u0027re docked they\u0027ll just clip through each other so no biggie. And once you\u0027re docked you\u0027re a single ship, and transferring stuff around a ship is a game mechanic that would probably be very hard to change.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
