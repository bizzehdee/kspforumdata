Obviously people could cheat and just use the crazy amount to boost everything else, but I think it might be something worth considering. payouts could be labelled 100,001, 100,002, etc. And linked to those specific tech nodes that branch out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-14T00:56:58Z\u0022 title=\u002202/14/2014 12:56  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 14, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by MedievalNerd\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Visari","CreatedById":78487,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-14T12:07:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo if I understand this right;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe intent of the subnodes would be to balance the availability of parts with the missions provided, through placing nodes inbetween current nodes with specific high science costs so the player can unlock those nodes and thus the next tier of science through the equally high mission science payout?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esounds interesting, but that would mean MCE becomes mandatory, right?
