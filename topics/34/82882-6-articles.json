I think people just forget the experimental part. I have been careful to delineate that it is a different version. But it is still interstellar in my eyes. Most of the code is still kspi, I\u0027ve just polished the presentation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am a huge fan of the kspi series by manley, and I have even offered to help him transition to .24.2 with a largely unmodified recompile that wont break his save. I received no reply because it looks like he is sticking with an old version for the rest of the series.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHonestly, I had expect a lot more hate for my version from the realism people. Geeks can be geeky like that. I get the appeal. I really, really do. But the experience was suffering more than I thought it should, so I took the opportunity to polish things up since no one else was doing it. The thing is, all the numbers are completely arbitrary. I\u0027ve even had people offer real world pricing for the parts, which doesn\u0027t even begin to make sense. And lets not kid ourselves. Most of the stuff in the mod is speculation. There are no reactors that behave anything like even fractaluk reactors. Noone has ever taken an actual nuclear reactor, strapped a nozzle on the bakc end of it, and launched it into to space. KSPI from it\u0027s inception has always been INSPIRED by real tech. I would say it has been more accurately inspired by wild speculation on \u0022real world tech\u0022. As publish physicist, I like to think that know speculation when I see it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA game is about arbitrary rules. Soccer is a game because of it\u0027s arbitrary rules. The point of it all is fun, so you have to keep your eye on the ball. Realism can inspire rules to keep gameplay interesting, but it isn\u0027t interesting in and of itself. KSP is not a simulation, it is a simulation inspired space flight game about little green men on a tiny, soupy earth-like planet. It\u0027s quirky and light hearted, and it wouldn\u0027t be anywhere near a popular as it is now if they had went the heavy simulation route. I hadn\u0027t even heard of orbiter before KSP, and I\u0027ve always been a space geek.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe can get into the casual vs hardcore debate, but keep in mind, when FPSs came out there was a big uproar about how they were for the casual player and adventure games were the hardcore games. It sounds silly now, as it should.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd lets not forget. I will opening up the mod to better support cross compatibility wherever I can. The more part config options I open up, the better you\u0027ll be able to have your realfuels, RSS, FAR, DRE, TAC \u0022hardcore\u0022 experience. You\u0027ll be able to tweak the mod more readily with a MM pack. We aren\u0027t there yet, but it is in the cards. I what you guys to have your cake too.
