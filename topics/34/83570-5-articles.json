The dancing is pretty much gone for me. Planes seem to taxi reasonably both on electric wheel motors and engine thrust, including ascending and descending the ramps from KSC runway to terrain. Minor steering corrections during a takeoff or landing no longer cause most of the gear to go into a disastrous spasm. I also like the increased spring strength, my gear is no longer bottomed out by default.

A HDG2 gear module which folds sideways/inwards/upwards, allowing closely spaced axles in a fore-aft row, An-124 / An-225 style (not sure exactly how the Antonov gear retracts, no need to exactly copy the motion, just an alternative to the current fore-aft folding). That might work nicely on the S2W, attached to the flat outer edges.

Right?? Riight???\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHmm, I\u0027d say so because stock has really weird lift happening even when you\u0027re almost stationary, but VTOLS are tricky nonetheless, main reason they\u0027re tricky in KSP is the lack of controls to handle it and lack of fly by wire setup that handles it for you, even the harrier jump jet got upgraded to have some fly by wire to manage the VTOL later I think I recall correctly, controlling a VTOL manually is properly tricky, it can be done, and people do it in KSP, but it\u0027s quite a challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBest manual VTOLS I\u0027ve seen in KSP so far were all symmetrical or near to it and either had their fuel set up to drain evenly or used TAC Fuel Balancer to ensure all fuel drained evenly. This usually limits their usefulness though because it\u0027s pretty hard to make an SSTOSP symmetrical or close to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI flew one of these: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/AVYuqEu.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/AVYuqEum.png\u0022 alt=\u0022AVYuqEum.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E but with a 1m sabre added to the top and bottom of the center cargo space into space once: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/f4PzW#0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/f4PzW#0\u003C/a\u003E and yeah that\u0027s before the new bac9 made KSC and before B9 had landing gear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELast time I tried VTOL I went with \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/67270-Throttle-Controlled-Avionics-1-1-0-23\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/67270-Throttle-Controlled-Avionics-1-1-0-23\u003C/a\u003E not sure it still works, you also need a probe core or docking port on the top to set as your control reference to use that plugin because it doesn\u0027t understand 90 degrees from control point to thrust axis if that makes sense, needs 180. It\u0027s quite cool, it adjusts your engine\u0027s power individually and look at their locations and the way they face to work a lot like RCS does, if it realizes one engine getting more/less power would turn you in the direction you\u0027re trying to turn it tweaks the numbers a bit to get you to move in the fashion you want, it makes VTOLs very easy (or did) all you really need is enough engine thrust at the \u0022corners\u0022 of your craft and it sorts out the rest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan also use MJ\u0027s translatron, to hover or slowly ascend/descend in a controlled manner\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-02T14:07:29Z\u0022 title=\u002209/02/2014 02:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 2, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by K3|Chris\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-02T13:57:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve managed a tiltjet with Infernal Robotics, but it\u0027s very, very tricky to fly, much less transition to forward flight.
