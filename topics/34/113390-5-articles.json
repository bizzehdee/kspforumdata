Some write their own metadata and CKAN only references it, some simply ping us when something is wrong and some don\u0027t even know CKAN indexes their mod. [@Tekener](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/117427-tekener/) is half-correct: CKAN does indeed read the .version file in a given mod\u0027s zip. In the case of your mod you use a remote .version file so CKAN will prioritize that info over the local file (but only if the version of the mod in the remote version file matches the mod version).\n\nThe issue arose because the spacedock release was delayed. Within seconds of 2.1.1 hitting the spacedock server it was on CKAN. ~~Would it be best for us to target your github releases?~~ Just read a quote from you \u0022 Github is the master, spacedock the mirror.\u0022 So we\u0027ll be changing where we pull releases to GitHub.\n\nAs for documentation for CKAN a decent primer might be [https://github.com/KSP-CKAN/CKAN/wiki/Adding-a-mod-to-the-CKAN](https://github.com/KSP-CKAN/CKAN/wiki/Adding-a-mod-to-the-CKAN)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-09T14:53:08Z\u0022 title=\u002205/09/2016 02:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 9, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by plague006**"},{"CreatedByName":"Whovian41110","CreatedById":155794,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-10T21:57:19Z","Content":"Since this is a 1.1 plugin will it still work with 1.0.5\n\n(No it does not)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-11T18:51:12Z\u0022 title=\u002205/11/2016 06:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 11, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Whovian41110**"},{"CreatedByName":"Cairol","CreatedById":145279,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-27T15:35:23Z","Content":"I love this mod.
