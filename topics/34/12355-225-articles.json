I\u0060d like it to look at (and predict) the TWR for the descent and notice if it will have to stage in the next 800Dv say and what the TWR would be afterward (not enough, loads more?) then adjust the descent profile to match.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example a craft with 200 remaning DV on a stage with a TWR of 4 may well use that up in the first part of a descent and the stage that follows might be TWR 1.8. It may be that the craft stages in the middle of a suicide burn with obvious results. It would be better to treat the first 200Dv as though it were at TWR 1.8 so a more shallow profile could be flown.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConversely, if the first 200Dv is TWR 1.8 followed by a TWR of 4 then you could follow the current normal descent. You would slow down too early then freefall for a while and suicide burn. Still not perfect but ok.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso for low TWR craft coming in with a Pe of below 10-15km there should be a way of getting MJ to follow a very low stop and drop. I\u0060d like it to keep altitude until the horizontal speed is less than 100m/s and altitude is just above the highest mountain at that lattitude then drop and land.

The lander is swinging back-and-forth in both pitch and yaw, while the roll is vibrating rapidly. It looks like the lander is being suspended in a rubber band. The Landing AP has completely gone bonkers. I\u0027ve tried various values of Tf, with no improvement. If anything, changing the Tf only makes it worse. The interesting bit in all of this is, the de-orbit burn starts out OK, but craps out in the last few m/s of the burn. This also occurred with every maneuver node activity from Kerbin to Moho.

Before you give up on MechJeb, I\u0027d try it with an ascent goal of 85km and see if you get better results. Also, be sure to raise your maneuver planner tolerance from 0.1m/s to 6m/s (it\u0027s less precise, but you\u0027ll waste less delta V chasing nodes). The general idea is to shoot close to your intended target, but low enough that you\u0027re still traveling at a (slightly) faster velocity to make up for the ascent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yes, I am able to stage properly with v2.06 and MechJeb2... but with a few (minor) modifications. First, I have a timer bolted onto the TT18-A stability clamps to make them stage after about half a second (mostly for the cosmetic effect of watching the engines fire up before lift off). Also, as mentioned in the KSO thread, I linked the OA-850 boosters to the big orange tank with stock fuel lines. They stage earlier (~10km), but I\u0027m fairly certain without loss to overall delta V. (In fact, I think this is a more efficient arrangement - I net a delta V boost.) Lastly, I\u0027ve attached one of dtobi\u0027s staging devices from his wonderful \u0022Small Parts\u0022 pack to the Thrustmax External Fuel Tank. It monitors the big orange fella for when it\u0027s spent. When that happens it triggers a control group that stages the tank and switches my engines from the Thrustmax 200s to the Omnimax 40Ts. Not really necessary (the orange tank will stage properly on its own via MechJeb without dtobi\u0027s part), but it\u0027s a nice convenience. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Virtualgenius","CreatedById":67644,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-24T09:09:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have no issues with mechjeb getting the KSO to a 300km orbit it stages correctly, the LRB\u0027s jettison at around 16000KM.
