Setting that to 0 makes re-entries much more controllable.\u003Cp\u003ENow, the Taurus heatshield isn\u0027t massless, so CoM shifts down. I think the problem here is that it\u0027s too light - once ablator starts to burn out, CoM shifts up, destabilizing the capsule. To mitigate that, you should increase its dry mass - from 1 ton to, let\u0027s say, 2.5 or something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will look into this, but for now, I don\u0027t want to do a third patch so soon, so please feel free to edit the cfg yourself.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vandros","CreatedById":131571,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T08:27:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, Squads lighting reflexes are catching most modders by surprise \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut more importantly, love what you did with this mod!
