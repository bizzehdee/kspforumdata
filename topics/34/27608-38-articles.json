Upon loading the craft, the wings just fall off! This will happen even in a vacuum, as I just tested it with a spaceplane on a sub-orbital path at 75km altitude. I\u0027ll try to test this under more scenarios to make certain no other wings are affected, but I know for a fact that the stock advanced canards remain attached while the procedural wings detach. Also worth noting is that when I pull up the log using F3, there is no \u0022structural failure\u0022 message unless I quickload a craft which is in the atmosphere. If I have it in orbit or sitting on the runway the wings will just fall off, and I note that the game appears to think they are still part of the craft since the view zooms out to try and maintain the center of mass in the middle of the screen.
