With increase in size, the engines increase in weight and thrust. ISP stays the same.

Meanwhile, decreasing the ISP would mean increase in thrust. Also, this increase should be different for different engines. The OMS would be able to increase its ISP to a lot more than the launcher, and so on. This feature should be limited by the tech level the player is on, ie, if the player is just starting, the hard limit on engine ISP scaling would be a lot lower than what the player would have later in the career.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScaling an engine beyond a limit or so would mean clusturing of the engines.

But with that proviso, here\u0027s my thoughts on how to proceduralize engines. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, divide the procedural engine into three parts - the shrouded portion of the rocket engine, the exposed portion of the engine and the nozzle (or bell). By breaking the engine up it is possible to produce a larger number of variations with a smaller number of models. To produce 27 rocket engines could require 27 models if each is made as a unit, and as well, they might not rescale well as bigger engines should look beefier and would require more detail than smaller ones to look good. On the other hand, 3 shrouds, 3 motors and 3 nozzles, a total of nine models, also allows for 27 combinations ( 3x3x3 ), i.e. 27 different rocket motors. I think, again not being an expert or even overly familiar with the code behind the various procedural parts mods, I would think breaking the engine into a couple of simpler parts would also simplify any procedural rescaling of parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy reason for breaking them up into shrouded and exposed motor and nozzle rather than some other selection is as follows;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConsiderations for the Engine Parts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor most rockets, most of the rocket engine is actually inside a shroud or within the rocket fuselage itself. KSP fuel tank volume seems to be calculated on the complete volume of the fuel tank, not allowing for any noticeable portion of the internal space to be taken up by the rocket engine. So there is no penalty to having a big rocket attached to a tank, and no advantage for a smaller one. Adding a shrouded part seperates out the rocket motor volume from the fuel tank, while at the same time limiting he number of models that have to be made to reflect a large number of potential different rockets. Resizing these mostly cyclindrical or perhaps slightly flared or tapered parts would seem to be well within the capabilities already demonstrated by Stretchy SRBs, and similarly a relatively small number of textures would be required to match stock, KW Rocketry, Nova Pulse, NASA or Soviet styled fuel tanks. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe exposed portion of the engine could be as simple as an adapter plate to allow single or multiple nozzles to be attached. More elaborate models would only be required for engines that have a significant amount of exposed engine components. In rare cases, an engine could be totally exposed in which case the shrouded portion might be foregone and the engine attached directly to the fuel tank. The option for multiple connectors might need to be applied to the shrouded part as well as single or multiple exposed engines might want to be simulated, not just multiple nozzles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe maximum possible thrust that would be generated by the engine could be calculated based on the volume of the shrouded and/or exposed components as appropriate. The thrust could be modified to be lower for early tech engines and higher for later tech to reflect improved design, miniaturization of parts and better materials science. The size of the nozzle (see below) would be a limiting factor - a given size of nozzle can only handle so much exhaust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe maximum possible Isp of the engine is defined by the fuel used - no amount of technological advance in the rocket engine can increase the Isp for a chemical rocket, poor design can only reduce the actual Isp below this. KSP however uses a generic liquid fuel plus oxidizer (LFO), so to simulate the less efficient earlier fuels like alcohol or kerosene \u002BLOX (theoretical ISPs of 360s or lower) vs later fuels like Hydrogen\u002BLOX (Isp 450s or so), early technology rockets should have a lower Isp built in. Even if Squad were to implement multiple fuels, or if an add on like Real Fuels is used, it would still be appropriate the reduce the earlier tech engines\u0027 Isp\u0027s to some degree to reflect less efficient design, however the Isp of the fuel would be the more significant factor. For nuclear thermal, plasma and such like engines, the Isp is defined by the maximum working temperature of the nuclear engine or power plant, the efficiency of heat transfer to the propellant and the molecular or atomic weight of the propellant itself. But again, the power would be proportionate to the volume and tech level.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConsiderations for the Nozzle parts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rocket nozzle is almost always a simple straight or slightly belled cone (ignoring aerospikes for the time being). Generally, the only noticeable elaboration to the bell is whether or not it has a gimbal mechanism at it\u0027s base, and likely that it is wrapped in a helical coil of piping that delivers coolant to the bell to prevent it from melting. Resizing the bell, essentially a cone, should be no more complicated than resizing the conical adapters already being done by Stretchy SRBs. The proportion of width to length of the bell will vary depending on whether it is optimized for use under standard sea level atmospheric pressure, in a vacuum or at some pressure level between the two. While this could probably be handled procedurally, it might produce some odd affects for the gimbal or coolant pipes if taken to extremes. Perhaps the gimbal should be moved to the engine portion rather than the bell to prevent this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason why the proportions of the nozzle can vary are because if the bell is too short, it is inefficient because the exhaust gas doesn\u0027t have time to expand enough, if it is too long the exhaust jet can separate from the nozzle, which also reduces efficiency. The optimum length of the bell increases as the ambient atmospheric pressure decreases. The consequences of either type of inefficiency is lost thrust and so effectively reduced ISP. You can read more on rocket nozzle theory here if interested --\u0026gt; \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_engine_nozzle\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_engine_nozzle\u003C/a\u003E. Anyway, because the length of the nozzle can vary significantly, if not handled procedurally then several lengths of nozzle would be required to reflect the different optimizations, perhaps as little as three - a short wide one for the liftoff stage, a longer narrower one for use in space and one in between for those optimized for an intermediate pressure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thrust or ISP changes for the engine would need to be reflected with a \u0022pressure curve\u0022 not that different that the velocity curves currently reflected in some KSP engines. This curve would have to be created programmatically to reflect the efficiency at various pressures which in turn would be determined by the length of the nozzle. I assume that this would have to be handled by a plugin that could analyze the nozzle measurements being created by the player.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is one more complication for nozzles - at higher tech levels it should be possible to have nozzles that adapt to maintain optimal length for the ambient air pressure. One method of doing this is to have a nozzle that extends in order to maintain the optimum length as pressure reduces, as has been done in the NK-33. This would be reflected by a more forgiving pressure curve, and it should be reflected in an engine animation, which I think would take it out of the bounds of a procedural engine mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAerospike engines avoid the problem of optimum nozzle length changing as ambient pressure decreases. From what I have seen of aerospike engines, they are visually simple, just a cone (or a wedge for linear aerospikes) narrowing to a point, i.e. the reverse of a normal nozzle which widens. Any coolant piping is on the inside to maintain a clean exhaust flow, so there is little or no detailing required, which should make them very simple to rescale compared to a standard nozzle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you think?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
