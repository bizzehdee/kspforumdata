This version definitely pushes the stiffness of rockets back towards what they were in 0.23, but I\u0027m still noticing a decent amount of \u0022engine dance\u0022 on higher thrust engines pushing a large load into orbit. The ship remains controllable, but 0.23 had zero physics dancing. I noticed in the config that the angularDriveSpring, driveDamper and MaxForceFactors had been changed from 0.23. I\u0027ve tried using the 0.23 values (which were quite a bit higher) but it doesn\u0027t seem to have any effect. I\u0027ve added more struts, but can\u0027t completely get rid of the dancing.
