I fires a full salvo of 16 inch guns at one of the hull pieces and it got destroyed. The nukes are kinda iffy. a nuke should kill off all the space center buildings but some don\u0027t. I\u0027m kinda limited on what i can do with damage. You can mess with the configs if you want.

The actual hull parts have ballast in them. Those are to weigh the hulls down so the ballast tank doesn\u0027t get so heavy it easily falls off. Make sure the hulls have water in them (the water in the hulls can also act as a balancing tool also).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat is going on? are the nodes not attaching?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWorking again, just re-install the mod\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
