I basicly use the same techniques I\u0027d use for a traditional hohman transfer. Set the target, set the dV, tweek it till the closest approach gets an encounter. only real difference is your dV budget is significantly higher and your probably not waiting for a launch window, you just go when your orbit around the parent body is faceing the right way. That and you probably want to be in an orbit in the 200-300km range or higher as your burn vector has a prety good chance of intercecting the atmosphere if not the ground itself if your in LKO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom my few attempts at it it seems the outbound dV requirement is inversly proportional to the time your shaveing off the trip from a homan transfer. one example was kerbin to jool, standard approach ~280days and 2k dV, direct approach ~57 days and about 10k dV. a few other dV values on that same transfer loosely followed the same ratios of time vs dV. 1/X time cost X*dV. Havent tried geting a transfer that went down to eve or moho however so dont know if it holds going that way. Jool duna and interestingly enough minmus were pretty similar however. Also didnt try when the target planet was significantly out of phase as both duna and jool were withen a month of a hohman window\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NeoAcario","CreatedById":24645,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-06T17:57:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey Fractal... have you considered allowing a few of us access to edit the Wiki?
