Many thanks for replying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[edit] One more questions and i think this has been brought up before. I have built a craft and its purpose is to drop the habitat module (mod) with solar panels and drills on the mun and a return vehicle attached to the top of this to take the single pilot back to kerbin leaving a \u0022base\u0022 running Z02 on the mun. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem i am having is when i seperate the last stage, my kerbal instantly dies as the z02 main module is left behind on the \u0022base\u0022 and the return vehicle is seperated from the z02 main module. Is there any way around this? - i could just put a mechjeb pilotless module on there instead i suppose.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBogus.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-08-23T17:40:50Z\u0022 title=\u002208/23/2012 05:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 23, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by Bogusheadbox\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"l00","CreatedById":11431,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-23T23:03:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYepp, the pics section has it wrong indeed.
