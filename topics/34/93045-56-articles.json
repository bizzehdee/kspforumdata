This makes building a craft near the tonnage limit or avionics limit very uncomfortable...\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor example I\u0027m now building a moon lander with 1.7t avionics and I wanna put as much fuel in it as I can: KER, Mechjeb all say it\u0027s 1.696t. The VAB shows 1.9t. When I launch it, avionics are locked because the mass is said to be 2.696t...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI usually manage to identify the faulty part that alters the mass count: I\u0027ve had this happen because of parachutes (realchute), because of wings (proc wings), because of fairings (proc fairings), because of srb (you can guess) and because of fuels (realfuels). Sadly there isn\u0027t always a workaround: sometime deleting the part and recreating it fixes the mass count for the vab (I have to do this everytime i reload the craft), allowing me to launch. Sometime deleting all fuel and refueling at launchpad fixes the avionics limit. As for parachutes there is no fix: the vab part list says the cone chute is 0.2t. I add it to my lander, go to action group and adjust realchute settings, now the parachute weights 16kg. But of couse the VAB mass count sees it still as 200kg.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think this should be a major bug to focus on. It really is game-breaking.\u003Cbr\u003E\nOne question: as for physics calculation (twr, acceleration etc) is the mass read correctly? Or do my rockets lose actual deltav because of this bug?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSorry for the long post and bad english.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003Etl;dr \u003C/strong\u003EWrong mass count, many mods involved.

I am not using baloon tanks, is that a procedural option? Also are you just decoupling the engines at 130s or the side tanks as well? I don\u0027t have a LES in RP-0 yet, 23m is just the tank length.\u00A0 What are you using for flight control the 3M core or something else? I haven\u0027t thought about lightening up the capsule in any way yet but I\u0027ll try the ablator trick.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso what sort of flight profile are you using? I start the gravity turn at 100m/s then follow the ship over to about 45 degrees until my apoapsis is what I want ~150-200 and then pitch toward horizontal.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have a R7 style rocket that has been my goto launcher and works very well but I wanted to try this route as well.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-19T21:28:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA 2m guidance ring should be sufficient, it supports the full mass of Atlas (that\u0027s what it\u0027s for, mostly).
