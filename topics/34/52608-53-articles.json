When I am heading slightly less than 90 degrees, the sideslip indicator moves all the way to the left of the compass, as if I were moving around 270 degrees instead of around 90 degrees. It works properly when I am heading greater than 90 degrees, however.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am using the latest stable release (though this problem predates this version; I only just identified the cause of the bug) with KSP .23.5 and FAR, MechJeb, Joint Stabilizer, and Chatterer installed, though I seriously doubt any of those mods will affect this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I\u0027m actually unsure if the problem is triggered when the *Sideslip Indicator* moves left of 90 degrees, or when my *heading* moves left of the same.
