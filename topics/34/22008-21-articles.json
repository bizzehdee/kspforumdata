Fuel tanks for ballast is about the most ineffective way tbh, its better if your ballast material is a bit heavyer per unit and constant. My best sub tests I was using tanks i made with stock generator module to produce \u0027ballast\u0027 a resource weighting 0.25 per unit, each tank also had purge system.
