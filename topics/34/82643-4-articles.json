They look great and the functionality is fabulous, which is a bit of a rare combination.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo ideas I\u0027ve had, the first one being more practical/doable than the other:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe in future releases we could be able to store the internal modules and/or the hatch on the outside nodes of the frame, where the panels currently attach to? Only because it\u0027s difficult for a single kerbal to remove/move around modules without leaving pieces (floating away) everywhere. So let\u0027s say you\u0027re going to roleplay a maintenance mission on a BoxSat, if one of the sides of the frame isn\u0027t covered by a solar panel or something else, the kerbal could store the hatch on that free side while working on the inner modules.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI realize that might pose problems when you want to \u0027store\u0027 the hatch back in it\u0027s natural position, but it\u0027s an idea. Maybe make another slim part that attaches to the outside of the frame that hatches and modules can be attached specifically too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy other idea is a bit more far-fetched, but I\u0027d love it if there were eventually TAC Life Support converter modules. Be able to build a frame to the side of a station/base with water filters or CO2 scrubbers built in. Adjusted to work for a smaller number of kerbals than the original TAC parts. Might be totally outside the scope of what you want to do, but I at least would use the heck out of such a thing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-30T21:23:17Z\u0022 title=\u002208/30/2014 09:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 30, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Boomerang\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"somnambulist","CreatedById":62108,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-30T19:25:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMinor bug report -- the fixed solar panel doesn\u0027t show up in the tech tree because \u0027techRequirement\u0027 is case sensitive.
