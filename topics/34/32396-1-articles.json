You\u0027ve even made the base self-sustaining - via Kethane, perhaps - and then one day you come in a little too fast for the landing and break your lander. What to do? Or, perhaps you have a new vehicle you want to launch from your Tylo colony, but don\u0027t want to wait seven months for a transfer window. The answer to both these problems has, so far, been either to send a new rocket up from Kerbin (and in the latter case, just wait) or to use an unrealistic plugin like Hyperedit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut what if you could set up another Space Center at your colony and build the ships there?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExtraplanetary Space Centers is here to allow that!
