This even happens if I only preload 1 crew. So it\u0027s indeed the first one who\u0027s thrown out afterwards by the boarding tourists (I\u0027ve also seen the missing crew member(s) before I accept loading the tourists).\n\n**Edit2:** The way BizCoPo does it (i.e. using a dummy IVA model with too few seats) is definitely fishy. The stock Mk3 Cockpit, which has a maximum crew of 4, uses the \u0022Placeholder\u0022 model, which has 16 internal seats, so too many seems to be okay. Switching the BizCoPo from the \u0022Generic3\u0022 to the \u0022Placeholder\u0022 model indeed fixes it for me.\n\nSo, I guess, there is no value trying to fix on the Contract Configurator side, what is rather a BizCoPo bug.
