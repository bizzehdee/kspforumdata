I tested the KerbCom plugin quite and bit and got it where it would fly the shuttle pretty well, minus some bugs I am hoping can be fixed.

The most important thing is to get the main engine as \u0022low\u0022 compared to the center of mass on the shuttle stack, so the NASA shuttle is slung low on the tank, while the Buran-style rides higher so the tank/engine setup is low.

Well, if the main shuttle engines used regular Oxidizer, it is able to use the oxidizer stored on the actual shuttle rather than in the tank. The main engines use oxidizer at such a high rate that it basically empties the shuttle in slightly over 1 second of running time. This occurs even though the shuttle itself contains no liquid fuel (the onboard engines use mono-propellant \u002B oxidizer in order to share fuel with the RCS system as the real shuttle did - I cheated a little, the NASA shuttles used MMH and N2O4 in both the OMS and RCS thrusters, but I left my RCS using just monoprop to keep it \u0022stock\u0022 but also reused the monoprop \u002Boxidizer for the OMS)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo you need to throttle down and then right-click-disable the main engines (or use an action group) before the main tank runs empty and before you can ever fire up the orbital engines on the shuttle.

That really just swaps the problem around though, as then you wouldn\u0027t be able to refuel the shuttle on orbit without having a stock of LOX on your station, though you would need less. I\u0027ll ponder the swap to see if it would have any unexpected side effects, or if it would be an improvement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am working on some cargo-pods for the shuttlebay to carry a variety of fuel or equipment modules into orbit, either as extra fuel or science bays to dock with a station)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for what you need to change - LOX and stock Oxidizer are identical except in name, so you only need to edit the engine configs:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGameData\\TiberDyneShuttle\\Parts\\EnginesAndBoosters\\TD_EngBearCatSSMETriple (main shuttle engine)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGameData\\TiberDyneShuttle\\Parts\\EnginesAndBoosters\\TD_EngBroncoQuad (main engine on the \u0027Buran\u0027 tank)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand find \u0027name = LOX\u0027 in the propellant section, and change it to name = Oxidizer\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then change the fuel that\u0027s in the tanks:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGameData\\TiberDyneShuttle\\Parts\\TanksAndFuselage\\TD_SBSTank* (Long, Short, Cap, Endcap and the Orange variants)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand once again change name = LOX to name = Oxidizer\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, remember that the shuttle engine will then immediately eat your onboard Oxidizer if its ever throttled up when the external tank is dry. Since the Buran variant doesn\u0027t have a fuel line to the shuttle, it should be fine\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-02T20:13:40Z\u0022 title=\u002210/02/2013 08:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 2, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Tiberion\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
