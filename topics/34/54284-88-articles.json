The simplest one is using the base and drill from USI, Struts from B9, and a tank that I made using a USI model. The part I made is rather simple, just the USI tank (White cardboard tube) set to be equivalent to it\u0027s max settings with tweekscale, and Proxy Logistics module added to it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do have a question about distance though. I think read that it is 100m? I was trying to place the object about 70m out. I noticed that when I do try to build something over 100m out, but within the 2km render range, it behaves exactly like I described regardless of plan type.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-29T01:53:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow do I make the \u0027build resource\u0027 box in the VAB/SPH go away?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-29T02:30:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022smjjames\u0022 data-cite=\u0022smjjames\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHow do I make the \u0027build resource\u0027 box in the VAB/SPH go away?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClick the EPL button in the taskbar.

I should have thought to ask that. Yes, the limit is 100m (to the nearest stake of the site). Unfortunately, there is currently no indication that the survey station could not find a site. I am, actually, working on this. Not only that, but selected sites will be properly highlighted (ie, all stakes in the site will be highlighted, not just one), I am seriously considering color coding the highlights (red/green/blue for XYZ, I haven\u0027t decided on Origin\u0027s color yet), and it will be possible to choose the site when there is more than one site within range.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E5thHorseman\u003C/strong\u003E: I noticed you\u0027re not using KerbalStats (I won\u0027t say how I know, as that would give away the easter egg).
