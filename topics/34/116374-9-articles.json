There are a lot of caveats, though.\n\n- First of all, this is distributed under the [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) license. Potatto made ~~all~~ both the textures in this mod, and I simply used them in one of the worst ways possible.\n- You\u0027ll need [KSP 1.9.1](https://www.kerbalspaceprogram.com/) and [TextureReplacer 4.1.3](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/96851-19x-texturereplacer-413-2322020/).\n- The Kerbals in the main menu still have their Kerbal eyes rendered. This is because instead of using the texture in /Skins to overwrite the default texture, I copied the texture into the /Default directory. In flight, the only eyes your Kerbals should have are Scott\u0027s.\n- In order for your Kerbals to only wear Scott\u0027s skin and not anyone else\u0027s, you should remove TextureReplacer\u0027s default set of varied Kerbal skins in GameData/TextureReplacer/Skins/TR. There\u0027s also a TR.cfg in GameData/TextureReplacer that will become useless if you do this, so might was well get rid of it too.\n- This update is not efficient and I have done basically no testing on it besides that to make sure it sort of works in a vacuum.\n    - Therefore, I offer no support. If you have problems with this, you\u0027re on your own. I don\u0027t plan to update or debug this in the future because looking at these textures makes me feel uncomfortable and I don\u0027t know what I\u0027m doing anyway.\n\nNow that I\u0027ve tried to insulate myself from the consequences of this action, [Here\u0027s my attempt at making this for 1.9.1](https://www.dropbox.com/s/1m2gi61e0cg8crm/ScottManleyHeadPackButSlightlyWorse-1.0.zip?dl=0)."},{"CreatedByName":"Dman979","CreatedById":123837,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-08-11T02:35:36Z","Content":"Anyone know if this works in 1.12.1?
