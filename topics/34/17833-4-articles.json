You will need fly to and initiate your burns over the landing site yourself. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe whole point of the Flight Engineer was to give you all the information needed to fly, without the temptation of using MechJeb\u0027s automation. Please note that this plugin does compliment MechJeb in many ways if you do wish to use them side by side. It is just that my personal goal for this plugin was to be able to fly completely manually, whilst still being as accurate as MechJeb (if you\u0027re a good enough pilot \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E).

The best way is to assume 4,500 to 5,000. This cannot be calculated because it varies so much on how you fly. If you fly slower you need more delta V to overcome gravity, and if you fly faster you need more because you\u0027re creating more drag. Sometimes your ship design will need that extra 200m/s, and sometimes you might have 200m/s to spare. That\u0027s where efficient flying comes into play and why there\u0027s an atmospheric density display, so you can plan your gravity turn based on when it is most efficient etc. (around 10k-12k)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechJeb does not calculate your delta V using the ascent computer based on the ship design... It just records the deltaV used and how much of it was used to do a certain thing, ie. overcome drag. No matter what design you\u0027re using. It works in the complete opposite of the Flight Engineer. MechJeb says how much you\u0027ve used (only when launching) in a very passive sense as it is happening. The Flight Engineer shows how much you have remaining (throughout the whole flight) in an active sense of analysing the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is one of them examples where both plugins do things completely differently but compliment each other nicely. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
