Most of the time it does not effect things, but other times like the mission you listed it causes problems with getting double payments and objectives. Not much I can do about it right now, since kerbals are vessels and MCE is in reality not doing anything wrong. The only way I could get rid of this is to ban EVA kerbals, and that would cause issues with EVA missions. Until kerbals count as something other then a vessel its going to be the way it is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPretty sure that KSP does have a Is EVA bool, kinda like the is flight and is editor. I will see if maybe I can add something with this that might help in this situation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpdate for .69. I managed to fix this, it took a hell of a lot of testing, and pulling of my hair. But I managed to make the game basically Reject any type of EVA as mission objective acceptable. Only objection to this new rule is when the mission calls for an EVA or Undocking or Docking.

This is a contract mission to do an orbital research mission over Minmus. I had no issues finishing this mission and lets go over the pictures I have (also for record I was recording this as next video for youtube page so be up next week, but I have pictures also.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first pic is a few seconds before the 1 day time period is over. The 2nd pic is right after the mission finishes notice I get the pop up that is going to give me the mission payout. But also notice that both the Orbit Research and the time both turn red. This is completely normal the mission is now finished so doesn\u0027t matter what color they are. Also notice in the 2nd picture a new button has appeared called HIDE FINSISHED GOAL. Its not really needed in this mission since the only goals were all part of the same SubMission Goal and that was to orbit, and do the research. If there was a 2nd goal, like land back on Kerbin you can hit that FINISHED GOAL button to completely hide the previous mission goals, and only focus on current ones. Again not needed in this example. but if you look at third picture you will see that I hit it just to show you what happens the goal is gone. I complete mission and get payed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RCl7wac.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022RCl7wac.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the question is what happened to your mission? You have hidden some of the screen so I can\u0027t see the whole MCE window. But is it possible you launched this vessel while MCE was disabled? Because any vessel you launch while MCE is disabled gets tagged and can NEVER EVER be used for a MCE mission EVER! If this is true a very large Red Lettered warning will appear in the Mission Window telling you either your in Disabled mode, and or this vessel has been tagged and can\u0027t be used in missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact if we look at your pictures and mine, they are almost the same.. Almost, the time counted down, then reset to 1d, 0 which means MCE recorded that you finished the mission and reset the counter and turned red. But you don\u0027t have the Hide Finished Mission Button. Which means MCE did not record your vessel as actually finishing the mission, which brings me to the idea that maybe you launched this vessel under disabled.. Even if you noticed that you did this, turning disabled off will not fix the problem, because you launched the vessel for FREE, and now does not exist in MCE terms because it was tagged as a Disabled Vessel. This is to stop cheating. Its really the only way this might of happened. I have done these missions OVER and OVER and over and have not had any issue. Usually if a GOAL is not completed, you would still be counting UP with the counter, because it was never reset. If it resets, then the goal was completed. Again, disabled vessels launched under those conditions will NEVER work for a mission no matter what you do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also checked recycling for like the 5th time in 2 weeks and still works on my end. Don\u0027t skip the Revert button, its suppose to take you directly to Space Center View and this is where you get payed for the recycling. Again with a pop up explaining what it is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd to restate how recycling works again. You DON\u0022T GET the WHOLE vessel back or ALL the MONEY. You only get a little bit. If you launch a vessel that cost 75,000 Dollars. That 75,000 includes the whole vessel with FUEL, And launch vehicle. When you only come back with a POD. Your only getting money back on the POD. Nothing else.. If you bring more of the vessel home, then you get payed more. but NEVER EVER 100%. Never going to happen, in fact many would argue that MCE gives you way to much money back and is completely unrealistic. Including the FUEL. And I agree but for game play purposes its more fun this way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMalkuth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet me make one more check to make sure the disabled warnings are still appearing. Might be possible they are not. Just a second.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit. So ok, the disabled plugin still shows up, BUT the info about the vessel being Tagged as not usuable because it was launched while disabled is not showing in contract screen. But does show up if using the Regular mission screens. This is my fault and I will get a fix up for the Displayed label as soon as I can. Then at least you will know if the vessel was tagged because it was launched in Disabled mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpdate for .69. Its also possible I had an older version of the Contract missions uploaded with older versions. It was behind a little bit. Not sure what I changed in the newer version (could of been a simple spelling fix, or anything really) but I was using the newer version to do the above test. And now the newer version is available in .69 with the updated warning messages.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-30T17:19:45Z\u0022 title=\u002205/30/2014 05:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 30, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by malkuth\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"malkuth","CreatedById":57414,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-30T17:01:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EVersion .69 is out\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Fixed: Added the warning \u0022Vessel Tagged, Vessel was launched in Disabled mode and cannot be used for MCE missions\u0022 To the contract missions, this warning did work in the Package Mission window though. What is this? It\u0027s in the manual but I will say it again in this. If you disable MCE in the settings window, any vessel you launch while MCE is disabled will be TAGGED. When tagged these vessel can NEVER EVER be used in ANY mission controller Mission EVER! If your launching vessel\u0027s in disabled mode you are launching them for FREE. So this is to avoid users cheating by using the disabled mode!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Fixed: There was an issue with how missions were recorded when you went EVA with a kerbal. For instance if you were doing the Random mission Early Manned Mission Rocket Basics, this mission has a whole lot of Altitude Optional Goals. If while doing this mission you went EVA with your Kerbal you would be Double payed for the current goals done. this is now fixed, and their is a New warning that works the same way as Throttle Up warning. Only this time the warning tells you that a kerbal is EVA and cannot finish the Mission goal without going back into Pod. When your doing a Mission that REQUIRES an EVA for a mission goal, durning that goal the new check is disabled automatically and does not apply. It also does not apply to Docking or UnDocking. Those are the only situations where you are allowed to go EVA (while trying to complete a MCE mission). This does not mean your limited to not EVER doing EVA missions. LOL. Just if you are trying to finish up a mission, just like you have to have THROTTLE DOWN to finish, now you have to NOT BE in EVA to finish most missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.
