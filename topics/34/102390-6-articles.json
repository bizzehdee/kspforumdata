The pop-up to write something on the plaque never pops-up which I think it the main issue. The unresponsive Kerbal will still have the right-click menu (and can even take the flag back down), but that Kerbal will never move again.\n\nThis is repeatable.\n\nI have a much more detailed write-up (including which mods I had at the time, and the steps I followed to isolate the problem to your mod) in the following thread: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/119040-Planting-a-Flag-on-Minmus-Makes-Kerbal-Unresponsive?p=1898987#post1898987](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/119040-Planting-a-Flag-on-Minmus-Makes-Kerbal-Unresponsive?p=1898987#post1898987)\n\nI hope there\u0027s enough information there for you to confirm the problem and maybe resolve it.
