Can depleted sample experiments (sci jr and goo) ever be restored? I understand part of the challenge is the 1-and-done nature of these experiments but since I want to build a reusable lander for Minmus, I really don\u0027t want to put like 8 of each on what should be a fairly simple lander. I tried using a scientist to do it but there was no option to restore or \u0027clean\u0027 it. Do they need to be a certain level? I also read some passing comment without detail about how labs can restore them. So if I bring my lander back to a base with a lab, then I can restore it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nno, they cannot be restored.

Putting TWO flags between the habitat and the sun, reduced radiation by 86%, two solar panels reduced radiation by 99%.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI tested \u0022standoff\u0022, whether moving the shielding object further from the ship improves shielding. It does, but by very very little. For example in a particular solar storm, a flag on the surface of the habitat reduced radiation to 0.444 rad/h, the same flag at the maximum extension of a 1P4 telescoping cylinder, reduced radiation to 0.441 rad/h. So there is an effect, but it\u0027s absolutely negligible.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe surface attached part can be inside the habitat, that is fine. However if the raycast starts INSIDE a part, that part does not contribute to shielding: embedding a habitat inside a larger part such as a fuel tank does not help. However if the larger part has internal walls such as a structural tube or a service bay then it does work, the principle is probably that the raycast has to hit a wall you can\u0027t see through: essentially if you can see the sun, the sun\u0027s radiation can see you. Also it doesn\u0027t appear to check other vehicles, a Kerbal on EVA can\u0027t shelter in the shadow of a ship.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe upshot: higher density objects are more effective for radiation shielding, but they don\u0027t need to be very high density, solar panels work well, flags are a bit flimsy but significantly better than nothing. Stacking layers of shielding is probably far more effective than heavier shielding. Enclosing the habitat inside an object with inner walls like a cargo bay is useful. Standoff doesn\u0027t literally do nothing but is practically worthless.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nA habitat in a base can be shielded simply by blanketing it in surface attached parts or placing it inside a cargo bay or service bay.

Symmetry packing a large numbers of batteries or something around the center of the habitat also allows for extreme level of shielding for negligible investment: why shield the enter surface when you can shield a single point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis is the measured in-game behaviour.

Can someone explain this part of the mechanic? Why can I go for long periods of time without any appreciable nitrogen loss but then all the sudden it seems to pick up and goes away in minutes? What is nitrogen actually used for? As I understand it it allows for more/longer EVAs but even when I am out the game allows me to EVA.

It was in orbit with 2 kerbals on board for about a month and nitrogen was barely depleting. Then I brought 3 more kerbals with a lander to the station. Went down to the surface to do some science and come back. Now my nitrogen has completely run out in the time it took for the lander to go the surface, do one biome hop, and come back. Less than a day. 2 kerbals went to the surface, so only 1 extra kerbal was on board the station during this time. It should increase usage by 50% by adding 1 kerbal the crew, no? This happened before, although I don\u0027t remember the details because at the time I just assumed I did something wrong so I don\u0027t remember the exact circumstances except that it also involved docking/undocking a lander. It seems something happens when a docking event or transferring kerbals between different parts of a vessel causes extreme nitrogen usage. Or maybe I just am misunderstanding the entire mechanic.

Before I sound like I\u0027m just complaining all the time I want to state I really love this mod. I\u0027ve played so much KSP over the years it has gotten boring, even with lots of mods. New parts are just new parts, but this mod introduces a whole new level of gameplay that makes things challenging and interesting so thank you mod creators!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNitrogen... I cannot understand it. Seems most parts come with loads of it and there is no need to pack extra. I\u0027ll go for days or even months without even having to worry about nitrogen, but then all the sudden it just runs out like crazy. There doesn\u0027t seem to be any bad consequences from it though. Kerbals don\u0027t die or anything and even though it warns me I can\u0027t EVA, I still can. Can someone explain this part of the mechanic? Why can I go for long periods of time without any appreciable nitrogen loss but then all the sudden it seems to pick up and goes away in minutes? What is nitrogen actually used for? As I understand it it allows for more/longer EVAs but even when I am out the game allows me to EVA. I\u0027m not sure if it is bugged or what.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExample: I built a rather large station around Minmus. It was in orbit with 2 kerbals on board for about a month and nitrogen was barely depleting. Then I brought 3 more kerbals with a lander to the station. Went down to the surface to do some science and come back. Now my nitrogen has completely run out in the time it took for the lander to go the surface, do one biome hop, and come back. Less than a day. 2 kerbals went to the surface, so only 1 extra kerbal was on board the station during this time. It should increase usage by 50% by adding 1 kerbal the crew, no? This happened before, although I don\u0027t remember the details because at the time I just assumed I did something wrong so I don\u0027t remember the exact circumstances except that it also involved docking/undocking a lander.
