It\u0027s an agency request, so we\u0027re not sure why they asked for it to be there. Perhaps they plan on crashing it into an atmosphere in the future, or they are thinking of giving the Mun an atmosphere. Who knows. Maybe they want to prove that it doesn\u0027t work.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEh, just because KSC doesn\u0027t gain anything useful from a result doesn\u0027t mean that other people aren\u0027t interested or that the test isn\u0027t valid in some way. If Rockomax wants to know if it\u0027s a hard vacuum in high orbit of the Mun, I\u0027m happy to take their money and cart a barometer out there to confirm it (even if we all know what the answer is going to be already \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it\u0027s a neat feature.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way, three little things - rescue missions aren\u0027t showing up again.. would you know if they have some sort of tech prerequisite? Also I\u0027m running with modded (nerfed) science return values, does that affect funds payouts too(they seem lower..)?
