It\u0027s true that real-world LH2/OX tankage ratio is closer to 2:1, but Nertea\u0027s cryogenic engines run a bit more fuel-rich than their RL counterparts.

Nor would we add boiloff to a stock resource. Adding boiloff for LH2 but not LOX makes a certain amount of sense anyway, as boiloff is a much less severe problem for LOX compared to LH2 in the real world. Moreover, the mass \u0022penalty\u0022 for extra insulation/refrigeration for LH2 is actually relatively minor - that is, the interval mass difference between LH2 lifting tanks and ZBOs is equivalent to only 10% of the dry mass of a volume-matched LFO tank.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The true dry mass \u0022penalty\u0022 for LH2 tanks is primarily related to fuel density. LH2 is far less dense than other fuels, and therefore requires much greater (~700%) tank volume for an equivalent fuel mass. Greater tank volume means greater tank mass, though the mass per volume is actually only half as much (or less), as mentioned above, which partially offsets this penalty. The penalty is further mitigated by using 2x the real-world density of LH2. What we\u0027re left with should be a bit inferior to LFO as a fuel type, but reasonably easy to balance by giving NTRs attractive properties.\n\u003E \n\nThanks for your considered answer here. LOX can hardly be considered a \u0022storable\u0022 - usually it would be gone in a couple of weeks - but I understand that altering a stock resource would be wrong. This isn\u0027t Realism Overhaul. Then again, LH2 is now the only propellant with RO-like properties, i.e. boiloff. Those NTR \u0022attractive properties\u0022; would that mean lowering the mass of all NTR engines, increasing thrust, etc? Stock ones, or the Nova from Ven\u0027s revamp, are, as things stand, completely non-viable.\n\nHydrolox engines are also non-viable though. I cannot currently design any craft, or any stage, where hydrolox makes more sense than LFO. Nertea talked about un-nerfing the cryo engines and I hope that happens. LFO stages are lighter, higher TWR, lower part count, and higher dV right now, even without ZBO EC penalties.

However, when arguing that LH2 tanks ought to be lighter, based on comparisons to specific real-world rocket stages or lack of need for internal bracing (as Bluebottle was doing), I believe it\u0027s useful to step back and remember that empty LH2 tanks are actually the lightest objects in the game for their size.\n\u003E \n\nYes, they are. And the mass and volume ratios you\u0027ve implemented are remarkably realistic (very close to the Delta IV CBC). A Centi-2 \u002B Centi-3 tweakscaled (I know, I know) to 5m give me something very close to a D-IV CBC tank ([http://spaceflight101.com/spacerockets/delta-iv-heavy/](http://spaceflight101.com/spacerockets/delta-iv-heavy/)), so the 2x fudge isn\u0027t actually unrealistic *in that case*. The engine TWRs, though, have relegated cryo engines to being niche parts - suitable only for a 2nd/3rd stage lifter - which is somewhat realistic, *but therefore* unbalanced versus the now-magical-by-comparison LFO. What I\u0027m saying is: nobody\u0027s going to use them, at least nobody who uses KER or Mechjeb for dV calculations, or anybody cares about part count and doesn\u0027t weld (so, so many tanks on interplanetary vessels).

Surface area increases at a much lower rate than volume ([http://www.tiem.utk.edu/~gross/bioed/bealsmodules/area_volume.html](http://www.tiem.utk.edu/~gross/bioed/bealsmodules/area_volume.html)), so the relative losses at larger volumes should be far below the current, linear relationship of 0.1 EC per 1000 LH2. There would have to be two metrics, I suppose: an absolute cooling EC demand that tapers down as the absolute volume increases, and a relative, per-vessel EC rate that compares the current LH2 remaining to the MaxAmount. A full tank means the volume:surface-area ratio is at its most favorable, and the bigger that tank is (in absolute terms), the better. This is because, per unit of LH2, a full Centi-2 should require much more cooling than a full Mondo, simply due to the volume:surface-area ratio. Just pie-in-the-sky stuff that would require large and unpleasant changes, I guess, but it could be a way to help NTR viability on large vessels.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-04T17:18:48Z\u0022 title=\u002202/04/2016 05:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 4, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Bluebottle**"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-04T17:38:11Z","Content":"I wasn\u0027t much involved, but I believe the flat rate was an intentional choice intentional to keep the system straightforward and simple.

They have less TWR, are more expensive, require relatively large tankage and EC to combat boil-off and return higher Isp and less wet mass overall. Conventional LFO setups give more thrust and dV assuming the same tankage volume with no drawbacks. I haven\u0027t played with cryo that much and can\u0027t quite wrap my head around in what situations would a cryo propulsion setup be better than an LFO one.\n\nLifters? Good ASL Isp, don\u0027t need fancy tanks but the stage is quite large and has less TWR. I tried using the first cryo engine you get in the career but ended up going LFO with a Swivel simply because it was cheaper, dV-richer and smaller in size. In an old save I had, when there wasn\u0027t boiling off, I \u0022engineered\u0022 an [SSTO to Duna](http://imgur.com/a/HQFc7) which worked quite well and it was fun to try out but obviously in real missions a design like that would be kinda silly.\n\nDeep space stages? Need to pack up additional EC which is mass, which is less TWR and dV. Nukes, LFO and electric engines do that job quite well too.\n\nIt feels as if cryos are a sidegrade to conventional engines but the stats are balanced in a way it\u0027s just easier to use the existing designs. A TF2 analogy comes to me: there is a default rocket launcher. Well, it\u0027s been there forever, a good, reliable weapon. Then later a sidegrade is introduced. The projectile travels 80% faster, does 25% more damage but the splash radius is basically non existent. In serious gameplay (competitive) practically nobody uses the last one because it\u0027s very situational and on top of that is highly dependent on one\u0027s ability to aim good very fast and score direct hits which is instantly thrown off by the 80% faster projectile.
