Back then I had uses Kerbal Alarm Clock (as well as other mods). On the current game I\u0027ve started on 1.04 I hadn\u0027t used any mods yet and now I\u0027m at the point where I could really use Kerbal Alarm Clock. So I downloaded the latest (3.4.0.0), extracted the TriggerTech folder and placed it in the GameData directory, started up KSP, and nothing. No Alarm Clock from any view. I tried starting a new game to see if there was some issue with my saved game, no luck. I looked at the output log for KSP and saw it loading Kerbal Alarm Clock components.
