Your best option for that is MechJeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, i have plans to add a Instrument Landing System which will enable graphical overlays and readouts to assist you with the landing. You will then be able to paint the LZ and get a target overlay in-game and on the map. It will most likely also come with readouts that tell you how far you are away from the LZ, the horizontal and vertical speed of your vessel, and information about the elevation of the terrain at and around the LZ. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now you can use the Lazor Guided Flight system to make the landing easier. Specifically the RetroGee function which will apply RSAS and also keep your vessel pointing up. The vertical speed readout on the Parameters tab will probably also be usefull. And finally you can use Lazor Vision to get an idea about how far away you are from the ground and the elevation. Just point the lazors downwards and you will see where they are hitting the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Volt","CreatedById":4686,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-12T18:01:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t get lazors to attach to color crystals, using your method or otherwise, in the SPH.

If the case is that you are running the system on a vessel with a lot of engines and few yellow lazors the extra thrust will be signifficantly less, as opposed to running a lot of yellow lazors on a vessel with few engines. On an airplane you generally need 2 yellow lazors per engine, and on a rocket you would need 4 per engine, to achieve the best results.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mooop12","CreatedById":24901,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-15T11:17:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks, putting more yellow lazors worked \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Does this mean that putting more purple lazors will result in a higher force they can apply?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Romfarer","CreatedById":20387,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-15T11:29:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022mooop12\u0022 data-cite=\u0022mooop12\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDoes this mean that putting more purple lazors will result in a higher force they can apply?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes.

As long as the target vessel is within 97500m, this is possible. However it would be extremely difficult to land the vessel safely because lazor system doesn\u0027t come with an automatic landing system and you will have to pull it off mainly by instrument readouts. Unfortunately the remote control system is partially broken at the moment where it for some reason don\u0027t work with vessels in orbit.
