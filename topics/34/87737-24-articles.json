The stock control surfaces apparently rely on the sign of the flight control deflection from the previous frame, but only for roll. For pitch and yaw, it uses the current frame. Basically the roll code is happening before the code that checks if the flight control is in front of the CoM. Since the StockPlus part fiddles with the control range, the roll setting was getting the wrong sign. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ser\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Ser\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHave some annoying issue but it is not common for most of the players however:\u003Cp\u003ENumpad keys seem to be permanetly bound to view rotation.
