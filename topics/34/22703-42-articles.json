It just did not suit the kerbals in the cockpit when I finally modelled an interior, and their heads\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Epractically stuck out of the ceiling. The Px-2 is now seriously scaled up, but not too big its hard to build in the hangar. Someone wants retracting landing wheels to come from underneath so thats about the only part left to finish on it and its released, i\u0027m not waiting for 0.21, if it breaks ill fix it as soon as the patch comes out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(apologies.. had to cut my textures down to half res for a video I was making to keep my FPS up )\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso notice the landing ramp you can walk up (folds back into a neat cube) and also the hatch has now been moved to the lowest point on the cockpit, making it possible to enter the hatch from a standing point without ladders.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.devogeninteractive.com/picup/image.php?id=25E2_51EF6E27\u0026amp;jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022image.php?id=25E2_51EF6E27\u0026amp;jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see, the new cockpit is much larger, 3 seats but room for about 10 kerbals or so. The texture in the cockpit was a bit rushed, Im more concerned with getting the IVA right and all the dials and controls, I am yet to release am IVA that actually works, so thats the next on my list of parts to accomplish. I\u0027m just trying to cover modding all the parts in the game as time goes on, I\u0027ve covered most of them now, really just need to pull my thumb out put some effort in.
