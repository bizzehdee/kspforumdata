I.e. put in a lead shield and the mod treats the distance as 100m instead of 20.  Not as computationally expensive as raycasting, but allows for stacking bonuses from multiple shields.  I suppose there would need to be a check that the shield is between the reactor and the crew.  I think if you keep the abstraction and balance you\u0027ve had so far in this mod that it\u0027ll give the feeling of a nod to realism while still feeling \u0022Kerbal\u0022."},{"CreatedByName":"ModZero","CreatedById":89470,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-27T17:57:36Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 3 hours ago, RoverDude said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Ah, I was not aware Nertea was working on something for radiation\n\u003E \n\nAh, I kinda hoped that you two actually worked together on this, it wouldn\u0027t be the first time :-) Having to choose between these would break my fragile heart :-/\n\nAlso, he has a [thread about it](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/132789-wip-radioactivity-line-of-sight-radiation-simulation/)."},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-27T18:29:50Z","Content":"Note that Nertea is intensely busy IRL, and may not have the time and/or endurance to actually continue working that proof of concept.

If I remember right it was talked about back in late 2012-ish?\n\nEve was supposed to be radioactive on its surface and highly radioactive on its oceans, making EVA and living in un-shielded habs possible only for an hour or so. Jool was to have a dangerous radiation belt that would have encompassed Laythe. EVA or venturing into the belt in any manned craft without heavy shielding would spell death in a few minutes and the sun would have a near impenetrable field around it.\n\nAlso if I remember right, there was supposed to be basic solar weather and safe magnetospheres around certain planets. Kerbin would have had one that would have given full protection around Kerbin and the Mun. Moho would have had a very minor one (analog to Mercury\u0027s weak magnetosphere) that would only offer trace protection. No idea on the solar weather mechanics though. I guess there would be some sort of background radiation in relation to how close you were to the sun.\n\nAs for shielding, a nice end-tech module would be an artificial magnetosphere coming in a 1.25, 2.5, and 3.75 size for ships and bases. It would give full protecting but require a lot of electricity to run and only protect what is inside the bubble, in a way similar to the bubble protection field the Alcubierre Drive add-on uses."},{"CreatedByName":"KerbalFanatic1","CreatedById":163408,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-01T18:04:48Z","Content":"i was wondering if USI Life Support works with KIS?"}]}
