So far I\u0027ve found 6 different maps for Io and Europa, but they are not only extremely blurry, but very low resolution. My guess is that we may not be able to use much of this as is, but maybe with some processing and a little artistic license, we\u0027ll get something that looks good enough to view from orbit. As for licensing, most everything I\u0027ve see is either free for public, non-commercial use, free for use with some attribution, or up to the original owner of the image to decide. I don\u0027t think RSS is in any way commercial, so I think we\u0027re fine for the most part, and I don\u0027t even think permissions would be hard to come by from image owners, though I\u0027m not really sure just how much effort I want to put into tracking down a lot of people to ask if we can use their image... If it becomes too much, we may just use their work as a guide to create something non-photoreal, but at least real looking.

I\u0027ve been trying to use an inverted copy of the image selectively blended to \u0022white out\u0022 the black shadows and then texturize and darken the resulting white marks to approximate a match with the light side of each crater. The result seems like it works somewhat, but I\u0027ve noticed a few issues which I need to fix:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: This one I don\u0027t get at all, but the scaled space color map has it\u0027s lighting offset by 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 to the East, so that the sun is actually shining on the day / night transition and the opposite day / night transition is squarely in the center of the dark side of the sphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: The actual light recorded on the sun facing side of the craters is quite bright near the poles, so much so that it make the resulting globe look odd. I\u0027m thinking I may not only need to push up the shadows, but tone down the whites a little to get a more even gray across the whole surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3: For some reason, when I\u0027m trying to blend the two images together, I often end up with some weird overhangs near the edge of the map, leading to a clear wrap line on the finished globe. I\u0027m really not sure what\u0027s going on here because I\u0027m definitely working with two identically sized images, but one or the other keeps drifting off the edge somehow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/k16IK#0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

If you pay close attention to direction specific features like the horseshoe shaped crater that shown in both versions in my album that is shaped like a \u0027U\u0027 pointing at about 030\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, I\u0027m betting yours is flipped so that same feature would be pointing at about 330\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 instead. The 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 shift is one I had to figure out for Mars, but seems to hold true across all of the planets so far, and is specifically implemented so the correct latitude and longitude coordinates work within the game. I never tried your config, but my guess is that if you try to place yourself at a known landmark like the Apollo 15 landing site, you can\u0027t go there just by landing at the correct coordinates. This is exactly what I was dealing with when I had \u0022lost\u0022 the Valles Marineris when working on Mars. It was there, but because of the map reversal and the 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 shift, it was not anywhere near where I thought it might be. So, back on the topic of what I did to your map, all I did was flip it horizontally and then move the left 25% and shift it to the right. The result is that, aside from features pointing the other way, it will look almost identical to your original, but have correct coordinates associated with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the spherical thing, I do see the normal map\u0027s effects, but I\u0027m not seeing that it looks significantly out of shape. I\u0027m guessing that the overly bright poles are the result of multiple layers of slices of the planet getting lit by the sun at the same time, resulting in a spike in luminosity at those points. That being said, I\u0027m still working with 5.5 as my dev build, so I haven\u0027t gotten to the new v6 just yet. Now that most of the available mods have been upgraded to 23.5 and the new RPL is out, I might just update both my dev build and my play build to the newer version. What has me concerned right now is the 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 shift in sun lighting for the scaled space map, though maybe that will be something that\u0027s solved with the newer version.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: With your permission, I\u0027ll upload the corrected color and normal maps which you can use with the height map I shared a page or two ago, and hopefully that will correct your issues with the wrong side facing the wrong way.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpacedInvader","CreatedById":106018,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-21T22:21:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter a lot of thought, I think its better to use the Kaguya color map. This is partly because it\u0027s the only full coverage color image I\u0027ve been able to find and so better represents the actual lunar coloration, but also partly because I don\u0027t think I have the photoshop-fu to properly get rid of the shadowing in all of the craters without making the thing look fairly disgusting. Does anyone disagree?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@AndreyATGB: I\u0027m still waiting for your permission to use these, but I\u0027m also starting to question if your statement that you didn\u0027t modify them means that you don\u0027t really need to give me permission?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I think I\u0027ll be done with the improved topography and color / normal maps for the inner planets (excluding Earth) by the end of this week. I already have a good color map for Mars and only need to create a normal map, I have elevation and a color map for Venus, though the latter is going to need some touch up, and I\u0027m in the process of acquiring the Messenger mission data for Mercury, which should have both elevation and color data for me to work with. As NathanKell has requested, I\u0027ll be offering both a high resolution option (8192x4096 for height and color with normal probably being fine at 2048x1024) and a lower resolution option (4096x2048 height map, 2048x1024 color, and 1024x512 normal). A disclaimer though, as I am not going to tweak any of the PQS settings beyond what is necessary to get them into the game and establish the correct elevation ranges. This is because I will be waiting to work on the higher level detail until Nathan can get the revamped loader in place for enhanced tweakability. That being said, these files will definitely offer much better terrain than what is currently available. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA note on the Moon as well. I do plan on disabling the voronoi craters for the Moon when the new loader is finished, at least if and until I can find a way to drastically shrink the size of the output craters. This is because the output craters are quite large and do not exist in reality. The high resolution height map, at least in the 8192x4096 size has enough detail to generate craters of the size that the mod outputs, so they are both redundant and unrealistic.

Thinking the new map wasn\u0027t being implemented at all, I commented out the color map line of the config to see how well the surface variations lined up with the stock surface and the end result was that the surface did match up with stock, but was very much smoothed out. I then went back and commented out the normal map lines and the result was a stock looking scaled space moon with much stronger features. I then went back to using custom normal and color and could easily find features like the canyons of the Mun imprinted in the Moon.

I know this for a fact because I ran into a mountain while on a 500km orbit, but based on the scaled space mesh, I was high above the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the normal map process, I must be doing something wrong while creating it, because I\u0027ve been following your instructions in the wiki as best as I could. I created the normal map, then selected the red, inverted it, created an alpha channel and copied the red to it, then selected the green, inverted it and copied that to red and also blue and then saved it. My maps still come out purplish...

You need to decompose the image, then invert the red and green channels and then reassign them properly when recomposing it. This only leaves the scaled space mesh issue to deal with. Also you need to invert the X or Y (can\u0027t remember which already, but one needs it) to ensure that the depth axis is correctly going into the surface rather than out of it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-23T04:56:35Z\u0022 title=\u002204/23/2014 04:56  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 23, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by SpacedInvader\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpacedInvader","CreatedById":106018,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-23T07:06:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk, so I\u0027ve made a little progress in dealing with the scaled space mesh issue. Using the ScaledSpace updater built into the planet editor rebuilds the mesh to match the PQS output. There are some problems with this, however, which I haven\u0027t been able to get around. The first is that this change is only temporary, resetting on the next load of the game. The second is that this also defaults the game back to the stock color map, though not the stock normal map. Though I don\u0027t think this specific approach is going to work for us, it does provide us with a proper solution to work towards. Somehow we need to initiate a permanent, or at least an on-load, update to the scaled space mesh through the RSS config. I thought there seemed to be a way to do it based on my reading of the source, but I may be totally wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jebandhisfriends","CreatedById":107822,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-23T14:49:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ehey people \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei may did something wrong but i havent got any parts and when i added real fuels i couldnt start the game anymore its stuck on squad utility trust block somthing like that but what did i wrong i did get a warning of the aaa toolbar but i couldnt find it.. if somebody knows what to do pleas help haha \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethanx\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"manuelasa1999","CreatedById":10304,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-23T17:54:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat is this bug: http:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4qGqGpf.png\u0022 alt=\u00224qGqGpf.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf i desinstall RSS it works OK but when i have it installed and go to the Space Center i can only see this black screen, I tried to download RSS again and install it but it doesnt work...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe it\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s caused by a incompabilty between the mods this is my game folder with the mods: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/kPLoNTT.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022kPLoNTT.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso i launched the game again and this happens:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/M4RJboj.png\u0022 alt=\u0022M4RJboj.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-23T18:04:02Z\u0022 title=\u002204/23/2014 06:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 23, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by manuelasa1999\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
