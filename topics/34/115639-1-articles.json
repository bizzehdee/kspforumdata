What it seeks to do is add in nuclear weapons (just generic ones for now). The backstory behind this mod is quite simple. BahamutoD refused to make nukes in his BD Armory mod, so I took matters into my own hands and made them myself.\n\nParts in this mod\n\nA nuclear warhead that just gets plopped on a missile.\n\nAn inline nuclear warhead that looks like an Oscar-B. You can put multiple of these together with some regular warheads to make a custom bomb.\n\nA nuclear tipped cruise missile that is launched from the surface.\n\nA nuclear tipped cruise missile that is launched from a plane.\n\nThere are also free-fall bombs with and without airbrakes, and a guided bomb!\n\n\u003E \n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
