I\u0027ll have a look at those build rate modifier numbers soon, I want an equation that gives incremental bonuses at first which quickly slow down then eventually after maybe 100 builds get so small as to be virtually non existent, then I\u0027ll rebalance build points so that when that point is reached you\u0027re building things quickly but not insanely so, not without massive upgrading to the VAB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been meaning to add some formulae for controlling simulation costs.

It makes sense that it would be part of the presets, so I\u0027ll get it done for next version (especially because I\u0027d rather not change the Presets specifications after release by too much). I\u0027m not positive that I\u0027ll be able to come up with a simple way to determine if you\u0027re rerunning the test, but I\u0027ll try because I like that idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe formula as-is for effective cost already has a rapid change in the beginning and it quickly dies down (and becomes pretty nonexistent at high values).
