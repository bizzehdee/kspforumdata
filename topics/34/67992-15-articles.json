We\u0027ve both been pretty busy with school. I do have good news though - with the .25 update seemingly coming soon we will be updating again as soon as we can after release. This will mean some interesting new updates to the HCV package, including:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- New 3.75m Crew Can, holding 8 Kerbals and featuring a custom IVA. This also shares the Science Lab texture, meaning minimal additional RAM overhead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- (Hopefully) updated Science Bay to use whatever new animation module the stockified SP\u002B parts use\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Actual FAR support for the Science bay cargo doors. Sorry about that one...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Proper EL support! Extraplanetary Launchpads should no longer be incompatible with the HCV, and we plan to add Workshop support to the Science Bay\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- New textures! Every single texture has been updated, many being completely overhauled. The parts look much better now, and have let us remove some of the bump maps, which reduces RAM load significantly. Additionally, the textures are now PNG based, further reducing memory use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Maybe some other stuff too. The engine we teased oh-so-long-ago is looking great, but it needs a lot of balancing and testing, and extra parts for it (fuel tank, fairing, etc.) need to be made, textured, implemented in game, and balanced. Hopefully we\u0027ll have time for that, but it depends on when .25 launches and how much we can get done before then.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo that\u0027s about it for our next update - it\u0027s certainly a big one. Let us know if there\u0027s anything small you want to suggest for the update (nothing like extra parts, more IVAs, or anything like that, please!), or anything in the future. I am already planning the next texture overhaul, thanks to advice from hoojiwana (the RLA Stockalike guy) and Taverius (one of the B9 guys).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this was a decent dev log/plan. Sorry for the lack of new images - I\u0027m away from my main computer at the moment and can\u0027t grab any new screenshots.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Eleven","CreatedById":60502,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-02T15:35:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022bsquiklehausen\u0022 data-cite=\u0022bsquiklehausen\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo that\u0027s about it for our next update - it\u0027s certainly a big one.
