The way it works is that a procedural part (pp) is stored/retrieved as 1000 times their cost. A part costing 123.456 funds will be stored as 123456 of that part. Additionally, due to their convenience, pp only have 1/10 of the InventoryEffect applied to them (so, the default of 100 which normally results in a reduction to 10% of new, instead results in a reduction to about 33% of new). Only the dry cost of the part should matter, and a procedural part is detected as procedural by the modules on the part (specifically, at least one module with the word \u0022procedural\u0022 in its name). Several popular procedural parts mods only use \u0022proc\u0022 in their module name, which I can\u0027t use as the requirement because of words like \u0022processor\u0022, so I need to probably add special cases for them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SaintWacko","CreatedById":113172,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-30T16:02:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m just starting to use KCT, and I had an interesting idea for calculating simulation cost.

For example, at first, before you\u0027ve visited a planet, all you could do is simulate the size of the planet and its gravity. In the simulation, the planet would have no atmosphere, so it would really only allow you to simulate getting a craft into orbit. As you collected more data, the atmosphere would become available in the simulation, although you could make the simulation cheaper by not having the atmosphere present. Once you began entering the atmosphere and gaining science there, the atmospheric makeup (for air-breathing engines and resource collection mods) would become available. Once you collected science on the surface, surface resource collection would begin to be available in the simulation.

The roll out time should include the integration of these stages.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) The first design of a stage is 10x more time consuming than the next copies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Usually the construction queue will build a lot of the same thing in an assembly line 7 (6) Mercury missions, but I believe 14 were built.

It\u0027s less dramatic than 10x (The 4th identical build will take half the time), but the build times are also less than real life by default.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) You can build a bunch of identical copies of something and have them all queued up if you want. You pay for them when you queue them, but you can scrap them at any time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) This is kind of like 4 and 1 combined. Queue up a bunch of boosters and use the edit function to add a payload. Or scrap the booster into parts, then build a new vessel that is the payload\u002Bbooster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t forget that having multiple build rates means you can build two things at once (or three, or more) and that additional rates are cheaper than buying faster primary rates.
