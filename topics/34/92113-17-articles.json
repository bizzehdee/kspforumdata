I\u0027m running the Interstellar pack V2 and everything seems to be working as intended, except Kerbin\u0027s clouds are outrageously dense. On the main menu, Kerbin is just a white sphere with an odd red discoloration towards the upper pole. In game when below the clouds it looks okay, although still too cloudy for my tastes. But if you fly above the clouds, the pure white comes back and you can\u0027t see anything below the clouds until you go back down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only other mod I have installed so far is active texture management, which I was going to hold off on until I was sure this was working properly but the game wouldn\u0027t even load without it. It would run out of memory and I could never even get to the space center. Even with the active texture management, as soon as the game loads I\u0027m sitting at 3.2GB RAM usage.
