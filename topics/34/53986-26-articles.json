When I correlate values with the default tanks it gives me around 10.4% ratio dry mass to total mass. Now I understand why I couldn\u0027t get into orbit despite building more powerful rockets. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-23T12:06:56Z\u0022 title=\u002201/23/2014 12:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 23, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Devinci\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-23T11:58:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022palker\u0022 data-cite=\u0022palker\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ETo my great frustration i found out that you have to connect Stratus V roundified monopropellant tanks to the fuselage with fuel lines otherwise your RCS will not work.\u003Cp\u003E So i would like to ask is this a bug or a feature?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe default RCS propellant is hydrazine, which follows a normal flow logic.
