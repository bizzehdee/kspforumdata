You can compare the old with the new and see if you can improve it any. In particular, the old one was already fairly harsh (no transparency fade on the border), so when I upscaled it, it simply reinforced the pixellation and isn\u0027t very pleasing. Compare it with StaticMask.png, which is much easier on the eyes.

I\u0027ve resized them with GIMP, but the pfdStatic.png came out fairly harsh and pixellated (and StaticMask came out pretty!), even though I used cubic interpolation on both. If somebody has the original resources used to make those, or isn\u0027t a n00b with GIMP, they may have better results. Or I can suck it up and soften it pixel-by-pixel... *shudder*.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027ve got the RAM and CPU horsepower, a \u0027brute force\u0027 method I\u0027ve used with reasonable success for upscaling an image is to first enlarge it REALLY big. EG:2560x2560 Then you can do some easy, broad blurring and/or painting strokes using a very large brush around the details. Then rescale it back down to the size you need letting the editor do the final smoothing of the image that way. It looks horrendous while you are working on the big image but the end results can be surprisingly good for MUCH less work than pixel by pixel editing. MANY sins are smoothed over and made invisible in that last shrink step. And once the bulk work is done, you can always go back in and pixel edit those last few pesky drips and blobs. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JaredTheDragon","CreatedById":137445,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T08:35:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022danfarnsy\u0022 data-cite=\u0022danfarnsy\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJaredTheDragon,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe relevant texture is in that dropbox link in /GameData/B9_Aerospace/Props/B9_MFD/images/pfdStatic.png .\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI messaged you two updated .pngs, 512 and 1024 for forward-compatibility.
