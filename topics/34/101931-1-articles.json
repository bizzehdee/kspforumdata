Therefore I applied them on the parts that are (at least can be) covered up by other parts. Like the small or big berthing adapters or the tapered adapter/end plate that is in the pack. This way you can have four different styles: plain gold foil that looks a bit like there is something to be added later, the big berthing node or the tapered, mli-covered adapter plate, with or without the small berthing adapter."},{"CreatedByName":"larkvi","CreatedById":108735,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T16:35:09Z","Content":"I love these textures, and wonder if you would consider making them work with the [Stockalike Station Parts Expansion](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/91814-1-02-Stockalike-Station-Parts-Expansion-%2804-05-2015-CTT-and-minor-fixes%29) mod?"},{"CreatedByName":"Drew Kerman","CreatedById":103177,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-22T18:51:55Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 3/14/2015 at 0:26 PM, Gaiiden said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E you must go forth and TEXTURE ALL THE THINGS\n\u003E \n\nI reiterate this statement.\n\nAlso [@InsaneDruid](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/137849-insanedruid/) since I see you\u0027re still around could you provide an alternate download link?"},{"CreatedByName":"InsaneDruid","CreatedById":137849,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-22T21:57:19Z","Content":"I could make an dropbox link and put it in the starting post.\n\nThough this skin was included into the fustek station mod some time ago, but now the part\u0027s UV get remapped a lot.
