Well having a camera on your telescope might be a bit easier... but you still have to look for them.. I guess in that way the TST telescopes might be a bit easier to find the unknown bodies. TST Space Telescopes currently function the same way as the ResearchBodies Telescope... (right click and scan), or by scanning with the camera until you find something and snapping off a picture to see if you discovered something. \n\nAs for TST contracts, the answer is No. The only difference for TST with ResearchBodies is it will NOT offer its usual contracts for a body until that body is discovered...  \n\nOnce a body is found the normal TST contracts kick in to take pictures of that body.  \n\nAlso taking pictures of discovered bodies adds ResearchBodies research to said bodies.  \n\nI like the idea though of having Contracts to discover the bodies... I think though contracts to discover the unknown bodies should be part of this mod, not TST."},{"CreatedByName":"Mitchz95","CreatedById":82292,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-29T21:59:54Z","Content":"This looks amazing.

I think though contracts to discover the unknown bodies should be part of this mod, not TST.\n\u003E \n\nI think this feature would make discovery feel more genuine rather than sort of gamey mechanic is is now. You could imagine realistic scientific reasons that might predict the discovery of a planet, and use the contract to test that prediction. Basically it would be great to have an authentic reason as to WHY we should point this telescope in this direction. I think that would really bring this entire idea together. \n\nFor example, spending science at the tracking station starts a random timer (3-30 days for example). This triggers a message that explains that new analysis of the inner planets orbits suggest there is body of mass xxxx somewhere between yyy and yyy distance from kerbol. This triggers a contract that predicts this body will transit Kerbol and in order to discover it, you must have a telescope pointing at Kerbol at THIS precise time to see it and collect data. \n\nAnother example, later in the game / tech tree: spend science at tracking station starts a longer timer (2-10 weeks). Message triggers saying a recent observation of Jool spotted an anomaly which may be a moon that passed in front of the planet. New contract appears to put a telescope in orbit around Kerbol at xxx altitude with an infrared sensor package and look at Jool for 1 week to try and catch this suspected body.\n\nOther missions may require orbiting the Mun so as to block any light from the sun and interference from Kerbol. They don\u0027t have to be 100% scientific, but at least offer some believable explanation as to why we might need to put this telescope here, rather than just random button clicking. \n\n-By the way I\u0027m so glad you are working on this because this was one of the first things I thought about when career mode came out."},{"CreatedByName":"JPLRepo","CreatedById":114736,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-20T10:18:47Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 29/1/2016 at 8:59 AM, Mitchz95 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E This looks amazing.
