That will help pin down where the bug is, if there is one. The thermal helper has a few known bugs, this could be related to one of them. The \u0022known bug\u0022 that comes to mind is the one where putting even a single Sethlans/Akula series reactor on your ship will make the thermal helper\u0027s numbers effectively useless if you have upgraded radiators unlocked (It calculates as if you hadn\u0027t unlocked the upgraded radiators). Not exactly a big deal, but it\u0027s annoying.

Then go into your saves/(insert save name) and look for a \u0022tree.cfg\u0022 file. Delete that too, it\u0027s from Treeloader as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter that, you\u0027re going to want to install TechManager. It\u0027s basically a fixed version of TreeLoader that can do a bunch more as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIMO, it\u0027s basically a straight upgrade to TreeLoader, and it can even read the same tech tree files that come with KSP Interstellar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust make sure you delete TreeLoader (and the saves/(savename/tree.cfg) BEFORE you install TechManager, because the two mods conflict with each other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth mods do the same thing anyways, so there\u0027s no real sense in having them both installed in any case.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBad things happen if you have them both installed at the same time.

No payload, no landing gear, not even a docking port of any kind. Pretty much just a probe core, reaction wheels, fuel, reactor (\u002B 1m antimatter tank if using AIM micro-fusion), magnetic nozzle, and enough upgraded radiators to never overheat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll ships had all upgrades available.

PERIOD.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMax TWR is around (but not much over) 1.0, and Thrust is just about pegged (625kN, max stated for all magnetic nozzles).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t take more than about 1500 units Liquid Fuel, or you might as well turn on infinite fuel for all the (lack of) difference it will make.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(seriously, you\u0027ll get tired before the engine runs out of fuel if you take much more than 1500)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis combo probably makes a great \u0022slow-boat\u0022 Hohmann transfer orbit interplanetary tug for before you get warp drives. Luckily in this case \u0022slow\u0022 just means a long time between burns, instead of the burns taking a long time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow for the Okay news: 2m magnetic nozzle \u002B 2m or 3m fusion, or 3m AIM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerformance was... acceptable, if a bit on the slow side. Minimal ships can get about 0.25 TWR, and I think thrust was around... 50 or so? Something like that, can\u0027t remember. Generally unimpressive, but still workable if you don\u0027t mind 10 minutes or more for a trans-munar-injection burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProbably good for \u0022set and forget\u0022 type transfers if you use MechJeb. Set a node for an interplanetary burn, tell MechJeb to execute the node, and grab a coffee or tea and a good book.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill HTO orbits, so still long times between burns, but now the burns take a while, too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, now the bad news. The 1.25m magnetic nozzles \u002B ANY fusion or AIM reactor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo want to use these, you either have to have the paitience of a saint, or MechJeb.

The 3.75m and 2.5m versions are workable options for orbital tugs, and the 3.75m one can even be coaxed into a lander engine if you really want to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 1.25m one, however. What\u0027s the point of that?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt least you don\u0027t really need to worry about running out of Liquid Fuel... ever, basically.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Einarr","CreatedById":4809,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-25T07:50:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo how does the 1.25m Magnetic Nozzle compare to the other electric engines of the same size and powered by a 1.25m basic fusion reactor?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
