Please read below for more information regarding how patch resets work now.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAdded a configuration file that fully encompasses every setting that it possibly could for each contract type. This lets users balance each contract\u0027s functionality and rewards in a highly customizable fashion. The inputs are sanitized and if you choose an input that is invalid, it will choose a default value for you, so for the most part it is unbreakable. Do note however, that this level of control can allow you to create some weird behavior if you choose to do so.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EDue to the changes required for configuration, there was a full balance pass. You will notice that rewards in general have changed significantly, generally in the upwards direction. I did get second opinions on the balance pass, but as always, your opinion may vary. If this is the case, I encourage you to play with the balance by using the configuration file and let me know if you find something better on the official thread. If people find a more agreeable setting, I will incorporate it as default in future versions.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAdded In Situ Resource Utilization contracts (resource harvesting). Because these contracts require other mods, these contracts are disabled by default. To enable them, open the configuration, go to the \u0022ISRU\u0022 section, and change \u0022MaximumExistent\u0022 to something other than 0. I recommend 2. This section also allows you to customize what type of resource you want to harvest, and what technology unlocks cause the contract to start showing up. By default this is set up to utilize the Karbonite mod, but you can set it up to use any resource mod you want (Kethane, Extraplanetary Launchpads, etc). You can even set it up here to be able to use multiple resource types, if you change \u0022Karbonite\u0022 to \u0022Karbonite,Kethane,Metal,Water\u0022 etc. You can also forbid certain planets or celestial bodies from being the target of this contract.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EISRU contracts will ask you to extract a certain amount of material from a certain location. Sometimes the contract ends there, but frequently you will also be asked to transport that material to a nearby location. Most of the time this will be planet to moon, or moon to planet. Delivery raises the rewards greatly.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EChanged how the patch reset works. It now only targets my contracts, rather than all contracts. Stock contracts and contracts added by other mods are no longer affected. It is also not not automatic, but rather, manually set by me in the configuration file if I feel like one is necessary. This gives the user a chance to opt out of the patch reset by changing PatchReset to False immediately after patching. This can cause undefined behavior, so I do not recommend it, but it is available if you wish to use it.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAdded low altitude contracts. These have a chance to spawn which is higher at lower prestige ratings, unless they are for a gas giant, in which case the chance is higher at higher prestige ratings. Low altitude contracts on gas giants provide a clear warning that it is likely a suicide contract.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAdded configuration option that allows users to add (or remove) parts from the satellite contract. If you are enabling ISRU contracts, adding resource scanners here might help you in future endeavours.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAdded a chance for aerial and rover contracts on Kerbin to spawn close to the space center. This is greater at lower prestige ratings.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAdded settings for each contract type that allow the user to disable those types if they want.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAdded settings for the names of each orbit type, for user preference.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EDisplay when an orbital parameter is being ignored or not, to prevent user confusion.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ETechnology check now properly handles underscores.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAdded some new names to waypoint sites that spawn on Kerbin, and corrected a few site name typos.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EIn an effort to improve compatibility with Real Solar System, removed all direct references to Kerbin, the Sun, and Jool.
