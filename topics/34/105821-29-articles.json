Not sure exactly what you are looking for, but if you are talking about external camera views (using actual camera parts you place on the craft), I believe RPM doesnt really have that function by itself.. I believe it uses the Hullcam mod to provide the basic functionality, which RPM then takes the \u0022feed\u0022 from, and displays it in an RPM monitor in IVA...  \n\nSo basically, what it sounds like what you want, is the Hullcam mod itself, or maybe the Docking Camera KURS Style mod..."},{"CreatedByName":"devikwolf","CreatedById":142118,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-25T18:19:34Z","Content":"Ahh, I have the camera mods and I can view the camera feeds from IVA.
