Anything that affects that stream will hurt your FPS because the physics need to run every frame. This is usually the cause of most KSP slowdowns. It doesn\u0027t matter if you have a crazy good graphics card or not, if the physics core can\u0027t keep up, your FPS drops. You can lower the max physics delta in your settings to keep your FPS up at the expense of time (i.e. time slows down but FPS remains high). I think default is .10, but to keep it above 20 FPS you\u0027ll need like .05 or lower, and 30 FPS is around .03. Just be prepared for s-l-o-w gameplay with high part counts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERunning lots of mods will affect speed as well, because RAM is at a premium for this game.

Is it the main KSP loop constantly calling it to check for a texture change? If so could there be flags to set in the cfg file that would disable checks for textures not being changed? It\u0027s kind of a waste to build texture list and scan through them all the time if that texture is never changed. Could it be done by removing all entries from the Texture List.txt file?
