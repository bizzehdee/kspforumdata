I know that the 64 bit version is new so I\u0027m not going to mention the issues I\u0027m having with it right now. I\u0027ll just wait for more stable releases, but I\u0027ve been tampering with KAS trying to get it to work, even with the in official patches thy have been posted here. I\u0027ve uninstalled, reinstalled the whole sha bang trying to get KAS to work. It just isn\u0027t worth it to play it without it. My temporary workaround is the fact that if attach parts to the outside of a rocket , or if I\u0027m using b9, inside a cargo bay, I can get away without containers but it\u0027s messy. At this point, i think I\u0027ll have to wait till the official release of the next version but I thought posting this was worth a shot. What do you guys think?
