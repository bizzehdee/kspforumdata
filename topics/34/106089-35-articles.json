Looks like when I fixed the patch that determines the fuel capacity (it was filling some tanks 2x much) I neglected to adjust the unit mass of the tank patch, leading to probably halved mass ratios for the LH2Ox and LH2 tanks. I\u0027ll fix that early next week when I have some time.\n\nThat example ship should get ~4220 m/s (vs 3700) with a mass of ~25.4t (vs 27.5). Also important to remember that the 2.5m cryo engine weighs ~ 1.75x the poodle\u0027s mass, so increasing the payload mass or using a smaller engine will have better results. Take the 1.25m cryo engine instead with that low payload mass, it\u0027ll add ~800 m/s and cut another 2t off the stage mass.\n\nFor the best benefits of cryo, use it for larger payloads that need really high energies.
