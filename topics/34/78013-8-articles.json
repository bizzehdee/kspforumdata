Having taken a look at NEAR.cfg it seems you only adjust stock parts and the adjustment is non-trivial. Then again the NEARPartClassification seems to suggest that there is already at least some special treatment for anything with a \u0027ModuleControlSurface\u0027. So, are there any formulas or hints as to how to convert values intended for the stock model? I assume ctrlSurfFrac is equivalent to ctrlSurfaceArea and maxdelect to ctrlSurfaceRange, can any reasonably general formula even be given for the rest?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-22T02:06:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENEAR needs the same level of cfg-making FAR does: all wings and control surfaces need the appropriate module with the appropriately-calculated stats added.
