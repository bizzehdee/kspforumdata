When there\u0027s not enough fuel to complete the required burn in the stage, it seems sometime Mechjeb just won\u0027t fire the motor, but if I manually drop the stage, the next stage comes to life and fires. so it seems that if there\u0027s not enough in the current stage (unless the motor is already firing, then it will drop the stage and continue) that Mechjeb considers it an empty stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone else see this issue?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"randyre","CreatedById":68240,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-16T16:37:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow do you get Mechjeb to use RCS without leaving it on all the time?

Jet flameout can cause spins and so on, especially on craft with more than 1 engine (i.e. all of them), so stopping all the engines before air intake reaches 0 is important.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am currently using 2 ion engines to do a 14 MINUTE burn. It takes a long time, but it\u0027s very efficient and hey, space is big. However, my craft doesn\u0027t have enough solar panels or generators to keep the rate of electricity constant, and so before the 14 minutes is up (i.e within 30 seconds) the electricity runs out. This results in 1 of the 2 engines shutting down, and the craft spinning. Also, just like a jet engine wasting liquid fuel, the ion engine wastes Xenon if \u0027flames out\u0027, bleeding it until the power builds up enough for it to switch on or off. The result is that it is twice as efficient (probably more, since the spinning from running lopsided on 1 engine is bad) for me to watch the burn, using an action group to turn off both engines before the electricity runs out, let it build up again, and start them up again, until it gets low again... and repeat... for 28 minutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf Mechjeb could handle electricity \u0027flame out\u0027 just as it handles jet burnout, i could spend those 28 minutes doing something \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003Eproductive\u003C/span\u003E fun.

Full throttle is more efficient, since both engines will be firing their full 0.5kN and not be dead weight. If you run out of power in 30 seconds at full it would probably only take one more extendable solar panel to get 100% throttle full time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternatively, dropping down to one ion engine.
