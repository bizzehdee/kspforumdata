No more wondering if Frolie Kerman is supposed to be an engineer or a scientist.\n\n- Pitch and roll can now be controlled with the keyboard. No more awkward mouse clicking and dragging... you can now do backflips and cartwheels on the Mun! By default the controls are mapped as follows:\n\nPitch Down - Alpha2\n\nPitch Up - X\n\nRoll Left - Z\n\nRoll Right - C\n\nI have found these work well in conjunction with the standard WASDQE controls (while letting you keep your right hand on the mouse for camera control). If you wish to remap them you can use the \u0022Settings\u0022 window, accessible from the stock application launcher or Blizzy78\u0027s toolbar.\n\n- the EVA \u0022rotate on camera move\u0022 setting can now be toggled any time by hitting the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E toggle (default T). Enabling it can make some EVA navigation a bit easier, but disabling it gives you more control.\n\n- jetpack power can now be modified any time through a slider in the EVA right-click action menu. Fuel usage is scaled accordingly.\n\n- the default jetpack power level can be set via the \u0022Settings\u0022 window.\n\n- precision controls can now be toggled using the same key as in normal flight mode (default is CapsLock). This automatically sets your jetpack power to 10% for finer control.\n\n- finally, some Nav Ball customizations for EVA mode. The throttle gauge will display your current jetpack power level between 0 and 100%. The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E indicator will light to show your if jetpack is enabled. The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E indicator will light to show if \u0022rotate on move\u0022 is enabled (only if the jetpack is on though).\n\n**Download Links**\n\nCurse: [http://curse.com/project/233788](http://curse.com/project/233788)\n\n\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100067](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100067-The-Comprehensive-Kerbal-Archive-Network-%28CKAN%29-Package-Manager)\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/seanmcdougall/EVAEnhancements/releases](https://github.com/seanmcdougall/EVAEnhancements/releases)\n\n**Source**\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/seanmcdougall/EVAEnhancements](https://github.com/seanmcdougall/EVAEnhancements)\n\nLicense: MIT\n\n**Credits**\n\n- TriggerAu for the [KSPPluginFramework](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/66503-KSP-Plugin-Framework).
