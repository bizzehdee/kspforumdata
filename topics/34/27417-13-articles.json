I can make it just vanish when in simulation, so it shouldn\u0027t be obtrusive.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Greys","CreatedById":57109,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-04T12:42:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWould that impact the part count or would they actually be removed when you go to the flightspace?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TouhouTorpedo","CreatedById":30603,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-04T16:57:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Greys\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Greys\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWould that impact the part count or would they actually be removed when you go to the flightspace?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey would still exist as a part unless I changed the Modular Wheels main module to allow public and persistant suspension distance (then just have the part explode or something so it no longer exists) Which I guess I could do as well, anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the brightside I figure I can turn off physics significance, the collider, the mesh renderer, and give near infinite break forces, and I think that\u0027ll probably make its effect compared to a normal part ingame near enough negligible (since there wont be any physics or rendering to do)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternatively I could just make 1 single part that changes the suspension height on every single wheel, and not neccesarily bother hiding it.

MK3 Embedded Fuselages adds MK3 type fuselages with dents in them. \u0022but couldn\u0027t I do that with a hammer?\u0022 Create finely curved 1.25m wide fuselage length dents with adapters to normal fuselages?! I don\u0027t think so! Use these to fit rockets, smaller planes, anything on top of another MK3 based aircraft. In the future, I may add other fuselage types, or embedding in different places. (say under, sides, something like that) For now the finely crafted dent sits on top. There are three parts in the mod- MK3 overhead embedded fuselage, MK3 to MK3 embedded fuselage adapter, and a MK2 to MK3 embedded fuselage adapter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDownload here!
