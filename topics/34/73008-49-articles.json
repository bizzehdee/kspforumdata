For me, ever since I first got that part, I haven\u0027t been able to \u0027control from here\u0027 using the actual docking port itself. No, the \u0027cfh\u0027 node on MY part has always been the rear attachment node, upside down of all things! Meaning, I build a plane with a cockpit (duh) and the SP\u002B inline docking port; launch the craft, and naturally the navball shows a heading of 90 degrees, blue side up, right? Okay, I choose the inline docking port and select \u0027control from here\u0027: you\u0027d expect the navball to now show all blue, with the red \u0027North\u0027 marker at 90 degrees to the left, correct? Nope! I get a heading of 270 degrees, level with the horizon, but blue side DOWN. And no, it makes no difference if the port is closed or open. \u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s frustrating to not be able to use a part that others obviously have no problem with. I suppose it\u0027s another of my MANY mods that\u0027s interfering somehow, but I\u0027ve tried removing just about every mod that could possibly be the culprit, with no success. I\u0027ve also mentioned this problem here before, and at best I\u0027ve gotten what amounts to \u0022meh...\u0022 for a response, so I\u0027ve basically given up on ever being able to use that part as intended.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd before anyone asks, no, nothing appears in the output logs.
