And to the mob of very useful people in the KSP G\u002B Community. And to Winchell Chung in particular for providing the impetus to mod the hell out of Kerbal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Nexus booster is a massive squat booster rocket designed by Convair (General Dynamics) to get very large payloads into orbit and beyond. This mod is a replica at half scale (Kerbals are small, and their planet is small) of the base Nexus design.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was designed to get a million pounds (~450 tonnes) into orbit, and then return and be mostly re-usable. This version is designed for 1/8th of the weights/thrust of the original, to match the half scale.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(from up-ship.com, where all the good info is)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022nexus2.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://up-ship.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/nexus2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDescent was controlled (but not really slowed) by big flaps. So side pieces are available as either flaps or static walls. You\u0027ll need 12 all up. Most representations have four flaps but versions with 12 were also investigated. Any mix of 12 pieces of either flap or static wall for KSP. As yet, there\u0027s only the one style of flap, but I always intended to produce both types that are detailed in Convair documents, and have had Blender models for both since the start. I just got these developed more as they look better than the whole panel and because I needed a test case to learn how to build aerobrakes in KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the last minute (I find just before the 1km altitude mark is best) forward facing solid rockets are fired that slow the descent and break the water surface tension and churn the water. This may have been optimistic, but probably would have worked as the forward shell/heat shield was sacrificial. A combination of this plus arrays of chutes was investigated but for some reason Convair decided to go with just the retro rockets. It apparently weighed less. Due to being lazy with determining re-entry points, I tend to add chutes. The retro rocket solution ain\u0027t so good landing on rock either.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond stages so far are 35 foot and 60 foot hydrogen tanks with gas core rockets. So far there\u0027s 3 sizes, matching the 3 sizes used for the Convair 70 and 120 foot second stages. At 1/8th of 6 million pound thrust, and 4 and 3, it\u0027s easier to just refer to them by the original thrust grades. Gas Core Nuclear Thermal Rockets (GCRs) don\u0027t work well below a 1meter internal radius apparently (according to some studies around \u002798), so I\u0027m being optimistic and saying Kerbals can make them a bit smaller. The 3MpT engine has an outside radius of 1m, so it\u0027s not too far off reality. The GCRs, as represented in this mod, are moderately optimistic. As yet, humanity hasn\u0027t managed to solve some fairly critical issues around instability of the containment vortex that stops the gaseous fission reaction from shifting and impacting things and then exploding.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn KSP terms, be aware these rockets are both generators and alternators. As the whole engine is mounted on a gimbal, they can gimbal a lot. Their atmospheric curve is highly punishing for using them in an atmosphere. (Kerbals don\u0027t seem to care as much about the radioactive and toxic exhaust, but reduced Isp is bad). They require a new resource, \u0022BlutoniumTetraflouride\u0022, which is the reactor fuel. Some is expended. You\u0027ll get quite a bit of flight on the included fuel. They also explode easily. Not from their own operation, but just try not to bump them into things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy original GCRs had a long slow build up and shut off time. Much like the jet engines, throttle response was slow. This is a result of my expectations of the engineering issues around building toroidal vortexes strong enough to hold a gaseous fission reaction. But in testing attempts to land on the Mun, it became clear that I just couldn\u0027t work a successful landing with the exaggerated throttle response lag. So this edition has that \u0022feature\u0022 removed. It\u0027s likely to be re-applied later. But I\u0027ll be doing a bit of research into what that lag should be. In the end case, either the rockets won\u0027t have lag, or they will and you\u0027ll be best off with some fine control secondary landing rockets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVarious shots, with various stages of completeness\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd parts in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-05-24T03:01:11Z\u0022 title=\u002205/24/2020 03:01  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EMay 24, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by TiktaalikDreaming\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Ev2 release\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"_Augustus_","CreatedById":115084,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-19T13:09:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EInteresting.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SmashBrown","CreatedById":102799,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-19T14:36:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan we have more pics please? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TiktaalikDreaming","CreatedById":136290,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-20T11:33:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMore pics added to OP.

I took all the sizes and divided by 2 and masses (and thus volumes of liquid, aka fuel units) and divided by 8. The meshes in the first batch of parts were actually full size. In the configs for (say the main tank) you\u0027ll see rescale is set at 0.5. But I quickly found that it doesn\u0027t fit in the hanger. So I looked at how FASA worked things and discovered their stuff is basically half scale. And thus the half size, and eighth mass/thrust edition of the Nexus was born.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will have a look at RO conversion, but not until I\u0027ve finished a few other parts.

I need to juggle a few things to match past post-unity juggles. Some of the textures are largish, but none are huge. The killer I think would be that the 3D meshes are high poly meshes. If your PC is struggling, it may be more the detail in the 3D objects than the rez of the textures. You could test by loading the mod up and killing all the texture files. That\u0027d be mostly .dds files, but there\u0027s probably a few left-over png or tga etc files. It\u0027ll look like either a white plaster molded object or an unshaded bright purple horror.

I need to juggle a few things to match past post-unity juggles. Some of the textures are largish, but none are huge. The killer I think would be that the 3D meshes are high poly meshes. If your PC is struggling, it may be more the detail in the 3D objects than the rez of the textures. You could test by loading the mod up and killing all the texture files. That\u0027d be mostly .dds files, but there\u0027s probably a few left-over png or tga etc files. It\u0027ll look like either a white plaster molded object or an unshaded bright purple horror. But, it\u0027ll determine if it\u0027s the textures or something else.\u003Cp\u003EIt may also be the reflective shader. You could probably test that simply by removing the dll for it.

I have trouble telling as my PC is over-specced for KSP. Esp on the graphics side of things.
