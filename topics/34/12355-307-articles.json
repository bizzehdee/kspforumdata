It might be easy, it might not be, it might throw out your dV charting a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, in using real fuels and realism overhaul, most of the boosters for instance have a power curve they follow. Currently, if MJ is running the staging, MJ doesn\u0027t \u0022hit the next stage button\u0022 until the booster is totally depleted of fire/push. This is usually not optimum. Optimum time to discard the booster is when it is no longer pushing the craft. I don\u0027t know if you can know if a booster is pushing or pulling it back slower at a given output.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt sure is cool though to watch your boosters peal away from your craft at just the right time. They only fall back slowly at first as they are pushed away with small rockets. Basically, if they\u0027re no longer helping, they need to go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other thing as a suggestion is... MJ is controlling the controlling pod/unit. It is getting all of its angular velocities and whatnot all from that component. If that component is at the top (for example) the rocket, and the rocket is long and limber, then MJ tends to chase. Could a flag be added that we could turn on that would have MJ use the component closest to CoM instead, even if MJ\u0027s controlling unit is on the top/end? This would help with these problem type crafts. Right now, I usually put another MJ controller on a large tank about half way up the rocket and control from there. Keeps the chasing down, but when that tank is dropped, I run into problems (have to switch crafts with the ] key).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Galane","CreatedById":77949,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-04T00:51:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bothersome\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Bothersome\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other thing as a suggestion is...
