Keep up the great work\n\nYou\u0027re most welcome!\n\nThe specific technical reason for the change was that the structural line between the booster and Orion was going through the engine\u0027s little node before, which is bad, even if with KJR it\u0027s possible to get away with. Previously we were getting a minor oscillation because of that weak point in the structure. \n\nThe new setup transfers the launch vehicle force directly into the service module.\n\nSide note since we\u0027re on the subject; Chaka\u0027s rockets are all pretty well made in terms of structural rigidity, such that you really could use them without KJR. The reason we switched to including KJR in 1.0.2 is that the latest KSP has a springy force on some parts that you can\u0027t overcome with node size. Overcoming that would require struts and raised parts count etc.\n\nIf the next version of KSP fixes this issue we will be able to drop KJR entirely, because all the craft are perfectly rigid enough without it other than the new spring issue.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E With the inflatable shield on top, it\u0027s good to go !\n\u003E [http://www.esa.int/var/esa/storage/images/esa_multimedia/images/2010/10/exploration_mission_spacecraft_assembled_in_orbit/10280621-2-eng-GB/Exploration_mission_spacecraft_assembled_in_orbit_node_full_image_2.jpg](http://www.esa.int/var/esa/storage/images/esa_multimedia/images/2010/10/exploration_mission_spacecraft_assembled_in_orbit/10280621-2-eng-GB/Exploration_mission_spacecraft_assembled_in_orbit_node_full_image_2.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E but where is the rentry capsule ? may be on the node... and with a eva hatch on the other side.\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://nssfrance.free.fr/news/HMM04.JPG](http://nssfrance.free.fr/news/HMM04.JPG)\n\nWhen I look at that diagram I see the Monkey Transfer Vehicle if you had to break it down into Ariane V - launchable bites ( mass, fairing diameter constraints )\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-09T21:41:34Z\u0022 title=\u002206/09/2015 09:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by YANFRET**"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbal01","CreatedById":57322,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T21:46:15Z","Content":"what happened to vulkan? you posted pictures and there are some parts that are labeled for vulkan but not a complete set and no .craft files. were they not ready for release?."},{"CreatedByName":"YANFRET","CreatedById":90547,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T22:01:37Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E what happened to vulkan? you posted pictures and there are some parts that are labeled for vulkan but not a complete set and no .craft files. were they not ready for release?.\n\nFirst, it doesn\u0027t fit neatly into this pack.
