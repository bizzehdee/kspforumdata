I added the on-screen buttons for people who want to do it that way as I know some people would prefer that method.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that the function of the Velocity Control mode has not changed, I just added the on-screen buttons for it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeight control is all new however.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0027Fly To\u0027 text box is the altitude you want your ship to hold in meters above terrain. Note that this is different then the altimeter at the top of the screen which displays height above sea level.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClick this box to enter text entry mode where you can enter your desired altitude as expected, then click outside the box to return to flight mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote the distinction between text entry mode and flight mode, this is important. Due to how Unity handles the text entry, when you have clicked into text entry mode, it captures all key inputs, including flight control inputs so until you click outside the text box and return to flight mode, you can not control your ship. I\u0027m going to keep looking into this, but I suspect this is a limitation we are going to have to live with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce your height is set, click the Auto Height button to fly to the selected altitude and hold. When the Auto Height text is green, Height Control is enabled and flying your ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen in height control mode, it still compensates for vessel tilt and mass changes in your ship so you can control your horizontal velocity while staying locked at your selected height.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEffectively, Height Control mode is Velocity Control mode with a Velocity setpoint of 0 at a specific altitude and should work that way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe one thing I need feedback on is how much thrust to reserve for horizontal control. At the moment, Height control mode can only use up to 80% thrust, the other 20% is reserved for vessel tilt compensation. This translates into up to 35\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 off vertical for moving around. You will see a yellow OVER PITCH warning if you go past 35\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 degrees, but Height Control will still do it\u0027s best but it can\u0027t guarantee a stable hover if you go past 35\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis limit however means that a ship with a TWR of less then 1 at 80% thrust, (or a TWR of 1.25 at max thrust) can not be height controlled and you will have a red TWR LOW warning and not be able to activate height control mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShould I change this 80% limit?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other thing you will see is a red TWR HIGH warning. This is caused by a throttle setting of 1% not being negative acceleration. This will be caused by the presence of SRBs on launch from Kerbin usually, although really low gravity moons may also cause this error if the craft trying to land has a lot of engine power. Again, all it means is that Height Control can not engage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn all cases, these warnings apply to Height Control only. The Velocity Control mode can be activated at any time and will do it\u0027s best with whatever ship configuration you have.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs always, any feedback is good feedback. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ED.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JumpsterG","CreatedById":63396,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-28T18:13:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELooking forward to using this again.
