I\u0027m thinking that I had too many things in Advanced Science Tech or something. I also noticed that the shroud that fits over the parachutes on the CM was missing too, it was under the same tech, but now that I know what to look for I was able to fix that too. I\u0027ll have to go through the parts and make sure nothing else is missing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI figured the missing .crafts would be something like that, thanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince I\u0027m trying this in career mode, I haven\u0027t had a chance to fly the full Apollo CSM yet, so I can\u0027t verify SP1989\u0027s report, but I have noticed in the past that the Gemini CSM is a bit of a mono-propellant hog. It tends to burn a lot of Mono if you try to maneuver using Mechjeb, because the nose likes to dip during burns.

It wouldn\u0027t have to fit the LM, just something so you could use the complete CSM with smaller diameter launch vehicles. I think all you\u0027d have to do is add that extra attachment node and decoupler from the SLA panel attachment plate to the 2.5 meter Titan fairing attachment plate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust trying to think of out of the box launchers for the CSM, since you get most of the parts for that before you get Saturn or SLS parts to launch it with, and the SLA only fits 3.75m parts. I tried to put a CSM on top of your Titan II, but it wouldn\u0027t attach because the SM engine doesn\u0027t have an attachment node at the bottom of the bell like the normal engines. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sp1989\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sp1989\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EActually I have more problem with fuel than Mono. Even transferring leftover fuel from the LM doing a Trans Kerbin Injection the fuel seems insufficient. Again its probably just me so don\u0027t change anything on my behalf if everyone else is doing it than its obviously something I am doing wrong. It just seems like I burn so much Delta V getting into Mun orbit and circularizing when I am ready for TKI there is way less than half left. Then if I was using Deadly Reentry my Kerbals would die because I am just happy to get an intersecting orbit with Kerbin because there isn\u0027t enough fuel to circularize and slow my decent. If its just me then I will revaluate the way I play. So please don\u0027t change anything for me because the rocket is probably perfect.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think I figured out what your dV problem is there, I just remembered that the Apollo missions didn\u0027t circularize on the return trajectory, they just went straight in.

Should I be using the J2 to get into mun orbit. What I usually do is the j2 to get the encounter I want and then half way through the trip to the mun I seperate get the LEM and then when I hit the encounter and start my burn at the right time. By the time I get into the mun orbit almost half the fuel is gone and then after circularing and getting into a low orbit to save fuel for the LEM ascent stage the fuel is a little less than half. So once I dock with the LEM I transfer the leftover fuel and even then it\u0027s not enough to escape the mun and intersect with Kerbin. It\u0027s not the heat with deadly Reentry it\u0027s the Gs that the capsule pulls during Reentry that kill my kernels. Obviously I turned off DR but if I were useing it or someone else was useing it Reentry would truly be the most dangerous part.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
