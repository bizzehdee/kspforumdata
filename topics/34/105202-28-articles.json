I feel a bit sad that it is only of such a limited usefulness.\n\nThe last graph in the album is the same calculation with the following change:\n\nThe mass of the Nom-O-Matic 5k is reduced from 1.5 ton to 0.55 ton.\n\nIn this case the Nom-O-Matic 5k is useful in much more circumstances.\n\nSo I would like to suggest to change the mass of Nom-O-Matic 5000 from 1.5 ton to 0.55 ton. (The 0.6 value of my previous post has been superseeded, because the newly tested strategies interfere with it)\n\nFurther results:\n\n- Mixing Nom25k and Nom5k makes never sense, because the Nom25k also has a greenhouse.\n\n- Using the Nom25k Greenhouse alone is not useful, because it is worse than using the Agroponics\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Food, oxygen, supplies, snacks, mulch, waste, whatever.\n\nSo I am looking at extending USI-LS in a few different ways (each of which is also about adding a new mechanic).\n\n1. One would be the idea of a time-based mechanic - basically, the inherent recyclers (the things that provide heat, cooling, scrub CO2, etc.) would have a service life. So the built in ones might last 30 days, but for long journeys you will need more robust equipment (in the form of separate parts). Their efficiency would decay over time, so that giant recycling module you dropped on Duna ten years ago may still work, but not at full capacity).\n\n2. In addition to resources and the mechanic above, where failure is life or death, add a \u0027happiness\u0027 factor, where the Kerbals need more space and more advanced facilities to keep them healthy and happy based on ship duration. The \u0027fail\u0027 penalty for this would be separately configurable - so a Kerbal squished into a lander can for ten years may not die, but they\u0027d be really grouchy. This would be a case where the lander can is good for, say, 30 days. But then you need simple habs to extend into the several months, and for super long term stuff, you will need centrifuges (for orbital stations) as well as medical bays, etc. to keep the Kerbals kicking.\n\n3. Automatic supply scavenging. If a Kerbal runs out of supplies, they can look not only in their current ship (and it\u0027s locked containers) but also other ships within a certain radius. This way, just by air dropping a bunch of supplies, Kerbals will happily EVA to pick them up. UKS already does this, but I\u0027d like it as something built into the core life support mod.\n\nI have a few other ideas, like enforcing temperature tolerances, etc. (so radiators are also need to keep crew alive), etc. but figured these were a good start"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Dilsby","CreatedById":232743,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-17T16:51:05Z","Content":"What I like best about your mod is that it adds the life support dimension but is simple and fun. Therefore my vote is to:\n\n1) Not allow parts to age please. Nothing else in the game wears out--engines don\u0027t need to get overhauled, you can recycle Mystery Goo indefinitely, etc. If you had filters etc that needed to be cleaned out by an engineer, OK--but I really don\u0027t want to have to decommission ships because their stuff wore out.\n\n2) This I like, having a \u0027happiness\u0027 factor for each Kerbal. Their \u0022Dumb\u0022 stat and BadS flag should factor into it. Unhappy Kerbals should be less efficient--maybe degrading their rank-based abilities, slowing movement, etc.\n\n3) Yes, you should be able to pull off a resupply by taking the effort to get the new stuff in the general area of the crew. Not being able to do so would be reminiscent of back when a Kerbal could get stuck on the ground because there was a 10cm step to get to the hatch and no ladder ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nIn general, I say keep it simple!

My suggestion was simply that unhappy Kerbals eat more up to a certain limit (50% more? 100% more?), with stupid Kerbals getting more unhappy when they are alone (because they get bored) and not-brave Kerbals getting more unhappy when they don\u0027t have much in the way of living space (because they get claustrophobic).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E 3. Automatic supply scavenging. If a Kerbal runs out of supplies, they can look not only in their current ship (and it\u0027s locked containers) but also other ships within a certain radius. This way, just by air dropping a bunch of supplies, Kerbals will happily EVA to pick them up. UKS already does this, but I\u0027d like it as something built into the core life support mod.\n\nHow much of a calculation footprint do these systems have? I do not want it and would much prefer to send a rover out to retrieve it, but I\u0027m fine with ignoring it as long as it isn\u0027t causing bloat.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-17T17:29:11Z\u0022 title=\u002208/17/2015 05:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Grumman**"},{"CreatedByName":"goldenpsp","CreatedById":113874,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-17T17:30:22Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E What I like best about your mod is that it adds the life support dimension but is simple and fun. Therefore my vote is to:\n\u003E 1) Not allow parts to age please. Nothing else in the game wears out--engines don\u0027t need to get overhauled, you can recycle Mystery Goo indefinitely, etc. If you had filters etc that needed to be cleaned out by an engineer, OK--but I really don\u0027t want to have to decommission ships because their stuff wore out.\n\u003E \n\u003E 2) This I like, having a \u0027happiness\u0027 factor for each Kerbal. Their \u0022Dumb\u0022 stat and BadS flag should factor into it. Unhappy Kerbals should be less efficient--maybe degrading their rank-based abilities, slowing movement, etc.\n\u003E \n\u003E 3) Yes, you should be able to pull off a resupply by taking the effort to get the new stuff in the general area of the crew. Not being able to do so would be reminiscent of back when a Kerbal could get stuck on the ground because there was a 10cm step to get to the hatch and no ladder ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\u003E \n\u003E In general, I say keep it simple! I think a good design rule to keep in mind is that it should be possible for the user to build an indefinitely self-sustaining long haul spacecraft if desired.\n\nI would reiterate these points. I think the beauty of USI-LS is the simplicity. As a standalone I would leave that. Both parts wearing out and happiness are things that kind of already have components of support with UKS (spare parts and workspaces). So I think that additional functionality of USI-LS would be cool if both this and UKS were installed."}]}
