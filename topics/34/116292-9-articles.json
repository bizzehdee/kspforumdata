If I\u0027m correct in assuming thats how they have it set up there should be multiple engineID\u0027s throughout the config file with different names. So I did the SpaceY engine configs and the 5m M9 rocket cluster has two separate modes, one where all the engines fire, and the other where only the center engine fires. In the config there is an engineID named CenterOnly and AllEngines. So in the RealPlume config for it all you need to do is add :HAS[#engineID[\\*insert engineID\\*]] after the @MODULE[ModuleEngines\\*]. So in the instance of my SpaceY config it was laid out like this\n\n    @MODULE[ModuleEngines*]:HAS[#engineID[AllEngines]]    {        @name = ModuleEnginesFX\t\t!runningEffectName = DELETE        %powerEffectName = Kerolox-Lower    }@MODULE[ModuleEngines*]:HAS[#engineID[CenterOnly]]    {        @name = ModuleEnginesFX        !runningEffectName = DELETE        %powerEffectName = Kerolox-Upper    }\n\nNow, I don\u0027t know if Felger has this fixed since I last did it but you can\u0027t have the same plume name for both so you have to pick two separate ones to identify the mode. If you can\u0027t find it just post the config file in here and I\u0027ll see if I can figure it out.
