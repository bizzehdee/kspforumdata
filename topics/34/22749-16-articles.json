It has the same effect that you would get if you turned off the engines and attached a big hot air balloon to the nose of the rocket, then start the engines again and cut the balloon loose when the gravity turn altitude is reached.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce again, if the rocket is below the gravity turn start altitude you have entered, MechJeb and MechJeb2 will use any and all pod torque, control surfaces, and/or {active and enabled} RCS thrusters on the ship to keep the engines pointed towards the surface and the nose pointed directly AWAY from the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know of nothing in MechJeb itself that will make MechJeb point the nose of the rocket at the ground, or make it flip out like that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, it WILL flip out if the center of mass and center of lift are misaligned, or if the center of mass and center of thrust are misaligned, and possibly even if the center of thrust and center of lift are misaligned (within a small margin that varies based on how well the ship responds to rotational controls {aka \u0022control authority\u0022})\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope that helps clear things up regarding an overly-acrobatic Kliper launch vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: added description of important details of MJ2 ascent autopilot functionality\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-27T12:36:11Z\u0022 title=\u002205/27/2013 12:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 27, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by SciMan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Good_Apollo","CreatedById":46497,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-27T12:29:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Canopus\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Canopus\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBeing so arrogant isn\u0027t going to help you.
