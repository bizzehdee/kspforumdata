Awesome!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe suggestion about being able to see the actual value would be nice but not necessary. Just would make it easier to know if what you are doing is actually helping or not especially when the CoM ball becomes so small that you can barely see it anymore. But then again, at that point it probably isn\u0027t making that much of a difference in the overall stability, but maybe it would be nice to have for the purists out there who love numbers \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA quick note, the plugin appears to calculate parts that are not connected to the craft. ex: have some fueltank with rcs thrusters on it and you disconnect it from the craft and leave it there in a corner of the VAB while testing a different setup, it will calculate the parts that you put away even tho they are not connected to anything anymore.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers and grats again for this great plugin!!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr Shifty","CreatedById":68146,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-16T21:25:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI notice that parts are still considered for torque calculations even when they\u0027re removed from the main vessel, i.e. they\u0027re semi-transparent red in the VAB.
