It\u0027s not something that can be fixed by futzing with drag, since even with 0 drag, at 0kN thrust you\u0027re not going to go faster...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(It took a much cleaner and ~400kg lighter aircraft than the Wildcat to get to about 240mph at sea level; I verified the 0-thrust thing by climbing then diving to get to about 400mph level, and seeing when thrust went above 0.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt any rate, the issue seems *very* [inversely] proportional to air density, since as I mentioned at high altitude engines might even over-perform.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"velusip","CreatedById":60676,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-16T00:31:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis seems like way too much thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qie0opS.png\u0022 alt=\u0022qie0opS.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are the Module Manager configurations for AJE, DRC, and FAR, : \u003Ca href=\u0022http://sprunge.us/beDb\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://sprunge.us/beDb\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps Ferram\u0027s KIDS mod interferes?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"camlost","CreatedById":57590,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-16T02:14:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022velusip\u0022 data-cite=\u0022velusip\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis seems like way too much thrust.\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qie0opS.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/qie0opS.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are the Module Manager configurations for AJE, DRC, and FAR, : \u003Ca href=\u0022http://sprunge.us/beDb\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://sprunge.us/beDb\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps Ferram\u0027s KIDS mod interferes?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s weird.
