My general crashes had gotten better with 1.1.2, and it seemed to just be triggering on KIS interactions. Bleh. Back to square one. (It\u0027s happening on two rather different computers, both rather new, so it\u0027s got to be something about the scene I\u0027m working in with this base)\n\nAs for the port rooting, I suspected that might be the case. Found a workaround accidentally though. Since the \u0022detach\u0022 action with the R key removes everything below from the root, you can just \u0022detach\u0022 the part the port is attached to and the port drops to the ground as a separate object.

Now, I have found an interesting problem with docking nodes.\n\nI guess KIS might be involved, as I performed a number of complex EVA constructions prior the issue. I am not yet sure and still try to replicate the issue with either my 80\u002B mods or a vanilla\u002BKIS only installation. I am also not sure if this problem has never occured before but my searches turned up nothing yet - so forgive me if it was already mentioned somewhere. I use KSP 1.1.2 with KIS v1.2.9.\n\nThe problem:\n\nI have two unused standard docking nodes (STATION NODE and CRAZY NODE (you\u0027ll see why ;-) )) on my space station. I try to dock a lander with his node LANDER NODE to the station. I use Docking Port Alignment Indicator which allows cycling through all empty docking nodes - nevertheless, I am only able to select STATION NODE with it. I can manually right-click target the CRAZY NODE, but every attempt to dock with CRAZY NODE fails. I dock with STATION NODE instead.

Garage adapter is not a part of KIS, authors of that mod should do the changes. And using \u0022R\u0022 to switch the node is a generic approach in KIS, why do you believe garage adapter deserves a special note?\n2. As for the open legs, it\u0027s a change in KSP 1.1 which I\u0027m fighting with for several days already (in scope of fixing a bug). So far no solution, but there are some ideas.\n3. Deploying limit feature should be suggested on the garage\u0027s mod forum since it\u0027s not related to KIS."},{"CreatedByName":"baranowb","CreatedById":61650,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-12T20:01:39Z","Content":"Hey Igor:\n\n1.

Dock ports have own logic which may get broken when KIS is used to modify the station. As a workaround, detach \u0022crazy port\u0022 and put it into inventory (any). Then pull it out and attach back. This should reset the port\u0027 state. In the future avoid using KIS detach function to break connection between two docked ports.
