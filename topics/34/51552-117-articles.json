Vessels that are unloaded from the active scene do not correctly act as relays.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is easiest to see with an example. Mothership M has a big dish and an omni antenna. The dish is pointed at the home satellite network. Probe P, which has only an omni antenna, decouples. It\u0027s fine, so long as it stays in physics range of mothership M. As soon as it gets past 2.5k and the mothership unloads, P loses its connection and can no longer be controlled, even though it\u0027s still well within the range of M\u0027s omni antenna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuicksave and reload is the easiest way to fix that problem, but it\u0027s still annoying, especially if the probe is in the middle of a circularization burn, or worse, already in an atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Sometimes RCS stops working after undocking. I haven\u0027t yet done scientific testing to prove that this is a RemoteTech bug, but it seems to only bite me when I have RT2 installed so I\u0027m about 75% sure. The symptom is that you simply can\u0027t turn RCS on, even though you otherwise have control of the craft. Again, quicksave and load fixes it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"brucethescottie","CreatedById":104100,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-21T23:18:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have downloaded the mod, and the installation page for it (@Kerbal Spaceport)is blank.

If I remember correctly, that target selection is a dish to dish not a cone setting, resulting in a dish pointing to Kerbin not making a connection to that dish. The way to use it you would have the sat set its dish to active vessel, and the active ship pointed at that sat in order to have a connection. To connect by pointing toward Kerbin you would have to be in a SOI which has a dish pointed in that direction, for example pointing a sat dish at Duna, your ship in orbit around Duna with a disk pointed to Kerbin would then have a connection.\u003Cp\u003EI hope this helps \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E It took me quite a while to figure it out myself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Enice, thanks for information. sometimes I find myself confused with this kind of stuff\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hedzup456","CreatedById":58059,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-22T11:59:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI, too would gladly help write up the documentation, if no-one any better than I want to do it.

It is my belief that the majority of problems related to this mod come from a incomplete understanding of how the components work which leads to a badly designed RT network. I know Cilph has some changes in mind and I\u0027m personally against some of them because I feel that some of them are to accommodate badly designed networks.

Trying to describe the network and descriptions and pictures of every satellite would take pages! It would be easier for you to explain why RTDEBUG is the last module called when I do a alt-f2 and then the program just hangs in that routine until the game runs out of memory! What is more maddening is that it\u0027s not consistent. One time I will sit and reload the game 50 times get pissed and go away. Come back and load the very same persistent.sfs file and get into the TS first try!!!! It\u0027s ****ing maddening!!! All I can see is every time it does hang it hangs in RTDEDUG!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurthermore what do you mean by a BAD network. I have basically two kind of commsats. The ones around kerbin have 1 gtx-128, 4 88-88\u0027s and 2 dts-m1\u0027s and a comm32. The ones around other bodies generally have a comm32, 2 dts-m1\u0027s, and an 88-88\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe omnis are all in range of each other, one dts-m1 is generally aimed ad active vessel on all sats. the others are assigned targets as needed. I have a 6 satellite pattern for most bodies (kerb, mun, min, duna, ike, and eve so far). four sats equatorial in high eccentric orbits in a clover pattern (the idea being they spent most time at the high end of their orbits) and two in high circular polar orbits 90 degrees apart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI favor orbital heights (measured from the center of the planet) around 2771 because this keeps all the comm32\u0027s within 4.8Mm of each other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition I am using the interstellar pack and fractal uk decided to change the way the seismic sensor works so I have an additional 6 landed relays on mun, min, kerb, duna, ike, and eve - four at the cardinal points around the equator and on at each pole. They consist of a comm32, 2 dts-m1 or aies pcf5\u0027s and a seimic sensor\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo adding all those up you have 12 probes per body (ker, min, mun, duna, ike, eve) that\u0027s 72 each with three to seven ant/dishes ea that\u0027s over 288 ant/dishes plus I have 4 scanners flying oover each body - SAR, RADAR, BIOME, KETHANE and each of those has at least a comm32. Plus I have manned vessels with dishes / ant to transmit crew reports!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
