It seems to try to get the dV down to .1 but the node wanders a lot that low on 50\u002Bton ships (not sure about lighter ones).

It does this even if the relative inclination is .11 deg. Which usually wastes an orbit to fix and since it\u0027s such a low dV maneuver, there is a lot of node chasing going on there. Perhaps there should be a larger tolerance for this. I get around it by having the planner do the holman transfer first. Once the burn is complete for that, engaging the rendezvous module correctly figures it is already on intercept and goes from there. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure what a good tolerance should be. Perhaps it should scale with the distance involved. If you and the target are relatively close (say in LKO) a relative inclination of even a full degree probably wouldn\u0027t make a lot of difference to the intercept. Of course without doing the math, I wouldn\u0027t know if 5 deg would make a difference really.

Due to variance and node chasing this has put me on collision course more times that is statistically agreeable. 100m seems to work great for smaller ships, but for stations and larger things 100m will often end badly. Any way to get a variable to modify this?
