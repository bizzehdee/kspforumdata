He will continue to keep them up to date as his time and discretion allows.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EThey will no longer be a part of the KSOS Mod for KSP\u003C/em\u003E, making sure that is clear since I don\u0027t want folks upset in the future when the KSO EX\u00A0drops.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe 3D Models and mesh data will be released as part of an alternate downloads pack. Several people, including our own testing team wished to have them to learn, build on, expand, or even release their own mod. In other words they will become a part of the KSP Modding community. This is an effort in my part to encourage and\u00A0promote more folks getting involved in 3D modeling, modding, model making, and learning how game art is made.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EWhy are the two shuttles being taken out of the mod and becoming their own thing? Why won\u0027t you work on them anymore?\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nWhen I built the first one, I didn\u0027t know what KSPs internal requirements were. It wasn\u0027t until I worked with Nazari through three mods.... (KSO, Super 25 and the satellite parts)... that I finally understood how KSP \u0022worked\u0022. There were also a lot of communication issues between him and I. In some cases he\u0027d use different terminology than I\u0027m used to, causing big issues (like referring to Transforms where I call them Pivots and so on). \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThis also affected size. When I built the first one, my goal was really to have a mini shuttle. This was because I never expected there to be much interest in anything bigger than 1.5m to haul stuff up to space. I figured the community wanting a shuttle was small as it were. I even talked about this a couple times in that thread and it seemed to me anyone wanting to haul stuff up would just use conventional rockets. So after lots of demands I put the KSO \u0022Super\u0022 25 together as a temporary solution until KSOS Phase\u00A06 (KSO EX).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWith the KSO EX, Nazari and I came to a conclusion: Why waste people\u0027s resource space as it is, just make the EX 2.5\u002B and solve the resource issue in one go. No more 4\u002B textures hogging up memory, no more dealing with two shuttles that need constant upgrading and repairs as Squad updates the game. I\u0027m sure you guys can see where this is going. In other words a single shuttle can be made to look 2 times better, have more features, have better textures and still take up a smaller footprint on your hard drive (ergo, less memory on KSP loading being hogged up).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSince the first shuttle I learned a lot, including upgrading various artwork creation tools and my entire art pipeline has changed. For that reason, the older shuttles are slowly becoming incompatible\u00A0on my end. The new shuttle is essentially compatible with all next-gen artwork. That means the new shuttle can potentially support a PBR type arrangement if Squad ever takes advantage of Unity 5\u0027s shader capabilities. I will be experimenting with Nazari on this.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nKSP has changed and there are new features coming in that the older shuttles\u00A0couldn\u0027t support. The new shuttle will have the foundation for internal views besides just IVAs. The older shuttles would have to be re-baked and essentially re-UVed in order to support that sort of thing. Just not worth the time and effort.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EWhy no more twin tail arrangement?\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nTo lower the amount of parts on the shuttle in game. Twin tails also presented all sorts of problems especially with RCS getting in the way and such.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe EX is more of a modern take on NASA\u0027s space shuttle, rather than a Kerbal space shuttle while still retaining some of the look.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSimplicity\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EHow modular is the EX compared to the other shuttles?\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nAs modular as it can be. The problem will always remain: Blending the delta wing into the cargo bay while still making the landing gear close in and be smooth. I think we have a good middle ground with this new design.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022icsdcWH.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022738\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/icsdcWH.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nI\u0027m trying to make as many of the parts as\u00A0modular as possible as seen above. You will be able to pull off the RCS blocks and re-arrange them or use them in other projects. The tanks can also be surface mounted on other projects. The shroud in the rear can be toggled on and off, in case prefer to reveal the guts of the thing or if you have a mod that allows your Kerbals to access the plumbing for repairs. All parts where possible will have this capability including the rear end of the shuttle where the SSME\u0027s mount.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSpeaking of SSMEs, the KSO EX aside from new OMS engines will replace the project SSMEs with the Thrustmax Aerojet (thrust not decided yet). Although stylized to be slightly \u0022kerbally\u0022 they are\u00A0highly detailed and modeled after the Space Shuttle Engines (Aerojet Rocketdyne RS-25)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022O7RMSeZ.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022750\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/O7RMSeZ.jpg\u0022 width=\u0022778\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nThe old lift vehicles will not be a part of the KSOS mod any more, they too will be retired along with the other shuttles. The KSO EX will have a completely new lift vehicle incompatible with the old models. Currently we\u0027re discussing that the new EFT will be 3.5m capable. It will follow the NASA Space Shuttle lifter design and not the Buran design. This is because the new lifter will be designed with radial symmetry in mind a problem the older shuttles always had. This new lifter will be fully modular.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ENaming them and colors was always an issue, how does the new project solve that?\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nGood question. As I said earlier it is my intent to keep the main texture \u0022skin\u0022 completely separate from flags and names. Unity 5 shaders as long as a decal is placed over a pixel shaded model (as opposed to vertex shaded), it shouldn\u0027t have z-buffer issues. I\u0027m not at that point yet, but it is my intent to experiment with removing the AO from the diffuse so that you guys only get a color diffuse and can simply just recolor a texture as you like. The name can be changed in the VAB and you\u0027ll be able to change it and make your own. Unfortunately you will have to know how to handle image alphas in order for your own custom name to show up correctly.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EWill we be able to see the interior from the outside?\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nUnfortunately no, not until Squad supports that feature (EVA looking into IVA) by default. However, I\u0027m putting together a middle ground compromise mainly for glass shader effects. The main reason being that it would probably kill people\u0027s computers to be able to see into the actual IVA directly from the outside. This is not to be confused with the shuttle internals which are low resolution models.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EWill there be windows in the moon door to see up as you dock, will there be windows looking into the cargo bay?\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nYes and yes\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EFlaps?\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nNo, we\u0027re done with that. It was a mistake in my part. CSEs will still extend but will operate like flaperons essentially.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EWhat parts are \u003Cstrong\u003Enot\u003C/strong\u003E modular?\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nThe main wings. This is because of how radial symmetry works in KSP. The bottom side of them is black with the tiles, the top is white with the heat blankets (FIB). The bottom has the landing gear wells and doors. Also, the wings root chords themselves would not be symmetrical if you drew a line through the root rib.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe rear end. For obvious reasons, the rear end can only fit the cargo bay. An adaptor will be made for this shuttle like the original had but will not be part of the first release.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe cargo bay. You may be able to stack the cargo bay to make a longer shuttle, however, I\u0027m not sure if that is possible as of the last edit (been working on other parts and haven\u0027t revisited the fuselage yet). As long as I don\u0027t need more space for the main landing gear, it should be stackable creating a long \u0022shuttle train\u0022 if that\u0027s what you\u0027re into.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe cockpit. Like the rear end, I -will- release a cockpit to KSP adaptor that will allow you to use the cockpit on KSP\u0027s stock space shuttle. However, like the rear end shroud, this will not be part of the first release.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nFront nosecone. This part is in a shape that only fits the cockpit. Also, this part contains the front RCS module sub assembly.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EWill there be an airbrake?\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nYes. Nazari had some issues with it on the rudder, but I can put airbrakes anywhere, we just haven\u0027t decided where we want it yet.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EDoes the rudder have a spot for a drogue chute?\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nYes.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EHow tall will the new shuttle be (how high off the ground), or will the kerbals not be able to walk under it?\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nSadly, I have a feeling the Kerbals might not be able to walk under this shuttle this time. That has to do with how much space we have for the main landing gear to fold and fit inside the wings without clipping. Since the new landing gear do not compress, chances are that the new shuttle might not have enough ground clearance to allow a kerbal to walk under it with a helmet on. There would be no way of knowing for now.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nAny other questions feel free to send them my way or ask here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Avalon304","CreatedById":68304,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-04T07:37:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222615788\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022132755\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221465024749\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002274755\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022helldiver\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n17 minutes ago, helldiver said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/O7RMSeZ.jpg\u0022 title=\u0022Enlarge image\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022O7RMSeZ.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage ipsImage_thumbnailed\u0022 height=\u0022750\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/O7RMSeZ.jpg\u0022 width=\u0022778\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is the first time Ive seen the Aerojet textured... holy hannah its pretty...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whovian41110","CreatedById":155794,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-04T16:23:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre there any other OMS engines that have KMGimbal and\u00A0are more powerful than the Omnimax 40?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Raptor22","CreatedById":130224,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-04T18:20:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHelldiver, would you be able to make it so that we have the OPTION of making it either twin-tailed or single-tailed? I love the old V-tail design, and I want to be able to use it in this. Could you see if you could make it so that the parts can be used independently (so that it is not a strict design, where the parts can ONLY be used for one purpose, and work ONLY for that purpose), so that we can make the shuttle work either way.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is like with how you had the original KSO. You originally had it a single-tailed design, but you then chose to move the tail fin(s) to make a v-tail design. The KSO EWBCL doesn\u0027t quite have this freedom since it has the texture underneath where the tail fins should go, so I would have to cover it up with\u00A0parts or edit the textures.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou did talk about having the texture change and being able to change the name.

The popular size for shuttle (you said it\u0027s almost like a modernised version, so surely it\u0027d work off similar architecture?) ETs for a vehicle of this scale is more in the realms of 5m, and that works a bit nicer (in my opinions) in terms of the general shape of things. It looks more reasonable that the LV needs a 5m tank\u0027s worth of fuel to get to orbit than a 3.75 worth\u0027s imo \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kujuman","CreatedById":28299,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-04T20:58:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust inquiring as to what you\u0027re using/planning for modular SRBs\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Drakenex","CreatedById":114246,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-04T21:56:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthose SSME looks unreal!! also \u0022 It will follow the NASA Space Shuttle lifter design and not the Buran design \u003Cspan\u003E\u0022 great, not a fan of the Buran style, I\u0027ve always used the KSO tank with the Super 25.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"helldiver","CreatedById":74755,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-04T22:15:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222616334\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022132755\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221465064426\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022130224\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Raptor22\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, Raptor22 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHelldiver, would you be able to make it so that we have the OPTION of making it either twin-tailed or single-tailed?

It seemed to be missing a spinning animation (though I can\u0027t test it anymore without 1.0.5).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot really important issues but I thought I\u0027d bring them up--I\u0027m just happy to see that KSO will continue to be supported by other modders, and the additions you\u0027ve been working on look really promising!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"astro_119","CreatedById":164997,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-07T12:08:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nfor now, before phase 6 dont install the klockheed martin plugin it messes up stuff aswell as the oms engines\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222619112\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022132755\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221465229537\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022130224\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Raptor22\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n19 hours ago, Raptor22 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is kind of sad you guys are retiring the old shuttles.
