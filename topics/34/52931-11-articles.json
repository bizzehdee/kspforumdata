I play with DRE and FAR and with how high you can pop your chutes as long as I don\u0027t come in at an extreme angle there\u0027s litterally nothing stopping me from releasing my main chute the second i go below 40km. The rate at which it slows me down by the time I hit the 32-30km range I\u0027m going slowly enough that theres no risk of the chutes catching fire making a heatshield redundant. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan you give thought to maybe asking nathan if you can \u0022borrow\u0022 his ablative shielding coding and apply it to chutes but name it somethin that has to do with how much of the chute is still intact and functioning. Such as either if the resource is gone your chutes are basicly shredded beon use and are automaticly cut or the ammount of drag they produce is equal to how much of the integrity resource is left? I know I can just house rule myself and not fire chutes litterally the first moment I can but having to think before I hit that button wouldn\u0027t be a bad thing especially if it can be disabled if someone didn\u0027t wish to bother with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeck you could even take it a step further and with all the new parachutes you have spread them across the tech tree denoting where parachute tech is increasing ( early chutes are barely a step above WW2 era tech later ones made of much stronger stuff able to take the higher reentry speeds).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-05T04:49:46Z\u0022 title=\u002212/05/2013 04:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 5, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Kalista\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
