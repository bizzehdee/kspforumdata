I had not originally seen the option in my gpu settings to cut the refresh rate to half. And also \u0022Every Other Vblank\u0022 in the application does the same. Runs the game at 30 frame per second... And the skipping reentry effects are gone. Its..\u0022smooth\u0022 now. \u003Cp\u003EBut being locked at 30fps is just.. horrible. So now that im able to narrow down the culprit.. to an extent id like to hope atleast. Maybe now I can work towards a proper solution to run this mod at 60fps. So the more fps the worse the skipping effect. There MUST be a solution somewhere here. I simply cannot be the only person having this problem.

But this skipping effects/audio is just killing it for me. So like I said in that comment it seems to be a vsync issue. The lower the frames per second. The better it is. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI ask this.. how many of you have pc\u0027s powerful enough to peg this game at 60fps?
