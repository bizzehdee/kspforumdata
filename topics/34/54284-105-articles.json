Remember the astronauts in the skylab were able to run around in artificial gravity ... and that was in the 70s.\u003Cp\u003EIf you have a big ship, you can have the crew compartments, or at least a gym, with artificial gravity. You just need to spin it fast enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI agree with you that a Lunar Base is a must, even before trying to go to Mars. Its quite retarded that we keep on burning tons of fuel to get stuff into LEO, when the moon is full of minerals and oxygen we can use. Most of the minerals on the moon, are binded to oxygen ... so basically the moon is FULL of oxygen. Yet we consider it barren and of no use ...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAluminium, Titanium, Silicon ... full of that stuff up there ... oh, and all of them binded to oxygen ...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW, yeah EPLP is one of those mods thats a game changer. Everytime there\u0027s a new update, i wait till EPLP is updated to get on the campaign mode. There\u0027s no point on playing it otherwise.

I couldn\u0027t think of a better way to applaud EPLP than to build biodomes with it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Coyote_ar","CreatedById":99837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T20:24:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewith 25m radius and 5rpm you could have 0.7g, i think thats enough to avoid health issues related to long zero-g. even 4rpm with 0.44g might do the trick ... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eanyway this kind of artificial gravity is largely related to long range missions. moon colonization and using it as a base to harvest materials used to build bigger stuff without having to haul it from earth gravity, would be the real challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etoo bad we dont have any empirical knowledge of what would happen if astronauts were to stay in for long periods of time in the moon with 0.17g. its a shame really \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
