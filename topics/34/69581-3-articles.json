Really looking forward to seeing the whole \u0022pack\u0022 come together. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn your question about stronger RCS blocks: they would probly be useful for people who play RSS. I just play stock KSP, so I find that since stronger RCS blocks use more fuel, I run out of RCS gas, and can\u0027t use them anyways, so I just use the normal RCS blocks. Plus, it\u0027s a huge space ship, it shouldn\u0027t turn on a dime like sports car \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E Just my thoughts on the subject.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BahamutoD","CreatedById":72433,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-22T02:04:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Starwaster\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Starwaster\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhen you say it\u0027s floppy, the legs, I take it you have to attach them?

Attach nodes (AFAIK) don\u0027t allow for different node sizes so it basically deals with them all the same. Even if you were to use a plugin to change their size I\u0027m pretty sure it wouldn\u0027t matter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStack nodes on the other hand: the higher the node size, the more attachment \u003Cem\u003Ejoints\u003C/em\u003E it creates. And either it makes them stiffer or just having more joints makes it stiffer. Each joint also has an associated breakForce / breakTorque (sounds familiar right?) and the larger the attachment node size, the higher the breakForce / breakTorque value. Maybe that\u0027s what actually affects stiffness, I\u0027m not sure. None of that happens in the VAB or SPH btw; joint strength is irrelevant there, it all happens when the vehicle is actually spawned and offrails. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat also has some bearing on your trusses BTW. You might want to increase their node size a bit, especially when they start getting attached to larger rockets of greater mass. Have you found \u003Cem\u003Ethem\u003C/em\u003E wobbly at all? I found my 10m (which was actually the default size) to be wobbly when KJR isn\u0027t installed. And I could not increase node size very much because I had several nodes too close together and it was making it hard to snap them. All my truss node sizes are 0.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt led me to create a small plugin that allows me to keep my node size as small as I want for the editor but once it launches and before it goes off-rails, it increases node size depending on configurable values for each node.
