Here we can use the upper stage from the Delta III, with some small modifications. You probably see already, we can do much part \u0026amp; texture sharing there, which really should lower the memory use, for that what you get.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, not to forget the Atlas V, the model is almost finished already, and just needs to be textured. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Oh, and also, Dragon01 will make a RSS/RO version for the rockets. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-24T06:25:13Z\u0022 title=\u002201/24/2015 06:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kartoffelkuchen\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-24T17:06:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice Delta launcher but why the off size ?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kartoffelkuchen","CreatedById":108501,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-24T17:42:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt doesn\u0027t match Stock size because I\u0027ve modelled it 1:1, because this pack is a replica pack and should be as first priority good to play with RSS. Modelling it 1:1 makes things easier, because you only have to scale down the size for normal KSP. And also, it should be compatible with US Probes, and they are also 64% of the real probe size. Many other mods are using the same scale, and this does so too.
