My keyboard profile editor now looks just like yours.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was trying to map keyboard keys in AFBW instead of the stock input system, hoping it would solve my multiple keypresses issue. (Side note: it did not.) Since I use the X52, some of my joystick buttons are joystick buttons and some are keyboard keys.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried adding a keyboard mapping for SAS Hold, which I thought was mapped to a keystroke but was actually a joystick button. The AFBW key mapper interface immediately changed into the window you pasted a screenshot of, all the way down to the almost-invisible outline of some GUI element in the top left.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat happened is AFBW put the XML appropriate for a joystick button into the section for keyboard keys in advanced_flybywire_config_v21.xml, and permanently confused itself. My AFBW seems to be pretty good about not letting me press keyboard keys while assigning joystick buttons, but theoretically this could swing both ways.

If you were to get the main throttle to work with rovers, you would probably experience problems trying to use it for liftoff and spaceplanes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI vaguely remember getting it to work once, but I have been experiencing a different odd glitch with the throttle. Usually it is zero to -1.0, but every now and then the game sees my throttle as a full axis that goes negative to positive. I don\u0027t know how or why, because by design that joystick\u0027s throttle axis (like all throttle axes) is supposed to be zero when the throttle is all the way down. It\u0027s possible that the first time I tried rovers was a time when I got that glitch. I end up calibrating inside AFBW on every launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEver since the first day, I\u0027ve been using the finger wheels for rovers. The main reason is they have a detent in the middle where I know the wheels are off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHonestly though, rovers are so bugged in that game that I stopped using them entirely after I landed the first one on the Mun. They are nigh frictionless, like slowly melting ice wheels on a Teflon planet. The brakes don\u0027t even stop the wheels when the throttle is at zero and the rover is stationary, flipped upside down with its wheels in the air. You can make them stop spinning by deactivating their motors and \u003Cem\u003Ethen\u003C/em\u003E applying brakes, but until you do that throttle in both directions makes them spin faster, and it still takes like 30 seconds for a free-spinning rover wheel to stop itself. The rover can\u0027t even stay traveling forward, it will slowly angle to one side and start this weird infinite frictionless skid in the direction it was traveling. Yet somehow, even when the rover is sliding frictionlessly 30\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 to the left of its wheel axes and has no reaction wheels or RCS thrusters, you can still use the steering to slowly control its yaw. (Which would indicate to me that if it\u0027s only drifting 2\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 to 5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 off axis, the wheels should have enough friction to turn that into a turn instead of skidding for miles in the same direction. But no, as soon as it\u0027s traveling faster than a Kerbal can run, it loses all control.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnless there\u0027s a mod that fixes them, I recommend simply not using rovers. KSP has obviously faked the physics in some way that just doesn\u0027t work at all. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact, ignoring friction seems to be a common problem in most of their math. Ever docked two spaceships only to get a slowly building resonant standing wave of spaceship wobble, when you are high in orbit and there are no forces acting on the craft? Ever put wheels on something, given it a tiny boost up to 10kph, and coasted along flat landscape for hours? Ever used a Kerbal climbing up a ladder into an obstruction as a thruster to get your science car moving after it runs out of gas? I\u0027ve landed small spaceplanes (single small jet engine, two liquid fuel fuselage, cockpit and wings), hit the parking brakes and gotten something from the fridge while I waited for the thing to stop so I could get out and take a surface sample on Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-30T21:35:00Z\u0022 title=\u002206/30/2015 09:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by misterbk\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rexrex600","CreatedById":66634,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-11T14:42:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs this compatible with ksp 1.0.4, and if not, do you plan to update it?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alkahest","CreatedById":144015,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T15:22:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI still cannot get the throttle working correctly.
