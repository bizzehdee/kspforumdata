Didn\u0027t get a chance to test indexing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFWIW, I think a default :FOR pass -- probably related to directory name -- is a good idea if only as a transitional tool. Right now if I wanted, for example, to run after all of the Realism Overhaul patches, there\u0027s simply no good way to do it. Best option would be to guess whether KSP would alphabetically load Wheels_Squad.cfg or pFairings.cfg last, and use an :AFTER on one of them. If I could say :AFTER[RealismOverhaul] as a catchall for everything in that folder, it\u0027d be useful during the transition and, IMO, it\u0027s a fair bet that the RO authors are going to use :FOR[RealismOverhaul] when they get to updating those patches, so the risk of my needing to change the name is low.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
