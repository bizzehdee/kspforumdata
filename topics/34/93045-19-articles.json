As Rabada suggested, this time I paid attention to my burn time, though I did watch the thrust percent and actual thrust. Anyway, from what I read on various Wiki\u0027s, the UA-1205 should burn for 115s. Presumably that means the two UA-1205 on the Titan IIIC should produce at least greater then 1.0twr for 115 seconds. However, at t\u002B1:48 (108s), I\u0027m reduced to 0.99twr with the SRMs burning at only 23.625% of rated thrust. If there\u0027s a page out there that says the UA-1205 burns for less then 115s before jettison, please point me to that page.

Known issue with stock SAS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust as an example, I have a 12.5t satellite on top of a Titan IIIC (should be able to put 13.1t into LEO according to various Wikis). Because of the thrust curve for the SRMs, my titan launches with 1.79twr (1.62SLT). It slowly builds up to 2.56TWR by around t\u002B1:41, then it starts to rapidly fall. By t\u002B1:49 it\u0027s down to 0.96TWR with SRMs burning at only 22.838% of rated thrust. And by t\u002B1:55, which is right about when the SRMs are supposed to be jettisoned, I\u0027m down to 0.03TWR with the SRMs burning at 0.795% of rated thrust. At that low of a TWR, I\u0027ve actually been losing speed for the last 4-5 seconds of the burn. Considering the Titan IIIC burns it\u0027s SRMs for 115s, jettisons them at around 116s and doesn\u0027t ignite it\u0027s main engine until around 118s, that means there\u0027s about 8 seconds where I\u0027m losing speed which, I think, is why I am having trouble getting this 12.5t payload into LEO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENathan, according to the graph you linked, at around 115s the UA-1205 should be producing around 800kN and shouldn\u0027t drop below 500kN until around 118s. According to the stats I see when I right click on the SRMs, I\u0027m at 800kN at 111s, 500kN at 113s and reach minimum 29.2kN at 115s. So it still seems like it\u0027s losing thrust at least 4 seconds early. Plus, that graph makes it appears as through the UA-1205 should completely burn out at around 120s but UA-1205 we have in the game continue to burn at 29.2kN until t\u002B2:09 which is 9 seconds longer then it probably should be burning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you for the graph, however. I am going to see if I can build a new, alternate thrust curve if for no other reason then to try and figure out if modifying the curve will fix the issue or if it\u0027s the amount of fuel that\u0027s the issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for SAS.... strange. I\u0027ve never had an issue with the SAS in the default game. It\u0027s only in RO that they don\u0027t appear to work. Normally in my stock and non-RO games, when I switch from \u0022Stability Assist\u0022 to one of the other options (like point retrograde), my RCS usage nearly doubles because of all the constant tiny corrections the system is trying to make. But when I do that same thing in RO, I see no change in the RCS usage. That\u0027s why I figured something had been turned off in RO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I do want to say, I realize that creating the thrust curve for the game was likely not an easy thing to do. The NASA graph shows the approx thrust at specific points in time, while the game adjusts thrust based on the amount of fuel still remaining. So coming up with the thrust curve we have now must not have been easy. And I know I\u0027m only complaining about a few seconds of burn time. Maybe the simpliest answer is just to add a bit more fuel. I know that will mess up the mass a little, but even a 3% increase in fuel results in SRMs on my test flight still producing 780kN (0.59TWR) at t\u002B1:55 which seems to be pretty close to what the NASA graph shows.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT2: I found a similar issue with the UA-1207 but adding 2% more fuel resolved it. Though 1%-1.5% additional fuel might be better.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-21T22:02:33Z\u0022 title=\u002204/21/2015 10:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by chrisl\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"chrisl","CreatedById":114320,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-21T21:26:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESeperate questions.

All three engines (AJ-10-137 SM engine, LM descent and LM ascent) should have gimbaling but all three \u0022ships\u0022 torque really badly. So much so that I end up using a significant amount of RCS fuel. When getting into the parking orbit around Mun, I do have the LM\u0027s RCS system turned off to conserve LM fuel. So that might explain the torquing I\u0027m getting with the AJ-10-137. But landing and launching the LM is using so much fuel (because of how much correcting the RCS thrusters have to make) that I find it extremely difficult to land and take off. One of my landings only succeeded because the LM\u0027s landing gear can apparently handle an extreme vertical impact (I was going better then -60m/s at impact) but even then I\u0027d used so much fuel from the ascent stage (where the rcs thrusters draw their fuel) that getting back to the CM wasn\u0027t possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main reason I\u0027m concerned that it could be a gimballing problem is that normally with an engine that gimbals, you can actually see it turning. But with all three of the engines on the CSM/LM, they don\u0027t appear to move when trying to turn. Is there any way to make sure that the gimballing is actually happening as expected?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
