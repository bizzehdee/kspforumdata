Or I\u0027m missing something. I have my three ComSats in orbit around Kerbin pointing at Mun. I have the one ComSat in leading orbit from the Mun pointing at Kerbin. For some reason however all it will do is connect to Mission Control. Once MC orbits around Kerbin I lose my connection, even tho all the satellites are clearly within the transmission cones.
