The subfolder arrangement only works when I know what\u0027s in it, which itself depends a lot on how interactive the mod is. If it\u0027s a mod I actually do things with while playing, like all the TAC mods, then I know where they live. But if it\u0027s a mod that sits there in the background doing its thing without my intervention, then I\u0027d rather it right of GameData, because I never become intimately familiar with it. For instace, RasterPropMon is now a subfolder of JSI, which I\u0027m pretty sure is a recent change.
