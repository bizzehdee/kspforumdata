Both of the operations needed (mining and electrolysis) work, but even with both of them selected, only one actually executes at a time. Thus, I have to run mining for a while, then switch to electrolysis when the alumina buffer is full until it\u0027s depleted again. I\u0027d prefer to just leave both of them turned on and have it eventually fuel itself up.

According to the power management display, the mining and refining both draw their energy even when no actual action is being taken, which could be the problem. Could the code be updated to not draw Megajoules when there\u0027s 1, no room to store new Alumina, and 2, when there\u0027s no Alumina to electrolyse? I think you should still be able to get your ship fueled with an insufficient power supply, it should just be much slower (by having it switch off when there\u0027s insufficient power for a particular operation, and resume when power becomes available, like antennae transmitting science).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can work around it but it\u0027s a little counterintuitive.
