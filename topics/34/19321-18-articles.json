So the effect isn\u0027t new; the new thing is that now both FAR and MechJeb are identically wrong in predicting it, while in 0.19 it starts happening exactly when air supply drops below 100% as computed by MechJeb. This might mean some new change in air consumption computations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: After some more experimentation, I found that the difference seems to be entirely because I disabled the engine nacelle intakes when testing in 0.19. Therefore, this issue seems to be very similar to the one that was causing problems for Kethane earlier: if you request a resource amount that cannot be serviced by any single tank, even if the total amount is sufficient, it can intermittently fail and return 0. In this instance it appears to render the small nacelle intakes completely useless once the air flow drops to a sufficiently low level.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA completely different issue that I just noticed is that it seems that in this latest FAR version the changes it previously did to the engines disappeared. The reason I disabled those nacelles in 0.19 is that it was hard to get the craft up to a height where it will flame-out with all intakes active, and I wanted to speed up events. In the current version however it is very easy to get it up to 18km even without specifically trying to - that\u0027s why I noticed this effect in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-27T09:17:33Z\u0022 title=\u002205/27/2013 09:17  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 27, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by a.g.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Photonically","CreatedById":60531,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-27T18:53:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHadn\u0027t really paid much attention to this until now, thought it looked like it\u0027d overcomplicate things, but now I\u0027ve tried it I think I\u0027ll be sticking with it, great improvement!
