(did you find a way to replace it? seems to be read-only).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was able to get a basic hinge working properly and rotating from correct origin. But only if it was attached in-line.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJoint.anchor and Joint.connectedAnchor both required modification as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E     \u003Cbr\u003EattachJoint..SetBreakingForces(breakingForce, breakingTorque);\u003Cbr\u003E                    ..... mod all the assignments to use attachJoint.Joint.    ....\u003Cbr\u003EattachJoint.Joint.anchor = attachJoint.Joint.anchor \u002B (-attachJoint.Joint.connectedAnchor);\u003Cbr\u003EattachJoint.Joint.connectedAnchor = Vector3.zero;\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever when attached radially, this falls apart and the direction of rotation is completely off. I suspect I ran into the same roadblock as you did on this front.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy working theory (correct me if I am wrong) is that all of the IR code is expecting a joint that is normalized to the orientation of the parent part as occured in the past when a new joint was created. So when the new joint was created, it\u0027s local transform was remained zero relative to the new parent. However when I modify the existing joint into an IR joint, the transform remains as is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe issue here is you can\u0027t just zero out the transform of the existing joint because the attached parts will transform as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I\u0027m planning to try tonight is to clear the joint transform and then apply the negative of that transform to the attached parts (hopefully returning them to where they belong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts?
