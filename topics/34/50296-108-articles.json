The new settings panel is going to be very minimalistic. Three difficulty buttons, a radio button for legacy aerothermodynamics... and I\u0027ll probably add a button in as a shortcut for the debug menu.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd as you might or might not know, whenever changes are made in the debug menu it creates a custom.cfg file. The new update will still do that except that it will add three groups of settings corresponding to the difficulty names (except that Normal is labeled as Default in the config file for compatibility). The difference is that debug menu changes made when you have a given difficulty set will result in changes to that difficulty\u0027s config node. Those use the :FINAL directive and it would be easy enough to create and distribute \u0027Realism\u0027 configs which ideally would use :BEFORE or :AFTER for third party distributions or :FOR[DeadlyReentry] for DRE official releases. It\u0027s all designed to stay modular which is why I\u0027m keeping the actual difficulty panel simple. If I or anyone else wants to later create something that is tweaked for realistic values then it\u0027s pretty easy to do so. For example, if RedAV84(R?) wants a custom set of DRE settings for Realism Overhaul then something could be created for RO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(such configs should use anything but :FINAL for ordering which should stay reserved for the debug created custom.cfg which is created when a player makes changes to via the menu and should be considered personal tweaking)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll probably release a test version sometime tonight or tomorrow with some settings combining my arbitrary choices with any usable feedback (i.e. hard numbers) from the forums.
