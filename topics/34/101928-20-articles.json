Why? Is it realistic?\n\u003E Yes, it is. For instance, assume a sub-assembly is a folding rover. A KIS container would store the entire rover. Upon landing, the kerbal would remove and deploy it.\n\u003E \n\u003E This is the exact same scenario as the Apollo Lunar Excursion Module. The rover was folded into a container under the LEM and removed by the astronauts.\n\u003E \n\u003E I realize that sub-assemblies are a different ball of wax vice just simple parts. So, if you could look at that for vers. 1.2 or so, that would be super.\n\nDude, you\u0027re badly missing the [**Hangar**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/88933-0-90-0-Hangar-v2-3-1) mod, it does exactly what you described and even better.\n\n![vWlM9vWl.png](http://i.imgur.com/vWlM9vWl.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-24T10:24:34Z\u0022 title=\u002204/24/2015 10:24  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Enceos**"},{"CreatedByName":"Apollo13","CreatedById":74572,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T12:44:20Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Dude, you\u0027re badly missing the [**Hangar**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/88933-0-90-0-Hangar-v2-3-1) mod, it does exactly what you described and even better.\n\nThat Lander Hangar is exactly the functionality I\u0027m looking for.

Kerbal would simply drag-and-drop rover to planet/moon surface from KIS as is done now with parts.\n\nAs a work-around, I\u0027ll make a \u0022special\u0022 rover hangar with 0 volume and 0 mass which can contain a rover of any mass and volume(configured in hangar part.cfg). I\u0027ll put a rover into it. Then put the hangar into the 20,000L KIS container. Thus, the volume and mass of the hangar will be equal to the volume and mass of the rover it contains. To deploy, remove hangar from container. Open hangar. Deploy rover from hangar. If need be, I can import the rover hangar .MU file into Blender and create a very small hangar which can contain a rover of any size.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-24T19:02:40Z\u0022 title=\u002204/24/2015 07:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Apollo13**"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T16:44:26Z","Content":"As for storing the hangar itself in a container, I don\u0027t know how the container deals with variable size parts (like in tweakscale), but those hangars can get BIG, you\u0027d need a cargohold sized container to hold those.\n\nReally though, neither one forces you to make a choice, you can either do it with the hangar or construct on site with KAS.

Of course, that means the smaller container can hold only 340L vice 1000L. Also, reduced number of items by half as well. (Yeah, I know, should be eight items, not 12. So, sue me...LOL)\n\nSecond, IRL, the container would not stick out of the side. So, I used the editor translation tool to embed the containerMount and container into the fuel tank (removing fuel to make room, of course).\n\n![DGIenmU.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/DGIenmU.jpg)\n\nOh, the things we\u0027ll al do with v1.1... For instance, 20,000L may be too large for some purposes. I plan to import the 20,000L MU file into Blender and cut it in half to create a 10,000L version. Need to convert the MBM files to PNG as well. Already working on an animated version of the current container. This stuff is for my own use only. Tis bad kharma to distro it without permission from KospY.\n\nSidebar: Kerbals can have 300L when in the vessel. For my gameplay purposes, the most a Kerbal can hold in a vessel is a wrench or screwdriver. He can have full 300L only when he pulls an item from a container while on EVA.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-25T05:20:14Z\u0022 title=\u002204/25/2015 05:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Apollo13**"},{"CreatedByName":"pip12345","CreatedById":18407,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T20:09:36Z","Content":"Any ETA on when this will be available for 1.0?"},{"CreatedByName":"LORDPrometheus","CreatedById":61414,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T20:15:08Z","Content":"So....

Right-click on the command module, and you can load upto 300 liters of stuff into the capsule per Kerbal.
