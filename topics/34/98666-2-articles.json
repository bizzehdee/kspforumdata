I mentioned 0.6.6 in the release notes, but I didn\u0027t make it super clear that it was a required update - I\u0027ll make sure to do that in future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat being said, I think there is a pretty good chance that your saves will be unbroken just by upgrading Contract Configurator - so please do give that a try and let me know! It *may* be that you need to cancel the Jool monolith contract and re-accept it to get the monolith to show up... not 100% sure, but we can deal with that if it\u0027s an issue. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spheniscine","CreatedById":125755,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-11T07:31:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAwr just my luck; when I recompleted the Mun monolith contract I got a contract to explore Pol instead (which cannot be declined).
