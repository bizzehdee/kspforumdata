Did not get a response to the email I sent out Monday. A whois check of the domain returns a status code that is listed on the ICANN website as an \u0022uncommon status that is usually enacted during legal disputes or when your domain is subject to deletion\u0022. So I\u0027m guessing the author has been failing to pay his server fees and GoDaddy shut it down. The domain itself isn\u0027t set to expire until next year so there\u0027s nothing I can do about that right now. Today I even went so far as to try calling the phone number registered to the domain and left a message - the voicemail was a generic mailbox that did not identify the recipient so I don\u0027t know if that message actually reached the author. I know the author\u0027s full name and location but was unable to turn up any obits, arrests or other news stories.

In other words, you need to constantly check the height between current node and the next neighbour you are calculating the A* values for, this way if the height change is above some number you know that you are falling into a slope or rising it depending on the sign of the number, but... this won\u0027t be accurate, simply because at the same time you may want to check the slope angle at the current node\u0027s position AND at the neighbour node. All in all, if you want to do this type of navigation, normally in unity I would suggest navigation meshes, but considering that there is no ability to build nav mesh for ksp maps, I think A* with the additions I told you, or teta* (maybe) can be used. Problem is, the accuracy of the map you would use for the height definition between nodes (maybe each pixel could be used as a node but still the accuracy would differ based on the resolution)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-07T15:41:16Z\u0022 title=\u002210/07/2016 03:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 7, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Jiraiyah\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Drew Kerman","CreatedById":103177,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-08T02:30:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222791886\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002223154\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221475850819\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022101780\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MAFman\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n11 hours ago, MAFman said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbalMaps is up again!!!\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kerbalmaps.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.kerbalmaps.com/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSure you weren\u0027t just seeing a cached version?
