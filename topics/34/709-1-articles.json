Cobbling these together with a little leftover aluminium, the Space Division Kerbos knocked together a radially-mounting parachute-arm, in an attempt to get more stuff back in fewer peices than normal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot only does this arm allow you to attach parachutes to stacked modules, but it also holds the parachute (and cables) away from the module it\\\u0027s supporting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003ETG-175 Liquid Engine\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF0000;\u0022\u003E*new*\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb\\\u0027s heavy use of the throttle required a bit of a rethink in mid/upper-stage engine design, as he had a habit of overheating the engines and using up all available fuel. The Space Division at Eclypse (Ltd) came up with the TG-175. The TG-175 is, in many way, an improvement over the TG-150 - especially considering the TG-175 actually got off the ground. Though producing less thrust than the LV-T30, the TG-175 is lighter, more fuel-economical and capable of withstanding higher temperatures, so it will keep Jeb happy. \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ice","CreatedById":2601,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-19T20:41:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELooks good, but what use does it have in the game?
