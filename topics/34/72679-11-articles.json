That would be a much more severe problem.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis, I believe, is directly related to the issue regarding getting 0 science data from the SCANSat. Since I never get science data from the sensor, I have nothing to transmit. Since I cannot transmit, I can scan a body and create the map, but I cannot \u0027save\u0027 the map. Example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI send up Surveyor I to map Mun so I can choose a suitable landing site for Apollo I. Surveyor I completely maps Mun and is deorbited. (I believe due to the fact that I cannot transmit the science data) If I then send Apollo I (with the necessary SCANSat hardware) to Mun, when it enters Mun SOI, I will have no mapped area of Mun. Meaning, Mun will say 0% scanned, even though Surveyor I already scanned it to 100%.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe it was an \u0027unintended feature\u0027, but previously (before the v6 and 0.23.5 updates for SCANSat and KSP respectively) I could do the above, and (seemingly since I could transmit the data back to KSC) if I sent another craft to the same body\u0027s orbit, I would be able to see the map of the body and where my craft currently was in orbit above the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this manner, as it runs right now in my KSP, if I want to have Mun (for instance) mapped 100% so I can choose a specific landing spot before attempting said landing, I must create a craft which is capable of scanning Mun 100% (basically capable of starting in a polar orbit, slowly transitioning to an equatorial orbit to ensure scanning of the entire surface), and THEN capable of landing on the Mun also.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL;DR: If I want to use a map for landing, I have to either leave the vessel which did the mapping in orbit (assuming here, I haven\u0027t actually tested this, but I believe that I would see the map in this case), or I would need to map the body first with the vessel I will be landing, then land it. Used to be that once I had \u0027transmitted\u0027 that map back to KSC, every subsequently launched craft would see that map, provided it had the necessary hardware of course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhew, sorry if that seemed pedantic, but as a software engineer myself, I can\u0027t stand bug reports which are completely vague and devoid of any actually useful information/test results.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-07T21:25:24Z\u0022 title=\u002207/07/2014 09:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 7, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by DoomHawk\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DMagic","CreatedById":57416,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-07T21:36:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMap persistence is not at all reliant on data transmission.

There is a need for a non-scanning SCANsat module in some cases (getting RPM to work without SCANsatRPM), but that doesn\u0027t need to be visible to the user in any meaningful way, the buttons can easily be removed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith what sounds like a stock toolbar being available in the next update (does anyone know about this for sure?) I don\u0027t see any real reason to keep supporting non-toolbar versions of SCANsat.

As K3 said, we don\u0027t know the extent of the moddability of the stock toolbar yet, best to wait and see. Also, blizzy has said he\u0027s part of the experimentals team and if he wasn\u0027t willing to develop Toolbar any more, he\u0027d have said a while ago. I assume this means that the stock toolbar and blizzys Toolbar differ slightly so I say still support the Toolbar version until you find out if you can mod the toolbar or not.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RayneCloud","CreatedById":11227,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-15T08:01:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother one of my fave\u0027s still up and running, yay!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"moridinbg","CreatedById":115207,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-15T16:17:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think it should be good to include a note in the docs that if you install the mod and already have a career in progress, the parts that need technologies you have already discovered before installing the mod, won\u0027t be available unless you manually edit your (backed up) save file.
