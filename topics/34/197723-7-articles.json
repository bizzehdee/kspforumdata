I also\u00A0went down a fascinating rabbit hole when I started wondering where to put the antimatter and how much of it. And I mean it truly is an interesting question, like, as most people do I used to think that in the real solar system you\u0027d find the most antimatter near Jupiter, where the planet\u0027s super strong magnetic field would magically turn sunbeams into antimatter, but turns out, that is probably wrong. Specialists guess that you\u0027d actually find more antimatter very close to Saturn, precisely because Saturn has a very weak magnetic field and that this would let more high energy solar particles interact with the exosphere and upper atmosphere, which is what causes antimatter to actually get formed. But turns out you can still find good quantities of antimatter near Jupiter, more specifically near Io, where ejected particles from that hellish volcanic moon are caught within Jupiter\u0027s Van Allen belts and all kinds of interesting things happen to them (interesting meaning probably\u00A0lethal for humans if exposed). But keep in mind that some of that is\u00A0speculation, enlightened guesses and scientific predictions, because of course we don\u0027t get many occasions to send orbiters with antimatter detectors near these gas giants.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo then I had to translate that in terms of GPP and keep it balanced and interesting for gameplay.\u00A0So there are three gas giants... Otho is in my opinion the most boring one, because its moons although pretty are nothing to write home about. I initially thought I should put not that much antimatter there because it is also the easiest one to go to and usually the first one you visit. But on the other hand having antimatter there would perhaps give you a reason to go there at least a couple times, make it overall less boring. So I\u0027m undecided.\u00A0Gauss is supposed to have the strongest magnetic field, so that would probably mean less antimatter there... But wait... there\u0027s Catullus. A big old semi-gas giant with a super THICC atmosphere, and then presumably some sort of exosphere, that orbits Gauss presumably outside of its magnetosphere. Meaning lots of antimatter just above Catullus\u0027 atmosphere could be interesting? And then there\u0027s Nero, which is like the super pretty and badass one and it has lots of interesting moons, I guess players will want to spend lots of time there, and it\u0027s the furthest one, so in terms of gameplay it would certainly make sense to have usable quantities of antimatter there, but more or less than near Catullus I don\u0027t really know. So yeah antimatter is a bit of a rabbit hole. Other resources are a bit easier to deal with usually, if you\u0027re having doubts about what resources should be present where, you can always check the GPP configs for Community Resource Pack which are in your GPP folder, and if needed also check the stock solar system configs for Space Dust and Community Resource Pack just to see how both mods handle resource concentrations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs to how to do it, it\u0027s as simple as creating new text files in your gamedata folder, changing their .txt extension to\u00A0.cfg so that KSP takes them into account, and writing stuff in them.\u00A0You can use \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/v8ym3qks0hu1h9b/Antimatter.cfg?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis file\u003C/a\u003E as an example\u00A0(it however needs some changes, the concentration values are not ideal).
