We do not have the original .dae models and the Squad made a rather stupid decision of making .mu files write-only. That means that unless somebody writes a custom exporter, we cannot modify RCS placement nor the OMS behavior. Plugins, 0.21 RCS update and some node trickery can help, but it\u0027ll never be as good as a new Shuttle made from scratch. The Shuttle, despite it\u0027s flaws, could be released now, since as far as I know, we fixed all we could fix. I\u0027ve already tried balancing it, while it worked (more or less) for the OMS, the RCS placement is unworkable in KSP, since you can\u0027t adjust it on a per-nozzle bases, nor assign nozzles to particular type of motion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and Kosmo-Not\u0027s shuttle is stock, ugly, dinky and has no payload bay. In other words, not really good for anything. In fact, if we had folding wings, it could fit into CSS cargo bay.
