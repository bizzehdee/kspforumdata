But KSPI also brings in parts that require so much power input (Alcubierre drive, for example) that they have a purpose. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a \u003Cem\u003Estand alone\u003C/em\u003E part, 250 Ec/sec \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E surface to orbit levels of thrust is pretty OP. Now if it\u0027s being designed to be used with the KSPI or NFP packs then it gets better... but still on the high side for a part that performs multiple functions IMO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[Edit] just saw the last reply.
