Previous to today (Last 12 hours as of this writing) I\u0027d played in C# by debugging some other code for probably a maximum of 5 hours in total, and what I did was mostly \u0022good guesses\u0022. Tonight is by FAR the longest I\u0027ve spent looking at ANYTHING C#. The last time I touched anything that resembled C anything (Standard, \u002B, \u002B\u002B) was over 15 years ago, probably closer to 20 now. I\u0027m by no means anything of a professional at coding in this language as I\u0027m still learning the nuances of this language, but once I understand the language construct, and what code does what when and where, then reading the code is second nature right after I go further to try understand how the author actually writes their code. Knowing what the language does is one thing, but how the author uses and writes the code is another. With the help of Kethane, SubAssemblyLoader, and ActionsOnTheFly, I\u0027m getting the gist of what is going on, and I look forward to tearing into MechJeb, and writing a small mod of my own ground up. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E I\u0027ll also say that these three mods written by three different authors all have given three very different coding styles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;/offtopic\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENon-Technical:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs the Kethane code sits as of about 12 hours ago, (Specifically in KethaneDetector.cs) if you\u0027re running multiple ships within the same Physics Area Of Effect (Henceforth PAOE), then yes, I\u0027ll grant you that you get better scans, but not for the reasons, or for the mechanics, you\u0027re implying in regards to multiple scanners on a single ship. Throwing more than one scanner onto one ship doesn\u0027t do anything more at any speed, 1x or otherwise, other than report back how much Kethane is at that geographical location. If you have 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, or 512 on a single ship, the call to update the map is done either once for all ships in the PAOE regardless of the number of scanners equipped per ship, \u003Cstrong\u003Eor\u003C/strong\u003E, once for as many scanners on the ships at that exact location at that time. Regardless of how many scanners you have, you\u0027re only in ONE location at each video or physics frame of time. The code specifically looks at the ships current long/lat. The code doesn\u0027t adjust left, right, forward or back by any degree. If you have a trailing ship, that ships scanner may update the map on your screen based on its own location if its in the same AOE, and that COULD give a different pixel. So yes, having a scanner on \u003Cem\u003Emultiple ships\u003C/em\u003E within the PAOE might indeed update your map faster, depending on the differences in distance at that time, but going the other way and having multiple scanners on one ship in the PAOE will absolutely not provide any additional information.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETechnical:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[[Just to keep things a bit clear, I\u0027ll bold Unity\u0027 update routines.]]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnity fires two events that are relevant to this discussion. The first is called \u003Cstrong\u003EUpdate\u003C/strong\u003E. This is called every frame update, and then there is the \u003Cstrong\u003EFixedUpdate \u003C/strong\u003Ewhich is called every physics update. These two events fire at two very different times for very different reasons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe physical map updates are done during the unity event \u003Cstrong\u003EFixedUpdate\u003C/strong\u003E, which is \u0022...called once every physics time step.\u0022 -- \u003Ca href=\u0022http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/index.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/index.html\u003C/a\u003E -- Since physics \u0027is kind of\u0027 turned off during normal time acceleration, \u003Cstrong\u003EFixedUpdate \u003C/strong\u003Eprobably gets called right after \u003Cstrong\u003EUpdate\u003C/strong\u003E. This mods \u003Cstrong\u003EUpdate \u003C/strong\u003Eroutine looks to be just updating the physical location of the \u0022You are here\u0022 icon. Both of these events are called at some point, yes, but in which order, I\u0027m not certain at this point, and I don\u0027t think it really matters. How things are handled under PHYSICAL acceleration could be a different story, but I don\u0027t think you hit 100x under Physical anyways, but then again, I wouldn\u0027t want to really since normal time acceleration yields the same results with less risk.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the situation with multiple scanners within the PAOE, I\u0027m not sure how its handled as of yet. I know multiple MechJebs can do their automation work at the same time so long they\u0027re within the same PAOE at 1x. If these scanners work on the same kind of principals as MechJeb I would like to assume that there is one map for the orbiting body, and all scanners just make a call to the proper \u0027object\u0027 that is holding onto that map, and updates the map by drawing the appropriate pixel in memory, there by updating the map you see on screen if it is shown.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs soon as I figure out how to write out log files (Which won\u0027t be hard I\u0027m sure, I\u0027ve just never done it in C#) I\u0027ll throw some debugging routines in it, have it write out an entry in a log file for each event, and I can tell you exactly what happens when and how often.

The key here is that detectors don\u0027t talk to each other, so they won\u0027t take turns; they\u0027ll just all work individually, and if two detectors happen to scan the same space, oh well. So, if you want to increase scan resolution, you should stagger your detectors rather than starting them all with an action group. Alternatively, you could run both detector types; since they have different scan rates, most of the time they\u0027ll miss each other.

This should automatically push detectors out of phase, on average.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s also worth mentioning that battery capacity is important for scanning at time warp. The small detector uses 0.9 energy per second, or 0.03 per frame (assuming 30 physics FPS). As long as you have 0.03 energy available to draw, the detector will run at full speed. However, if you run at 1000x time warp, the detector now requires 30 energy per frame, and a small probe may not have that capacity. If you use RTGs, it\u0027s even worse, because they erroneously use the Update routine (graphics frame) instead of FixedUpdate, so its electrical generation isn\u0027t synchronized with consumption. (This is why RTG generation seems bursty.) So, if you have 45 capacity and there are six physics frames between each graphics frame, the small detector will run at full speed for one frame, half speed for the next, and then \u003Cem\u003Enot at all\u003C/em\u003E for the next four frames.
