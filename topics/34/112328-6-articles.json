You could make a copy of the parts with **NO** internal model defined and it would work. The code will work with any part that has a deep freezer partmodule defined and no internal model. This is because the code does expect if there is an internal model that there are pods for each seat defined. But it also handles and supports NO internal model and any seat config for that.\n\nit seems everyone wants a 4 or 6 kerbal part?

Is this what you are experiencing? If you try to attach to the doors it will not but instead roll around the shape some distance from the part. You can radially attach parts to the sides and the rear, anywhere except the doors. I will look at whether I can allow radial attachment to the doors if you don\u0027t have RPM installed in the next version but if you have RPM installed you can\u0027t radially attach to the doors because the doors open and close.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-24T07:06:02Z\u0022 title=\u002208/24/2015 07:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by JPLRepo**"}]}
