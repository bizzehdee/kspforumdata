The solution is actually very simple. You\u0027ve built your ship parts with a mass which is 1/10000 of real life stuff - needed for 1.0.4, terrible for 1.0.5. I\u0027ve just built \u0026 tested a cargo ship and see the problems, I predict they can be solved with less than a days work.\n\nMass increase to more realistic levels. The ships should be in the water no longer bouncing off.  \n\nCrash tolerance, breaking force \u0026 torque need to be set to correspond with mass.  \n\nEvery hull part should get a buoyancy parameter.  \n\nMaybe a CoM adjustment to improve or even decrease stability.\n\nExample: the cargo ship I built.![SVIGH6u.png](http://i.imgur.com/SVIGH6u.png)\n\nOriginal mass: 5 tons.

You didn\u0027t go through anything unique. I spent 25 years riding that rollercoaster. It\u0027s where developers doing creative work live. Though I admit it\u0027s been so long I can\u0027t specifically remember my first time anymore.\n\nThe lesson you need to take away from this experience is you perhaps aren\u0027t meant to be a developer. That\u0027s not intended as an insult; simply a statement of fact that you don\u0027t have the temperament for this role just like I don\u0027t have the temperament to be an investment banker or basketball player. I\u0027m just not competitive enough for those jobs.\n\nOnce, IBM changed the way my mainframe\u0027s CPU executed a particular instruction via a maintenance patch to the microcode, and they didn\u0027t document that either. Took six weeks of constant crashes of our 24x7 hospital admission system to find the problem, and then 5 minutes to fix. IBM even flew two of the CPU\u0027s chief engineers to our site from NY for the last couple of weeks. Cost my employer $30k-$50k in downtime alone, and cost me six straight 80-hour weeks with no overtime pay.\n\nI\u0027ve been through similar problems thanks to \u0022undocumented changes\u0022 by Microsoft, Oracle, Sun, and dozens of smaller companies you never heard of. It\u0027s part of why developers burn out sometimes and retire to a cabin in Maine. It\u0027s usually not that the company sloppily forgot to document something. It\u0027s because they had no idea I was using that particular mix of features in that particular way, probably had no idea it was even possible, and since that condition wasn\u0027t tested during QA the vendor didn\u0027t know it had changed.\n\nIn other words, please try not to blame Squad for a problem that\u0027s endemic to the whole damned software industry. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\nSo, yeah, give the code away and pick a new hobby. Have you considered a cabin in Maine? Or how about a sailboat? For a decade I had a fantasy about buying a sailboat and just cruising the world, getting as far away from computers as possible. Had a big stack of books about it, and spent hours evaluating different equipment and outfitting my non-existent boat. \n\nI do understand, and sympathize.

And when it does work this way, it can be, and should be, subject to criticism.  \n\nAs a developer, you would be entirely correct to be frustrated at the lack of a supported API, the lack of documentation on such an API if it existed, and the lack of documentation on changes to such an API. Being frustrated by this tells me that you understand good software development principles, or at the very least understand the frustrations that arise when such principles are not followed, even if you don\u0027t know the specifics of technical phrases like \u0022Separation of Concerns\u0022, \u0022Interface abstraction\u0022, \u0022inversion of control\u0022, \u0022dependency injection\u0022, and so on - although I suspect you might.
