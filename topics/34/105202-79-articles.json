It\u0027s one thing to walk 100m to take a nap.  It\u0027s quite another to walk 2KM.  Without rovers or logistics parts (in which it\u0027s inferred there are bit for moving things arond), resources also have a pretty short range (as does maintenance, and a few others.\n\u003E \n\nI am very pleased to find it working as designed. The Mk II/V off-world habitation studies station on Minmus is now in place and kerballed (crew of three). Three structures, Command Pilot, Mining Engineer and the Bio Scientist buildings. There is an unmanned warehouse consisting of a few Kontainers behind the camera position along with the crew return lander. The site has good substrates, gypsum and hydrates and looks like it will have no shortage of supplies for a lot longer than Homesickness (1y 195d) and Habitation (1y 215d - the same in all 3 structures ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022) ) will allow. The base could possibly benefit from another Engineer (to occupy a workshop seat) and another Scientist (for the Mk V Com-Lab) bringing the total crew complement up to 5. Extra resources dug up and sifted out should soon begin contributing to planetary logistics. This model is now the blueprint for further exploration on distant planets (passing mid techtree point in career mode game) including heavier Mk III versions. The now recycled skycrane delivery systems (4 landings for what you can see) all demonstrated capability to land nearly anywhere, not just on \u0022easy\u0022 Minmus. Actually, I had to roll (modular wheels) some elements over a kilometer into position and the low Minmus gravity was a real disadvantage for that. The agency is considering abandoning an earlier alpha test base on the Mun on account of it being an ill-conceived, ugly beehive and a downright hazardous and inefficient KAS pipe infested mess.\n\n![oO1qmjR.png](http://i.imgur.com/oO1qmjR.png)\n\n[@RoverDude](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/105198-roverdude/) Awesome!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-16T13:14:06Z\u0022 title=\u002203/16/2016 01:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 16, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Kaa253**"},{"CreatedByName":"omelaw","CreatedById":156483,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-16T13:33:06Z","Content":"Can I assume that there won\u0027t be an update(unless there is an critical bug) for USI until 1.1 is released?\n\n1.1 enter experiment, so..\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-16T13:34:13Z\u0022 title=\u002203/16/2016 01:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 16, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by omelaw**"},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-16T15:03:22Z","Content":"That would be a very fair assumption.\n\nI will be doing pre-releases with the 1.1 public pre-release."},{"CreatedByName":"Glaran K\u0026#039;erman","CreatedById":146334,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-16T15:37:56Z","Content":"Just a quick question, are the life support tanks considered \u0022passable\u0022.
