In planes that don\u0027t specialize in carrying cargo, there are usually large areas beneath the cabin that are used for avionics systems and maintenance items, small but enough to perform maintenance or fight a fire. I may be underestimating the size of your parts, since I haven\u0027t played with them just yet, but fuel tanks aren\u0027t the only option.
