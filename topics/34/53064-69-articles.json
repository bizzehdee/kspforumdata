I typically use one ascent stage and one vacuum stage to get into orbit. For the first stage I try to go for kerosine \u002B liquid O2 and for the vacuum stage I go for liquid H2 \u002B liquid O2 because it is much lighter than other fuels and the engines are more efficient.

But if you do like i told you, you can stretch them bit more freely and it is not cheating. So, once more, when you are placed a stretchy tank on your craft, save, exit VAB, go to science building, click the last opened engine node there (nothing else), exit science building and return to VAB, now you should be able to quite freely to alter the size of the tank. Once you have placed interstage fairing or another adapter and placed next tank, repeat the above again. \u003Cp\u003EAlso, it is not necessary to use biggest engine all the time, you can always use smaller engines in clusters if that works to get twr 1.2-1.5 to launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know what you told me and I can confirm that this works, just I dont \u003Cstrong\u003Ewant\u003C/strong\u003E to abuse a bug.

This is no rant over the tanks any more as the argument is settled. I just wanted to point out, if I take a stronger first stage engine, I would need more fuel tanks to balance the rocket which means making it rather tall. A higher diameter is very welcome, thx Nathan. And yes, your suggestion of 3-5-8-12-infty seems to be quite reasonable. Maybe adjust the minimal diameter for conic fuel tanks as well, so it is easier to build sounding rockets when your probe core is only 150mm across at its base ;-)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESemmel\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-22T00:58:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESorry, thought it\u0027d go without saying that minimum diameter will be 1cm. :]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn your case I would suggest a *much* larger second stage.

I wouldn\u0027t have needed the boosters either because the liquid hydrogen is much lighter than the first stage kerosine. I wasnt quite sure how much dV is required to reach the vacuum though. Also, it looked more rockety to have a small second stage and a big first stage. w.r.t. the TWR of the second stage.. yes, I run the rocket at 50%-20% thrust because it was too strong. Unfortunately, its the weakest hydrolox engine I have (maybe I need to install the Russian rocket pack after all..). The 2.42 vacuum TWR were a result of the total dv needed. Maybe my design process ist quite right.. I first made the probe to be below 1T, then the second and first stage so that their proportions looked right, balancing the launch TWR to between 1.2 and 1.4. I realized that in order to get the dV needed to reach orbit, I needed more fuel, so I could either increase the first stage and use a stronger engine (didnt work out well because of fuel tanks.. hence discussion above) or using SRBs. Then, I adjusted the SRBs length to match the dV needed following by adjusting their thrust to not exceed the 1.4 launch TWR. I never really considered the dV of the first stage at SRB burnout. Your suggestion to increase the second stage and reduce the first stage in size sounds a solid solution to all the problems..

But me and Nathan are a bit butting heads to the level of simplicity we need to go to. And judging by some of the mistakes I\u0027ve read for this and other mods, it\u0027s quite traumatizing how much you have to explain things. Just asking someone to install a mod you can get varying results: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Some people don\u0027t extract the files and just shove the archive in the game data folder (if it even is in the correct folder).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Some people don\u0027t pay attention to only keep the actual mod folder, and not the archive name. IE when taking a mod from Space Port, you don\u0027t want to keep the Upload12-12-12_Modname folder. But I know some people who tried to keep it and that totally breaks any attempts to refer to the content of said mod with Module Manager. (Since some tweaks refer to specific folder names)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* And then you have post installation instructions which in some cases seem to be ignored completely. IE, ModuleRCSFX for RO. I mean there is a reason why it\u0027s not in bold red letters on Nathan\u0027s thread.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo it\u0027s not just time, but also coming to an agreement to the level of detail the instructions should include. And I\u0027m actually concerned that if you go too far on the simple level, then it\u0027ll throw moderately skilled people off and they\u0027d ignore the video and perhaps miss some of the more subtle things that the video would do good to explain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt should be noted that in the end, it\u0027s not like we are hiding details. Everything is written in the installation threads, but one must read the entire OP thread of ALL the mods. Or they will miss something.

IE, if you use PP or StretchySRB for fuel tanks, then you can definitely delete the tanks for those mods manually. That would downsize the amount of parts considerably. Same thing with fairings, if you use procedural fairings, don\u0027t need all the NP/KW fairings. As long as you make sure not to delete stuff that is being used for RPL Probes/Experiments. If you go in the parts of the RPL Tweak Pack you can check which model I use, for the most part I stuck to stock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd stuff like IR or LAZOR, I placed them in the tree as to make them optional. I\u0027m not sure if I\u0027ll use them to make experiments down the road. But those are like not even on my radar for now in terms of integrating experiments to them. See this a sort of disclaimer. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain speaking parts, anything pertaining to engines so KW, NP, the oms \u0026amp; double oms engines from the Shuttle Engines, etc. Those are rather crucial if you don\u0027t want to end up with a lack of engines/thrust at a certain tech level.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENothing stops someone to not include all the mods, but one should do so carefully and not arbitrarily. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for making RPL \u0022stock compatible\u0022, that wouldn\u0027t work considering that RPL has been heavily modeled based on Nathan\u0027s Rfts. So engine diversity/choice would be heavily restrictive. With engine sizes going up to 10M, you need a good diversity of models/sizes. Plus there are already a crazy amount of nodes, if I start put sub nodes to each node for \u0027non stock\u0027 mods it would be probably pretty hard to keep it looking decent. It\u0027s already pretty bizarrely shaped. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut let\u0027s keep in mind RPL is still in it\u0027s alpha stages to polish and such is still miles away from the final \u0027vision\u0027. I\u0027ll be working on polish and clarifying installation instructions as development moves forward. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"prc","CreatedById":108757,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-31T10:56:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MedievalNerd\u0022 data-cite=\u0022MedievalNerd\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHi prc,\u003Cp\u003EThat sounds more like a TAC issue. (Kerbals not having oxygen when exiting the capsules) And since you tested this in sandbox it\u0027s sure that RPL isn\u0027t at fault since in Sandbox you don\u0027t get the tech tree.

Found the issue actually in career mode as Jebb kinda died @orbit, then tried it again in sandbox mode. Thanx for reply. Had to ask as I had it working with MS19c version. Thus I have broken something while installing. Someone had similar issue with TAC at its own forum threads, but reinstalling TAC as instructed did not fix the issue. Will try to figure out it later.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
