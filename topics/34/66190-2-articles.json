Kipard\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Cpt. Kipard\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat KW docking port has only one ModuleDockingNode. It\u0027s nodeType is size2 meaning that, as you said, it\u0027ll dock to itself without hassle and to other 2.5 meter ports. It will not dock to a nodeType size3 docking port.\u003Cp\u003EBasically it just looks big, but technically it\u0027s a 2.5m part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022AntiMatter001\u0022 data-cite=\u0022AntiMatter001\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ealso why not make three docking nodes in the same place? wouldn\u0027t that work?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, that\u0027s how it works.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"woot","CreatedById":102873,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-01T22:43:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKW Rocketry\u0027s \u00223.75m Dual Purpose Docking Ring\u0022 can dock with both 3.75 and 2.5m ports.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-01T23:54:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah...

That\u0027s what I\u0027ve done with all the stock ports as well as the ones from several mods, like B9 and Kosmos, etc. I make all my docking ports \u0027size1\u0027, but you can actually call it anything you want, as long as you make them all the same they\u0027ll dock with each other. You could use \u0027nodeType = size947\u0027, or \u0027nodeType = Sasquatch\u0027, or even \u0027nodeType = BoogerBrain\u0027, as long as they match, it doesn\u0027t matter what the physical appearance of the part is. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust some info for everyone, I hope this helps. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBtw, I\u0027m not advising anyone to NOT download this mod, I actually think the models look pretty cool. But I, like many others, I\u0027m sure, have to be wary of the dreaded \u0027parts bloat\u0027 problem, so lately I\u0027ve been looking long and hard when a new parts mod comes out to decide if I really \u0027need\u0027 these new (extra) parts.
