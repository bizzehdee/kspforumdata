In addition the adjustment size is now automatically managed by the mod and adjusts itself to the situation. With both these enhancement in place the last aim for me was to somehow get air breathing engines with their delayed response time supported by the center thrust mode. I failed miserably and have (again) given up on it and air breathing engines now have their delay disabled while under control of this mode.

This allows you to fly unbalanced vehicles. However it only allows thrust balancing of the engines facing in one direction. This works okay for rockets but for a VTOL system like a harrier things can be more complicated since there is in general thrust in at least two directions, vertical and horizontal. You can setup the center thrust mode to balance the downwards vertical engines, which is where most often the imbalance lies, and ignore the horizontal engines and control them on a separate throttle.

This should also work the other way as you decelerate to land.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet me know how that works out for those of you who give it a try.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ED.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Voculus","CreatedById":85437,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-09T03:02:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI just discovered this mod, and I\u0027m blown away!
