A cool cinematic of the craft being rolled out of the VAB to the pad or taxiing to the runway from the SPH would be cool (skippable of course). Then you\u0027re on the launch pad as normal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach craft that has been successfully built should have a counter associated with it. Future builds should take shorter delays up to a point based on the number of prior builds. Changes to a design could decrease that counter by one each time the craft is re-saved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVehicles launched by the SPH should probably be handled different as they aren\u0027t necessarily dismantled after recovery and should be reusable with only a short delay for fueling and maintenance governed by the size and complexity of the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis likely isn\u0027t as complicated as it sounds and should be relatively transparent to the user but it would make for an interesting component.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne wonders if a mod could be made to do this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eoooooooooooohhhhhhh, a thought just occurred.

KAC is really my No.1 \u0027must have\u0027, couldn\u0027t live without.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a suggestion. Sorry in case it was already considered (but I can\u0027t find about it in this thread). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP is very nice, lots of good features and such. But for one thing, that is closely connected with time: countdown to burn time. Yes, that value that appears to the right of the Navball and down when a node exists. Problem is, it is way too small and almost not noticeable. IMHO, such an important value should be put in full evidence, at least when the focus is on the relevant ship and the time-to-burn goes below a set threshold (say, 10 sec., but could be adjustable). I believe everything needed to set an \u0027alarm\u0027 at burntime-10sec. already exists in KAC, the only thing should be to create an action when that alarm goes off, that will display the countdown in a larger font, in a set position onscreen (I would initially set it just @ the center) and a set colour (I would initially make it dark red, to differentiate from other readings and provide a sense of urgency). At burntime = 0, or shortly after in case no burn was initiated, this additional display will disappear being no more relevant. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeing nothing more than a value to be properly displayed at the correct time (already known to KAC), I am under the impression that you could very easily implement this.
