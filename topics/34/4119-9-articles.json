IF you want a bit more adaptability, you might be able to place a plate, which would allow versatility. E.G. things could be mounted side by side, and things that aren\\\u0027t meant to be put in would not turn awkwardly when placed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The part it self would be structural, like a tricoupler, it doesn\\\u0027t do anything but it allows things to attach to it. Since the collision box would be separate from the hull, you could simply make it flat. It would snap where the current mount is for the decoupler, but be very thin to not reduce the cargo space. Things could use the native mounting method where they simply place where they can, and if it is flat, they wont rotate awkwardly. You might even be able to place a tank internally, and have the extended fuel loadout that way instead of a whole separate bay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E If you do not understand what I am trying to convey, I will be reinstalling Maya later today and I can try to make something, but I haven\\\u0027t worked with it much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a side note, you can actually stack cargobay/fuelbays together on one shuttle, at the moment I have one fuel bay behind one cargo bay so I can get pretty far AND launch a sat.
