class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have a question for you guys, cause i believe i am clearly doing something wrong... i love flying planes, actually i love building them and have the autopilot fly them, at least in ksp... so this is clearly a must have... however i\u0027m having issues when trying to set up the correct approach, i also do like math, (don\u0027t know as much as i could though)... so in a few words... i spent the entire morning more or less trying to figure out my vertical speed setting to meet the correct glideslope selected on the KILS (kerbal ILS i woud say (?),) the thing is, i can\u0027t find to mathematically arrive at the actual value...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nactually i believe i did, i\u0027m not sure if the math is sound... but it seems okay and it\u0027s consistent with itself... i deviced an excel sheet in which for any given right triangle with an angle of 3\u00BA, and a given distance (base) it will calculate at what altitude i am, this in turn would allow me to via the gradient of the hipo figure out my optimal VS to meet the glideslope start to finish.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFYI i know this is me being extremely picky, i just do it for the sake of it, i don\u0027t need it really and managed to land semi automatically plenty of times, but i do like it when it goes perfectly... the problem is i arrived at a gradient that seems a bit odd, 0.052408, which given i used meteres to calculate, is my VS in m/s (i guess), i tried to plot it in a graph, and yeah, makes sense, at the end of the \u0022distance\u0022, i \u0022arrive\u0022 or the function meets the \u0022ground\u0022, however in ksp that does not work...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni tried getting some data to figure out if the slope may not be what it seems, but i get conflicting data, from practical observation, as the angles i get with every measurement are not consistent with each other, and i guess they should if all the approach is done at a said glideslope, also i took into consideration the error on the practical reading as i was reading KM instead of m, would be a case of calculating the angle for the 100 places in the decimal read just to see if any average value would pop up, it did not for the 5 measurements only 1 was sharing some part of the number that formed the angle, not and exact match\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nand alternative could be that actually the slopes are divided in which case the results could potentially make sense, however i don\u0027t think that\u0027s how they work once you enter the ILS signal, so i would be surprised if the mod was created that way\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni also tried to verify my calculations (the once on the second paragraph, and they did not work either, to verify them i used a sensible point, the beacons, 10km out of the runway header there\u0027s the outer beacon, with a 3\u00BA slope, the distance i need to have from the runway should be 524.0778 (according to my second paragraph), however at that distance i\u0027m way below the glideslope path, tested the right altitude at the outer marker and it turned out to be 675 i believe that is exactly the value when you are going thru the middle of cone the beacon transmits, so with that, let\u0027s figure out the angle/slope, which was 3.861607\u00BA, which then crosschecked at a different distance, did not match, i anyway went on and figure the VS needed to follow the slope would be 0.0675 m/s which was not haha\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nso i tried to experiment with different vs values and it seemed to my inexperienced eye that the glideslope was actually splitted for some reason, as the VS that followed the instrument was at first @10km out about -5m/s, then it goes down (up i guess) towards 2, and at the last moment, about 200 mts or so (may be closer) it jumps to about 4 or 5 again...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nonce again i may be requesting a kind of perfection that is not required whatsoever, or also i may be doing wrong calculations, or maybe i\u0027m missinterpreting the idea of G/S, however i believe i\u0027m not, if anyone wishes to go ahead and help me out, i\u0027ll be grateful, i guess the question would be:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nis there supposed to be a unique glideslope along all the approach once you enter ILS range? (i believe the answer would be yes)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nis that glideslope able to provide with math the perfect VS at which you\u0027ll hit the runway perfectly? (again, i believe it is)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nam i missinterpreting anything at all? (yep, i also believe so, but i can\u0027t figure out what)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nif you would like to see my calculations i can upload them\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:heart_eyes:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/heart_eyes.png\u0022 title=\u0022:heart_eyes:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m tempted to ask for the calculations you derived, but as the old joke goes, the reason why I went to law school is that I can\u0027t do the math (and then tax law came about and RageFace.jpg).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, both considering your disclosure that you\u0027re running an autopilot, and my own experience that I have HSI (this one), the PAPI mod,\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0one of the HUD mods that projects a flight path indicator, you raise an interesting point,\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ebut\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0we may also need to check one variable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Though please also note that I\u0027m running with 1.9.1 at the moment, but I don\u0027t think there would have been anything drastically altered by 1.11 to have changed anything between the compatible mods, would it?)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can note from experience that the HSI\u0027s 3-degree glideslope does not exactly line up with the PAPI\u0027s 3 degree setting. What would be dead-center on the HSI is 3-white on the PAPI (\u0022slightly high\u0022, but I know there is a specific slope range for that, like about 1.5 degrees I think?)\u00A0.\u00A0 On the other hand, by the time I can distinguish the PAPI I\u0027m close enough that reading both instruments would be quite sensitive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, I can also note\u00A0from a recent sweet run\u00A0 where from even before the outer marker, I managed to peg the HSI centered (glide\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0localizer, sweeet!), and planted the HUD flight path indicator dead on\u00A0 where the PAPI lights would\u00A0\u00A0cross the runway (in short, the expected touchdown point), and making sure that I can keep it there, and I observed that, for as long as I was correcting to keep the flight path indicator on the touchdown point, I was flying the HSI glideslope. And the only time I deviated was at the inner marker when I saw I wasn\u0027t managing my speed properly, I was coming in too hot, so I had to kill the throttle.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnder those conditions then, I was more or less keeping (as humanly possible) a straight line.\u00A0 If the HSI glideslope indicator wasn\u0027t dancing around, then it was reading (the mod was projecting, to be more accurate programming-wise) a straight glideslope, which is exactly what a glideslope should be.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOkay, time to dive deep into the fireworks.

Though some airports might require steeper glideslopes due to certain requirements (terrain, noise abatement), no glideslope I recall would wonk a a glideslope like the way your math is suggesting--especially considering how glideslopes IRL work (won\u0027t go into that here, but I can safely say that the airport ILS radio signals aren\u0027t designed to \u0022bend\u0022). When airfields require an approaching plane to \u0022break\u0022 their descent rate, they do so using their published approach charts which says like, until 15 miles out from the airport do not descend below 3,000 feet, which must be flown by the pilot or input into the flight management system--but not using the ILS, and not on final approach, which is what the ILS is designed to do.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAside: that sort of \u0022approach descent break\u0022 is exactly what one must be careful of on approach to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E from deorbit. I am not sure of the math either, but there is a chance that the 3-deg glideslope from the Runway will hit the mountains west of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, so you don\u0027t want to fly that path until after the mountains. I think?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, I would like to ask if you accounted for one more variable in your math and your autopilot settings:\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ehorizontal speed\u003C/em\u003E. A descent rate alone is immaterial in determining the glideslope, you also have to account for how fast you\u0027re going forward, which is what projects the otherwise vertical descent into a slope.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd this goes to your autopilot settings, as well as the equation you\u0027ve ginned up. Depending on which one you use (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, AA, etc., and I would probably want to know which one), it may or may not be controlling your ground speed at the same time as your vertical speed. Ground speed has an effect: a plane coming in hot will need to lose more altitude to hit the touchdown point than a plane going in slow, because the faster plane will get there faster and need to shed the altitude quicker. And that means faster descent rate.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, a plane is gradually shedding speed as it approaches the runway (that\u0027s the entire point!), so the descent rate would change between initial approach point and touchdown, and that has to be accounted for as well. You will notice that the vertical speed would be reducing as the plane approaches touchdown, which again is the point:\u00A0 to get you to your \u003Cs\u003Estall speed\u003C/s\u003E\u00A0EDIT: landing speed, though it should be close to but not at the stall speed, and so that upon flare, you\u0027re just arresting what is left of your descent rate to \u0022butter the bread\u0022.\u00A0 And if the rate of horizontal speed reduction is not constant, neither will the vertical speed reduction be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPilots (or their flight management systems) have to control both vertical and horizontal speeds in getting the plane to the touchdown point--and that\u0027s why there are \u0022approach speeds\u0022 in the plane manuals to help keep things predictable. As a way of getting into the mindset:\u00A0usually on Microsoft Flight Simulator, when I\u0027m flying the standard pattern in for example a Cessna 172 (FSX, that\u0027s why), turning onto final from the base leg (meaning line up and get onto the runway), I aim not to exceed 500-700 feet/minute, and I should be at least 10-15 knots from my expected touchdown speed, or at least 5-10 knots above my final approach speed as published, precisely because of the entire VS/HS speed management thing. For a Vectors-To-Final where I use the ILS (and thus the HSI), it\u0027s almost similar, but because I am not flying with a Flight Management System to command my horizontal speed (no mods for my FSX), I just look primarily at reducing my horizontal speed using the autothrottle to get to my final approach speed (as published), but let the AP manage my vertical speed, which does evolve as I change my AT speed target and thus my throttle, so that by the time I cross the fence, I am at the speed I need to be, I kill the autopilot and wait until I have to flare. But that\u0027s my thing, and actual and instructor pilots around here will probably reprimand me for it.\u00A0 (And I am open to reprimands, by the way, I am open to learning.\u00A0 Though this system works for me, \u003Cem\u003Estop nagging me, you\u0027re not my parents!!! WAAAAAAAHHHH!!!!!!1!!!!!\u003C/em\u003E)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is a way to verify this: get an autopilot to fix your ground speed instead, about 3m/s above your stall speed. Then fly the glide slope all the way down, even at that speed. All the way to disassembly-on-contact.\u00A0\u00A0See if the vertical speed (measured independently, e.g., use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s info panels) changes so drastically as suggested by the math. Do note it will still fluctuate because the two ways an autopilot can change ground speed on landing are throttle\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eand pitch\u003C/em\u003E, and pitch changes will\u00A0\u00A0naturally affect vertical speed, and I don\u0027t know if or which KSP autopilots are configured to do both. (Seems like Atmo Auto does so, but I\u0027m not sure, while I observe \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E just brute-forces with the throttle). But it should otherwise be predictably constant.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdditional contextual information: In fact, at the landing attitude, both throttle and pitch will affect both VS and HS to varying degrees. I remember the manual from\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EJane\u0027s USNF\u003C/em\u003E, suggesting practice exercises for carrier landings,\u00A0and the same exercises I also found in an ultralight manual, and the same is suggested in some FSX tutorials,\u00A0in landing attitude, you\u0027ll primarily be using pitch\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eto control airspeed\u003C/em\u003E, and throttle\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eto control altitude\u003C/em\u003E. But, as the F/A-18 carrier missions in FSX and the infamous Top Gun for the NES Landing Sequence will show, you may end up playing with throttle as you pitch, and pitch as you throttle, to get to your speed and altitude gates for landing. Land pilots, well, they don\u0027t really have it easier, but the primary education is to be really at specific speeds and altitudes at certain points in their approach--hence my entire \u0022where am I as a plane on the turn to final\u0022 thing up there, that was because of the FSX tutorials. It\u0027s an easier mindset to grapple with than pegging your VS to a certain \u0022ideal\u0022 number. Better to think in terms of Velocities Never To Exceed (or shoot under).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd this is why Flight Management Systems are a thing for commercial airliners, and why landing is a constant drill for pilots.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTL;DR: A glideslope simply points the plane to the touchdown point, and the ideal rate at which the plane must shed its altitude. The speed at which it does so however is another thing entirely, because it depends on controlling the horizontal speed as well, which by its nature must change until touchdown. Thus the vertical speed is not a fixed number unless the horizontal speed is a fixed number.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPS: Also, if you\u0027re using the VS indicator\u0027s needle swings\u00A0in KSP to observe how dramatic the change of VS is, I recall from somewhere that the VS indicator is logarithmic, meaning that the further it goes the more it reflects larger rates. So it is not reliable to establish rate of change of VS across a wide range. Stick to just using the middle 1/3rd or 1/4th of the entire thing.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n***************\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdditional Edit: I noticed in your post above yours that you have AA. \u00A0There was an older mod here somewhere that actually made for a real FMS/landing autopilot, because it allowed you to set the altitude and speed targets for the outer, middle, inner, and TD markers. So the only thing left to do was to figure out what speeds you wanted, and what the target altitudes were at the O-M-I-TD (TD being the runway altitude, of course).\u00A0 And again, that means varying, \u003Cem\u003Ebut otherwise constantly reducing \u003C/em\u003E(so as long as the groundspeed/indicated airspeed was reducing as well), VS across the approach.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-04-06T07:30:59Z\u0022 title=\u002204/06/2021 07:30  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EApril 6, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by B-STRK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GabeTeuton","CreatedById":116756,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-04-06T09:38:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223949813\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022162967\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221617685440\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022126119\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022B-STRK\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 hours ago, B-STRK said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m tempted to ask for the calculations you derived, but as the old joke goes, the reason why I went to law school is that I can\u0027t do the math (and then tax law came about and RageFace.jpg).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, both considering your disclosure that you\u0027re running an autopilot, and my own experience that I have HSI (this one), the PAPI mod,\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0one of the HUD mods that projects a flight path indicator, you raise an interesting point,\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ebut\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0we may also need to check one variable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Though please also note that I\u0027m running with 1.9.1 at the moment, but I don\u0027t think there would have been anything drastically altered by 1.11 to have changed anything between the compatible mods, would it?)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can note from experience that the HSI\u0027s 3-degree glideslope does not exactly line up with the PAPI\u0027s 3 degree setting.

Though some airports might require steeper glideslopes due to certain requirements (terrain, noise abatement), no glideslope I recall would wonk a a glideslope like the way your math is suggesting--especially considering how glideslopes IRL work (won\u0027t go into that here, but I can safely say that the airport ILS radio signals aren\u0027t designed to \u0022bend\u0022). When airfields require an approaching plane to \u0022break\u0022 their descent rate, they do so using their published approach charts which says like, until 15 miles out from the airport do not descend below 3,000 feet, which must be flown by the pilot or input into the flight management system--but not using the ILS, and not on final approach, which is what the ILS is designed to do.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAside: that sort of \u0022approach descent break\u0022 is exactly what one must be careful of on approach to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E from deorbit. I am not sure of the math either, but there is a chance that the 3-deg glideslope from the Runway will hit the mountains west of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, so you don\u0027t want to fly that path until after the mountains. I think?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, I would like to ask if you accounted for one more variable in your math and your autopilot settings:\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ehorizontal speed\u003C/em\u003E. A descent rate alone is immaterial in determining the glideslope, you also have to account for how fast you\u0027re going forward, which is what projects the otherwise vertical descent into a slope.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd this goes to your autopilot settings, as well as the equation you\u0027ve ginned up. Depending on which one you use (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, AA, etc., and I would probably want to know which one), it may or may not be controlling your ground speed at the same time as your vertical speed. Ground speed has an effect: a plane coming in hot will need to lose more altitude to hit the touchdown point than a plane going in slow, because the faster plane will get there faster and need to shed the altitude quicker. And that means faster descent rate.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, a plane is gradually shedding speed as it approaches the runway (that\u0027s the entire point!), so the descent rate would change between initial approach point and touchdown, and that has to be accounted for as well. You will notice that the vertical speed would be reducing as the plane approaches touchdown, which again is the point:\u00A0 to get you to your \u003Cs\u003Estall speed\u003C/s\u003E\u00A0EDIT: landing speed, though it should be close to but not at the stall speed, and so that upon flare, you\u0027re just arresting what is left of your descent rate to \u0022butter the bread\u0022.\u00A0 And if the rate of horizontal speed reduction is not constant, neither will the vertical speed reduction be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPilots (or their flight management systems) have to control both vertical and horizontal speeds in getting the plane to the touchdown point--and that\u0027s why there are \u0022approach speeds\u0022 in the plane manuals to help keep things predictable. As a way of getting into the mindset:\u00A0usually on Microsoft Flight Simulator, when I\u0027m flying the standard pattern in for example a Cessna 172 (FSX, that\u0027s why), turning onto final from the base leg (meaning line up and get onto the runway), I aim not to exceed 500-700 feet/minute, and I should be at least 10-15 knots from my expected touchdown speed, or at least 5-10 knots above my final approach speed as published, precisely because of the entire VS/HS speed management thing. For a Vectors-To-Final where I use the ILS (and thus the HSI), it\u0027s almost similar, but because I am not flying with a Flight Management System to command my horizontal speed (no mods for my FSX), I just look primarily at reducing my horizontal speed using the autothrottle to get to my final approach speed (as published), but let the AP manage my vertical speed, which does evolve as I change my AT speed target and thus my throttle, so that by the time I cross the fence, I am at the speed I need to be, I kill the autopilot and wait until I have to flare. But that\u0027s my thing, and actual and instructor pilots around here will probably reprimand me for it.\u00A0 (And I am open to reprimands, by the way, I am open to learning.\u00A0 Though this system works for me, \u003Cem\u003Estop nagging me, you\u0027re not my parents!!! WAAAAAAAHHHH!!!!!!1!!!!!\u003C/em\u003E)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is a way to verify this: get an autopilot to fix your ground speed instead, about 3m/s above your stall speed. Then fly the glide slope all the way down, even at that speed. All the way to disassembly-on-contact.\u00A0\u00A0See if the vertical speed (measured independently, e.g., use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s info panels) changes so drastically as suggested by the math. Do note it will still fluctuate because the two ways an autopilot can change ground speed on landing are throttle\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eand pitch\u003C/em\u003E, and pitch changes will\u00A0\u00A0naturally affect vertical speed, and I don\u0027t know if or which KSP autopilots are configured to do both. (Seems like Atmo Auto does so, but I\u0027m not sure, while I observe \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E just brute-forces with the throttle). But it should otherwise be predictably constant.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdditional contextual information: In fact, at the landing attitude, both throttle and pitch will affect both VS and HS to varying degrees. I remember the manual from\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EJane\u0027s USNF\u003C/em\u003E, suggesting practice exercises for carrier landings,\u00A0and the same exercises I also found in an ultralight manual, and the same is suggested in some FSX tutorials,\u00A0in landing attitude, you\u0027ll primarily be using pitch\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eto control airspeed\u003C/em\u003E, and throttle\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eto control altitude\u003C/em\u003E. But, as the F/A-18 carrier missions in FSX and the infamous Top Gun for the NES Landing Sequence will show, you may end up playing with throttle as you pitch, and pitch as you throttle, to get to your speed and altitude gates for landing. Land pilots, well, they don\u0027t really have it easier, but the primary education is to be really at specific speeds and altitudes at certain points in their approach--hence my entire \u0022where am I as a plane on the turn to final\u0022 thing up there, that was because of the FSX tutorials. It\u0027s an easier mindset to grapple with than pegging your VS to a certain \u0022ideal\u0022 number. Better to think in terms of Velocities Never To Exceed (or shoot under).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd this is why Flight Management Systems are a thing for commercial airliners, and why landing is a constant drill for pilots.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTL;DR: A glideslope simply points the plane to the touchdown point, and the ideal rate at which the plane must shed its altitude. The speed at which it does so however is another thing entirely, because it depends on controlling the horizontal speed as well, which by its nature must change until touchdown. Thus the vertical speed is not a fixed number unless the horizontal speed is a fixed number.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPS: Also, if you\u0027re using the VS indicator\u0027s needle swings\u00A0in KSP to observe how dramatic the change of VS is, I recall from somewhere that the VS indicator is logarithmic, meaning that the further it goes the more it reflects larger rates. So it is not reliable to establish rate of change of VS across a wide range. Stick to just using the middle 1/3rd or 1/4th of the entire thing.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n***************\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdditional Edit: I noticed in your post above yours that you have AA. \u00A0There was an older mod here somewhere that actually made for a real FMS/landing autopilot, because it allowed you to set the altitude and speed targets for the outer, middle, inner, and TD markers. So the only thing left to do was to figure out what speeds you wanted, and what the target altitudes were at the O-M-I-TD (TD being the runway altitude, of course).\u00A0 And again, that means varying, \u003Cem\u003Ebut otherwise constantly reducing \u003C/em\u003E(so as long as the groundspeed/indicated airspeed was reducing as well), VS across the approach.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nokay, that\u0027s why i came here, i feel happy!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbZSe6N_BXs\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbZSe6N_BXs\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI started playing FS at the 98\u0027 version haha, it\u0027s been a while since my last time actually playing FS, and when i purchased the latest one it crashed (FS) before take off, and as i was focused on other games i couldn\u0027t be bothered to re open it to try... still have a flight pending\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut yeah i don\u0027t recall the ILS system descent rate changing, and yeah i do know that some approachs may require a change in VS while they are performed, but we don\u0027t have charts u.u, however I saw a chart on the back pages, it is beautiful... but that\u0027s waay too much, as this is not FS, the point is, i\u0027m lazy, i want to set the Atmo Autopilot at a -VS @10 kms away from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003Eksc\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, starting at whatever altitude, and forget about it until its time to masterswitch off and flare , that\u0027s why i\u0027m trying to figure out an actual VS to follow the ILS suggestion.

98\u0027 version haha, it\u0027s been a while since my last time actually playing FS, and when i purchased the latest one it crashed (FS) before take off, and as i was focused on other games i couldn\u0027t be bothered to re open it to try... still have a flight pending\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut yeah i don\u0027t recall the ILS system descent rate changing, and yeah i do know that some approachs may require a change in VS while they are performed, but we don\u0027t have charts u.u, however I saw a chart on the back pages, it is beautiful... but that\u0027s waay too much, as this is not FS, the point is, i\u0027m lazy, i want to set the Atmo Autopilot at a -VS @10 kms away from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003Eksc\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, starting at whatever altitude, and forget about it until its time to masterswitch off and flare , that\u0027s why i\u0027m trying to figure out an actual VS to follow the ILS suggestion. I know i can actually do my own, which i ended up doing, splitting the approach in 2 legs for the \u0022first descent\u0022 and the last 300 meters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nhowever it sparked my curiosity about the mod suggested glideslope, and how it was generated as it seems that\u0027s not quite right, end even though a know a little tiny bit of coding i wouldn\u0027t know how to start searching for that module\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwhen it comes to horizontal speed, yeah i accounted for it, in my other calculations not related to the approach, i have an excel with some formulas that calculate various things in the most kerbal way possible haha, it got a little bit serious when i started trying to calculate this as i had to watch videos to remember trig functions and triangles, and i love doing that and solving problems that way... when it came to the approach calculations i ended up disregarding the HS, as it was fixed during the entire approach to 65m/s as that\u0027s why i set as the final approach speed for the airplane, with sense rather than math (i kind of don\u0027t want to use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research

it, yeah i know hs has to have a part in the calculations... but i don\u0027t know where to start, i would say that i have to add vectors to my math to split the direction of motion into the 2 vectors, BUUUUT i have a good reason to disregard HS, i use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E aswell, and as far as i can tell, the horizontal speed always matches my AA desired speed, and the vertical speed (inside AA) has no effect on the HS, AA sets up the plane parameters to meet both my desired HS and VS, so regardless of my math if i set the HS @65m/s, and the VS @-2.5m/s it will keep both values on point until changed, and i wasn\u0027t able to get a consistent VS that would follow the suggested path by this mod, keeping a constant HS\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwell i guess know its time to show the math, please

me think about what you mentioned of HS having a part, however the actual thing i\u0027m trying to calculated is a RATE, every glideslope will have for a set alt and distance a specific VS which has a horizontal component to it, that would mean that my calculations are taking into consideration the HS from my VS expected, but not my actual HS, which i guess is the difference between my set HS (65m/s) and the horizontal component of the expected VS, just woke up and its getting hard to explain what i mean, hmmmm, i figure you\u0027ll get it anyway, or ask away, the rest of the sheet (coloured triangles) are my experimental testing, i took note of the distance and altitude whenever they matched the glideslope in the mod, and tried to backward engineer the actual glideslope, which
