I just did some more testing and found it is not caused by decoupling, i am getting the problem even with no launch clamps with the latest version of KJR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurthermore, with my current rocket. There does not seem to be much difference between having and not having KJR installed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand one of the main sources of bending seems to be procedural fairing bases. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eits like KJR has no effect on them. This is with KJR and like 16 struts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://ft.trillian.im/26ff886aedb257b5494e6296a47c202592541125/6mz5Koz9buZk0m5NUzGlMq2hmFwvW.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00226mz5Koz9buZk0m5NUzGlMq2hmFwvW.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this part Ferram im seriously starting to wonder if it wouldnt be better to just disable bending joints and just make them break only.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn real life a rocket joint will either not bend more than a few milimeters or break and have a catastrophic explosion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is no real life situation where you can have a joint separating on one side by like 10 cm and then somehow magically coming back together with no lasting effect on the rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ein a situation like that the rocket is toast anyways\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I think just disable joint bending and let joints either break or be locked rock solid. reducing bending doesnt seem to work.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-12T06:57:38Z\u0022 title=\u002201/12/2014 06:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 12, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Zander\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"iVG","CreatedById":58021,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-13T22:46:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have the same problem.
