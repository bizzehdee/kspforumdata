To me it would make sense for hab and home time depletion, as well as making \u0022probe core on everything\u0022 a bit less encouraged.\n\nVarying penalties depending on Kerbal type. I\u0027m thinking things like pilots would still work, but scientists and engineers wouldn\u0027t. Might be too many options though.\n\nAn \u0022adversity\u0022 feature that would allow suspending or extending timers in certain situations. I\u0027m mainly thinking that mods like Dang It could trigger this. The oxygen tank blew up and suddenly you don\u0027t care much that three of you are crammed into the lander, that kind of thing.
