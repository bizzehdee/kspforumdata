The inner surfaces on the wings are set to pitch only, the outer ones to roll and the middle winglet at the back to yaw.

I assume you are talking about a \u0027real\u0027 plane-tail with elevators\u002Brudder? Never really thought about it, since i was kinda used to elevon\u0027s.

The CoM actually wanders behind the CoL with empty tanks, which would be pretty bad normally, but the air-powered flight sees basically no shift of the CoM. The 2 big 2.5m tanks are the only source of fuel, so the shift is very low and only appears after some time of rocket burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFunnily enough, i actually managed to land that thing on my second try, despite a screwed up dry CoM/CoL.

I\u0027ll switch them around and add 2 horizontal stabilisator\u0027s to the vertical one, just for test.

Following the instructions, I now changed the outer control surface pitch, increased front stab size, and angled the outer wingtip. Also remove a number of b9 wheel\u0027s, so the CoM is now better balanced.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe result was quite promising, the plane\u0027s lacking aerodynamic still have been somewhat of an issue (and lol, turns out that thing needs some dedicated roll surfaces), but it was much better controllable, if a bit instable. Especially the big front stabs are a big improvement. Had to move the tanks a bit more to the front to balance the CoM, though. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve had some suspicions about the wing-shape for a while, and your picture also pointed me in that direction. So i decided to give them a quick rework, making them wider instead of a delta-design, which also left some place for bigger control surfaces. Much more fragile, but also delivering more lift. Shown in the second picture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only remaning issue was the lack of powerful SAS. I missed that the plane still run on a single S2-SAS, since this was originally more of a mashup instead of a serious space-plane. Added a HL-SAS, but deactivated it for the test-flight, to get a better feel for the new wing-design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn conclusion, the old wings - and original control\u0027s - probably just sucked above 20k and mach 4. The new design and improved control allowed me to bring that thing into space without using RCS for the first time. The HL-SAS should further improve the flight. Otherwise my piloting skills also need work, since i\u0027m still relatively new to ARM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the help, i\u0027ve learned quite a bit working on bringing that brick into brick.
