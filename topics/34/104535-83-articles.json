Two counter-rotating rings also work. It would be sweet to have actual counterweights. I don\u0027t really want two rings and I want my core to be minimal.

The station wheel is 250T (it\u0027s also edited from the original to contain extra fuel), everything else should be negligible and under 300T. The station wheel has torque disabled.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E So, I went a bit extreme, added three 500T counterweights and a hacked \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E wheel with 3000 torque, but the core still rotates much faster than the wheel around it ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif \u0022:(\u0022)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E **CONCLUSION: Assuming I remember my physics correctly, I guess, the 250T station wheel has so much angular force (since all of its weight is far from the axis of rotation) that the core, even at 1500T  with the huge \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E wheel is not enough to counter it. I\u0027ve no clue how to do the math but it seems that the core has to be either larger to provide more angular counter-forces (I\u0027m making up words as I go...)  or silly-heavy if I want it to be compact. I\u0027ll try that later today then.**\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [![screenshot.1222.jpg](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14471718/forumstuff/ksp/RotStationAttempt/screenshot.1222.jpg)](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14471718/forumstuff/ksp/RotStationAttempt/screenshot.1222.jpg \u0022Enlarge image\u0022)\n\u003E \n\nFor a ring that big, you really need a massive station. Also if you set it to accelerate / decelerat very slowly that will also help. But yeah the station needs to not only be heavy but have its weight spread out. So not just a heavy tube (unless it\u0027s ridiculously heavy, like 5-10 times heavier than you have it now.) also the faster you spin it, the harder it is to stabilize."},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbital","CreatedById":170602,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-24T17:38:14Z","Content":"Yup. Big. It took 5000 counterweight and 20,000 of torque to stabilize this beast. But in the end it\u0027s not perfect and not practical. I might be able to get away with lighter counterweight, but still in the tens of tons. Sorry, I don\u0027t have any video capture tools installed.\n\n1) I had to use MechJeb\u0027s Smart ASS to keep the core stable. The stock \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E would make the whole thing shake. I had to make sure all other \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E modules were disabled, of course.\n\n2) Forget about moving 5000 of mass.\n\n3) The wheel movement isn\u0027t smooth, sometimes slows and speeds up, then stops and goes.\n\n4) The whole structure shakes from time to time.\n\n5) Yeah, I had to set breaking forces in cfg to 999.\n\n5) It survives even the fastest warp but shakes ugly afterwards, I have to stop and restart it to stop the shakes.\n\nEDIT-\u003E6) Oh yeah, and I had to enable \u0022No crash damage\u0022 and \u0022Unbreakable joints\u0022 in Cheats. Otherwise placing this mass on the launchpad would result in an instant explosion.\n\nSo, in the end I\u0027m not going to put any of my Kerbals on it:) This might work with a smaller ring though.
