I need to find a way to take advantage of welding in this area or give up on stations bigger than 200 parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell... you \u003Cem\u003Ecan\u003C/em\u003E weld docking ports, just make sure you only have one docking port per part that includes the ModuleDockingNode module. From what I can tell this part module is probably looking for some animation or anchor on the model to use as a docking target so with a single docking port you\u0027d be fine (quite similar to how engines can be welded). Of course there\u0027s nothing stopping you from welding multiple non-functional docking ports to the same part by removing ModuleDockingNode...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Azunai","CreatedById":104025,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-25T15:18:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ehey, i just installed the mod but the \u0022weld it\u0022 button does not appear ? :S\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand my KSP.log is spammed with:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMissingMethodException: Method not found: \u0027EditorLogic.Lock\u0027.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"malkuth","CreatedById":57414,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-25T16:21:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Azunai\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Azunai\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ehey, i just installed the mod but the \u0022weld it\u0022 button does not appear ? :S\u003Cp\u003Eand my KSP.log is spammed with:\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe front page download is only for .22.

Just for you understand Im not taking this over. So still using this thread to release this version. Few issues I have noticed but had no time to Track Down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Yes it works in career mode now. To unlock you have to research Advrocketry. Every time you build a new Weld it will end up in this Science (Sandbox ignore this its always available)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Once you save it in career you will have to go to Research and unlock the part again (just like adding a new mod to existing tree)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Noticed that once you weld something it breaks mods (Some mods don\u0027t like to be reloaded which is what This mod does to load the new part config) sorry to say the only way to fix this is to start KSP over again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. If your not using any other mods then the reload is not needed.. At least I think. For sure MCE has to be reloaded and so does Interstellar and Engineer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan\u0027t think of anything else. Its not perfect, but nothing is skipped in the mod and everything that needed to be is replaced in the code with what was needed. So Fxemitters actual work now. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThats it, again i\u0027m not taking over the mod and pretty busy with MCE.
