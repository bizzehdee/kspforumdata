However, Jool is going to be problematic for you with or without Deadly Reentry. That\u0027s been a known issue since KSP 1.0 came out and the problem is mainly due to the fact its atmospheric density is the same as Kerbin\u0027s and coupled with high speeds and high pressure (if you make it in to any appreciable depth) ensures that you\u0027re going to have a very bad day.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s something that (I think) is getting fixed in 1.0.5 along with the other thermodynamics.

The more comfortable I am, the less changes I make to the thermal system\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince KSP adopted the skin/internal concept that I introduced with DRE 7.0.0, DRE\u0027s thermal involvement has been limited to changes to part thermal parameters only, such as giving internals much lower tolerances than outer. Or ensuring that space planes were more reliant on shallow reentry profiles and punished for steeper ones.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith KSP 1.0.5 I\u0027m still appraising the thermal changes before deciding whether to discard any of those alterations or not.
