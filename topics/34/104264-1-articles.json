He\u0027s blaming poor sales of his pet project, the Oscar-B fuel tank, on consumer preference of the ROUND-8 fuel tank. As a result, he\u0027s converting all new ROUND-8 tanks to store Xenon to boost Oscar-B sales.\n\n**Now he\u0027s heard about a plan to save the ROUND-8 and he is not happy! He\u0027s willing to pay anyone who will destroy Probodobyne\u0027s stock of ROUND-8\u0027s**\n\n![81aWvWO.png](http://i.imgur.com/81aWvWO.png)\n\n![5BavxDJ.png](http://i.imgur.com/5BavxDJ.png)\n\n**Description**\n\nThis Contract Pack is a spoof of nightingales [Save the Round-8](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/115705-0-90-Contract-Pack-Save-the-ROUND-8-v1-0-0-2015-04-15). Personally I never use the thing, so lets destroy as many as we can!\n\nThis may be a spoof, but it is a real life working Contract Pack! It\u0027s very simple, just load up the required amount of Round8s, and destroy them any way you feel like it. (I\u0027d love to see some screenshots though)\n\nAlso, if you have Save the Round8 installed, you\u0027ll get a mission to destroy a hidden cache of Round8s on Kerbins Ice Caps\n\nNew Mission: Eject the Round8s from the Kerbol system\n\n**License:** Licensed under [CC-BY-SA-4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) (because nightingales pack is) but honestly I don\u0027t care.
