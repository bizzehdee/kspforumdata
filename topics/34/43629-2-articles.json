It\u0027s only just descriptive enough that the operation can be carried out in a repeatable way. It is far from optimal. Here is to hoping that one day we can actually use that nice graph to plot our ascent. What would be really nice would be to be able to click and add points on the graph and to be able to plot our course if you will. Currently we have to give up gravity losses to gain aerodynamic efficiency. That of course will always be true but there is much more DV to be had on both ends. The current system only allows us a best fit to the middle of the efficiency range.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
