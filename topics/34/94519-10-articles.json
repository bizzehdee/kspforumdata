The reactors and RTGs would be generating power even when I\u0027m not firing propellent through them (in fact, when considering an RTG, with no ability to throttle - if you aren\u0027t cooling it by firing propellent through the heat exchanger you better be doing something to keep it cool).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, I think some of the values used in your parts are slightly out of line with the two relevant stock parts, 1) rtg and 2) LV-N. I\u0027d suggest that the candle probably should weigh somewhat more than the RTG (maybe double) but put out power (point 1) as well as serve as an engine. This makes it a nice (but costly) choice for long range probes. The LANTRN shouldn\u0027t pay any ISP penalty compared to LV-N when operating in fuel only mode (its the same core temp, and its using hte same fuel, so it should have the same ISP). But it should be heavier (extra plumbing). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThird lightbulb gets in range of speculative stuff, so not sure how to balance it - i\u0027d argue instead how I play with Lightbulb. I don\u0027t want to play the interstellar mod, because it carries way to much baggage with it as cool as it is, and I don\u0027t want to play with mods that are completely in the realm of fantasy (e.g. kerbanite\u002B with torchdrives), so that pretty much leaves your mod with lightbulb. As such, I want lightbulb to be overpowered, but realistically overpowered, extremely expensive, and end-game tech tree tech. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m thinking perhaps two engines\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe lightbulb you\u0027ve got, but significantly lighter. Right now its TWR is worse than LV-N. 30 tons? I\u0027d say something between 6-10.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then, something better than lightbulb. Like gas-core reactor, or possibly fission fragment, Different nitch - much higher ISP - 5000-8000, much lower thrust. (~80 ish). Basically , option 1 is the \u0027lower isp, high trust\u0027 engine, and the second option is the \u0027ion engine for big ships\u0027 alternative.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Seyv\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-29T18:26:19Z\u0022 title=\u002206/29/2015 06:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Red Iron Crown\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EKeep it friendly, please.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T18:55:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Randazzo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Randazzo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI understand you feel the need to defend your baby, but I\u0027m really not bent out of shape over it.
