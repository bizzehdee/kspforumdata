I always liked the idea of a packable rover (that\u0027s what they did on the Apollo missions) and it would save me having to figure out where to strap one on the side of my lander without sticking way out and throwing off the center of mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn stock, the monoprop is relatively useless for landers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess for SETI it is a preparation towards weaker/less usefull reaction wheels sometime in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe semi saturation goes in that direction and with RLA Stockalike, there will be more options for RCS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SwGustav\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SwGustav\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt depends on your playstyle, you may use CSM to rendezvous while others (like me) use the lander. Reaction wheels are overpowered, often making RCS on small landers completely redundant.
