Thankfully I\\\u0027ve devised a rocket that can slow myself down for re-entry quite well, so it shouldn\\\u0027t be a problem, but I\\\u0027m wondering what it will do to other things. Like, will re-entry heat cause a fuel tank with fuel in it to explode faster then an empty one? (speaking of which, why does everything \u0027explode\u0027 when it hits the ground or another object? I highly doubt empty fuel tanks or pieces of wings would \u0027explode\u0027 the same way an engine would.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, now i have some questions about the new kit and about the action buttons. How exactly are the fairing supposed to work in the new pack? I\\\u0027ve tried twice to open them while approaching the Munar surface now, and both times they wouldn\\\u0027t disengage. are they meant to be opened in 0g? and is there anyway we can remap the action key from \u0027g\u0027 to something else for opening the solar panels? I\\\u0027ve had at least three crashes because i hit \u0027g\u0027 by accident while using F key to momentarily disable SAS to fine-tune my approaches to the Mun and the solar panels opened inside my fairing and clipped through it, making the whole ship freak out and tear itself apart in a crazy spin... will G always activate EVERY moving part on our rocket? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethis is a link to the picture.
