In a stock install with only baris installed the buttons seem to work just fine, mostly.

In the coming days I\u0027m going to start adding mods one at a time and testing baris to see if I can isolate what mod or combo of mods is making the situation worse.

I discovered I had a number of issues related to workers and buttons not working as I felt they were intended. I then re-cleaned install folder, downloaded a clean copy of KSP and only installed Baris and Module manager to compare, and only realized then that the same issues show up without any other mods installed, I just hadn\u0027t noticed when I was first playing around with the clean install of Baris.

It seems the only way to do this is to press the button, and then timewarp until the repair is complete. However, with repairs on some probs of mine lasting 11 days, it would be nice to start the repair, then continue on with other missions while the repair continues in the background\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- When in the flight scene, and viewing the Vehicle Health display, the list will fail to load on a vessel with many parts (for example, a landed lunar or planetary base). This makes it impossible to determine which parts are broken or need maintenance. The only way I\u0027ve found to mitigate this is to quick save, then undock various segments and switch between the modules until I find the section with affected parts, and then quick load, EVA an engineer and perform the necessary repair or maintenance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would also like to propose a feature: include the ability to hire workers in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E. For example, if I wanted to split the workforce to work on two different vessels, you need to change to the space center to halve the number of workers, assign them to craft 1, then go back to the space center, rehire the workers to return to the same number of workers, then re-enter the build scene and assign them to craft 2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain, I really do love this mod.

Again you won\u0027t notice this unless you go through an integration pass and load the craft with the part in question. The max quality of a part is 80%\u00A0by default, but when you add difficulty bonus and perhaps facility bonus it could give you over 100% chance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGiven this behavior with default settings it seems to me you will be doing static fire tests for a very long time before the mk1 parachute can be trusted, much less any engines. I was able to begin surviving failed launches on Normal difficulty after using all of my money at the test bench to get a 75% parachute rating and packing 6 redundant chutes. But now I\u0027m broke ...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother weirdness to look out for: if you enable debug mode then failures and explosions will stop happening by themselves, you will have to read the log and trigger them yourself, though you can\u0027t seem to trigger every type of failure (critical failure of pod or parachute which causes it to vaporize). The main gotcha is that failures don\u0027t return to normal after disabling debug mode until you leave the game and reload. They came back for me after leaving to main menu and coming back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
