I am using B9 and procedural wings there. Recounting my experiences with it:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn 0.21 i found out that a design (very) loosely based on F-18 with a bit more swept wings and wingtip \u0022winglets\u0022 was working very well. Quite stable (ignoring the natural dutch roll tendency if i try to yaw excessively), good AoA, a bit twitchy but handled like the above mentioned jet fighter. Using twin Sabre\u0027s as propulsion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E0.22 comes with the new SAS, and here my problems start: this kind of design is a bit unstable by definition, in 0.21 SAS had no problem handling the very slight movements necessary to make it fly straight. In 0.22 the SAS seems to overshoot by quite a bit.. shaking and wobbling nonstop, sometimes even totally losing control (went into a spiral spin at mach 5 with a prototype: nasty).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat i found out is my designs had a huge roll unstability. This is the roll-unstable design:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zunVKdr.png\u0022 alt=\u0022zunVKdr.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI got an almost similar design on which i added negative dihedral on wings (like on jet fighters) which solved the roll unstability.

Another possibility is just unequal flexing in the wings, which is caused by a known joint bug; make sure that the parts are strutted to each other well and to the fuselage well to counteract that. If the roll instability isn\u0027t prominent in supersonic flight, try making the plane more pitch-stable and see if that counteracts the roll problems; it might just be pitch instability combined with wing flexing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConsider placing an empty structural fuselage piece in front of your fuel tanks; this will help make the plane more stable as fuel burns by adding more dry mass in front of the fuel tanks, which will help offset the high dry mass at the back due to the SABREs.

Results in more pitch stability, but seems to increase mach tuck effect at transonic speeds. Still can keep control so not a biggie.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Added front canards to increase pitch stability (as per Ferram\u0027s suggestion, and to mitigate mach tuck effects)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Added more length to the delta front section of the wings, to increase wing surface area (used a 3rd procedural wing clipped in between)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* negative dihedral on the whole wing area (one small rotation step in the SPH, not sure about the exact angle). The net result is very good stability in most flight situations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Move the tail fins a bit apart and gave them a slight tilt outwards, seems it\u0027s working (thanks again Ferram !)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Increased the span of the rear part of the main wing, to account for the increased weight and length (added tank). Increased sweep a bit too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt handles as beautifully as the looks suggest. Roll is very sensitive (like a jet fighter basically), new v0.22 SAS is totally lost there. Deactivate SAS and the plane flies very nicely. Landed without SAS at north pole, almost lost control just before landing (i use keyboard !!), AoA at low speed must be kept tight to avoid a stall (i guess due to the highly swept wings). It also wants to dutch roll like crazy so yaw inputs have to be very subtle and progressive.. I can now throw it into a stall while supersonic, by giving it too much pitch input, i guess it\u0027s a compromise i have to live with (like the real world counter parts, so it\u0027s not surprising). Good thing is in most cases it seems to come back to stable / prograde by itself and not go into a spin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 3 tank sections allow for more precise fuel balancing (wish i had fuel loaded wings..).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlight data with unstable SAS roll (but stable normal flight):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YA7iN76.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022YA7iN76.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb approves this spaceplane and FAR !\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jjgclnx.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022jjgclnx.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow we are still missing fully retractable ladders and gear bays.

I got 2 of them (one in front just behind the cockpit, one in back just before the engine twin mount) for space, wondering what are their effects at subsonic and supersonic speeds in atmosphere.

I guess the front canards helped there. It was not controlled though it was a stall..
