Simpler is not always better, and this mod adds complexity in ways that make for some interesting interactions with other mods. For example, I use the Dang It! mod, which creates random failures and leaks, including in LS canisters. That means, since I have a 30-day window for food, I don\u0027t worry about backup food supplies for short missions, but I tend to bring backup oxygen supplies in case of failure of one of my reservoirs.

Kind of like the announced (and RoverDude developed) Relays being added to 1.1 versus RemoteTech. If the features of the Relay remain as planned, I will be sticking with RT.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgreed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I\u0027m not saying TAC-LS is perfect. I often wish that it would take into account % of CO2 in the atmosphere of vessels and cause problems if it got too high, or there could be explosions if the oxygen content got too high. But the work TaranisElsu put into trying to get the consumption and production values correct is really great.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd leaky canisters sounds like a great level up. I\u0027ll have to give it a try. I use BioMass with TAC-LS, so I use the oxidizer--\u0026gt;oxygen release and I guess I\u0027d need to make a custom MM file to make the oxidizer tanks leak, but totally worth the trouble I think.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
