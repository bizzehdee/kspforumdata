Furthermore, the changes to version 1.0\u0027s tech system are significant enough that I do not think there is any point in continuing support for this mod. There are a couple of features that TechManager had that KSP does not, like multiple trees in one game and the ability to hide entire sub trees, but those were practically unused by anyone and now KSP defaults all nodes to be visible by default anyway. So, I am HAPPY to say, there is no more point to this mod. Thanks SQUAD!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll keep it around for download for those of you who like to play old games (I know you are out there). But don\u0027t expect any updates. And, as always, anyone is free to use the source code for any reason, if you can think of one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy rocketeering.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a plugin that will allow you to modify the tech tree, including adding new nodes. It was developed and tested primarily for use with KSP Interstellar, however, other developers are using TechManager to load their own custom trees and you are free to make your own.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnofficial versions of the KSP Interstellar and Near Futures tech trees are installed by default. When / if they release updates that conform to the (slightly different) TECHNOLOGY_TREE_DEFINITION format, I will likely remove the unofficial trees. Any \u0027official\u0027 tech trees released by modders will work in place, no need to move them to the TechManager directory. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you expect this to work, be sure to remove / do not install the TreeLoader mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne MAJOR way this mod differs from TreeLoader (besides working with .25) is that you must define the ENTIRE tech tree. You can not simply put only the new nodes in the tree definition file. TechManager works by inactivating all of the tech nodes it sees at start up and then loads in what is in the file. As such, there is no REMOVENODE node type. If you don\u0027t want a node, just don\u0027t define it in the file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe source is included in the download.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDownload TechManager from \u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/297/TechManager\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKerbalStuff.com\u003C/a\u003E It will say version .25, but that will also work with .90.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELicense: MIT\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVersion 1.5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-changed menu keys from Left-Alt-F7 to Modifier-F7.

The source for the mod is included in the download. It might be a good idea to separate tech configs from part configs, where tech tree configs shouldn\u0027t mention parts at all, while part configs should explicitly mention the tech they need.

What actually gets saved are the ProtoTechNodes in the ResearchAndDevelopment instance, and that is just a string identifying a techID, a state saying the tech is researched or not, and a list of purchased parts. The graphical tree, clicking on buttons, etc is just a way to get that data in there, and I use all stock code for that. I set the fewest number of fields I can get away with and then let the game treat them like normal tech nodes afterwards. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIs it a simple case that if a part has tech requirement for a node that doesn\u0027t exist in a save\u0027s tree, it just won\u0027t be available?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMostly yes. If that tech isn\u0027t in the tree, it won\u0027t show up anywhere. But, you can change the tree at any time while at the R\u0026amp;D screen. If you purchase a part then remove that tech, the part will be forgotten. If you then add that tech back in, it will show up again but need to be purchased again as well. At least.. I think that\u0027s what would happen. I should probably test that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENothing you do in one save, however, should have any impact on any other.

I would like to change this, however. Or, really, I\u0027d like ATC to just incorporate TechManager. I named it Tech*Manager* because I saw it as a fitting nicely with Module*Manager*, at least eventually. The main problem with allowing arbitrary mods to add techs, is how do you then determine where every node is physically located? What if two mods try to put a node in the same place?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou do NOT need to declare parts in the tree.cfg file. You can though, and if you do, it will take priority.
