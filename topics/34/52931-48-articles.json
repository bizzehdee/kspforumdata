If I stop having fun doing this because the feedback I get is that I\u0027m not working fast enough or that I\u0027m not doing what you think I should do, and that therefore I\u0027m in the wrong, I\u0027ll simply stop updating this and do it for myself in my free time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t take this wrong, I do want feedback.

It\u0027s gonna put me off, and probably you too, and it\u0027s not fun for anyone. Inform yourself, read the posts I leave lying around in the OP, read the FAQ, etc. If I don,t agree with you, don\u0027t rant off, you\u0027ll lose me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t want to have to make such an announcement, but it seems I have to, because the amount of posts with this tone lately is growing very fast. Even though there is no more \u0022WIP\u0022 tag in the title, this mod is still in development. I removed it because I have reached the original scope I planned for this. Everything I\u0027m adding from now on is extra candy because I feel like it, I like doing this, and because I want to give you guys the best. If I stop having fun doing this because the feedback I get is that I\u0027m not working fast enough or that I\u0027m not doing what you think I should do, and that therefore I\u0027m in the wrong, I\u0027ll simply stop updating this and do it for myself in my free time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t take this wrong, I do want feedback. What I don\u0027t want is feedback that makes me feel attacked and that forces me to do posts like this where I need to defend myself. Criticism is alright, as long as you understand that I\u0027m perfectly in the means of having a different opinion, and that at the end it belongs to me to see what I will/will not do. As far as I know, I\u0027ve been pretty ongoing on that and I\u0027ve added most of - if not everything- that you guys proposed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst there is no need to get defensive, I am not attacking you. Unless you consider difference of opinion an attack. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou claim the current ui is more user friendly, and it is not, as it takes you longer to accomplish the same task. You can dismiss that as a rant, but the new ui takes more time, there is more chance for misconfiguration (error), and requires more knowledge. Not many people realize how to build a chute from scratch, for example what material to use for drogue, drag etc. If your new design requires \u0027read the manual\u0027 and the old one did not, what does that tell you about user friendliness? And manual is not exactly ready is it? So where else I could get this information other than ask here? I don\u0027t recall being here at version 0.3 asking stupid questions - because things were rather obvious.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt does give you more options which I appreciate, there is a workaround with the sub-assemblies, so not that big of a deal, yet less \u0027user friendly\u0027. This is why I suggested adding some sub assemblies, so people can go and test them in sandbox, or copy over to their game. I am perfectly capable of adding them, and would have offered to provide them so you don\u0027t need to lose your own time, but fair enough, if this would somehow ruin your mod, I won\u0027t argue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow about the part size - \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m pretty sure you are aware of the issue when using symmetry. You can\u0027t do that anymore, at least I am unable to even put the smallest cone on a 2.5 side boosters. Yes I know I can build a single one and then symmetry the whole booster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout the \u0027next\u0027 size - most of us think of next size as a bigger size. This is for two reasons, most of us count up, and you unlock bigger sizes later. Also in most cultures which write left to right, next is to be placed on the right, it\u0027s more intuitive. Both easily fixed with changing the labels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe calculation does not seem to work very well, I assumed is FAR issue. Still, hit the ground at 12m/s instead of 5m/s. Perhaps was simply coming in too hot. Landing happened at around 1400m, return from LKO. Does atmospheric density affect drag? Do I need to compensate for elevation?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe copying part around - while a copied part keeps the stats, further modification, requires you to enter each and every stat, as the UI cannot pick them up. Which I personally consider less user friendly than the stock tweakables in the 0.3 versions. Consider a case where you add a radial chute to one stage, configure it\u0027s properties, copy it to another, and want to tweak something - well you cannot - while you could do that with previous parts. Hence my comment - it was better before. Here you can use subassembly as well with various results. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou also need to remember which one is your original when using symmetry, and which are the copies. I know this is ksp limitation, modular fuels have the same issue. Dare I suggest you add that in the list of known issues?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout the weight - I did not see anything about the case size/max diameter/spares and how they affect weight, or your further implementation plans in the area. A simple \u0027it\u0027s on my to do list\u0027, would have done nicely. What information post mentioning this I seem to have missed? It\u0027s not in the first post of the this or the dev thread (or its very well burred), so not sure why you feel the need to imply I\u0027m lazy or ignorant, and go on to lecture me about being aggressive. Perhaps your energy is better spent on amending the information. OP information which isn\u0027t exactly correct - for example says selecting a drogue chute gives you exactly the same chute as before - well sure except it gives you main chute look, and material. Not that it makes so much difference in behavior other than drag and weight, the autocalc compensates for the most part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo answer my own question, in case someone else is wondering.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently, in my experience\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn case of radials, use the smallest case possible, as it fits the same chute, it\u0027s lighter, and presents less surface in case of FAR - deadly reentry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor cones use the one which fits your node, if aerodynamics aesthetics matter more than weight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s unknown to me whether or not bigger case has less chance to break, or if chutes break at all (guessing from the OP they don\u0027t, I haven\u0027t tested that as I have deadly reentry, and will peak G forces/heat before the joint or chute breaks).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would likely change in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso combo chute, will not warn you if your craft is too heavy if, your first chute is main and the second drogue - which happens to be it\u0027s default configuration. Reversing them gives warning, but the second chute won\u0027t fully deploy. So don\u0027t have secondary chute open second.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a unrelated note, what would be pretty nice (especially for drogue chutes), would be option to have a deployment speed, for example, deploy when speed falls under 400m/s. Pre-deploying auto-calculated drogue at the default 30k tends to result in 8-9g.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot sure on what max diameter is based, I have managed to set cone to either 121 or 70m, any insight on that?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s an honest feedback. In any case, since you seem find all this insulting, I\u0027ll go do something less futile.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-07T16:22:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Aedile\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Aedile\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFirst there is no need to get defensive, I am not attacking you.
