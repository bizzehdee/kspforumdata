Is it possible to build an SSTO with FAR. All my attempts seem to spin out at 12km despite the fact the only engines I\u0027m running up there are rockets. I burn very little jet fuel, and this happens right after I ignite the rockets. The jets are off and rocket thrust is not hitting any other part of a perfectly symmetrical space craft. Another problem I\u0027ve noticed is that the max speed I can get on jets is at most 400m/s, and this is usually while they are careening all over the place. This is a far cry from the 1500m/s at 25km suggested for SSTOs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ferram4","CreatedById":21328,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-15T03:57:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst, you should try looking at some of the craft included with FAR; some of them are SSTOs. It\u0027s quite possible that your designs are becoming unstable as they drain rocket fuel and the CoM moves backwards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for getting a good top speed with jets, first, make sure you\u0027re using the turbojet engine, not the basic jet engine; the latter doesn\u0027t make much thrust beyond Mach 1. Second, make sure that you climb steadily up to the proper altitude and speed; you will not reach top speed on jets as quick as you are accustomed to. Third, make sure your vehicle is properly streamlined with highly swept wings; unswept wings and short, fat fuselages generate far more drag than swept wings with thin, long fuselages. Fourth, make sure that the rocket thrust vector passes through the CoM; make sure that the fuel drains in the way you expect it to. Fifth, make sure that the CoL isn\u0027t too far behind the CoM; this can make trimming the vehicle at supersonic speeds difficult.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are also the suggestions in the readme file, but I assume that those didn\u0027t help if you\u0027re coming here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPictures will help a lot in diagnosing whatever problem you have, so please post those if you want more specific help.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-15T06:38:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd it\u0027s quite possible to make SSTOs without highly swept wings too \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E I\u0027m going to be in trouble when you fix that.

The air is so thin up there the thrust/drag ratio doesn\u0027t seem to suffer much.
