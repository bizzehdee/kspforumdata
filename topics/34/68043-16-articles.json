The first possibility is to have the TACLS config have all of its own parts (created through referencing the originals with some edits, not by copying models) with TACLS\u0027s unitless amounts, which for an oxygen block would be about 84.15 (average human breathing ~550L/day with 46284L in the tank). In this version I would also need to alter the resources so the US Core would use something like LO2 and LH2 to signify that they are in liquid form while also preventing those 46284L from throwing the TACLS balance completely out the window. The other option would be to convert the US Core amounts to match what TACLS would be, while then also scaling the usage rates for the fuel cell to keep them in line with what is already established for this mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think option 2 is the most succinct / least complicated way of doing the integration, but I have concerns that the game will accept an input resource rate of ~0.00006/sec. Option one means more extra parts the game has to load and for users to sort through, but it would preserve the original numbers much better, plus I would include a TACLS converter that would give an appropriate conversion from liquid oxygen to TACLS oxygen units so your LO2 supply could be cut into to give you more O2 in a pinch. I also have plans to include a water purifier, carbon extractor, and maybe even a waste compactor since I keep reading things that hint that the shuttle had such a device.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I\u0027d like your thoughts on all of this, keeping in mind that this is still just a stopgap measure until the proper TACLS pack is released.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-20T21:48:53Z\u0022 title=\u002206/20/2014 09:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 20, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by SpacedInvader\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rayder","CreatedById":95226,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-20T12:08:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy personal opinion, is that while KSP is quite realistic in some ways, it is definitely not in others.

So the size of the tank pretty much determines how much water you can store in it. Food is in the same boat here, but for different reasons (obviously). The same is not true for Oxygen, however.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can have the same volume tank, and increase the pressure to store a higher quantity of gas.

Stock KSP gives resources a density which basically makes 1unit = 5L, kind of an odd ratio, RealFuels changes that to 1unit = 1L. RealFuels also has a built in feature that essentially models pressurization. Say having a 10L tank, but pressurized to 3600psi, would mount to having about 245L all squeezed into 1L. So there is a variable that one would set to 245, and bam, that 10L tank, can handle 2450L of a resource.
