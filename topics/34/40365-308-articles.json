This NODE in particular is a type called MODULE, which are compiled bits of c# in a .dll somewhere. For instance, most engines use the ModuleEngines MODULE, which has several configurable parameters. RESOURCE is another, that is what handles the resources displayed on the tooltip as well as what resources are available to a vessel and how it flows around the vessel. In our case, you can see the name of the module for the reactor, which is a c# class contained within the warpplugin.dll. The tooltips are actually generated in the module itself. Maybe in the future more of this information will be made configurable in the part file with a separate module that handles upgrades, but for now I\u0027m just concerned with getting the information displayed within the game instead of referring to a picture in the thread OP or Wiki.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-23T11:19:23Z\u0022 title=\u002203/23/2014 11:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 23, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by WaveFunctionP\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BudgetHedgehog\uFEFF","CreatedById":104112,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-23T10:46:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMaybe say Power Output to make it a bit clearer and line up with the Power Requirement.

I think that I\u0027ve worked out that is based on the reactors current thermal energy production, sorta, but the numbers don\u0027t line up exactly. I guess the fundamental problem that I\u0027m having is that I have no idea what the units for tritiumBreedRate are. My goal endpoint is to have either a max theoretical breed rate (/day) value or better, an unit/GW value. Any insight would be greatly appreciated. The 0.6f is there as a hack right now for maximum carnot efficiency, but even that theoretical value comes up slightly short of the INFLIGHT
