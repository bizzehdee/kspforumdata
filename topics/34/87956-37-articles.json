That way, we can decide for ourselves what we want to keep or discard. Of course, since you\u0027re re-doing both the J and K parts, giving them all new cross sections, that\u0027s different. But again, I feel that some of the older parts still have merit, so I\u0027d still like to see a \u0027legacy\u0027 parts category in your inventory, maybe changing the designations of the older parts to something different, perhaps \u0022J-X\u0022 and \u0022K-X\u0022, for example, to avoid conflicts with the new stuff?
