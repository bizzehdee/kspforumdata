From memory, all the in game mod formulaic methods are all based on circular orbits, so any body with an elliptical orbit will not be 100% correct, and then different people do different things to correct.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat the elliptical orbit thing means for the formula alarms is that the time you get to reach the target phase angle when you create the alarm is almost never the actual time to the target phase angle, close but not exact. I put in an option to adjust for that automatically, but what it means practically when on is you set the alarm, and it says 9h, but as the planets move the time adjusts and the alarm fires when the phase angle is right - what this means is that the time figure is somewhat an estimate\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally I\u0027ve used the model version before, and begun using \u003Ca href=\u0022http://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/\u003C/a\u003E and then setting alarms via it\u0027s UT values, it\u0027s mid course correction stuff is very cool. One of these days I\u0027d like to figure out how to get that into KAC, but its a long way down the list - how cool would a porkchop in game be \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E .\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwaster","CreatedById":71262,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-05T22:44:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs the phase angle option in the current release or upcoming?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah I was thinking that must be the case re: elliptical orbits too.
