Whichever you make, look closely at how it\u0027s painted. N1 paint scheme is very distinctive and asymmetrical, only the N1-7L is plain white, but other details differ. They\u0027re all dark gray/bright white, with no other colors visible on the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour escape tower has no separation motors. Again, this is pretty important for such a huge rocket. BobCat\u0027s N1 had them (he was initially opposed, too, but later we found it to be the best solution to LES decoupling problems it had). They\u0027re modeled, so making them functional is just Unity work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, IMO, the lower shroud should be actual parts, not an autoshroud. The reason? Those sticking-out bits with holes you modeled are \u003Cem\u003Eseparation motors. \u003C/em\u003EYes, it was actually so massive it needed separation rockets for it\u0027s interstage shroud. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E That would\u0027ve looked really cool if it actually got to the first staging event...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EL3 complex is wobbly. This was a problem with BobCat\u0027s N1, too. Every major connection of the L3 complex should use size 3 nodes. Also, avoid attaching things to engines. It\u0027d be better to have engines with only a single node, and tanks with an additional node for mounting the decoupler. That would stiffen the stack and make the rocket more rigid as a whole.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, increase stage heat tolerance and decrease heat production on engines. Currently, if you try to hot-stage the N1, it ends up blowing the lower stage up. Engines also notoriously overheat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and the RCS nozzles on Block D are 45 degrees off axis, too, dunno why. The same with Block G. They should also be jettisonable, along with their hydrazine tanks. Lastly, Block D shroud seems to be a single piece on N1, too. It can be an autoshroud, but it probably shouldn\u0027t be split like it is now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall, it\u0027s a solid start, needs some work, but the basic structure works great. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-13T11:04:04Z\u0022 title=\u002205/13/2014 11:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 13, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Guest\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Virtualgenius","CreatedById":67644,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-13T11:13:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi would it be possible to get an alternative download link please as I refuse to use curse\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-13T13:14:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOK, found more bugs.
