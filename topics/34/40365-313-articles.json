First time post, got an odd thing happening and I wonder if it\u0027s a bug in the plugin / the game, or just a bug in my brain.\u003Cp\u003EI have KSP 023, KSPI and a bunch of the planet packs from kerbal universe active.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERunning the AIM reactor - reactor shows ~0% active when turned on, even when under load. It will power up initially to ~100% and then drop off to zero. I assume that it is supposed to throttle to zero when there is no power required however, it does not throttle up again in line with power requirements.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI noticed this when the ship has a microwave transceiver:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- With the microwave transceiver turned ON (in either send or receive mode) - If I time warp for a while, it will activate at 99%, then go back to 0 very quickly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- With the microwave transceiver turned OFF and with no other load, after time warp it will function correctly when put under load. If I then turn on a microwave transceiver (in either send or receive mode) it will again fail and go back to 0%.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Without using time warp, the reactor will remain at 0% regardless of the power configuration, occasionally perking up a little, i.e. to 0.0001%. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- If the ship does not have a microwave transceiver then the reactor doesn\u0027t seem to work at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve tried a clean install of KSP and KSPI with a blank sandbox save, but that didn\u0027t work either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone have any ideas / has anyone experienced the same problem?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAIM?
