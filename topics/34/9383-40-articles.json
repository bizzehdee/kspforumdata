You\u0027re saying that the optimum setting are, basically, processor-dependent, based on how efficiently your rig can process a given number of scans in a single frame? Am I correct in interpreting this as meaning a better processor can do a wide-beam scan with fine resolution at a higher altitude (and therefore scan the whole planet lickety-split) without slowing the physics to a crawl? I guess I understand the basic methodology, but don\u0027t understand how to play with the parameters to optimize scanning.
