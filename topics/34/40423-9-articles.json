Then:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Using WASD, align your nose so that the orange crosshair is dead center in the window. You are now moving in a direction parallel to the target port.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Using Q and E, rotate the vessel to the desired roll angle. This will set the green needles to the proper orientation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Here\u0027s the important part: Use IJKL to move the window\u0027s yellow prograde marker (not the one on the navball) over to the intersection of the green lines. Use H to thrust forward towards the target at a speed comfortable to your level of skill and actual distance to the target (the one in the window is the actual distance to the target port, rather than the center of the vessel).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) As you approach, the green needles \u003Cem\u003Ewill\u003C/em\u003E inevitably move closer to the center of the orange crosshairs. Use IJKL to adjust the yellow prograde marker so that it remains centered on the intersection. \u003Cem\u003E(You are not wasting mono fuel here - you\u0027re simply cancelling out the necessary translation velocity from step 3)\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) When everything is dead-center, all that remains is to slow down at the proper time to ensure a soft docking (0.1 m/s works nicely).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI apologize to those who knew how to do this already, or who may have intuitively but unconsciously understood it.

Those of us who had used similar indicators before dropped the ball in explaining how to use this one. I\u0027d point out that sometimes you want to align your roll axis first, if your vessel isn\u0027t symmetric around it. I\u0027m thinking particularly of BobCat\u0027s Buran shuttle, which has a docking port inside the cargo bay facing upward (like the U.S. STS\u0027s Orbiter Docking System). When you roll around that docking port, the yaw changes too, because the shuttle isn\u0027t symmetric around the roll axis.

To test the \u0022approach corridor\u0022 concept, I\u0027m drawing a long orange line out from the targeted port (in 3-D space), but I\u0027m not sure how I feel about the aesthetic of a 3-d overlay. It seems a bit too \u0027futuristic\u0027, as odd as that sounds. Another possible approach would be to draw a 2-D circle around the target port, in \u0022GUI\u0027 space.
