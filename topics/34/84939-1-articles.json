This mod adds a new resource, CrashDummies, that adds only to the Command Seat in the VAB/SPH and is removed when the vessel is launched. This adds to the weight of the Seat as if a Kerbal was sitting in it. So now, you can plan around the corrected CoM, and will show the corrected mass and dV in any mod that calculates it (MechJeb, Engineer, etc)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERequires ModuleManager.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/johnqevil/CrashDummies/releases/tag/0.03\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ERelease\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/johnqevil/CrashDummies/tree/master/Source\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESource\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ELicense: GPLv3\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpdate: 0.03 released.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChangelog:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E0.03: Corrected resource update method to set CrashDummies resource directly to \u00220\u0022 instead of decrementing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E0.02: Initial official release.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-21T06:22:38Z\u0022 title=\u002209/21/2014 06:22  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 21, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by johnqevil\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bs1110101","CreatedById":58438,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-19T01:56:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s a good idea, but why does it need a plugin?
