The lower the speed, the lower the drain. Thinner air also means lower drain. (so no drain in space or on the runway at 0 m/s.) The current formula right now is (surfaceSpeed x atmDensity) /15 (This might get tweaked for balance). I am thinking about having this so that the wing drains more at lower speeds rather than higher speeds, because wouldn\u0027t the wing have to work harder to produce the same amount of lift? Also, should the ion wing be able to be turned on/off? Right now the logic is so that if the wing has electricCharge, the lift is 15. (stock wings are at 2). But if there is no electricity, the lift is set to 1.75. Lift is constant, electricCharge drain is variable.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EIon wing now has a cutoff speed for electricCharge drain.

Been using your mod for months, and \u003Cem\u003EI can\u0027t find the hydrogen intake anywhere tonight in .90!\u003C/em\u003E Building a modified II/HX/IXS ship that\u0027s doing great, but my converter module is minus the main thing I need it for! I know I\u0027ve used them a dozen times before, and found the converters, but can\u0027t find the intakes to save the manatees tonight. Help if you can! Everything else is there, engines, tanks, RCS, so I know it\u0027s just me... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Nevermind, sir!
