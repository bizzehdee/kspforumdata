I\u0027ll reply in chunks.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m a little spooked by the save-breaking possibility... Anybody had it happen yet?\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I would take a guess that Necro means \u0027ship breaking\u0027 if he decides to take away a part, or even just give it a new identifier in the code. Can\u0027t figure out any reason why a parts pack would kill an entire save...?\n\u003E That aside, interesting mod indeed - I have oft felt disappointed at my options for multi-kerbal landers, what with the 3-man orbiter pod being excessively heavy. Hopefully this pack will give some more variety ^^\n\nYep, really it just means \u0022potentially ship breaking\u0022 if I have to make major changes, such as removing a part, or rescaling one, or moving attachment nodes around. Thankfully that latter one (changing the nodes) is no longer ship-breaking, as of KSP 1.0.4.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E On landing leg mass, I think a good reference from a gameplay standpoint would be the mass needed to do the same thing with girders or i-beams. If the landing legs are significantly heavier than that then they become suboptimal to use at all.\n\nThat\u0027s a good point. I\u0027ll add up some I-beams and see how it looks. I can probably bring the mass down on the legs.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Congratulations on a release Bones! Do you still have any plans for ramps or the like for the rover bay? I know that was something you were trying to figure out.\n\nThanks! Yeah, we were just discussing ramps on the previous page actually. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Seriously brother, I\u0027m all out of RAM, and at least half of it has your name stamped on it. ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nLOL, glad to \u0022help\u0022. ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E About the ramp:\n\u003E Why not a sort of service module .

I know I\u0027d get complaints of \u0022why is it all monoprop? I want LFO and Xenon!\u0022 or something like that. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nWhat I want to experiment with, and see if it\u0027s at all feasible, is to build the ramp into the service bay, and angle it down at maybe 30 degrees when deployed. If it functions as a \u0022landing leg\u0022 with a telescoping function, and very weak springs, it may somewhat auto-adjust to the height of the lander. I\u0027m having to fight against the constraints of KSP, in that animations are either static (with infinite motor strength and no flex), or they use the wheel suspension system."},{"CreatedByName":"ModZero","CreatedById":89470,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T13:57:58Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E What I want to experiment with, and see if it\u0027s at all feasible, is to build the ramp into the service bay, and angle it down at maybe 30 degrees when deployed.
