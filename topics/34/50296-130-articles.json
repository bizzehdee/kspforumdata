That repeats 3 or 4 times per reentry. Higher up (~30km to 35km) the ablative shield will rapidly switch between not being used and having minor usage (~0.03/sec). This is on the Normal DRE setting. Overall, from a 85x30 reentry I\u0027m using ~60 to 80 ablative shield units. Incidentally, a Mk1-2 pod with the included 1000 unit heat shield nearly burned up from a 120x30 decent with ~0.7T extra. In short, DRE is behaving oddly with NEAR since the update to .90.\u003Cp\u003EThe only things I think it could be is that DRE is \u0027cooling\u0027 the shield as is ablates or NEAR has messed with something that DRE assumed to be true.
