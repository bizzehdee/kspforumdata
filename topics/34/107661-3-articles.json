A couple of things about the future.\n\nFirst off - The last version of [x] Science! that I bunged onto CKAN caused the lovely CKAN guys to send me the following missive\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Should it have a ksp\\_version\\_max or a flat ksp\\_version in case it breaks with whatever major ksp updates come down the line?\n\nAnd thus was I gently reminded of the impending arrival of \u0022Starship Breakage\u0022 or KSP 1.1 as it is more commonly known. Of course what chaos will ensue when it finally drops out of hyperspace in the Kerbol System is anybody\u0027s guess.\n\nSecond point is that I recently said\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Assorted mods with their own rules for science many of which only look like science. [x] Science! does it\u0027s best.\n\nTurns out that may not be entirely true. Disappointing? Yes! But it does mean that there is room for improvement. [x] Science! contains some constants and short-cuts - I think I can remove them and it will handle science mods, maybe not perfectly but better.\n\nAs I said before, I don\u0027t want to have to add magic for every damn science mod. (Lazy programmer is lazy / That way madness lies - I\u0027ll let you choose!) If I can make [x] Science! work as well as I can then that will be good.\n\nSo it seems to me that the immediate future includes fire-fighting 1.1 and Orbital Science/SCANsat support. I\u0027m thinking that I shouldn\u0027t worry about 1.1 - just pretend it isn\u0027t happening and deal with it when it arrives."},{"CreatedByName":"LordFerret","CreatedById":111598,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-18T20:39:41Z","Content":"I have the latest version, just installed it.
