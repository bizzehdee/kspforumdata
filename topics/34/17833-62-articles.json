I selected all of my ships and opened them at the same time, and then used the \u003Cem\u003EReplace All in All Open Documents\u003C/em\u003E button in the find-and-replace dialog. As a sanity check, there should be twice as many replacements of EngineerChipFlight to EngineerChip as there are replacements of FlightEngineer to FlightEngineerModule, because each chip itself is named twice (once by the parent part, and once by the chip itself) while the module is only named once (within the actual chip).

In retrospect, I should have started from the bottom and worked my way up. I\u0027m sure there\u0027s a way to automate this (Notepad\u002B\u002B has a feature for recording and executing macros, for one thing), but it didn\u0027t take more than a few minutes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sewer Urchin","CreatedById":127771,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-30T17:53:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi, I am loving the HUD so far!
