Basket size is just enough for kerbal body to squeeze in, but not enough to let the helmet through. When the point is scored, the section of the court containing the basket is jettisoned to the side, opening a new area with a new basket. If you don\u0027t manage to get kerball though the enemy team, and enemy team manages to push your kerball out of the court, the game stops and the turn goes to the enemy team, who selects their own kerball and here it goes. \u003Cp\u003EEdit: The team that first jettisons the last basket wins and walks away through the opening.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI say it\u0027s brilliant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAttach the baskets to decouplers and allow the use of RCS packs, and I think we have a winner. GO KERBIN KRAKENS! xD\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
