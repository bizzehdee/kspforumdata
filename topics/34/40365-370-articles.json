Well I finally went back to my cloud scoop and began getting some of the infrastructure in place to support it (prior to that it was a single use tool essentially). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe most important thing it needed was an antimatter station as no other source of power has proven good enough for flight that deep in Jool\u0027s atmosphere. I launched the MKI collector below which came in two parts for easier launch and had it all set up but after I switched away I returned to find it a pile of debris drifting (rapidly) apart. I still don\u0027t know what happened but I\u0027m assuming from the parts that were left it was an explosion of the AM tanks. It had more than enough power so my guess was maybe an issue with either the way the tug disconnected (decoupled rather than docking port) or the fast there were docking ports between the tanks and the reactor. Either way I then built the MkII as a single piece and it seems to be working beautifully. I have also now designed the MkIII which if it works will have an extra 35 collectors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe experimental scoop was then deployed to Jool and rendezvoused with the station and took on a good load of antimatter. It uses a thermal turbojet on liquid fuel for self propulsion in space. From there it simply descends into Jool\u0027s atmosphere, turning on the thermal turbojet (atmospheric) to power directly downwards as hard as it can. It then simply levels off at about 50 meters and starts scooping He3. The flight is so stable it usually only has an ascent/descent speed of \u002B/-0.01m/s and can thus be left alone and checked on every 15 minutes or so. At the moment it scoops about 108 an hour. During yesterdays trial I took 28,000 antimatter which was enough for just shy of two hours flight, plus ascent and I still had about 5000 left in the tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaking orbit is embarrassingly easy with antimatter... I just fly up at about 80\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 East on full throttle... this gets you most of the way out the atmosphere as it is and should even get an apoapsis above where you need. As you cross into the thinnest parts the thermal turbojet will start to overheat as it has no pre-coolers so you switch to liquid fuel for the rest of the ascent and completion of the orbit. When doing so the scoops can be set to Hydrogen, continually replenishing the tanks even in the thinnest whiff of atmosphere. By the time it makes a 500,000m orbit the small liquid fuel tank should still be over half full.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what next? Well I need a craft to shuttle between the scoop in low Jool orbit, the AM station higher up and my station around Laythe, bringing AM to the scoop and then carrying the He3 back to Laythe. Shouldn\u0027t be hard and will probably be plasma thruster powered, though it could also be refueled by the scoop and also run on thermal engines. After that I need to refine the scoop further - it\u0027s just a prototype really. I want the final one to have over 4x the scoops if possible so it can fill 400\u002B an hour. The problem is as it gets heavier it also gets slower which leads to each scoop being less efficient. At some stage I\u0027m going to hit a wall where adding an extra scoop doesn\u0027t really increase what it can bring in per second. I may also get to the stage where it can\u0027t actually even fly that low down, or can\u0027t ascend so I\u0027ll just have to see if it\u0027s even possible to meet my objective.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/vYHFD\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
