Easiest way (especially now that we have SelectRoot as stock) is to test just the stage itself. With 0.90 you should be able to set the primary part of the stage as the \u0022root part\u0022 (so for a stack based stage it might be the decoupler or top-most fuel tank, for a radial stage like an SRB, I\u0027d just go with the SRB. Though radial ones you may want to test completely separate due to symmetry issues, in which case there is always subassemblies) and pick up the rest of the ship so it isn\u0027t attached. Then run the test on just that stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt requires a bit of work, but it\u0027s easier than doing a bunch of test flights generally and once you know a configuration works (like if a booster always recovers fine with two radial chutes but not one) then you can just use that configuration in the future without worries.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe one day I\u0027ll see about splitting it into stages automatically, but I don\u0027t have the time currently.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LuvSicGrl","CreatedById":125392,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-16T15:53:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eeither way imma use the mod \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E Fun times \u0026lt;3\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magico13","CreatedById":73338,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-16T16:00:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LuvSicGrl\u0022 data-cite=\u0022LuvSicGrl\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI would like to ask a question i\u0027m sorry if it has been answered before.

StageRecovery is designed to circumvent that issue by checking if there are enough parachutes for it to land safely (or if the vessel is controlled and has fuel\u002Bengines). If the part wouldn\u0027t land safely then StageRecovery won\u0027t recover it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis mod doesn\u0027t change anything in the current recovery system, so if you land a craft yourself it will function exactly as it would in Stock KSP. In fact, StageRecovery uses the exact same distance requirements as Stock KSP, so if you drop a booster on the other side of Kerbin you won\u0027t receive as many funds back as if you had dropped it right on the KSC (but you\u0027ll never actually get 100%, just 98%).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn short, StageRecovery only supplements the current system and does nothing to impede it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Also, \u0022drop a booster\u0022 or a \u0022stage\u0022 are just colloquialisms of mine. StageRecovery works on any type of vessel. If you have a space station full of Kerbals and Science that has parachutes on it, you could deorbit it and StageRecovery will recover it (and all the science and kerbals, though there\u0027s a bug right now that will cause the kerbals to lose their experience). The \u0022normal\u0022 usage is recovering spent stages/dropped boosters (or for some people, fairing halves. Yes, you heard correctly, some people recover their fairings... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E ), so that\u0027s what I tend to use in conversation.
