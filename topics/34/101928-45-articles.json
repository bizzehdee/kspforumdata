When this happens, I no longer have access to inventories on command pods. (Seat 0, Seat 1, ect)\n\u003E \n\u003E Close down and reboot KSP and it\u0027s all loaded correctly.\n\nStrange possibly related problem. I added a few items to the inventory for a pod and it showed up fine for the kerbal in that seat, but when I EVA the kerbal\u0027s inventory is suddenly empty and when they go back into the pod the inventory is also empty.\n\nIt seems to be isolated to the UKS Training Akademy module...another strange thing about that module is you do not see the crew inside and when you EVA them the focus stays on the ship instead of going to the EVA kerbal.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-27T21:48:10Z\u0022 title=\u002205/27/2015 09:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Smurfalot**"},{"CreatedByName":"Vorg","CreatedById":74652,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T23:26:58Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Hi Vorg!\n\u003E To attach solarpanels you need to press \u0022x\u0022 while the panel is green coloured - the mouse icon will change to an electric screwdriver if done right. I recommend to try it on the launchpad first...\n\u003E \n\u003E To capture a free floating part i recommend to get in range and match up speed with soft touches of the control. Bring up your inventory with \u0022tab\u0022 and press \u0022r\u0022 to disable the EVApack. Then press and hold \u0022g\u0022 hover cursor over the part and drag\u0026drop it to your inventory.\n\u003E \n\u003E To get a snap for surface mounted part you need to use the electric screwdriver - then press \u0022r\u0022 - its not possible with the wrench.\n\u003E \n\u003E hope this helps to use one of the best mods properly...\n\nI already knew that stuff. You have to hold the key down to attache. If you let up too soon, it just places the part. I placed 2 panels and went for the 3rd when the first 2 started floating off. I found I wasn\u0027t holding the key long enough. But the problem was, I could not interact with the floating panels. I was close enough to bump them, but could not grab them. I could pick up loose parts at KSC, but not floating in space. And I know the screwgun is for snap to parts. I got a chute to snap to. But a docking port jr didn\u0027t want to snap to the mount point. I just attached where ever it was regardless of which tool I used. I was trying to connect to a round structure on the runway in sand box to test attaching to atachment points."},{"CreatedByName":"Mitchz95","CreatedById":82292,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T00:45:42Z","Content":"Do the explosives detonate upon taking damage from a fall or collison?"},{"CreatedByName":"curiousepic","CreatedById":60039,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T03:29:38Z","Content":"Apologies if this is covered somewhere as I\u0027m finding a search difficult:\n\nIf I have a container (in this case a Cargo Transfer Bag with TACLS supplies) in the \u0022seat\u0022 inventory of a part, is there any way to have it be considered a resource available to that part?
