I had a KW fairing issue a while back, turned out TE was messing with the decouple force. If not, it\u0027s probably worth asking in the KW thread - as was pointed out to me earlier, FAR is an aerodynamics mod. It has literally zero effect in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, your ascent method is what\u0027s screwing you up - you have too high a TWR at launch (especially with 2/3 throttle.. that\u0027s not just FAR, that\u0027s bad rocket design - you obviously don\u0027t need the extra 1/3 throttle, why have an engine that can give it? It\u0027s just extra weight to carry up) and are moving too fast and too high at the gravity turn. Seriously - ferram mentioned a very slow turn starting at about 50 m/s and not straying very far from prograde. This is what you should do. In actual fact, a bigger and heavier cargo (like nuclear reactors) can help with stability as it moves the CoM higher making it easier to control, as you found out. When your CoM is too low, you\u0027ll have trouble, especially with that ascent profile. You probably want to start turning at around 1km high or so - that should be when you\u0027re travelling between 50 and 100 m/s, providing your TWR is around 1.3 at launch (which it should be) and start turning veeeeeery gradually. Once you\u0027re about 10 degrees off vertical, I find it\u0027s actually better to turn off SAS and let the rocket fall into the correct angle by itself. By about 35km high, the air is much thinner so you\u0027ll need it back on to stabilise you again. Also, you do have stuff like fins at the bottom, right? They help point your rocket right tremendously.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry these and ferrams tips and see if they help.
