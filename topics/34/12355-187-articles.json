Using the Return from Moon option of the Maneuver Planner to return from Mun appears to generate erroneous maneuver nodes. Starting from a 100 km equatorial orbit around Mun and requesting a 100 km periapsis gives a maneuver that results in an orbit that intersects Kerban. Reduce the Prograde velocity change by about 6 m/sec and the orbit grazes the Kerban surface. Another 6 m/sec and the periapsis is approximately 100 km. If you request a 300 km periapsis, the maneuver planner gives you approximately a 100 km periapsis. Repeat the experiment from Minmus and a 100 km request yields an orbit with a 100 km periapsis and a 300 km request yields a 300 km periapsis. It appears that the initial conditions for the Mun computation must be incorrect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.) When making inclination changes with the maneuver planner, you can match the orbital plane of another object orbiting the same central object or at some angle to the equatorial plane. There does not appear to be an option to set an inclination with respect to the central object\u0027s orbital plane. This option is equivalent to the equatorial plane, if the rotational axis of the central object is normal to its orbital plane, but this situation is rather rare in the real world. (Earth\u0027s orbital plane i.e. the ecliptic is tipped 23 degrees from the equatorial plane.)

First stage is a FASA tank, same capacity though and I like the markings. No flips, no shimmies, no problems. Oh! No fins, either.
