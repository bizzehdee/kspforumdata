Meanwhile, if you \u003Cem\u003Edo\u003C/em\u003E take it out, it just means I have to slap that annoying MechJeb case on literally everything again. I was enjoying not having to do that. (Speaking of which, anyone know how to turn off the lights on it? That green emissive is pissing me off.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERT should remain exclusively about connection rules. Don\u0027t gimp the computer to \u0022match\u0022 the horrid new SAS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Etl;dr Flight Computer != Stability Augmentation System\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m going to start witht he new SAS system. It isn\u0027t meant to replace MJ, the RT FC, or your ability to fly. It is meant to represent your pilots gaining experience and being able to take over some of your flight tasks for you. I for example use the new SAS and hold prograde to help my gravity turns a lot when my rockets aren\u0027t balanced right and nose down too much on their own. In the real world people don\u0027t rely on a single autopilot system alone for the entire journey, and you shouldn\u0027t either. Look up mini transat or the volvo ocean race. They are very long single person sailing races, and the regs require multiple autopilots as backups. As your pilot gains the ability to hold direction in different directions, you should play with them and try to find good use cases for them, instead of saying it sucks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can field one complaint about the new SAS though. For some reason it appears that all my vessels, SAS equiped or not, attempt to spawn themsevles with SAS turned on, which is fine if I have sas, because I canturn it on and off again to make sure it off and not messing with MJ, but if there is no SAS on-board it nerfs MJ, which is annoying. RT FC still appears to be able to push a craft with SAS \u0022turned on\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry adding FAR, DRE, TAC-LS, SNACKS! etc and all of a sudden probes become far more relevant. I had a lot of fun setting up a rudimentary comm sat net with stayputniks early in the tech tree. All I did was mod the cfg to place the stayputnik earlier in the tree (at the start actually because manned missions before probes? seriously squad?) and I\u0027ve had a great time playing. I\u0027ve launched far more probes then kerbals, and with final frontier and the new experience system, I actually care about kerbals instead of abandoning them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstead of complaining about a mod designed to add difficulty and challenge to the game that it is too difficult and challenging, why not embrace the challenge fully. Add a few more difficulty mods to your install and then get back to me on if you think probes are nerfed, and useless.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso the flight computer in RT is fricken amazing. Sure, it doesn\u0027t have the same level of control as MJ, but it is far less buggy then MJ, just like in real life. I have had it plenty of times where MJ fail, will not co-operate, or does something completely un-expected. Enter RT with the flight computer and I\u0027ve literally saved both manned and unmanned missions by transferring control authority to the KSC. That alone is a pretty good reason to keep manned vessels in contact with the KSC. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo walker, what you just described should be fairly easy to do. All that needs to be done is reverting the tracking station functionality to completely un-upgraded, or make the new features of the upgraded tracking center only active if there is an RT connection. This method also has the advantage of being easy to disable via RT settings (hopefully) for sandbox games. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich reminds me....feature request? Ability to temporarily suspend RT? I like to prototype my probes, and don\u0027t want to have to set up comms first just to test out a lander probe. I play in a sandbox save for that, and don\u0027t want to have to go folder digging and moving each time I want to switch saves.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-09T18:58:35Z\u0022 title=\u002201/09/2015 06:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Errol\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nitrous Oxide","CreatedById":131998,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-09T18:57:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Errol\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Errol\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ETry adding FAR, DRE, TAC-LS, SNACKS! etc and all of a sudden probes become far more relevant.

Don\u0027t get me wrong... my current save has 34 active satellites... except none of them have any point other than boosting range/some science experiments I decided to split over multiple satellites. RT is a mod designed to add realism, not difficulty. Probes aren\u0027t this hard to deal with in the real world where you have a competent interface and the ability to pre-program them (and more than one ground tracking station). But in RT if you lose connection before finalizing your orbit, \u003Cem\u003Egod forbid your software engineers were competent enough to program a failsafe or something\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, maybe I am complaining about RT, because it\u0027s looking more and more like a bunch of needless artificial difficulty for people who want some \u0022challenge\u0022 completely unfounded in reality. I guess if the FC changes, I\u0027m switching to AntennaRange.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChallenges are cool and all, but really, when you\u0027ve already accomplished a bunch in the game, just having to start over because of 0.90 and deal with all these downgrades is kinda lame. It\u0027s not even hard, just a waste of time. I don\u0027t \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eneed\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E maneuver nodes or the Flight Computer, but they keep the game enjoyable and not a damn chore. Seriously, I\u0027ve played nearly 500 hours. Nothing is hard anymore. Taking away the ability for my Stayputniks to use the maneuver nodes that I just paid money for, that\u0027s a good way to get me to uninstall this mod. I don\u0027t want to spend weeks grinding through the start, I want to colonize Duna and stuff... :\\\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBesides, the only changes the new SAS brings that is good is not needing a mod for auto-pilot, and having manned pilots have an actual skill. However, it\u0027s a poor implementation for probes (seriously, it can hold prograde and retrograde, but can\u0027t figure out how to hold 90 degree offsets of those two? What kind of incompetent programmer...)... if the FC gets a rework, please, for my sanity, allow the FC to be upgraded based on what tier of probe you have unlocked.
