The decoupler system used for many \u0022secondary payloads\u0022 is really quite lightweight - in some cases the entire satellite weighs less than 10kg! Even for the larger decoupler systems the actual decouplers themselves are pretty lightweight, much lighter than is modelled in KSP - still small enough to not even be included separately in the total vehicle weights listed for the various Apollo missions due to \u0022decimal truncation\u0022 (in other words, the actual decouplers for the SI/SII interstage weighed less than 10kg.) Now, KSP models more than just the decouplers themselves in the \u0022decoupler\u0022 parts - it includes the interstage structural and other elements aside from the ullage motors/fuel as well.

TR-18A and TR-18D seem the obvious choice - the are the same size and have the same decoupling force (250) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow there\u0027s a big aside here. As is not uncommon in KSP, the physics of decouplers is a bit wrong. The 250 which we thought was Joules, is actually not joules at all. It\u0027s added as an instantaneous force during decoupling, and in the wrong mode. If you have phys warp active you\u0027ll end up with extra force for free. Not exactly ideal. Anyhow, have reported the bug the the KSP overlords plus how to fix it so hopefully it will be fixed in the next version. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyhow the upshot is that all the forces as specified by ejectionForce are actually impulses, and the real impulse is (ejectionForce * 20) Ns. (newton . second). The 20 is because our standard physics frame is 0.02 s, plus masses are in ton, so you end up * 1000.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mass of the 18D is 0.075, whereas the 18A is 0.05. The difference is the 18D has twice the \u0027decoupling aparatus\u0027 that the 18A has, so we can assume the mass is made up of 1 or 2 \u0027decoupling apparatus\u0027 massing 0.025 (25kg - seems reasonable) plus 25kg of impulse producing mass. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the ISP of our separators ends up as 5000 / 25 kg / g = 20s. This is pretty pathetic really. So that line of investigation is a bit of a fail, but lets run with it anyhow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext task: how does the decoupling apparatus scale with size? well you\u0027d expect the mass of the apparatus to be proportional to the area of the surface, or to the diameter squared. Furthermore, the separators will have twice the decoupling apparatus of the decouplers. If we then take off the push mass from the existing decouplers, and then divide the remaining mass by the area we end up with a range between 20kg/m^2 and 76kg/m^2, with an average of 43 and a median of 39. There\u0027s no real relationship between the size of the decoupler and this figure, the values are more or less random. I\u0027ll use a value of 40kg/m^2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow well does this fit?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEquivalents of the TR-2V and TR-XR about right. TR-2C is 30%, 18A 48%, and 18D 64% more massive. The equivalents of the Rocomax and the 38D are about 55% of the standard parts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess it\u0027s not TOO bad, but not exactly ideal. Std dev in fit is 0.42\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo scrap all that and go for something very simple: Mass is proportional to the area of the decoupler, no tricky bits. This actually gives a better fit - stdev 0.26, most of the stock decouplers are \u002B/- 25% of their calculated mass, the main outlyiers being 18A at 62% of the calculated mass, and the XL at 139%.
