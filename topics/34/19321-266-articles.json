And well aware too that even 100m/s is quite fast, 360km/h, 194nm/h, I understand that at this speed its pretty much a tube bullet cutting through the air. One common misunderstanding mos people is not aware in aviation, during more stable situations, we control height by the throttle, control speed by pitch attitude. For example if coming for a landing , you\u0027re too low, you throttle up and slow down the descent rate, if coming too slow you pitch down to immediately gain speed. I\u0027m pretty sure this apply to most planes too, even airliners though I\u0027ve never piloted them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother cool way of loosing airspeed while quickly descending, is gliding sideways while pointing down (or up to lose more airspeed), then you somewhat control your roll to maintain direction, this is pretty cool and works with FAR. I\u0027m pretty sure you never see planes going S, crazy sideway climbs or whatever to lose airspeed. But again, this is for most general aviation planes, jet fighters and acrobatic can do that stuff, supersonic planes too must have quite different behavior.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway I find it weird that even on low altitudes its very hard to slow down naturally, I literally just throttle all the way down, could cut off engines, and it would barely lose speed and altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow is a shot of my current working plane, its a pretty good design and flies wonderfully. Now I\u0027m almost able to come down for final approach at about 60m/s, which is close to the stable control limit, but still too fast, often having too use the drag parachutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother point too, flaps, while they drastically increase lift, and allow for lower angle of attack, should also drastically increase drag. For example on the shot, I\u0027m only 70m/s and still I think an angle of attack as little as 1\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe I\u0027m just misreading these drag values, afterall we can\u0027t compare KSP to regular planes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://postimg.org/image/rp2ow29pf/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s21.postimg.org/rp2ow29pf/screenshot1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry for the bad shot, I thought I had another one from the profile. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn another totally different note, ferram, Do you take into consideration that mach speed depends on atmosphere density?

I took a 30t plane near supersonic at 1000m and throttling off practically threw the pilots out the screen, but I agree that sometimes it does seem hard to lose speed when you\u0027re slower.
