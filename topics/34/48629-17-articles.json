The main FOOD section can be shut down in an emergency and just the SNACK/FOOD section run to keep 1 Kerbal alive (food only and some O2); but I dont use just ElecCharge to make Snack/Food - it also uses about 10 processes !\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo probly BIOMASS is used as you intended; the conversion rates may be different; I read yer BLOGS - very nice !\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also deleted BIOMASS Difficulty or just all of the data in the CFGs and made both just normal/easy; the reason for this is so I could code the part cfgs the way I wanted them to work; the difficulty cfgs were preventing that; it was just like customizing my own difficulty I guess.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the VAB exploding parts...and the coding...there may be some problems; deleting resources in a part file was a solution and only some parts work; like a greenhouse; I have a few other solutions I may try; resources are best in a part so you can see what is needed for a process; I finally got multiple processes in a part; but it really all boils down to one conversion code that most MODS seem to be using; just that the labelling is different; I cant get your code to work converting gasses to liquid form dont ask me why.
