Tried to land a ship last night at a flag I have planted about 2.5 km away from the pad at KSC that I\u0027ve designated as the landing field. There was nothing unusual about the landing; it was from a regular 100 km orbit, inclined maybe 2 degrees after returning from Duna. First off, the MJ didn\u0027t deploy the chutes until I was down to under 12 km. Then when the lander was still about 8 - 9 km up, it became apparent it was going to overshoot the landing field by a couple kilometers. MJ began a \u0022correction burn\u0022; in doing so, the autopilot titled the craft up around 90 degrees, almost perpendicular to the velocity vector, to try to correct. At one point the it was actually tilted up greater than 90 degrees while hanging under the chutes, trying to make that correction burn. At that point I got alarmed and tried to abort the auto land but just as I did so, my craft broke apart. The lander can snapped off the rest of the lander structure. Fortunately, there were enough chutes attached to it that I was able to land safely and recover the vessel but clearly something was amiss in the landing sequence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, I don\u0027t understand why it missed the landing so badly; the vessel mass, the number of available chutes, the engine thrust and fuel load were all available, and this was a very easy west-to-east landing approach. Second, having missed by a couple kilometers while hanging from parachutes at 8 - 10 km above the targeted landing site, why was MJ so aggressive in trying to \u0022correct\u0022 when the vessel clearly didn\u0027t have the lateral cross-range while under parachutes necessary to make it, to the extent that it broke the lander? When does MJ think to itself, \u0022This is as close as I\u0027m gonna get\u0022 and just put the thing on the turf rather than keep trying to correct?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-01T15:43:43Z\u0022 title=\u002201/01/2014 03:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 1, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by LameLefty\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bobe","CreatedById":95803,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-01T18:07:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have a fairly large ship that I\u0027m trying to send to Duna.
