I was looking at some of Alternis Kerbol\u0027s code earlier and I may be incorrect in my assumption that the time warp can only be edited in the flight scene. As it stands now it loads the data when a scene is loaded and doesn\u0027t touch anything before that, though what I think I\u0027ll do is change that so it just gets the defaults on startup, then loads data when it needs it on flight scene. I ran into massive problems implementing this feature so while it \u0022works\u0022 right now, its kind-of a train wreck behind the scenes. I would suggest editing the rates directly in your startup code, and I\u0027ll work to sort out my mess and have it automatically pull the default values from whatever they are, so mods that want to change them can do so before I go screwing with it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blizzy78","CreatedById":68543,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-02T15:20:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve noticed that in TimeControl.Update(), you are calling:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ERenderingManager.AddToPostDrawQueue(0, OnDraw);\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this correct?
