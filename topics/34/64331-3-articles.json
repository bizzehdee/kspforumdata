Last I checked, Principia attempts to simulate the entire star system; all I can think of when I see that is \u0022Jool and its moons are so going to fall apart in short order\u0022. And the performance considerations for that many objects all influencing one another... yeah. Better to keep all the celestials fully on rails, tbh. You could then still apply N-body physics to the player spacecraft (and thus also asteroids) themselves - and quite possibly with higher precision, because you save so much performance by not calculating the celestials.
