But originally I had new ribbons in mind. If we use the same ribbons twice, maybe it\u0027s doable.\u003Cp\u003ECloning the ribbons is not possible without changing the ribbon codes which introduces a very difficult problem later on. All ribbon codes must be unique; changing this would make a complete redesign neccessary that cost weeks of work with questionable success. But different ribbon codes for different gender are not a good idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGender specialized ribbon codes are not that easy to implement, because we just cannot clone them. Alternatively a second list for checking if a ribbon is already awarded is an option (a list for males and another for females); but then the check is done outside the achievement ribbon code and we can\u0027t change the wording by just changing the text. Ok, we can change the wording if we change the achievement class to generate the text for each kerbal.

The crashes always seem to happen when I recover a flight and FF ques up to determine the ribbons that should be awarded. I suspect FF might have a memory leak. As a workaround I started using OpenGL to cut down on RAM use, but you might need to check that out.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T17:45:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOpened a support thread with logs - game crashed when entering the pod, at least I can remember it this time happening then.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/121143-logs-from-recent-crash-unable-to-locate-mod-at-fault?p=1936294\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1936294\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/121143-logs-from-recent-crash-unable-to-locate-mod-at-fault?p=1936294\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1936294\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bolverker","CreatedById":139861,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T18:01:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello, first off thank you for making this mod it\u0027s awesome. Definitely adds a lot more immersion to the game. That being said ever since I converted my save file over to the new format KSP now takes about a minute to start loading or longer and hangs and goes white into not responding. I select wait for program and eventually it comes around, but after that the game will additionally hang when I am playing it as well at times. It has got to the point where I have to just not run FF. Any idea on how I can fix this? Also let me know what I can do if you need more info.

If you decide to do that, you MUST make it optional, because to an American at least, it would be completely stupid. The orange jumpsuit has a meaning. It means you\u0027re a civilian, not military. That\u0027s why a lot of the later Shuttle pilots had orange suits but none of the Apollo astronauts did. It\u0027s not a fashion statement, it\u0027s a uniform. White=military, Orange=civilian.
