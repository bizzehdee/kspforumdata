I must disagree with that last statement.\n\nI was under the impression that the modded tech trees were supposed to augment and add to the Stock Tree, not replace it, including the positioning of the nodes (?); this tech tree does not follow this convention.\n\nI have no clue where you got that idea or convention.  This tree replaces the stock tree completely. In fact, that\u0027s why I made it and shared with the community.\n\nCommander Zeta\n\n\u003Cfont color=\u0022#0000ff\u0022\u003EZeta, this tree is not everybody\u0027s cup of tea.  A lot of people like the concept, foreign as it may be to the stock tree.  Personally, I believe it would be nice if one could choose the type of tech tree you want to play straight from stock.  The tech tree can completely change your gameplay experience.\u003C/font\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"Probus","CreatedById":102512,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-13T02:22:47Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 3 hours ago, odya-kun said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Guys, do you have any thoughts (configs?) about UKS integration? I made a very draft config (without Extraplanetary Launchpads yet). Mostly cloned from CTT one, but with some fixes.\n\u003E \n\nThat looks really good odya-kun.  I am looking forward to integrating it to see how it fits!  I need to move some ETT nodes around for better base and colonization support."}]}
