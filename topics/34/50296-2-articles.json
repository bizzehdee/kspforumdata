I think possibly because a lot of parts are missing breakingForce entries, and the values seem to make less sense than crashTolerance? Some parts have insanely high bFs...but that\u0027s worth thinking about!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are three issues, AFAIK, with parts \u0022being destroyed when they shouldn\u0027t.\u0022 (1) was the explode on launch bug: fixed. (2) is the gTolerance is too low, which the multiplier helps with some (but really, we need a new formula, as you say, although breakingForce is not, I think, quite right for it). (3) is that we shouldn\u0027t even be looking at current craft acceleration but the force the part is currently experiencing (a probe core squished between two tanks and two mainsails running full blast will experience 0 acceleration, but tons of force).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esidfu, VetTech doesn\u0027t actually rearrange the tree *nodes* at all, it just changes the TechRequired for parts. So a part may require a different node.
