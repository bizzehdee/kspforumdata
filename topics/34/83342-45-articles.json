E: Which window? The main one? Or the rename window? E2: I know the reason. It\u0027s the code that keeps the window centered. I\u0027ll fix it, for at least that window. Not sure what\u0027s wrong with rollout. I\u0027m not seeing anything there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EE3: Fixed the rename window in the latest dev version. There were two codes fighting to keep it centered and neither was happy with each other. That could happen in one or more other places as well. If you find more flickering, let me know which windows are doing it and what other KCT windows are open.
