So more or less they should be 2-4 times lighter than comparable heatshields. However even with the same mass as heatshields they might be better since a spacecraft is not receiving heat in upper atmo and can be less slim or even not aerodynamic. Then heat shields are very light in KSP compared to RL:\n\n1.25m = 0.3 t\n\n2.5m = 1.3 t\n\n3.75m = 2.8 t\n\nMy 180m diameter stork ballute has a reference area of 20573m2 so in RL it would be good for total mass of 27.5t and it would weigh around 3t. The problem with even bigger diameters is that we are approaching KSP physics bubble and weirdness can happen so I would opt for smaller diameters that are heavier than in RL but also have much better stopping power. Then I guess it would be good to balance them against heatshields.\n\nSo for example:\n\n1.25m ballute - 0.6t - 50m diameter - good for 15t, average for 30t etc\n\n2.5m ballute - 1.35t - 90m diameter - good for 30t, average for 60t etc\n\n3.75m ballute - 2.7t - 150m diameter - good for 60t, average for 100t etc\n\nNow we could i.e. use hyperEdit to measure m/s2 deceleration at given altitude and body. Then for example 1 m/s2 would be a good score etc.\n\n(stork ballute - 3.75-5m custom shape - 3. - 180m diameter - good for 90t, average for 150t)\n\nThe other thing is how ballute can interoperate and exchange heatshield (since aerocapturing usually means destroying ballute from overheating).
