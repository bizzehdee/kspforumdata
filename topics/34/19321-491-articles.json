What I am trying to do here is to get an understanding of why things behave in the way the do and whether that is the intended behaviour.

Why does that happen and how to deal with it? What is the realistic balance of stability and control authority then? As I understand most of real life planes do pitch down when the main wing stalls because delaying the stall of the tail plane and the elevator means maintaining pitch control authority for longer. Right? Then does the difficulty of stalling an average kerbal plane only come from the over stability?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf kerbal planes do not achieve the critical angle of attack even at maximum control deflection then where does the oscillation come from? For example roll the plane on its side and pull back on the elevator gradually increasing the deflection to maximum and keeping it there as if you want to make a very tight turn. Unless the plane is just heavy and bulky it is very likely to oscillate noticeably and constantly in the pitch channel. Even if you keep the controls steady for a minute this may not stop at at all.

In my hard, 100\u002B mod career game, I had an early jet plane could not take off, as it insisted on spinning out on flat ground around 50-80m/s with no control input. The stability derivatives were all green at the default Mach 0.35, but in the 0.15-0.20 range, several turned red, including Xu. The cheatsheet I\u2019ve written down from some of the guides on this forum says that positive Xu means there is a bug. Figuring another mod might be an issue, I downloaded a fresh install of KSP and manually installed FAR (and the dependencies) from SpaceDock. The craft still had the issue and I started playing with individual parts to isolate it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI have found that there are several parts that appear to have a positive Xu at Mach 0.35 when initially placed, including the spaceplane cockpits, some landing gear, and cargo bays (not an exhaustive list). It will become appropriately negative if the parts are rotated. They all seem to seem to be parts with aerodynamic shapes/small cross sections perpendicular to the direction of travel so I would expect drag increase with increased speed to be small, but not for it to be the inverse! However, I am not an aerodynamic expert like you are, perhaps this is somehow expected behavior, or perhaps something wrong with just my computer?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4MigLm2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00224MigLm2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a result of this toying around, I have also found that the SPH FAR window will freeze, go blank, and requiring exiting and re-entering the building if you ask it to calculate stability derivatives when there are no parts placed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI know that most people don\u2019t build single part planes or calculate the stability derivatives of nonexistent parts. However, in the first case, adding more parts doesn\u2019t seem to fix the issue, only mask it by outnumbering the bad parts with good ones, which can lead to problems with small planes and at low speeds.

I think I found a bug: Placing M-2x2 Structural Panels\u00A0at the front of a rocket caused a pitch down moment at high angle of attack, making the rocket very difficult to flip when it\u0027s traveling at high speed.\u00A0Placing them in the back (like a lawn dart) caused a pitch up moment at high angle of attack, which made the rocket easily spin out of control.\u00A0I am using KSP 1.1.2 \u00A0on Windows\u00A0with Ferram_Aerospace_Research-v0.15.6.5_Knudsen, and no other mods.\u00A0I tested this\u00A0using the ksp.exe and ksp_x64.exe;\u00A0I assume ksp.exe is 32 bit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.

The wikipedia page on stalls says that some planes, notably T-Tailed planes, experience \u0022deep stall\u0022, where turbulent air from the main wings blankets the rudder, and makes it ineffective. Is this effect modeled in FAR?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. Sometimes, when I move a wing around, the static analysis graph shows two stalls, like a staircase, one after the other. Usually, throwing out the wing, then grabbing it again from the parts menu fixes this, so there\u0027s only 1, clean, stall. Also, when i move a wing, then immediately run a static analysis scan, i get wrong info. waiting a bit before running the scan, and/or running the scan again fixes this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6.
