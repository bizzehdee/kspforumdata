You\u0027ll still have to experiment with how far of a lead ahead (if any) of the KSC you give your re-entry profile but I tend to overshoot just a bit. My secret to success is the ridiculously powerful airbrake that is included. That thing is as effective as a parachute partially deployed and does wonders for slowing you down. Spamming that thing lets me come down at very steep re-entry profiles and still hit the runway (or make emergency landings before electric charge runs out for example). The key for me is to come in slightly unrealistically steep, spam the airbrake and then manage landing and slowing down as best I can.

I have previously made an upscaled version of the closable aerodynamic docking adapter, and used that on the nose of the shuttle (rather than doing those off-axis dockings). I\u0027ve also added these ports to the top and bottom of the external tank, along with probe parts, batteries, etc., so that the ETs can be used in orbit perhaps as wet workshops. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut doing so caused a problem. I found that if I attach something to the bottom of the ET, it changes the function of the External tank\u0027s \u0022decouple\u0022 mechanism. Now instead of decoupling from the orbiter, it decouples the docking port off the bottom of the tank. Then it\u0027s impossible to seperate the tank from the orbiter. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also added a decoupling mechanism to the command pod section of the orbiter, so that I could strap on some rockets and abort and just seperate the crew cabin (and added parachutes to it). I found that when I hit abort, it actually wouldn\u0027t sever the external tank from the command pod (because of aforementioned problem). So this added decoupling module I added to the part file may contribute to these issues. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also have found it very difficult to fly the orbiter coming back. my strategy of multiplying values by 1.5 doesn\u0027t seem to have worked when it came to the flight characteristics of the shuttle.What should I be doing to the drag coeff and the deflectionliftcoeff? I left drag alone and multiplied the deflectionliftcoeff, but that doesn\u0027t seem to have worked. (shuttle flips around and wants to fly backwards). Also I don\u0027t have FAR or any other mods installed except for the inflatable parts and some rescaled stock parts I\u0027ve made myself. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway.
