Thanks~~\n\nNvrmnd.  They aren\u0027t showing when searching for CRY, or DEEP, or GLYK, but I did find them via brute force.  Maybe some keywords need to be set for searching?

In the meantime you can turn off the setting to integrate the pod with the temperature in the difficulty settings.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 6/9/2021 at 4:55 AM, DOOM89 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I can\u0027t get the mod to work properly, My kerbals freeze then after a vessel change become de-associated from the ship and i can\u0027t thaw them apart from at the space center, and even if they stay associated i get an error when thawing them and and the thaw is aborted...\n\u003E \n\nNo logs = No support, sorry."}]}
