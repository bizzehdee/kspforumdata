And you\u0027ve done a good job of noting the differences between versions. One thing I would note is that you should have a \u0022scope = default\u0022 reliabilityCurve. That was added after and its basically a fallback and TestFlight can\u0027t otherwise find a matching curve. Also TextFlightReliability_EngineCycle no longer needs to have a reliabilityCurve.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDefinitely yes.

Is it spamming it in the logs, or is it just every now and then?

Believe the number matches some parts, so could be dependent on the craft used. Have to conduct more tests. Wouldn\u0027t be surprised if such NREs were indeed benign, and could just disappear when all parts in a vessel are matched to a TestFlight config.

The problem is if KSP detects ANY changes in the part modules loaded vs what was saved on the craft, it attempts to rebuild the craft with the new part modules, and often fails to do so properly causing some part modules to be dropped.

I see \u0022du\u0022 gained under one scope have no effect with other scopes (intended for what I guess). That means parts abruptly change MTBF due to du change when transitioning from one scope to another, e.g. from X_atmosphere to X_space. But the transition is effectively smooth in reality. Even more smooth would be a transition from X_space to Y_space (changing SoI), but the amount of du gained while in space can be pretty high so the change is really sharp in TestFlight (of course, if both X_space and Y_space are defined, though one may be substituted with the \u0022default\u0022 scope).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan\u0027t see if a mechanic to address smooth changes in scope is already present. If not, I would allow some \u0022transfer\u0022 of du to adjacent scopes (similar to what exists for similar parts). Or, would try a different approach, e.g. from atmosphere to space as a function of current altitude, or of pressure; from one to another SoI based on distance and ratio of the bodies GM (gravitational parameter).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Agathorn","CreatedById":99662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-18T18:03:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey all just a quick update on \u0022Why so long till another version!?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been working on a fairly comprehensive revamp of how parts get attached inside TestFlight which will open the doors for seamless interoperability with other mods that implement \u0022dynamic\u0022 parts, such as RealFuels, Procedural Parts, TweakScale, etc. This has taken a lot of work and a lot of testing, but I think I can see the finish line ahead.

Apparently i\u0027m a total moron and when I released 1.2, I forgot to update the mod on KerbalStuff. If you downloaded it from Github you are good, but if you downloaded form KerbalStuff then you got the old 1.1 version. So sorry! I have updated KerbalStuff now, and it should be good.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Eagle21221","CreatedById":106478,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-27T15:45:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust wondering what you would think about adding a feature that with time and experience points would allow you to upgrade isp, thrust, maybe gimble, alternator, energy storage, solar panel efficiency?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Agathorn","CreatedById":99662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-27T20:44:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Eagle21221\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Eagle21221\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EJust wondering what you would think about adding a feature that with time and experience points would allow you to upgrade isp, thrust, maybe gimble, alternator, energy storage, solar panel efficiency?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERather outside the scope of this mod I think.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"undercoveryankee","CreatedById":103505,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-27T21:02:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Eagle21221\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Eagle21221\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EJust wondering what you would think about adding a feature that with time and experience points would allow you to upgrade isp, thrust, maybe gimble, alternator, energy storage, solar panel efficiency?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf RealFuels is present, most engines will have a choice of RF tech levels, and better versions will be available as you enable more tech levels through the tech tree. I could see requiring a minimum level of testing before an engine could be deployed at the highest unlocked tech level, or even giving a very-well-tested engine early access to the next tech level.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the obvious way to do that would require RealFuels to know about TestFlight, and that would have the potential to annoy people who want to use RF without TestFlight. Probably better to keep reliability and performance separate, maybe with some way to turn surplus flight data into science once a part has reached its max reliability.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
