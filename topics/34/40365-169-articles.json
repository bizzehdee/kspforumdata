A period like 3 days in game time is enough for ingame events to occur, as an example, a reactor that fails due to overheating and needs to wait for decay heating to subside could have real gameplay implications, 3 days is more than enough time to fall out of orbit, for example, but it\u0027s not enough time to actually waste the player\u0027s time warping through it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s important, in my opinion, for simulation games to convey ideas, you don\u0027t and will never get close to 100% accuracy but you want to get across an idea that people can recognise in a particular technology. Nuclear reactors have massive advantages in terms of power output and amount of fuel required to achieve that power output and indeed are very safe, especially the Molten Salt designs potrayed here - but you can\u0027t go just tinkering around with them any old way, you perform the maintenance by the book so you don\u0027t kill yourself.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-07T00:40:51Z\u0022 title=\u002212/07/2013 12:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 7, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Fractal_UK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Myrten","CreatedById":92200,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-07T02:27:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022forsaken1111\u0022 data-cite=\u0022forsaken1111\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat looks awesome!

Think about it. I only use the small fission reactors on either atmospheric research planes or one way probes. Neither situation do I have the need to refuel them as by they will have finished their mission long before they run out of reactor fuel. On larger vessels, I likely have larger fission reactors, so including the small reactors in maintenance cycles is not a problem. Also, by the time I need to refuel early tech fission reactors, I will very likely have developed better power systems. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my mind, the fusion reactors take the place of the smaller fission reactors in many applications once you unlock them. Fusion reactors have higher power output and easier refueling as well than their same sized counterparts in the fission reactor family. So once I\u0027ve unlocked fusion tech, I rarely find the need to include fission reactors as the sole power source on small vessels and probes. If I do use the small fission reactors after unlocking fusion reactors, it\u0027s usually for short duration missions (refueling not needed) or on larger vessels or stations (can just swap out reactors as needed or they have facilities for refueling/reprocessing).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know that just because I don\u0027t have the same issues with refueling small fission reactors that doesn\u0027t mean that the opinions that they are difficult or impractical to refuel are invalid.
