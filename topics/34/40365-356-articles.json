Can someone describe it - I know already that it doesn\u0027t work if it\u0027s not directly stacked behind an intake(which means I can\u0027t stack more than one of them behind an intake). What are its stats, how many do I need per engine? Or per intake? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInterstellar adds a module to turbojet, RAPIER, and B9 SABRE engines that adds additional heating to the engine at high airspeeds if you have intakes without precoolers. If you have a precooler behind every intake, only stock sources of heating will apply. If you have coolers on some intakes and not others, you will get extra heating as a function of the percentage of intakes that aren\u0027t precooled. The code doesn\u0027t care about the number of engines, only whether every intake is cooled.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"undercoveryankee","CreatedById":103505,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-01T15:48:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022nli2work\u0022 data-cite=\u0022nli2work\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E1. From my experiments precooler is per intake, and seem to only add altitude ceiling for stock turbofan (take off to 200km apoapsis without rocket engine at all). B9 Saber and Turbofan engines still overheat around 1300m/s and 23km\u002B... I\u0027m not even sure how Precoolers work at all. Nothing in the config files shows anything special that sets it apart from a normal part config.

The ModuleManager config with the changes is in Interstellar\u0027s folder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 200km apoapsis on airbreathing engines was probably the bug in FAR 0.12.5.2 that made those engines overpowered at high airspeed. The precooler code has no effect on how an engine\u0027s thrust varies with speed or altitude; it only governs whether you get Interstellar-applied heating in addition to stock heating.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deredere","CreatedById":96253,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-01T16:06:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Boamere\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Boamere\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EUnfortunately no, but a new save stops this from happening :/\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh.
