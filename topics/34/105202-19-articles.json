Think about it as \u0022that is part of\u0022. BTW, I took nothing as an insult as well so let\u0027s just keep constructive discussion.\n\nA constructive discussion is all I was doing and all I did. I made it a point to state it was nothing personal. And also said you have some interesting and good ideas. I simply stated my idea as to why I felt it doesn\u0027t fit as a part of this mod. I also stated that it would be a good mod implemented on it\u0027s own that could integrate with any life support mod out there as well.\n\nI absolutely love Roverdude\u0027s work. And like you I like mods to fit my gameplay as best as possible. If he implements this or some form of it great. I\u0027m all for him doing what he feels like. And I\u0027m all for people getting the type of mods and gameplay they desire. Might it affect my decision to use the mod? sure. Just the same as this mod affected my decision to move from TAC to USI life support. It doesn\u0027t mean anything is bad as I said. It just doesn\u0027t fit what I want to do.\n\nthis would be great as side mod to implement with integration for any life support as I\u0027ve seen a few people bring up stress mechanics before. I think someone either did or tried to do this with another mod in one way or another as well. And as a separate mod it would also allow more people to use it also, since each life support has a niche of users it seems. I also think it would allow for better implementation and development if it wasn\u0027t tied to a specific Lifesupport mod.\n\ni also said if it was implemented here that I would like it to be completely optional. As then people can choose to use it or not. Which is another reason I feel it\u0027s best served as a separate mod.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-15T21:53:06Z\u0022 title=\u002205/15/2015 09:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Hevak**"},{"CreatedByName":"johnsonwax","CreatedById":79077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T23:11:43Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The 4x mount from Universal storage looks like it works well holding 4 of the little green houses.\n\nUniversal Storage has a dedicated NOMS wedge."},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T23:21:28Z","Content":"So let me hop in and help keep things simple ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nI have no intention of expanding the scope of what this mod does.. it\u0027s a very basic, very simple (and somewhat whimsical) take on life support.

I don\u0027t see this as a big issue or anything, but it could add a bit of flavor to avoiding prolonged starvation. It could also be a sort of extrapolated \u0022hibernation\u0022 type mechanic.

Why have a life support mod if you aren\u0027t going to use it to support the life of your kerbals.\n\nwell as seen above Roverdude nixed it anyways, but I think you mistook my post, I may not have explained it well. Because it didn\u0027t remove any side effects in any way. What I meant was starved kerbals wouldn\u0027t instantly go back to work after being starved for awhile. They would take some more time to go back to work once fed or in the kerbin safe zone. So it actually added a bit more to the side effects not removed them. It would make one more likely to not starve them for long periods if they needed more time even after being fed to work again. \n\nFor instance right now on any mission that takes less than 15 days to get to destination and do whats needed why send supplies? If youre good enough and can go there and set up a decent reentry ( depends on reentry difficulty of course.) in one go you can fly ther and back with no supplies and get instant control back once in the kerbin safe zone. In my idea you wouldn\u0027t because they would need a period of time to regain consciousness or be well enough to function again, or however one wants to rationalize the time it takes for kerbals to function again after being fed. So even if you reach the kerbin safe zone after starving them you wouldn\u0027t gain control back in time to control anything on the ship. That\u0027s what i was going for. \n\nBut it\u0027s all good just was throwing some thoughts and ideas out there on some possible tweaks..\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-16T06:57:37Z\u0022 title=\u002205/16/2015 06:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Hevak**"},{"CreatedByName":"Dreadp1r4te","CreatedById":98426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T14:06:31Z","Content":"So when 1.0 came out, I resolved to add TACLS to my mod lineup to make things more... interesting.
