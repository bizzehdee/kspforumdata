Thus, I surface-attached some Separatrons, facing inwards, to them. However, I\u0027ve noticed that this sometimes generates phantom forces (or something), which cause MechJeb to muck up flying it (and end up careening it into the ground), when, without the Separatrons, it could fly the exact same rocket perfectly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason I say phantom forces is because it always seems to manifest itself as the prograde direction (and the rotation) veering slightly off what would otherwise be normal, and MechJeb then compensating, and compensating, and compensating, before going irretrievably off course and hitting the ground. Keep in mind that MechJeb is able to fly the rocket just fine without the Separatrons.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sidfu","CreatedById":70409,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-30T06:17:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eive only had 1 issue with this update and thats with the quad fairing when i revert back to hanger and sometimes when i revert to launch either some fairings be missing or hvae reverted to here small triange shape\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ralathon","CreatedById":71537,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-30T08:03:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sidfu\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sidfu\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eive only had 1 issue with this update and thats with the quad fairing when i revert back to hanger and sometimes when i revert to launch either some fairings be missing or hvae reverted to here small triange shape\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan confirm this issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESometimes when going back from a launch to the VAB/ loading up the craft, the interstage fairings with quad symmetry forget their shape and sometimes fail to appear at all.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
