Modders can (to a certain extent (reputation effects)) afford BPB releases, Squad cannot. We have no idea how much they\u0027re doing and not telling us because the work is still secret. Mods can be (and many are) much more open. Go ahead and appreciate the hard-working modders, but give Squad a bit of slack. They\u0027ve recently put 0.21 out for testing, they can\u0027t be slacking off that much \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Majiir","CreatedById":7550,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-01T10:09:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPlease, don\u0027t have this discussion here.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Arran","CreatedById":64656,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-01T11:42:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWith the overlay open in Mapmode, when i have hovered my mouse over the grid and get the Node Popup info in my screen, then when i return too my ship view, the Popup stays in my screen, replacing the mouse cursor.. to get back too a normal cursor i have too switch back too the mapmode, hold my mouse away from the HexGrid overlay, and then return again too the Shipview..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts a minor glitch, dunno others have it too, dunno if other have the same issue, havent read all the pages ..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the rest great work Majir, really like the new Overlay..\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"agentexeider","CreatedById":57184,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-01T11:56:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMajiir, I am still having lag issues when the overlay is on, the game studders when it\u0027s on and does not when i switch it off.
