In FSX, much of the texture/effects rendering is done on the CPU (due to the nature of DX9). As such, when things like shadows are being \u0027cast\u0027 on the model and on the ground, having badly generated polygons can create a higher workload. Having an optimized model, regardless of actual number of polys, results in the effects and textures being rendered in a much more predictable fashion without excess \u0027faces\u0027 that create complex problems that have to be solved for rendering to occur. One of the biggest places this occurs is when developers (in FSX) have modeled things on the inside of an airplane and don\\\u0027t properly set their visibility as such. Thus, the interior of the airplane is trying to be rendered, shadowed, and everything else every single frame, instead of just the exterior of the airplane. Additionally, there are other parts that are \u0027conditional\u0027 for rendering like the landing gear. You can specify that once the landing gear is up, the system doesn\\\u0027t have to render them anymore because they\\\u0027re enclosed by the landing gear doors, allowing for resources to be freed up elsewhere. While the GPU can handle many more polys much faster than the CPU, especially through use of shader models, a badly optimized model will still place a significantly higher load on the GPU than a properly optimized one, regardless of how many polys each has.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sarkun","CreatedById":10559,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-01-20T13:55:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022CardBoardBoxProcessor\u0022 data-cite=\u0022CardBoardBoxProcessor\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhelp. gonna stop work on the x-33 till this problem is fixed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=6049.0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=6049.0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eif anyone knows how to contact harvester or report this it would be nice of you \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHey, you are my hero, don\\\u0027t give up! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027ve done a shitload of work this week so I\\\u0027m taking a proper weekend off and will be working hard on my pack.
