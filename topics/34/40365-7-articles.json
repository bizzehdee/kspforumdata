Hybrid rockets use a solid fuel and a liquid oxidiser, this has huge advantages over entirely solid fueled rockets because it allows you to control the throttle of the rocket - add more oxidiser to go faster, shut the flow of oxidiser off to stop, etc. There is one particular type of hybrid rocket that I wanted to include: the Aluminium-Oxygen hybrid rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Aluminium-Oxygen rocket is by no means special in terms of its thrust performance, it has pretty abysmal specific impulse of 286s and thrust is nothing to write home about either BUT the huge advantage of this rocket is that most of the moon\u0027s crust is made of minerals containing large quantities of aluminium and oxygen. In other words, any site you choose to land at on the moon becomes a potential depot of fuel supplies. The low gravity of the moon also means that a potential rocket doesn\u0027t need to be particuarly stunning in terms of specific impulse and thrust performance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAluminium is fairly reactive so needs to be seperated from oxygen but this can be done with electrolysis and we\u0027ve already established that the science labs have this capability. Both here and in reality, the process is hugely energy intensive, which is why we need things like space nuclear reactors to actually get enough power to do this kind of thing. So now, if you land upon a world with a regolith based crust, you can electrolyse aluminium/oxygen fuel and power your munar operations with stunningly abundant by inefficient fuel!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is an example (I connected a nuclear reactor \u002B science lab up to a munar lander using the Kerbal Attachment System (KAS)):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/kOeeXtw.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022kOeeXtw.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Note: I made a mistake here. My science lab is not connected via any crossfeeding components to an oxidiser tank so I cannot actually produce any oxidiser but had I added a small tank with some oxidiser capacity to the rig, I could produce oxidiser into that and then transfer it manually into the aluminium/oxygen rocket.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor now, this particular form of In Situ Resource Utilisation is only available on the Mun and Ike.

Real life ion engines measure their thrust in fractions of newtons, not in fractions of kilonewtons. If you do a bit of maths, you\u0027ll see I can\u0027t make the plasma thrusters any more powerful, all the figures are there. You know the power output of the generators and power = thrust*specific impulse*g/2. The plasma thrusters have almost the exact parameters that a real plasma thruster would were it attached to a reactor of that size.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith all of the parameters in this mod, I\u0027ve used real numbers and real units for the specifications so I can\u0027t just \u0022cheat.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, as for the low thrust you were experiencing, the plasma thrusters rescale their thrust depending upon how much power they have. This is a way of making one engine useable and scalable with reactors of very different outputs. They are 60kN with a 2.5m antimatter reactor and the standard brayton turbine, that is what I use as the reference value. With a nuclear reactor, they are almost useless due to their low thrust. In real life, many-week long burns are not in problem, in KSP they are.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegardless, they are pretty decent with an antimatter ship as they give you a slightly different compromise with respect to thrust and delta-v, especially if you can deploy the electric generator upgrade. The upgrade for these engines is also amazingly powerful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Jason_25\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Jason_25\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. The requirement of needing thermal rockets attached to reactors is too rigid, especially with the weight of the reactors. Think of thin sci-fi spars, support struts, and nacelles that these will need to hang from in the presence of gravity and during ground testing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can\u0027t really avoid this.

If you don\u0027t attach it directly to the reactor - no heat, no thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegardless, why would you attach a huge and incredibly heavy nuclear reactor to a thin spur?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Jason_25\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Jason_25\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9.

The nuclear reactor upgrades take the thermal rocket nozzle up to about 2700s of specific impulse.

The biggest problem: The plasma thrusters have very low thrust and the jet needs an atmosphere so that leaves the thermal rockets as the only viable ones for a heavy ship with the warp drive. But with every combination of fuel that I have chosen, the resultant dv of the thermal rockets is worse than a comparable rocket with the stock nuclear engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe un-upgraded nuclear engines are slightly worse than the stock nuclear engines but offer the options of power generation as well. You can, however, use the scoop or various other ISRU technologies to refuel your ship all of which require quite a lot of power so aren\u0027t an option with the stock engines. All the other engines - the upgraded nuclear engines and the antimatter engines have so much more delta-v than anything in the stock game, they\u0027re not even comparable. The 2.5m antimatter reactor/engine can SSTO itself with an orange tank in Kerbin, using less than half the tank of the fuel and never going above 25% thrust.
