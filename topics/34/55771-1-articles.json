Depending on the case, it can be just annoying or really infuriating. That\u0027s what this mod try to fix. It will allow you to edit in almost any way you can think of your action group in flight. It can be used for small mistake on small probes (*cough* forgot to bind your solar panel before launch ... *cough*) or for large interplanetary vessel (there is filters to help you manage your action, even with high number of parts).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFeatures :\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Add, Remove, Edit your action groups in flight.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E \u003Cstrong\u003ENew 1.3.0.0\u003C/strong\u003E : Manage your action groups with the build in context click.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Add or remove all the symmetry counterparts of a part.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Mod friendly.

Search the parts concerned in the left panel. You can click on propulsion to filter parts. Once found, click on it, the available actions will appear. You see the \u0022Toggle Engine\u0022 that\u0027s what you looking for. Click on the right arrow next to it, to add it to the current action selected. When you click it, the right arrow become a left one : Click on it to remove this specific action. Do the same thing for the other engine. Now you have your two actions in the right panel. To add it to an action group, the third custom here, click on \u0022Custom 3\u0022 button below which enabled when you added action to the right panel.

Here when you look at your engine in the left panel, you see two with a little \u00223\u0022 next to them, and one with nothing. Click on that little \u00223\u0022. All the parts associated with that group are loaded. Now, in the left panel, click on the missing engine, and add \u0022Toggle engine\u0022. Your right panel shows three \u0022toggle engine now\u0022. To associate all the parts, just click on the \u0022custom 03\u0022 button at the bottom. The right panel disappear, your modified action group 03 is updated (\u0022Custom 03\u0022 must have a 3 in the action group grid at the bottom of the window).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E I want to delete an action group ?\u003Cbr\u003EImagine you want to delete all parts in the action group 3, you\u0027ve just created. Search your engine, and when you find one, click on the \u00223\u0022 button showing to the right of the part name. You just loaded the whole \u0022custom 03\u0022 group in the right panel. To delete it, just click on the top left button of this panel (\u0022Remove ...\u0022). A confirmation click is required, so click one more time to delete it. Your action group is deleted, you can see at the very bottom of the window that the custom03 doesn\u0027t show number in parenthesis anymore.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E New 1.3.0.0 : How to use the context UI mode ?\u003Cbr\u003EIt\u0027s pretty straightforward. Active the mod by right clicking your root part (your pod, sometimes a docking node). Select \u0022AGM : Enable\u0022. Now click on any part and you\u0027ll see all bindable actions. Click on an action. All other action will disappear and two new item will appear : \u0022General\u0022 and \u0022Custom\u0022. See that as folders, if you want to add your action to a numeral action group (Custom 05 by example) click Custom otherwise click General. Now once clicked the folder will unfold and show action groups. Click on one to bind the current action with this action group. Once clicked the action group will appear with asterisks : Your action is binded, you can close the context menu. A special case is if your part has any symmetry. In that case after clicking on the action group, two new choices will appear : \u0022Only this part\u0022 will only associate this part and action to the action group. \u0022This part and all symmetry\u0022 will find the same action in all the symmetry counter parts and add them as well. All menu act as folder who can fold and unfold : You selected \u0022Activate engine\u0022 on your engine, but wanted to select \u0022Toggle Engine\u0022, just click on the \u0022Activate Engine\u0022 button and you\u0027ll be back to the Action selection. It works at any level of the button hierarchy. Finally when you finished all your action group stuff, just click on your root and \u0022AGM : Disable\u0022. Your context menu are now back to normal. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E How can I add a part and all the symmetry counter parts ?\u003Cbr\u003EIf a part has any symmetry parts, a new button will be displayed next to the add or remove one : double arrow (\u0022\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0022 or \u0022\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0022).

I kind of love over-complicated and dense GUI with buttons that pops everywhere. Yeah i\u0027m probably not born to be an UI designer. =) But i will probably, when i come back from the world of Starbound, try to add a more compact and straightforward way to manage that. I understand that this kind of mod can be useful for heavy editing while parked in orbit, but not straightforward enough for short editing. The AotF author (macbernick) seems to be MIA, i will try to contact him anyway and see if he doesn\u0027t see problems with me reworking and incorporating his code. The license allow me to, but you know always nice to ask. In such case, we could have the best of both worlds.
