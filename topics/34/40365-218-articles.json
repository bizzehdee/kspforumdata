These are of interest in space travel because they require no fuel and no energy other than that required to point the sail in the proper direction. The downside of solar sails is that the thrust is minimum (0.08\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B5N/m^2), thus very large sails are required to produce useable thrusts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy interest in solar sails in KSP started when Honey Fox sent me some code after producing some initial work on solar sails, the problem, as it so often is in KSP, was that solar sails didn\u0027t really work because you can\u0027t timewarp fast enough for their tiny thrusts to actually do anything without the player waiting for days or weeks. I was fairly certain I could solve this particular problem by making the solar sails work at normal time acceleration (i.e. up to 100,000x) but development stopped at a half-finished state because I decided to work on other things and I had no suitable models anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of that changed a week or two ago when SasquatchM posted a topic on the development boards about a solar sail part he had made and requested some plugin code to control it. I pointed him toward the half-finished solar sail module found in Interstellar, I subsequently finished the work on this Module and indeed it now works properly during both physical and non-physical time acceleration. Subsequently, SasquatchM has generously allowed me to make use of his model for Interstellar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInitially, the sail will be purely solar powered - under those conditions it operates rather nicely up to about Kerbin\u0027s orbit and adequately out to Duna\u0027s orbit, it\u0027s brilliant for inner solar system missions - indeed I imagine it becoming a top method of propulsion for Moho and Low Kerbol transfers particularly, since these misisons have very high delta-v requirements. We do, however, have future plans for a laser part, which sort of like like the microwave arrays, could be used to beam power into the sail and permit higher thrust operation at far greater distances and making the sail far more versatile!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/iK4Fv\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

That solves basically every issue with implementing low thrust engines in KSP and for accelerations to high fractions of light speed for high fraction of light speed interstellar travel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHell, even with pre-warp KSPI tech, you could get delta-v\u0027s on the order of about 10% of light speed with the fusion engine at low throttle and at a mass ratio of 10, which would entail a interstellar travel speed of 2.5% of c for a manned interstellar voyage or return probe, 5% of c for a probe intended to actually land somewhere, and 10% of c for a flyby.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt kerbal scales (1/11 of real life), a flyby to a hypothetical Alpha Centurai analogue would take just over 3 Earth years discounting the acceleration period (which would probably be on the order of several months I grant you), a probe that needs to slow down would get there is about 6 years, and a manned mission would take 12 years each way, which is completely feasible for someone to wait through with 1,000,000x time acceleration. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReally the limiting factor on interstellar travel in KSP has always been the insane acceleration periods required to reach suitable velocities, and from the sounds of things your well on the way to solving that. Great job man!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, is there any chance this \u0022on rails\u0022 acceleration could be used to simulate orbital perturbations and/or exoatmospheric drag? Maybe even an alternate means of simulating N-body interactions by guesstimating the perturbations that would occur from such interactions based on the orbit\u0027s characteristics compared to the universal time (which can be used to extrapolate the relative positions of any celestial bodies in the kerbin system), and applying them in the same manner. Granted I have no idea whether that\u0027s even possible to do given how many calculations this would add to mantaining \u0022on rails\u0022 objects positions, or whether it would be accurate enough to provide a reasonable approximation of actual multi-body dynamics, but I would really like to think it would work, given that pretty much everything else Squad said was impossible to do for technical reasons (multiplayer is the big one) has been accomplished by mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact, if this solution could be shown to work, I\u0027d hope Squad would adopt it for the vanilla game and implement \u0022true\u0022 n-body physics when the simulation is off rails, given that the \u0022on rails\u0022 part was the limiting factor.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-14T18:52:50Z\u0022 title=\u002201/14/2014 06:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 14, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by InfinityArch\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Neoxan","CreatedById":100967,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-14T20:45:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFractal, First of all, great mod, one of the best mods ive ever seen, Scott Manley picked you for a good reason, but as everything, its not perfect, I want to report a bug that has caused me a lot of nightmares.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESabre engines are quite bugged, when you enter rocket mode, the mod does not detect that and they keep overheating, even in space!!! to overide that, you of course need to put the precoolers and they just work fine but the air intakes need to stay open and as i said, even outside the atmosphere, rapier engines work ok in rocket mode but please, can you plz fix the sabres?, sometimes i dont put precoolers cause i use the rocket mode to climb up faster and the bug is really easy to fix, just include the sabre engine rocket mode as a rocket engine so the mod can overide the heating while the engine is at high speeds when in rocket mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you and keep the good work, youre amazing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
