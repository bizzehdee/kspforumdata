Hold on, let me explain. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had the same problem last night, and here\u0027s what caused it: I was launching some small mapsats from a shuttle cargo bay. During construction, I had created the mapsat as a sub-assembly so that I could put several of them into the cargo bay, mounted to clamp-o-tron jr.\u0027s via small decouplers. Here\u0027s the trick: in order to create the sub-assembly in a way to make it attach to the docking port properly, I had to make the DECOUPLER the \u0027root part\u0027. It would be the same if you wanted to \u0027alt-click\u0027 to copy the assembly too. So, up goes the shuttle, open the bay doors, activate the first satellite decoupler by staging, and it launches fine. Switch to the satellite, tell it to aim prograde, force roll 0 deg. Nothin\u0027, it just sits there wobbling. It won\u0027t respond to manual \u0027stick\u0027 (keyboard) inputs either, I have no pitch, roll or yaw. On a whim, I selected \u0027control from here\u0027 on the probe body, and huzzah! It now responds properly to commands. So it looks like when you decouple a small craft from the main ship, if that small craft\u0027s \u0027command pod\u0027 part wasn\u0027t the root part during its original construction, control does not automatically switch to that part. At least, that\u0027s the conclusion I\u0027ve reached. I don\u0027t know if this is a quirk of the game or of MechJeb, but it doesn\u0027t matter that much to me, it\u0027s an easy enough problem to solve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo anyway, I hope this info helps. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rdfox","CreatedById":1818,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-25T03:10:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey, something I just noticed in the landing autopilot.
