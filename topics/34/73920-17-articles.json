Kerbal Construction Time can compound the problem of rescue missions necessitated by Dang It!, so that\u0027s fun, too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnything where you use a lot of unmanned vessels makes this mod especially devious, and the potential for water or oxygen to leak adds a lot of interesting gameplay. For example, on a recent moon mission, Jeb ran out of fuel in orbit around the Mun. I had to quickly construct a rescue vessel before Jeb\u0027s food ran out; KCT meant I would only have time for one attempt. I opted for an unmanned rescue vessel for cost and weight reasons; I just didn\u0027t have the rocketry to get two manned pods to the Mun and back easily. Because of RemoteTech, I had to time my rendezvous very carefully; there was not much of a relay network yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, the rescue vessel sprung a leak on oxygen long before it reached Jeb. I had to get Jeb home using (a) a vessel with no fuel, or (\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E a vessel with no oxygen (I had no resource transfer mods). I opted for (\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E, because even though a normal Hohmann transfer from the Mun to Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere would take too long to last without oxygen, an unconventional flight path got him back in just under the amount of time his EVA supplies lasted. In effect, I traded some excess delta v for a shorter flight time. That meant a dangerous reentry (with Deadly Reentry/FAR installed of course), but it worked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELong story short, if you like this mod, use the other \u0022hardcore\u0022 mods. They function in concert to create problems you\u0027d never expect, and that\u0027s really fun.

I opted for an unmanned rescue vessel for cost and weight reasons; I just didn\u0027t have the rocketry to get two manned pods to the Mun and back easily. Because of RemoteTech, I had to time my rendezvous very carefully; there was not much of a relay network yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, the rescue vessel sprung a leak on oxygen long before it reached Jeb.

So DangIt adds an additional cost for the spareparts (500 in the case of a one-man pod). That\u0027s 10 per unit of SpareParts. But when you remove resources from a pod the savings are not based on this (500) number. The plugin looks to CommonResources.cfg where Spareparts are valued at 63 (unitCost = 63). So when you remove 50 units of SpareParts your launch costs go down by 50*63 = 3150. That puts the pod into negative cost numbers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpareParts are valued at 63 in one place, but 10 in another, and this makes removal of SpareParts in the vab an issue. The answer is to pick a consistent price. I\u0027ve changed the entry in CommonResources.cfg to read \u0022unitCost = 10\u0022. This allows me to then remove SpareParts without going into negative launch costs.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-11T01:39:36Z\u0022 title=\u002210/11/2014 01:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 11, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Sandworm\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ippo","CreatedById":107018,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-11T03:32:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LethalDose\u0022 data-cite=\u0022LethalDose\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EQuick question about the notes in the moduleManager cfg files.
