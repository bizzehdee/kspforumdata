Every time I load the game I watch it in Windows Task Manager and it eats up every bit of available RAM until there\u0027s nothing left, then it freezes. I had assumed it was ATM failing to compress textures since I have so many extra parts, but even after getting rid of all my big packs (KSO, KSPI, and KW Rocketry), it was still climbing to the max. But after looking at the output log, I\u0027m guessing textures are the least of my problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI doubt it would be a cause for a memory leak, but I guess it\u0027s possible.

And in the end it may not be a MM CFG issue, it just looks and sounds a lot like a problem I had when I forgot to save a change to a part edit, and ended up with a MM file pointed at a part with no change being made.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"styckx","CreatedById":49519,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-27T22:46:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust got done my first repaint...
