Of course the amount generated from atmosphere would be less than mining but still It would make Eve a viable target (if you add Hooligans Airship mod you could have self sufficient cloud cities). If this is possible I get visions of sending \u0022dippers\u0022 into Jools atmosphere to harvest kethane (that and giant floating cities). Ive been poking around the code and was wondering if this is even possible?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Majiir","CreatedById":7550,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-18T17:36:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Arrowstar\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Arrowstar\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo does that mean the new view is on the roadmap for 0.7?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes.
