However I am having a huge issue where as soon as I start to pick up a decent amount of speed on my aircraft it starts culling the maximum joystick inputs severely. (Using RSS/NEAR if it matters) By the time I an flying at a couple hundred m/s I\u0027m only able to get a maximum of 25% or so control authority. I know the AFBW is reading the joystick inputs correctly because the full range registers on the calibration screen, so it\u0027s something in the programming that\u0027s limiting the inputs. I can\u0027t however find the option to disable it and get true 1 to 1 joystick input. Can you please point me to what I need to do to enable a straight 1 to 1 input of controls.
