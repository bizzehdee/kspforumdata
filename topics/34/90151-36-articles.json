Each time I do I get an answer and I think Ive got it but then I come back and I just have more questions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour DV remaining from your original craft you say is anywhere from 1-500 DV. If you are using Procedural Tanks, and are upset at having extra DV, after orbit, try to remove some fuel from your second stage. This will provide more DV in your first stage, and may help you feel like you are not wasting fuel on orbit. Also the mass of your payload, and fairing size will change your DV as a bigger fairing will need more thrust to push through the atmosphere and a lighter payload will have you left with extra DV with final Orbit insertion. Real world launchers are chosen for the mass they can put to orbit/GTO/Transfer\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand they will have extra fuel left in the tanks almost always, so don\u0027t feel too bad about the waste as long as your mission goal was achieved. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour second question regarding using the same DV launch vehicles, you must also take into account your (burntime) along with your TWR and DV. You can have a second stage with a TWR of .80 that will burn for 15 minutes, which will require a lot of off velocity vector thrusting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also place RCS on your (Big/Unwieldy) stage to help orbit maneuvers. And in RSS you don\u0027t have to change headings in 3 secs, turn stability off thrust in the direction of heading change and alt-period time warp. You will see that a little thrust will move big objects, slowly \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo get to GSO. Try to design a launch vehicle with around 16000km, you will need around 9.5 for orbit, around 2.5k for GTO, and will the left over DV you will burn for inclination change and orbit insertion. You will have fuel left over if done correctly, I just want to make sure you get there\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaunch your rocket into orbit. Create a node at equatorial AN/DN if you are not using any kind of flight software (KE/Mechjeb) Get it. Make your node so that your apoapsis will be around 35,786 km. This will mean when you hit apoapsis you will be on the earths equatorial plane and traveling around 1600m/s instead of LEO 7.8. At this point your plane change to mirror the equator will be VASTLY cheaper than LEO. You can attempt to burn prograde/normal/anti-normal at the sametime to make your burn more efficient, however if you are just trying to get to GSO. Do your plane change, then do your circularization burn. If you click on the earth, and click on info, you will see that its rotational period is 23 hours 56min 4 sec. when you have completed your circularization burn, use your rcs to fine tune your orbital period to mirror this time. Again you will need (KE/Mechjeb) If you follow these steps you will soon find out that getting to GSO is more of a timewarp pain than anything else.

SO are you saying I should try shifting more fuel to the lower and less in the higher? So, maybe 5000/4500 instead of 4800/4800? If I were to do the GSO insertion would a completely separate stage for the orbital maneuvers be a good idea or should you try to just enlarge the others? As far as GSO goes what I was attempting in .25 was first launch into a parking orbit, create a maneuver node at the DN to raise apoapsis to 35,786 so when you get to apoapsis you should be on the AN and change inclination at the same time you circularize. I was using a maneuver node to do both. but then I would Mess soimething up and reert to retry it and end up not achieving orbit with the designed stages or having a ton of extra fuel.

Using one of these as a first stage engine in RP0 is awesome due to throttle control, you can build first stages that will have a max TWR of 10, but can throttle them so you barely reach 5, minutes into a launch.

If you want a different stage for every part of your mission, its totally up to you. With the part limits of .90 early career, the only advice I can give is to design a rocket that gets you to orbit with 2 stages, reuse your second stage for burn to GTO, and have your satellite have enough DV to perform the inclination change/circularization. the would mean you only have 3 engines total.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Agathorn","CreatedById":99662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-18T17:34:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Makers\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Makers\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBobcats engines, I am a little up and down with these.
