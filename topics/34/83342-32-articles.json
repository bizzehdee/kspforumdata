It\u0027s going to require a somewhat substantial amount of time, which is something I don\u0027t have a lot of at the moment. Fortunately, after the next release the only issues with KK will be that you have to go to the VAB/SPH to launch (requiring a scene change, but one less than you do currently) and that reconditioning and rollout times won\u0027t work properly (but you can just turn them off).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI might be able to get a pseudo-compatible release that lets Recon/Rollout function per launchsite without as much effort.

In the end, I preferred the current system. The R\u0026amp;D center is big. It\u0027s got a lot of people in it working on independent things all at the same time. More advanced technologies require more time still, but can also be worked on at the same time (though, realism should require them to be at a reduced rate while their pre-req nodes are still in progress).
