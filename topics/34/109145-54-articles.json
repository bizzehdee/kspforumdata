It is in effect the bluntness or steepness rating of the part. 1 = fully blunt; 0 = fully pointy; but note that the majority of pointy parts (in stock) are rated at about 0.37 which gives you a good sense of scale for this number. The M2X super-pointy nose or tail might have a noticeably lower Y\u002B (but not Y-) value.

This particular mod has a tricoupler (with 1 auto-generated drag cube) that mates perfectly fine on the y \u002B front side, but basically experiences full drag on the Y- back end as if three rapiers weren\u0027t connected to it. Yet the 3 rapiers say that Y\u002B end of their drag cube is fully connected and experiencing no drag, but of course the uncovered Y- back ends with the nozzles are experiencing drag (as one would expect.)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-11-20T14:10:13Z\u0022 title=\u002211/20/2019 02:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 20, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by ztoundas**\n  \nCorrected the polarity of a mentioned y axis"},{"CreatedByName":"Manul","CreatedById":189366,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-20T08:23:14Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 11 hours ago, SuicidalInsanity said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027ll add fixing the drag cube(s?) to the list.

This is when compared to other parts that act normally, like the MK2 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E tank section of equal length. Last night I went through and smoothed out every part in my ship, and now the drag is nice and consistent concentrating on the areas that you would expect like a nose cone and the intakes and Tri couplers in the back. \n\nReally there are two issues that affect the drag inappropriately on stock and modded parts. Some, like discovered earlier on in this troubleshooting path, get a miscalculated area for the front of the drag cube because the game gets confused when they have hollow internals. This is what was happening to the stock drone core and the modded \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E stability section. The other issue is that some simply have and abnormally high drag coefficient on the Z axis of the drag cube (around 0.92 instead of say 0.35-ish), which would be the belly of the plane. This was what was causing abnormal drag in the closed stock MK2 clamp-o-tron and cargo bays.\n\nI\u0027ll take a look at the Spaceplanes Plus Pack and see what stands out there.\n\nAll that being said, does anyone know who does stock patches, or a way that this fix could be integrated into a stock fix mod? That\u0027s the kind of modding that I\u0027m incredibly unfamiliar with, but it seems like it wouldn\u0027t be too hard to push a fix while the devs figure out a way to make the calculation of drag cubes more consistent.  \n\nEDIT: **The latest patch update, 1.8.1, solved the inconsistent X axis drag** (i.e the belly of the plane)! Values are far more consistent. The drone core is still broken on the Y -/\u002B axis, so I am doing a bug report for that.   \n\nMods will still certainly be problematic for the hollow-part reason.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-11-20T15:38:31Z\u0022 title=\u002211/20/2019 03:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 20, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by ztoundas**\n  \nI updated my game and half the problems went away"},{"CreatedByName":"JadeOfMaar","CreatedById":167617,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-21T02:32:18Z","Content":"[@ztoundas](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/201417-ztoundas/) I can\u0027t help with bicouplers and tricouplers, sorry.

I suggest using the \u0022Specialized Flight Systems\u0022 node (I think that one\u0027s in the Stock tree too...) which has a literal symbolic representation of a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003EVTOL\u003C/abbr\u003E plane on it!\n\nAlso, if you\u0027re looking to be more ambitious, the mod parts feel a bit underpowered for the late game (though fine for early to mid-game).  I recommend adding an upgrade-node for them in the very last nodes of the Stock tech tree (and later still in CTT) that \\*slightly\\* improves the Thrust or reduces the weight of some of the parts (particularly the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003EVTOL\u003C/abbr\u003E engines- which are much too heavy for their Thrust: especially considering you can\u0027t fit any fuel in the fuselage segment they occupy, even though you should realistically be able to fit just a little fuel around the margins of the engines...) if you\u0027re not going to add a little bit of fuel tankage to the fuselage-based \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003EVTOL\u003C/abbr\u003E parts...\n\nBy contrast the RADIAL parts feel much better balanced, as you\u0027re not stuck with a draggy and overly-heavy fuselage segment that, for some indecipherable reason, you can\u0027t fit any fuel in... (miniaturization, better design, stronger alloys: all reasons we might expect just slightly better parts for fuselage-based \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003EVTOL\u003C/abbr\u003E by the late game...)\n\nBalancing parts by making them heavy or their thrust weak is something that\u0027s done far too much on \u0022Stockalike\u0022 mods- often even undershooting the performance of the Stock parts themselves by quite a bit (which, in case modders missed it, are a good bit more effective than they used to be in earlier versions of KSP...)  Balancing by assigning \\*slightly\\* higher part costs and making parts available later in the tech tree is used far too little in Stockalike mods- and leaves us with parts that feel clunky/heavy and weak (keep in mind, real life rocket/plane engines outperform anything in KSP by leaps and bounds- often being MUCH lighter, more efficient, or powerful...)"},{"CreatedByName":"Bryson","CreatedById":204591,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-19T02:09:29Z","Content":"Hello, i have downloaded this mod and so far i love it, thanks for the hard work, I appreciate this effort, specially now with the quarantine, KSP is giving me a paradise to rejoice.  \n\nI love to build spaceplanes more than rockets and notice (3) things that are missing in the Mk2 stuff:  \n\n- No Cokpit have remote control points for the probes (hop)  \n\n- No double size service bay  \n\n- No nuclear tank storage (fuel/waste)  \n  \n![m6r4cl7.png](https://i.imgur.com/m6r4cl7.png)  \n![NkFbIvI.png](https://i.imgur.com/NkFbIvI.png)  \n[https://kerbalx.com/Bryson/craft](https://kerbalx.com/Bryson/craft)\n\nI have also install others mods like configurable containers to use the regular fuel tanks but some mods arent compatible with others"},{"CreatedByName":"KanzKa","CreatedById":201180,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-22T23:26:31Z","Content":"Hi !
