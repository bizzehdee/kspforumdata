Did you boost the Ap to 100km first and just cut-off the engine and coast to Ap? That way, the fuel will be floating inside the tank all around and not staying at the bottom of it during the coast phase. And when you want to re-ignite the engine, you need to use any kind of measure that can push the craft a little bit to make sure the fuel falls back to the bottom of the tank. This can be done by RCS forward by several seconds (time depends on how heavy your ship is and how big your RCS thrust is), small ullage motors (e.g. the small Separatron SRB), etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scripto23","CreatedById":95288,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-28T19:48:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere was mention in the OP of rotation affecting fuel flow, does this mean the mod will model the \u0022centrifuge effect\u0022; if the rocket is spinning too fast my engines won\u0027t light?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
