(Don\u0027t circulize this orbit, it will end up sort of egg shaped with the periapsis lying along the orbit you want)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, I release a probe just before what ends up being the periapsis and have the probe circulize it\u0027s orbit which brings it\u0027s orbit time back down to the original amount (4 or 5 hours in this example). Then as my main ship moves through its longer orbit, I release another probe when it returns to the periapsis and follow the same steps.

This means that the vessel must stay pointed in pretty much exactly the same direction for it to properly track dV. Since normal/anti-normal mode will constantly update the target vector, this kind of issue is to be expected, you need to keep it at either killrot or maneuver node (The flight computer caches the burn vector once you send the \u0022maneuver node\u0022 command, so it isn\u0027t updated).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA similar issue is possible in a low-thrust, long-duration capture burn. the difference of angle and magnitude between the velocity vector and the vessel.forward vector changing can in such instances be enough to mess with dV calculations. In such cases I\u0027d recommend doing a timed burn in stead of a dV burn. By the time you reach your target planet, your interplanetary stage has probably had one burn, which gives the maneuver node interface enough data to provide a pretty close estimate of burn time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TaranisElsu\u0022 data-cite=\u0022TaranisElsu\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E5) Time warp to the node, careful that you do not overshoot it.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI completely forgot to list a new feature in the latest changelog:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour ship will now automatically drop out of timewarp whenever a burn is initiated by the flight computer, so you don\u0027t have to be so careful any more.

Right now there isn\u0027t ****-all to do in the game except go to planets for the sake that they\u0027re there. RemoteTech at least gives you a goal of establishing a relay network. I personally expanded the kinds / types of dishes and greatly adjusted their weights and power drain to provide even more tradeoffs and requiring some balance or intentional design. For example, if you want to put the SatDish 9000, which has range to everywhere, you need a space station dedicated to generating outrageous amounts of power and you need to get all 15 tons of dish into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
