Phase IV vehicles, oddly enough. I was driving around with the Sedan, and with the engine fully throttled up (what exactly is the throttle supposed to do on it? It barely moves with it at 0%, yet still heats up), the car wants to overheat. Checking the debug menu, it got to something like 1500! Isn\u0027t there something I can put in the config to make it disperse heat easier?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: So I looked into it the part configs. The firetruck had a heatProduction value of 23. However... the sedan \u003Cem\u003Eand everything else for some reason\u003C/em\u003E had a heatProduction of \u003Cstrong\u003E211\u003C/strong\u003E. I think that was a typo for 21, and got copy-pasted around. For comparison, the stock Ant has 25. So, considering that car engines \u003Cem\u003Earen\u0027t rockets\u003C/em\u003E, I\u0027d say that 20-something is a good number.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also lowered the sedan to 19, and bumped the bus to match the firetruck, at 23, while the lorry is at 21.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever... I still don\u0027t understand why they have engines, and don\u0027t just run on electricity. I mean... they do. Just not the sedan? Like, I dunno, it doesn\u0027t make sense. The sedan clearly drives faster only when it\u0027s throttled up, but the other vehicles just drive like a normal rover.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo... upon further inspection, what\u0027s happening is that when the sedan (or patrol) spawns, it just instantly has no electric charge. (The sedan starts with only 100 electric charge, when it has a maxAmount of 125, curiously.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo it seems to be a bug with the sedan\u0027s electric charge. I looked through the configs, but I have no idea how to fix it. But... please look into making some of those changes I mentioned, please. I\u0027m just trying to help!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT 2: I think I\u0027ve figured it out. The bug might be caused by the fact that the alternator is on the same part as the electric charge. Every vehicle besides the sedan has its electric charge stored in the chassis. Like with a stock rocket engine that holds a charge (for its alternator), at launch the engine has 0 electric charge. I\u0027m not sure how to impliment a change on this for the sedan, but I\u0027m almost certain this is the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-14T07:16:26Z\u0022 title=\u002207/14/2015 07:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Z3R0_0NL1N3\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Turk_WLF","CreatedById":115580,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-17T15:38:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Times New Roman\u0027;\u0022\u003E \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Calibri;\u0022\u003EI feel foolish for asking this (yet again) but I know that KSOS in the very first posting of the thread is for KSP 0.90.

Makes me want to pull up my old .25 save and finish up KSOS. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Glad you got the shuttle working in 1.0.4.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETy Sir, its all thanks to all the modders out there and their hard work that I was able to capture it. Mod still needs some work as re-entry heat effects don\u0027t show up when in iva view, the ofd (the globe thing) doesn\u0027t work in iva just black screen. So its got some tweaking needing to be added/updated which is beyond my skill, but for now I\u0027ve got it working for the most part and can\u0027t be happier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThinking I will probably look into messing w/ cfgs further to allow for the switch of tanks to hold hydrogen and such to possibly be able to make long distance/explorer shuttles with addon engine mods and extra planetary launchpad(think thats the mod name) as obviously they wouldn\u0027t make it to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@MeCripp thats orginal code for the cfg, I changed it along w/ most all the other cfgs that are shuttle related to maxtemp 2900// = 3400 and seems to work I don\u0027t know what the other modifiers do so left them alone. It all works but you can\u0027t really vear off a 5 or -5 aoa for to long before the parts start to heat up quickly and blow, so one has to really thread the needle when de-orbting and shooting for the ksc. (once you get through re-entry shes free to fly).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-23T06:16:47Z\u0022 title=\u002207/23/2015 06:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ironhawx\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"davidy12","CreatedById":143411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T15:40:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou think you can post a link of the files on Dropbox?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ironhawx","CreatedById":141422,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T17:31:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022davidy12\u0022 data-cite=\u0022davidy12\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou think you can post a link of the files on Dropbox?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf author of mod give me the ok sure, i\u0027ll msg helldiver and see if he says its ok, I don\u0027t want to redistribute someone else\u0027s work w/o permission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdited: I\u0027ve msg\u0027d helldiver awaiting response if if he gives me the go ahead I\u0027ll post link here.

I\u0027ve downloaded this new pack yesterday, updated \u003Cem\u003EFirespitter\u003C/em\u003E, and installed the new 1.0.4 compatible \u003Cem\u003EDeadly Reentry\u003C/em\u003E \u003Cem\u003E(DRE)\u003C/em\u003E mod and I\u0027ve had pretty flawless flying so far. My first flight on the \u003Cem\u003EMini-KSO\u003C/em\u003E it looked like something in the nosecone exploded but no signs of damage. This happened to me in beta a few times as well. One noticeable difference I can tell however \u003Cem\u003E(and this maybe because now I\u0027m no longer using FAR)\u003C/em\u003E the shuttle only glides so far, I haven\u0027t been able to drop it from high altitude and angle it to get lift, but that makes sense, the actual space shuttle flies like a brick too, it\u0027s not meant to do that stuff. I noticed this though because I calculated my reentry in the \u003Cem\u003ESuper25\u003C/em\u003E using the \u003Cem\u003EMini-KSO\u003C/em\u003E numbers and overshot the runway far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason I\u0027m posting this is because, In search of tutorials and tips for flying these badboys, I\u0027ve noticed alot of discussion over shuttles being lost on reentry and I felt compelled to share my experiences. In BETA all the way to .90 I used many mods, however the KSO mod was so large, I cut back my use on most of them. FAR, DRE, KSO I considered to be essential and are the mods I will be focusing on. I have not used a patch a modified .cfg or anything, just the stock mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIn BETA;\u003C/strong\u003E FAR, DRE, KSO Installed - Lost on reentry 75% of the time, realized my angle was too steep, learned to coast it until the plasma burns away as I come into the atmosphere just before the mountain range west of KSC.
