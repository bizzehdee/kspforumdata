Your engine should consume so much fuel, you are going with X% of max rated speed for this engine, when X% gets near to 1 then overheat engine? (I assume thats vastly oversimplified ^^ but I would like to know how it actually works). In reality engines dont overheat when you get close to their max speed, do they? I am not sure about it, but afaik they produce just less thrust the faster you go, so making them overheat is just a way of workaround? However, I know that engines irl can very much overheat too. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI googled the engine specs - took some time, I had to rely on guessing for some of the specs on the the F119, F135, and the AL41F1S because those are state of the art engines where people seem to be very hush hush about the specs alone, didnt even find bypass ratios for one engine. In the mod the F119 is shown with a thrust of 250kN, in reality that is ~100kN less actually, the TWR and Thrust are known for the F135 and F119 engines, they are essentially the same engine with some modifications to it (F35 non STVOL version).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell I know that the its physically speaking not complete, but it might help. I dont think you would get any specific Thrust to Altitude data on legal ways about those engines, I would assume they are OPSEC stuff i.e. top secret. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know the website where OP got that velocity to thrust plot from, read that myself on my research for this, because I have incomplete data I turned to use a sigmoid curve to model the velocity curve for KSP. It depends on the individual aspects of the engine, specific impulse, thrust, SFC, BPR, weight, ..etc the formula is shown in the PDF. It might not be accurate for serious aeronautics but at least balances the engines against eachother depending on their performance you would derive from their specs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn any case we need a third curve definition for KSP especially for Jetengines, thrust to altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"camlost","CreatedById":57590,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-05T23:58:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETake your time to use NASA EngineSim, play with this mod, read the code and cfg, or try AJE Tester.exe that\u0027s included.

Basically, I started at zero, I have no knowledge of how Unity works or how to do something like AJE for KSP, I have basic IT know how. So I saw the config files for engines and played around, googled the rest and wasted a day trying out. I even had chat with my physics professor (yep, I study physics) about Isp and other things. It soon was clear that vanilla KSP doesnt let you apply any realworld physics approach to model jet engines.
