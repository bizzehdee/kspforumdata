In addition, you will make wingtips much heavier than wing roots. You will make wing mass depend not on anything related to the construction and loading of the wing itself, but instead on the properties of some part of the aircraft far away from it that contributes little to the forces on the wing. Finally, you will make wing sections that are carrying comparatively little load heavier than wing sections that are supporting huge amounts of wing area heavier for arbitrary reasons. The inverse (having it vary with 1/(dist to CoL)) will result in even stranger behaviors and will cause NaN masses and encourage parts used a wing buffers to keep them away from the CoL.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is not an exhaustive list though, considering I just got back from working an election and that I spent less than 30 seconds thinking about it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI appreciate that you, like many other people, have this idea that how things are actually put together doesn\u0027t matter, only the way it looks matters.

Adding a fixed amount to distance or mass in that formula could prevent those NaNs EDIT: another oversight. This would punish small planes. Perhaps some other way or a way to grasp the scale of the aircraft its working with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my posts, the whole reason I mentioned anything is that construction DOES matter... in an odd way relating to mass. I\u0027m not trying to say that the 2 wings pictured should perform the same structurally. They dont, and shouldnt. Im saying that, once *I* strut them all together symmetrically and add wing spars, the biggest thing that differs in terms of performance is the mass distribution. Im not trying to dispute the idea that wingroots should be larger/heavier/stronger than wingtips etc. Thats reality. I\u0027m saying that the way FAR detects what pieces are wingroots and wingtips results in great changes according to the order you build wings.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-06T04:21:25Z\u0022 title=\u002205/06/2015 04:21  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by DundraL\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jovus","CreatedById":117163,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T03:01:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWould it be possible to use the voxelized shape to calculate mass based on total supported distance from center-line in a cross-sectional manner?

It never will be. They are structurally different, flex differently, and if constructed that way in reality would behave differently. So they will behave differently in FAR. Build your wings sensibly; when you insist on supporting a large mass of wing not through a solid connection to fuselage, but through a crazy daisy chain through other wing structure plus a single strut, it will require additional mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E@Jovus: \u003C/strong\u003EMaybe?
