I hope. The motivating force behind the creation of this configuration file was to make nuclear engines more attractive. Even though there was a mass issue discovered with LF/OX tanks, I think there\u0027s still a prevailing attitude that nuclear engines are undesirable.

It could be initially filled via the pumps in the launch \u0027towers\u0027.

Great Isp offset by a choice of having to accept either lower reaction mass or voluminous H2 fuel tanks to compensate.

The only drawback to it seems to be the increased weight. However, I\u0027d like to keep the weight down on my upper stages, but when I\u0027m trying to use the LH2/LOX configuration, the weight goes down, thrust goes down, ISP goes up, but my dV is extremely low.

If that\u0027s the case, what\u0027s the function of LH2/LOX?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy 2nd question is what does everyone use the different fuel configurations for? Do you use a specific config for your lifter stages and another for your payload? Any comparison to what real world craft are using? The shuttle\u0027s OMS engines used an LH2/LOX configuration and had about 1000 m/s dV, from what I could find. That doesn\u0027t seem like a lot to me for use in KSP.

I used to be fairly solidly of the belief that Isp was everything, and it definitely is important but delta-V is also linked to the mass of the propellant you\u0027re throwing out the back. I guess one way of looking at it is that H2 might provide the best Isp in a given engine design but then you have to look at the fact that because it\u0027s so light you might need a lot more of it to achieve your desired delta-V. that\u0027s especially true of the nuclear engines. and more H2 means more tank dry mass\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do find though that it\u0027s become my \u003Cem\u003E\u0027go to\u0027\u003C/em\u003E fuel for my heavy lifters simply because it lightens my stages. kethane is interesting too since I modeled the kethane engine configurations from real life methane examples so it\u0027s a somewhat lower Isp fuel but its higher density means more mass to \u0027toss out the back\u0027. kethane tanks arent supposednto be fillable in the vab but I\u0027ve noticed if you \u0027auto-configure\u0027 your tanks, MFT will load it in even though it says it isn\u0027t. definite bug \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Epersonally the way I\u0027d like to see it work is that if you recover a vehicle with any kethane in it, that quantity will become available to MFT in the VAB. should be feasible if the API allows hooking into the recovery system.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"p3asant","CreatedById":83235,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-25T11:29:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI just had to register to say this is perhaps the most awesome mod (in relation to content) !\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis makes creating realistic looking rockets very much easier (with procedural fairings).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext procedural engines so we can get out 20m diameter rockets off the ground?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
