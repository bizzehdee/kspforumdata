Pick the part up and move it so it is attaching where you want it and then use the WASDQE keys to get it aligned. The firespitter mod includes a very helpful wheel alignment mode that displays guidelines on the part showing how it is aligned. For accurate alignment you can change the \u0022Fine\u0022 value down to something quite small, such as 1 degree, and the three \u002B/- controls to 0.1 degree and you can then rotate by 1 degree with shift and 0.1 with alt.

I don\u0027t think it is really necessary, given that the normal and fine (WASDQE and shift-WASDQE) increments can also be changed. I usually have the normal setting on 30, fine on 5 and the alt settings on 0.1. The F key can be used to change the fine setting to 1 temporarily and shift-F cycles it back again (or alt-F to reset it directly to 5).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, it might be quite nice (and I\u0027m a bit surprised that Unity doesn\u0027t have a simple way of doing this already), so I will have a bit of a play with doing it at some point. Keyboard auto-repeat is usually defined with a configurable delay before the repeats start and then another configurable delay between the repeats, e.g. an initial delay of 250ms and then 100ms between repeats means that after the initial keypress (which works immediately) there is a quarter second delay before the key starts repeating at 10 repeats per second.
