I hate to be odd man out, here, but I\u0027d really prefer to *not* have things purely time-based. For instance, with only a bit more funding Centaur could have been operational a lot sooner. An early focus on stations (and a circumlunar flight) rather than a moon landing would have changed a lot of things around; this was the original NASA plan before Kennedy selected the moon landing approach instead. By contrast, if you are doing very poorly, your space program is a string of failures, and you\u0027re barely able to manage orbit, why should Saturn V and the LEM become available like clockwork?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI see three paths a \u0022real career\u0022 mode might take.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. You are given historical missions and historical technology, and asked to complete those missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Technologies and (and parts, and configs...) are placed in logical progression; for instance researching early hydrolox yields the original RL-10, and further advances will lead to RL-10A-x and J-2; capsules move from early Mercury/Vostok like things (spam in a can) to actually-maneuverable ones to sophisticated spacecraft like Apollo or Soyuz.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Some hybrid.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow #1 has the advtange of being exactly real history...but \u003Cem\u003Eit isn\u0027t a career\u003C/em\u003E, it\u0027s a set of specific challenges with specific hardware selections, and could better be handled by restricting what parts are available in sandbox mode. It squanders the freedom of the game, in my opinion, and, because the results of prior challenges have \u003Cem\u003Eno impact\u003C/em\u003E on what is required of, and available to you later on, is \u003Cem\u003Eless\u003C/em\u003E of a \u0022real experience\u0022 than #2. Frankly, it is \u003Cstrong\u003Eless\u003C/strong\u003E realistic to expect that you\u0027ll get an SSME in 1981 if you have a different 1960s, than that you will get something that \u003Cstrong\u003Eflows logically from what you\u0027ve done\u003C/strong\u003E. If you (as NASA) decide against hydrolox early on, why on Earth would you get ever-more-impressive hydrolox engines automatically, rather than things actually relevant to the history you are creating? Technological advancement does not occur in a vacuum, and is certainly not unaffected by the uses to which it is put.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a less theoretical note: RPL is up for adoption right now.

That\u0027s a plugin that needs to be made, and that needs to interface very well with TweakScale and with RF (since everything will be changing the same stats...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf someone wants to make that, that would be awesome. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERedAV8R: yes, it\u0027s not hard to set the initial date of the game. You can just substitute a different starting epoch in the RSS.cfg file, although the game will still say \u0022Year 1\u0022. For instance, in RSS v7 I changed to starting in 1951 instead of 1950, so Year 1 = 5\u003Cstrong\u003E1\u003C/strong\u003E instead of 5\u003Cstrong\u003E0\u003C/strong\u003E for easier computation by the user of the Earth date.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESmartbrain5: You must unlearn what you have learned. KSP teaches you bad things about rocket engines. What matters for a rocket engine\u0027s thrust is its *throat* diameter, not its nozzle exit diameter. The expansion ratio (exit:throat) varies greatly between different rocket engines, dependent on the altitude at which they are designed to operate. A rocket nozzle is designed to expand the exhaust gas to ambient pressure. At sea level, that\u0027s 101.325 kPa. In vacuum...that\u0027s 0. Compare the XLR11 with the RL-10, for example. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_nozzle#Aerostatic_back-pressure_and_optimum_expansion\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Esee here\u003C/a\u003E for more. \u003Cstrong\u003ERedAV8R: time for more FAQ!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERedAV8R: you probably also want to do the alt model for the LV-T5 (which has a sane nozzle!!!), and also the Kingfisher?
