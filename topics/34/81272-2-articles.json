I haven\u0027t gotten a reasonable 2.5m rocket to push the 3-kerbal pod to orbit, at least without using some boosters (a la Titan IIIC). I can make a Saturn-V-alike rocket with 5m parts from NovaPunch, KW, FASA, or SXT.

The rocket itself was above the rafters in the VAB (first stage was under 2500 DV; including two of the new KW SRBs; second was around 2.3-2.4k; final stage using the 3.75 KW upper stage engine had 3.4k to give that final push into orbit).

This works well especially if you\u0027re ram-tight like I am already (2.5k in the VAB with ATM basic / texture replacer) as you don\u0027t need anymore planetary PQSs or whatever the wrap that goes over the planet mesh is to eat up more texture memory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne serious question though; would I be better off using RSS styled heatshields over stock ones with the orbital velocities we\u0027re talking (6.2 km/s @ 150 kM altitude circular) or have you attempted re-entry?

On 1x scale Kerbin everything below 28 on the height map (I think?) is underwater, but the coastline is at 70. The beaches are already unreasonably steep, and if we want taller mountains on 6.4x Kerbin, it doesn\u0027t make sense to me that we\u0027d also want even steeper beaches.

If I\u0027ve understood this properly, to put the highest peak on Kerbin at 9000 meters (a bit taller than Everest) we\u0027d need to scale up by 33%, or to 40 m per pixel value. To keep the same sea level we would need \u0022heightMapOffset = -1200\u0022 and \u0022heightMapDeformity = 10200\u0022... except that\u0027s not right at all.

I\u0027m still fiddling with it, but not only does the low-res texture better match the terrain, but you can actually see the mountain range west of KSC starting at 1500 m altitude (Kerbin\u0027s horizon distance is still pretty short at 6.4x scale).

Stock KSP has overly heavy capsules and parts in general - that and the gluey atmosphere rebalances the game to make it necessary to build reasonably big rockets on such a tiny planet. So, if you rebalance the part masses, it will bring down the size and costs of rockets, and I wouldn\u0027t consider it cheating.

I\u0027m not seeing sand on the beach or snowy mountain tops as there seemed to be in your pictures, but that\u0027s a little thing and I\u0027ll try reinstalling later since I may have changed a setting while poking around in your files.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-4.steampowered.com/ugc/67872130875580625/A6BC97746638D541C58B1BE7DEE7A7DE9BAA8079/\u0022 alt=\u0022A6BC97746638D541C58B1BE7DEE7A7DE9BAA8079\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-4.steampowered.com/ugc/67872130875611472/272423C7FA816D9E2125434778BB30784D3DFDA8/\u0022 alt=\u0022272423C7FA816D9E2125434778BB30784D3DFDA8\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpeaking of mounds - the offshore islands look good, the islands are pretty low lying now. The island airport itself is on quite the mound - maybe 20m high on the ocean side but only half that on the inland side, that could be brought down a bit, but at least it\u0027s not hanging off a cliff. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-4.steampowered.com/ugc/67872130875600415/55603D361AC240F41736B3CDC9CF16AAF2BD4F1B/\u0022 alt=\u002255603D361AC240F41736B3CDC9CF16AAF2BD4F1B\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
