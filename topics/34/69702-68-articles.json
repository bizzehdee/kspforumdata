When I discovered KSP, I felt that if someone were to create a custom game tailored specifically to everything that appeals to me, KSP would be it. Which is why I find the 4GB limitation in the 32-bit version a severe limitation and running it on a PC with 16GB of ram just begging to be utilized just adds salt to the wound. I love this game so much in fact, that I decided to set up Ubuntu 64-bit and create a dual-boot machine, just to play KSP. Obviously I think KSP is a fantastic game, but I also feel that without all you modders out there, I would have gotten bored of the stock game by now and it would be collecting digital dust. KSP is the foundation for all the excellent mods out there to expand the game in ways you never imagined and create new worlds and solar systems just by adding a few files. Cherry-picking my \u0022must-have-cannot-live-without\u0022 apps, then tweaking the heck out of the game by adding Active Texture Management, and then experimenting with forcing opengl and dx11 through Steam got old fast. Despite my best efforts, I could only manage to launch and play out one mission, then when I returned to space center...bam, back to the desktop with a new crash log folder in the KSP directory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m an IT professional for a living and have been working on everything relating to PCs for about 20 years now so I\u0027m not stranger to Linux, dual-booting, and the like. I loved the way KSP ran on Ubuntu 64-bit with all settings maxed and running as many addons as I could throw at it, but I was experiencing issues unrelated to KSP which eventually led me to abandon the Ubuntu/KSP setup and just go back to Windows full time. I have a MSI laptop with a Haswell i5 and Geforce GTX 760M and it seems there are some bugs with Nvidia\u0027s proprietary linux drivers relating to switching between the GeForce and the on-chip Intel HD Graphics 4600. I have a dual monitor setup and no matter which driver I used (stable or experimental) and after countless hours of research and trying Ubuntu 14.04, 15.04, Mint, Debian, etc, I eventually found out that what I was experiencing is a known issue with a bug report filed and awaiting resolution. The problem is that the Nvidia settings app in Ubuntu fails to recognize both monitors as separate monitors, even though Ubuntu Control Center finds it without any problems. Since Nvidia cannot properly detect and set up my secondary display, this results in the Nvidia drivers creating one giant screen with a huge resolution of 3820x1080 combining the width from both monitors (1920x1080 and 1900x600) while keeping the largest height. So what happens is that lightdm runs the monitors properly and the nvidia drivers do not, so I start to get tons of screen tearing and artifacts all over the screen when moving windows, watching videos, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter going back to Windows, I finally decided to give the 64-bit workaround and the unfix a try and I\u0027m still experimenting with it but so far two weeks in, I\u0027m extremely pleased with the results. Sure, there are a few bugs here and there that force me to restart the game, but the 32-bit version already forces me to do that constantly whether I want to or not. But being able to run all my mods with graphics maxed without having to worry about hitting that memory barrier is magnificent. I still can\u0027t wait for an official 64-bit version of KSP running the Unity 5 engine, but for now, this will do. Its either that or hanging up KSP until Squad releases an official stable 64-bit version.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way I\u0027ve been doing it is starting out with the 64-bit Windows version in a separate folder leaving my official Steam 32-bit folder untouched. Then I modded the stock version with the Unity 4.6.4 exe and dll and then started introducing one or two mods at a time slowly, testing it out, and if all went smoothly, add some more. So far I haven\u0027t ran into anything that broke the game, but I\u0027m about to introduce some of the more risky mods that enhance visuals such as EVE, Scatterer, KSPRC, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t expect it to work, and I will not seek support if it doesn\u0027t work like some have done without letting modders know that they are running said mod in a 64-bit version of KSP. BUT...if I do end up getting good results, then awesome! Playing around with the game\u0027s files, mods, etc is a lot like playing KSP itself. You cobble together a rocket from what parts you feel will work in your VAB, re-order your stages, set up your action buttons, and then give it a test launch. Sometimes you make the rocket top-heavy and it starts to tumble out of control when it reaches 500 m/s, sometimes you build a rocket so damn fast that it fries to a crisp before reaching space. So you revert...change some parts around, change out couplers, fairings, tweak engine thrust %, etc until you get it right...much like experimenting with the game\u0027s files itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry for the long reply, I just don\u0027t on forums often so I guess I\u0027m making up for lost time ;-p\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S.
