Constructive criticism, however, is always very welcome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Terrain scatter stuck a tree in one of the runways. I\u0027m not letting that minor annoyance stop this first version being released.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- This is the largest bit of work I\u0027ve done in a long time. There will be graphical issues (my current oprimisation methods tends to leave small gaps between meshes for example).

Perhaps only indirectly if they happen to be in physics range when something they\u0027re parked on is unrendered and they crash to the ground and are destroyed. But that should never happen. Sorry chap, even the old KerbTown doesn\u0027t do anything remotely like this. medsouz will doubtless jump in if he has some clue.\u003Cp\u003EKerbinSide has no code outside of KerbTown and couldn\u0027t do something like this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT - Also, I just thought what if it\u0027s something new being rendered that destroyed your vehicles. But the only things added to the KSC Island are a radar station on a peak and a lighthouse way out of the way. Unless you parked your vehicles on a very very steep slope, it can\u0027t be that either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT 2 - Did the vehicles use just the attachable exterior seat? If they have no kind of command pod, then if you\u0027ve got persistent debris set to 0, a vehicle like that will be considered debris and deleted.
