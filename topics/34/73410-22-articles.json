I know I\u0027ve mentioned this before, but it\u0027s been a while back in this thread. Every part mod I add (i.e. NovaPunch, KW Rocketry, FASA, SpaceY, AIES, Home Grown Rockets, etc) I \u0022assign\u0022 a personality. Usually this is based on the type of parts they have, or maybe just the flavor I\u0027m feeling from them. For example, FASA and Stock have a NASA personality. KW and AIES have an ESA personality. KOSMOS and NovaPunch have a Roscosmos personality. HGR has a Chinese personality. SpaceY has the (wait for it...) SpaceX personality.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach personality has certain fuels it likes and uses most often, and even then they have different mixture ratios. So, NP uses lots of hypergolic fuels. SpaceY favors kerolox, hydrolox, and methalox. FASA uses a mix, but tends to favor the *lox. KW is fairly balanced. My assumption is that most RFStockalike players have at least 2 or 3 personalities in their game, so it should balance out. If you only have KW, you\u0027ll be a bit bored with the choices probably, true, but most part mods don\u0027t break the bank with RAM, and can be easily pruned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOriginally I did this because almost every part mod has a J-2 or J-2X clone. I didn\u0027t want to sift through every single mod to find the J-2 clone and make it a hydrolox/methalox/kerolox engine. It\u0027s much easier to say \u0022You\u0027re a ESA-type\u0022 and choose fuels from there. I\u0027ve branched from that slightly, as the case arises. SXT is a good example, because there are clones of both Saturn V engines and N1 engines. But on the whole, I like the idea of these \u0022personalities\u0022 because they force decisions on the player. You choose a certain personality for this rocket, so it uses all hypergolics. Swap out for a different mod\u0027s engine, and now you have to swap your fuels to kerolox for the first stage. Different mass ratio, different TWR, different style.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of that is my idea of a good game (or mod in this case). But I\u0027m not the everyman, I know that. Which is why I wanted to give everyone the tools to tweak these as they like. The webapp is exactly this. You should be able to find any engine you want to tweak, and to make those tweaks using the same tools I do. You want methalox in all engines? You can make those changes (relatively) easily. And, if you \u003Cstrong\u003Ereally\u003C/strong\u003E want to, you can take the Stockalike configs and make an entirely different engine set. The license is open for that purpose. And, there\u0027s a feature in the webapp that\u0027ll let you clone out an existing engine to tweak. So, you can make a copy of a NP engine and make an entirely new engine out of that doesn\u0027t conflict with any other engine, but will use the same model/effects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven so, I\u0027ll see about adding methalox to the K-2X line for NovaPunch. It at least makes sense there. May not be soon, since I want to try and make this as \u0022future-proof\u0022 as possible as RF updates. One thing on the table is different engine cycles being modeled directly in RF, and not being inferred through configs. Which is very relevant to methalox engines similar to the Raptor. I would like to use methalox a bit more in Stockalike. However, it most certainly \u003Cstrong\u003Eis\u003C/strong\u003E a first-line mixture. It\u0027s just used mostly in the NASA and SpaceX \u0022personalities\u0022.

I didn\u0027t want to sift through every single mod to find the J-2 clone and make it a hydrolox/methalox/kerolox engine. It\u0027s much easier to say \u0022You\u0027re a ESA-type\u0022 and choose fuels from there. I\u0027ve branched from that slightly, as the case arises. SXT is a good example, because there are clones of both Saturn V engines and N1 engines. But on the whole, I like the idea of these \u0022personalities\u0022 because they force decisions on the player. You choose a certain personality for this rocket, so it uses all hypergolics. Swap out for a different mod\u0027s engine, and now you have to swap your fuels to kerolox for the first stage. Different mass ratio, different TWR, different style.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of that is my idea of a good game (or mod in this case). But I\u0027m not the everyman, I know that. Which is why I wanted to give everyone the tools to tweak these as they like. The webapp is exactly this. You should be able to find any engine you want to tweak, and to make those tweaks using the same tools I do. You want methalox in all engines? You can make those changes (relatively) easily. And, if you \u003Cstrong\u003Ereally\u003C/strong\u003E want to, you can take the Stockalike configs and make an entirely different engine set. The license is open for that purpose. And, there\u0027s a feature in the webapp that\u0027ll let you clone out an existing engine to tweak. So, you can make a copy of a NP engine and make an entirely new engine out of that doesn\u0027t conflict with any other engine, but will use the same model/effects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven so, I\u0027ll see about adding methalox to the K-2X line for NovaPunch. It at least makes sense there. May not be soon, since I want to try and make this as \u0022future-proof\u0022 as possible as RF updates. One thing on the table is different engine cycles being modeled directly in RF, and not being inferred through configs. Which is very relevant to methalox engines similar to the Raptor. I would like to use methalox a bit more in Stockalike. However, it most certainly \u003Cstrong\u003Eis\u003C/strong\u003E a first-line mixture. It\u0027s just used mostly in the NASA and SpaceX \u0022personalities\u0022. It\u0027s just I don\u0027t have many places to use it that make sense given the framework I\u0027ve set up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I\u0027ve written far too much. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Hope that makes sense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, I\u0027m really not so sure a RosCosmos \u0022personality\u0022 was the best choice for NavaPunch2. It has Saturn V, no fewer than *THREE* J-2X (in different sizes), and aerospike analogs (the last of which was a technology that was most developed by NASA, not RosCosmos)- and some entirely original stuff. If anything, it\u0027s more of a mixture of the \u0022best\u0022 ideas from both NASA and RosCosmos than a direct analog of either...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, many players (including me) are severely pressed for RAM and don\u0027t install more than one conventional parts-mod (as opposed to KSP-Interstellar, which I also use but doesn\u0027t really have a lot of rocket engines in the conventional sense- opting for a number of thermal rocket setups where you combine different reactors, fuels. and even nozzles to get different performances...) As such, having options that limited really isn\u0027t FUN. I\u0027d very much like to have a Meth/LOX lander engine (which I\u0027m not sure can be found in ANY parts-pack at the moment, even SpaceY...) as well as a Meth/LOX J-2X fuel-mode in Novapunch\u002BStockalike, and the RMA-3 and Orbital Bertha are NovaPunch\u0027s 2 main lander-engines...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne last, unrelated question. \u003Cstrong\u003EWhat\u0027s up with the Thrust/Weight Ratio (and ISP) on the M50 rocket engine in NovaPunch?\u003C/strong\u003E Its mass and Thrust values remain COMPLETELY unmodified from their stock values. In fact, I\u0027m not sure the engine was even modified by Stockalike at all aside from a backup-config replacing its LFO with Kero/LOX (the *ONLY* fuel-mode it is capable of using, which itself seems strange). I can\u0027t even find the m50 in a text-search of the Stockalike config for NovaPunch- so it seems you probably missed it. The excessively-high mass of the engine make it nigh-worthless compared to all the other 2.5 meter engines in Novapunch\u002BRealFuels\u002BStockalike, and the engine-config really should be fixed to balance properly with Stockalike...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EP.S.\u003C/strong\u003E Precisely *because* major changes are coming down the line for RealFuels, I strongly advise updating things like this *BEFORE* the RealFuels 10 release.

The trick is only keeping the parts you use. For example, FASA is like 200\u002B MB on disk, but I only have about 35 MB installed. And I abuse ATM and use quarter-size graphics.
