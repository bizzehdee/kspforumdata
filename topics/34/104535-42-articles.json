Our joints are managed in FixedUpdate (physics ticks), but when you do 4x physics warp some updates get skipped, so you see joints under load drift away. In your case your craft is quite heavy, so it goes to a certain extreme, but in most cases it is not that bad. I do have some other ideas, involving locking the joints completely while they are idle, but it requires some substantial code changes and therefore needs much more testing. Will keep you updated.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 30 April 2016 at 7:40 PM, Nommykins said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Yep, that\u0027s the issue. Is it the largest or most massive?

This needs more testing, but I\u0027ll push the release really soon for everyone to try on their crafts.\n\nAlso I\u0027ve fixed the mirror symmetry on all parts including the uncontrolled ones. There is one thing though - due to some changes in Physx in Unity 5, in order for uncontrolled part to function properly both ends of it need to have a regular part attached somewhere (like fuel tank or structural fuselage) and not only physics-less ones (batteries or octagonal struts and etc) as the latter are not simulated and thus do not move the joint.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 2 hours ago, LeCosmopilot said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Just want to say THANKS for you insane mod.
