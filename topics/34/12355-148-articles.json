Push one and whichever one was previously pushed in pops out. Yup, the people who came up with these grew up with such radios and these two types of selection widgets have become standardized in graphical user interfaces. Mixing up their usage tends to confuse people - especially people who have been using computers for many years.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich brings up an issue about KSP in general. It\u0027s filled with toggle buttons that don\u0027t indicate their status. They act like a momentary button, they have a clicked state but do not have an *active* state. The buttons all return to their un-clicked state. Some have a *very tiny* icon somewhere else that changes, some like Set As Target change the text on a popup window but others such as Control From Here have no state indication at all. The quickest fix would be to just have all the buttons stay in their clicked graphic state when the user has clicked them to change things from their default state. I\u0027m a big fan of software being as informative as possible via the use of text, but a quickly discernible graphical status indication is also a good thing so the user doesn\u0027t *have* to read the text or look for a difference in a tiny icon that\u0027s not on the button. Like an old radio selector button, the button itself tells its own status.

Most of the flights that you mention were simulated on ground based computers and the results transmitted to the spacecrafts for execution. In the very early days the computers were either analog or took up most of the floor of a reasonable sized building. This approach to operating spacecraft was common until the 80\u0027s or 90\u0027s, when spacecraft computers finally got good enough to compute orientation changes. At that point the destination orientation was uplinked to the spacecraft and the onboard computer generated the rotations around the control axes of the spacecraft. Orbital changes (that involved burning engines) were still computed on the ground and the results uplinked to the spacecraft. \u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eskips\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou really don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about here. Gemini had the capability of computing its own orbital parameters and trajectory changes, as did Apollo. That being said, the capabilities were rarely if ever used operationally; rather, the burns were calculated using on-board assets and compared to those provided by ground tracking and computing; most of the time (tho\u0027 not always) the ground solution was used.
