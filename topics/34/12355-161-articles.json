That is not I am talking about. If I select \u0022Prograde\u0022, the ship will swing to prograde, slowing its yaw/pitch rate as it approaches, like it should do. However, once it is on prograde, the ship has a definite roll of a few degrees per second around the prograde vector. I have let it roll for a minute or more and it does not stop, even as it keeps the nose pointed to prograde. However, if I tap one of the roll keys, the roll stops. The behavior looks like what happens when I turn on SAS (the ship quickly counter rolls to reach the same roll orientation it had when I tapped the key). Same thing if I press Kill Rot for a second before switching back to Prograde: the roll stops, and it does not return. I have noticed on launch a similar thing - I typically roll the ship 90 degrees before the gravity turn so that the crew are oriented with their heads \u0022up\u0022 relative to the surface once I reach orbit (like would happen if I could \u0022Force Roll = 0\u0022 during launch). With the current build, I see the ship drifting through a roll during ascent such that it is oriented at least 45 degrees off of the roll=0 orientation by the time I reach orbit. With the 2.1 official release (build# whatever it is), I see MJ suppressing rolls both while holding orientation and during ascent. That behavior does not seem present in build 115, with no other changes to my vessels or the KSP environment.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spektyr","CreatedById":57918,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-27T16:29:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen I installed the current MechJeb 2.1 on a clean install of KSP (in career mode - haven\u0027t checked sandbox) there are absolutely no autopilots.

(currently) MJ looks at stock values for drag but FAR sets those values to 0 and recalculates and implements drag itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESarbian / Ferram have (I think?) done some work in helping the two mods talk to each other better so eventually we should have better integration. (presumably what\u0027s needed is for MJ to check for FAR\u0027s presence and query it about drag)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know it\u0027s tough right now but the workaround is to let MJ do its initial de-orbit burn then abort once you have re-entry. Make sure landing prediction is enabled and check the map to see where you\u0027re going to land. Point prograde or retrograde as needed (really spellcheck? You know what retrograde is but not prograde?) and do a slow gentle burn to bring that number down. As you get better you need the map less and can just look at the landing AP GUI. Closer to the target and you\u0027ll need to use \u002B/- radial burns to extend or reduce your landing distance. Normal burns if you\u0027re not quite lined up with the site.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"drtedastro","CreatedById":70911,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-27T22:30:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Esounds like a plan...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Virtualgenius","CreatedById":67644,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-28T04:40:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would probably work on a new landing AP as you will have plenty of beta testers as we all love MJ and are only to happy to help out, but you should set a baseline ship to test it on\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
