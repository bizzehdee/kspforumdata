Just to be clear, do I need benjee\u0027a suits and your configs? I make no point on having any of in. You see in 1.11 I used nothing but kerbalized suits. Back then the red suit you see in the EVa pic above would show both in IVA and EVA, no benjee, no nothing. Why was that now in 1.12 it doesnt, thats the mistery.\n\u003E \n\nOCD Cure -\u003E [HERE](https://www.dropbox.com/s/zcvmsiatqtbbvo3/KerbalizedSuitConfigsPatchThingy.zip?dl=1)\n\n[Benjee10\u0027s mod](https://spacedock.info/mod/2675/Benjee10%27s%20Historical%20Kerbal%20Suits) is needed or the game won\u0027t even know there are IVA suits (they\u0027re the same as the EVA) to look for.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-09-06T04:25:34Z\u0022 title=\u002209/06/2021 04:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 6, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by DirtyFace83**"},{"CreatedByName":"Daniel Prates","CreatedById":172769,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-09-06T16:53:15Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 13 hours ago, DirtyFace83 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E OCD Cure -\u003E [HERE](https://www.dropbox.com/s/zcvmsiatqtbbvo3/KerbalizedSuitConfigsPatchThingy.zip?dl=1)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [Benjee10\u0027s mod](https://spacedock.info/mod/2675/Benjee10%27s%20Historical%20Kerbal%20Suits) is needed or the game won\u0027t even know there are IVA suits (they\u0027re the same as the EVA) to look for.\n\u003E \n\n~~I installed benjee 10, and pasted your new files over the mod - it overwrote some 25 files or so.~~\n\n~~Still, no change. Sorry.~~ \n\n~~Hm... am I supposed to use texture replacer, or texture replacer replaced?  (edit: nevermind, I tried with \u0027replacer replaced\u0027, it is the same thing, plus \u0027diverse kerbal heads\u0027 doesn\u0027t work).~~ \n\nYou know [@DirtyFace83](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/131509-dirtyface83/) I realized I am being inconvenient. It is stated in spacedock, quite clearly, that this mod is EVA ONLY at the moment, so, I am at fault here asking you this. You see, up until 1.11 it was an automatic thing, the suit you chose would apply everywhere and you wouldn\u0027t think about it, I guess 1.12 must have changed that and I didn\u0027t stop to read the OPs and the descriptions in spacedock.\n\nEdit: although... in 1.11. I used texture replacer replaced, not texture replacer.  I stoped using it in 1.12 because it doesnt work with diverse kerbal heads anymore. Maybe that\u0027s why previously I had no issue using your suits both in iva and eva? \n\nAnyway, it turns out that I am being a damn bore. Sorry. But if sometime the suits do become available to both IVA and EVA, do drop me a PM, will ya?  Thanks, your work looks great. \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-09-06T17:58:15Z\u0022 title=\u002209/06/2021 05:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 6, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Daniel Prates**"},{"CreatedByName":"DirtyFace83","CreatedById":131509,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-09-07T03:55:26Z","Content":"Figured out what was going on. The IVA plugin requires a normal map to be actively assigned to the suits in order to render them.
