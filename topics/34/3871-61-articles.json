Now, looking at the \u0027PWing\u0027 add-on, it seems someone has worked out how to dynamically scale a part and the stats it has on the fly in the Editor. What would be UBER cool is if you could provide a procedural variable-length fairing wall for each diameter so we can attach it and set the length dynamically.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tobyz28","CreatedById":72108,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-06T20:29:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow do i orient the explosive bolts to use them with fairings \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tiberion","CreatedById":8356,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-06T21:46:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou don\u0027t use them with fairings anymore, they\u0027re more like tiny radial decouplers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tiberion","CreatedById":8356,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-06T22:46:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso, for the memory crashes; there isn\u0027t a whole lot more I can do; its really an issue with the game not handing mods that use a lot of memory (whichis in turn the fault of Unity in some way)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyour best bet is to install the part subfolders one by and see how much you can handle, pick the parts you want to use most.

I run windows8 so I am stuck with 32bit KSP atm, and my game will crash at around 3.6gb memory usage(i have i7quad, nvid gtx 630 w/2gigs, and 16gb ram). This is due to the way a 32bit program runs within a 64bit OS. Will run in kind of compatability mode, part of that is limiting how much system mem the program uses. 32bit KSP will only use between 3-4gb or system memory. If it is forced above this, via to many mods or whatever, the game will crash. This is not only true when the game loads, but as you load ships into the game too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@jpkermin- When Squad made KSP Unity did not support 64bit programing for platforms other than linux, hence no win/mac 64bit ksp.
