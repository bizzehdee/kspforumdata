Yes its a good thing on paper sinse devs saw the fan work as a quality software and decided to take it. But the frustrating fact is that its more of a credit steal then actual game implementation. Mods get into stock, Modders are supposely hired to squad. Mods official place in forum is closed becouse no longer needed, once the mod is kept updated for the actual game.. The modder is also done for. Squad wont remember you, you wont get any golden seat in credits. you are used.

Harvester stated on numerous occasions that they didn\u0027t know -anything- about aerospace engineering when they started working on KSP. That means they still don\u0027t and probably never will understand fluid mechanics to the degree that allows them to implement them into the game in a way you did. Best thing they can do is find a speciallist in aerodynamics or hire YOU. If you stop the development while KSP is still in beta I\u0027m going to stick to whatever version you finnish at and even if KSP hits gold I\u0027m still going to play beta. I study Aerospace Engineering and I cannot imagine playing KSP without FAR. It may just be a game I sometimes play in my free time, but knowing how it should work I just cannot stand the way it works in stock. Even if they get to the point of NEAR, there still gonna be a lot to improve upon. FAR is not just a \u0022fix\u0022 or \u0022improvement\u0022 for stock aerodynamics anymore, it\u0027s a complex aerodynamics simulation tool that a lot of Kerbonauts can\u0027t play without. Even Scott Manley uses it. Imagine what would Interstellar Quest look like without your contribution in form of FAR? Where would all those awesome spaceplanes people created with FAR go? Everyone would still go away from it knowing more about aerodynamics, but it wouldn\u0027t be the same anymore. No matter what Squad does, if they improve aerodynamics at all, it won\u0027t be as detailed as your work. I doubt it\u0027s gonna be much more advanced then it\u0027s now, they may find a better approximation for calculation of drag, but that\u0027s it.
