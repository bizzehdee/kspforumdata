When I play with [my previous modlist](http://i.imgur.com/64iRwHj.png) I lock my fps and get ~60fps. Not very stable, it drops to 50-40 on reentry, aero effects, etc... at worst: looking at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003Eksc\u003C/abbr\u003E \u002B 1000m/s speed \u002B 4km high \u002B 31 mods installed I get 28-27 fps. After that I install G-Effects or Audio Muffler Redux and I get a 20fps drop for every instance. I just remembered I have no ATI control panel. I play on an 2011 imac using windows 7 bootcamp. It has bootcamp/apple drivers installed, it includes an old AMD Catalyst version which I can\u0027t update from. Yep, the usual apple bs.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I have no idea about programming/modding. It might be a drivers issue.\n\u003E \n\nSome people have also reported FPS drops with G-Effects but I couldn\u0027t reproduce that. My PC isn\u0027t a beast too so I struggle for every single FPS as I like to play with SVE/scatterer installed and some mods had to go sadly. But I always keep G-Effects as it doesn\u0027t show any FPS impact to me. Though I have NVidia GTX550Ti. But when we speak of KSP, we should also consider CPU usage.\n\nI suspect some possible bottlenecks in the mod\u0027s code like preparing overlays in graphic cycle or reflection used for KeepFit cooperation. Also, if G-Effects and Audio Muffer Redux reduce your FPS at approximately same amount it might be caused by the only common part of them - the Unity\u0027s low pass audio filters. The only way I see to find something out is to compile several builds with those features disabled for you to try so I could understand what needs optimization.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-05-29T08:08:02Z\u0022 title=\u002205/29/2017 08:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMay 29, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Ser**"},{"CreatedByName":"Ser","CreatedById":104207,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-29T20:20:29Z","Content":"[@pocolaton](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/177985-pocolaton/), so, if you feel like you could help a little, here\u0027s dll\u0027s to try:\n\nWithout low pass filters: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/4i708kdm8fgagvj/G-Effects-No-aFilters.zip?dl=1](https://www.dropbox.com/s/4i708kdm8fgagvj/G-Effects-No-aFilters.zip?dl=1)\n\nWithout reflection API: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/vyuyp0t761wnc08/G-Effects-No-Api.zip?dl=1](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vyuyp0t761wnc08/G-Effects-No-Api.zip?dl=1)\n\nWithout red/black-out effects: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/bg7pk735ktricms/G-Effects-No-Visuals.zip?dl=1](https://www.dropbox.com/s/bg7pk735ktricms/G-Effects-No-Visuals.zip?dl=1)\n\nYou need to download the zips and extract to G-Effects/Plugins folder replacing the original G-Effects.dll file.
