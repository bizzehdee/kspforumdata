If you look at Table 4.3.1 on page 56 of that document, it places a reference value for IVA Food at 0.67kg. It then breaks down the various storage methods and their masses, with the ISS style being the most massive, while carrying the comment \u0022Food as-shipped\u0022 indicating pre-prepared foods that do not need additional water for hydration. Anyway, noting the source information for this table as coming from section 7.2.2.2.3 of \u003Ca href=\u0022http://msis.jsc.nasa.gov/Volume1.htm\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ENASA\u0027s Man-Systems Integration Standards\u003C/a\u003E, you can find the following figure detailing the food and water mass per CM-d:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://msis.jsc.nasa.gov/images/Section07/Image232.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022Image232.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, as you can see, not only is a great deal of the mass of daily food intake coming from hydrating dehydrated products, a full 3kg is coming from water either being consumed as is, or being used to hydrate dehydrated food items, including beverages. Adding in the extra 0.5kg in packaging leaves a remaining value of 0.7kg in actual food mass. That all being said, I\u0027m not really advocating cutting all of the water mass out of the daily food requirement per CM-d, but I think some of that water mass is being included twice, once as pure water, and then again as the hydration necessary for food or beverage items. It may be worthwhile and perhaps somewhat more accurate / realistic to account for this in the food / water masses per CM-d.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Also, \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.scielo.br/pdf/rimtsp/v47n6/27192.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EI found this paper\u003C/a\u003E which indicates at the end of paragraph 2 on the first page that the average density of human feces is 1 gram / cm\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B3, which would mean a liter of feces for our purposes should have a mass of 1kg.
