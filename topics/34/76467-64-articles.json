I tweak an engine in the VAB and everything appears fine and dandy. MechJeb is happy and gives me a sensible TWR for the rescaled engine. All stats are present and correct. I\u0027m using real fuels and all sorts, but it all seems happy. With high hopes I then proceed to the launchpad and the ship loads with the engine visibly rescaled, so far so good. I launch. 30g! The tweaked engine loads in with original (un-tweaked) physics rather than giving me the rescaled physics. The same reversion also occurs if I save a ship and load it back up in the VAB. My gameplay is consequently ruined. In addition, I note that the RO mod has taken to removing engine gimbaling (for me at least). I somewhat fixed this by throwing the Gimbaling config file from SFJBRealEngines into my game folder. But that just won\u0027t do. Point of interest, this problem does not occur with the \u0022Little Mother\u0022 engine although that\u0027s the only exception I\u0027ve discovered so far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Stack decouplers are totally broken. I spent ages trying to work out why my first and second stage engines were both firing at launch, only to find that none of my decouplers work. I fire the decoupler and the second stage engine base just sticks to the damn thing. So I can\u0027t launch anything multi-staged. I note that the decoupler graphic that usually connects the stages and shrouds the rocket engine does not execute when I connect a decoupler.
