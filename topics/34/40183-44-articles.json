This could in theory completely bork MCE Docking and Undocking Goals. So If I somehow managed to get this to work when people dock in other missions or dock they would be charged again for vessel. I will see what I can do though, might be hard to work around that, since docking is already a pain in the ass to make work for just regular goals.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-22T20:47:30Z\u0022 title=\u002202/22/2014 08:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 22, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by malkuth\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"landeTLS","CreatedById":97925,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-22T20:55:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI also feel the custom revert button kindof makes it feel more seperated from the main game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI understand that in the way things work the plugin cant get the correct values if the native revert button is pressed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut how about a hacked approach?
