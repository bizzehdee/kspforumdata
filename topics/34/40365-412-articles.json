First, I sent up a satellite with a 3.5m Akula fission reactor, with a 3.5m electric generator positioned right under it. I put 6 huge radiators on it (my radiators are upgraded to Graphene radiators because I have experimental electrics researched), and in ground tests this setup produces 1.91 GW of power with no complaints and zero heat accumulation. I put the same thing into orbit and the generator is producing less than half a gigawatt of power, the reactor (although running at 100%) is only producing 2.2GW of thermal power, and when I shut the thing down it took almost half a year to cool down.\u003Cp\u003EThis isn\u0027t normal, is it? I mean, my supposed max heat dispersion with those six radiators is 5x what the reactor is capable of producing. Even assuming that they don\u0027t work as efficiently without an atmosphere this seems extremely....weak for the largest reactor with the largest generator attached to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, I have 4 satellites spaced apart in a 750km orbit around Kerbin, each with a microwave transceiver on it set to relay mode. None of them will detect that the others exist, nor will they detect that my wimpy power plant is transmitting 450 MW of power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny ideas, suggestions, hints? This is my first delving into microwave power transmission and so far I\u0027m very underwhelmed. I realize that fission reactors are entry-level but...well, I could live with the low power production if they\u0027re actually only supposed to produce that much, but the fact that I don\u0027t appear to actually be able to USE it is annoying at best.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Well, I figured out the solution to problem 2...the satellite relays will only activate if something\u0027s actually demanding power.

The part that\u0027s really getting me now is that if I park the exact same generator off my runway it produces 1.91 GW of power (reactor running at 4.5 GW, no heat buildup at all with 4x huge radiators), but put it in space and even with 2 more radiators it accumulates a fairly large amount of waste heat, the reactor only runs at 2.2 GW, and the power plant as a whole only produces 450 MW of power. It seems to me that, even with atmospheric losses, it might be more efficient to just build four or five generators at KSP and focus orbital operations on setting up relays than to waste all the time, power, and resources putting power plants in space.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ABZB","CreatedById":98947,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-20T18:23:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Esoon:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/86999-0-24-StarSystems-v0-1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/86999-0-24-StarSystems-v0-1\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Mr Burns excellent*\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"positivewun","CreatedById":96922,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-20T20:59:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022WaveFunctionP\u0022 data-cite=\u0022WaveFunctionP\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe the official .dll file, which the plugin code run by ksp, has been compiled for .23.5. I do not believe that anything changed in .24 that requires the .dll to be recompiled in order to function. Compiling is the process of turning the human readable text document that is written into the code that computer understands natively. Compiling is done by a special program called a compiler, which is usually part of suit of development software called an SDK used by programmers to write software. Usually, you only need to recompile if a part of the written code used in the software has changed. Basicly, if the part of the underlying code (the API) that the plugin utilizes is changed, the software must be recompiled or, more often, rewritten to adapt to those changes.\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know that running 64 bit will cause any problems that aren\u0027t just inherent with 64 bit\u0027s instability right now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is always worth it to mention any issue you may be having as knowing about potential issues is the first step in rectifying them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like answers like this. Clear and to the point. Yeah I was thinking what I am looking at is in all probability an instability with unity 64 tbvh. What I\u0027m seeing is that everything loads and runs ok but when I get to the VAB initially all looks well! When I select a vessel it\u0027s ok too. However the second that selected vessel is about to appear everything locks up and this weird spark thing shows in the picture along with the display as if I was selecting kerbonauts. then the error appears saying the game crashed. If you can point me to the log I hear about when it is failing I can get that and post so you can take a look. But to be honest I think its a unity 64 issue. I remember when I tried the unity 64 when all was still 23.5 @ 32 bit stock and we were (well i was along with a lot of other peeps) tinkering with unity 64 that it flashed the astro lounge. It looked something like a hybrid between that and as if it was trying to run the VAB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFunny but sad thing?
