Since I have some modding experience I decided to try my hand at it and see what I could come up with. I do not like to simply copy and paste parts that someone has already created but instead try to make it my own thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe original concept behind \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CCORE\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 was that I wanted to play \u0022rocket scientist for a day\u0022 by designing my own rocket family from the ground up. The aim was to balance my rockets to be more realistic than what KSP has already pioneered. I wanted to respect the lessons learned by other modders but above all else I wanted to see if \u0022it\u0022 could be done.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOver many iterations and many months of tweaking we have come to the latest iteration of Anvil. My rocket program has evolved into a one stop shop for a simple and reliable platform to launch your payloads. Sure, there are lots of great mods out there that offer hundreds of different ways to create all sorts of exciting machines but Anvil is different. When you just want to get into orbit without the hassle then that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s when you break out the Anvil.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI consider the whole effort a success and I greatly enjoyed the opportunity to make this happen.
