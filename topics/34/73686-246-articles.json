A fairly normal resistojet thruster has a thrust of around 0.5 N using 750 W of Power. This can easily be increased to 1 N by using chemical combustion of around 1 kW and then heating it further with 750 W of electrical power. The problems are that there is an upper limit to the temperatures you can handle as well as how much propellant flow the resistojet can handle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s first make two three assumptions that will break immediately when applied to real world physics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. There is no upper limit to how hot emission gases we can handle in the resistojet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. The temperature increase is linear to the amount of electrical power we use for heating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. The exhaust of a chemical rocket has the same molecular weight as hydrogen gas. :-)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf, under those assumptions, we have a resistojet that produces 0.5 N at 750 W we can built a 25 N thruster using 37.5 kW of electricity. We could do this either by heating 50 times as much reaction mass or by heating it to a temperature that is about 50 times higher (creating a massive increase in Isp).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we have a chemical rocket of 0.5 N using we could heat that exhaust gas and double the exhaust velocity to produce 1 N thust by adding 750 W of resistojet augmentation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo make a 18 kN resistojet with an Isp of 600 s, we would then have to provide an amount of chemical fuel that provides is burned at a temperature of around 4000 K to achieve the first 400 s of Isp, and then heat it 50% more to 6000 K to get our 600 s Isp. That means that we will have to provide around 6 kN extra thrust using electricity which equates to around 12 MW (!) of electrical power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen applying real world physics we will probably melt the parts of the engine that cannot be cooled (the resistor), we will further more have a much heavier exhaust than hydrogen, for example water, and even with all that not taken into account we need to have batteries capable of providing 12 MW of power for three minutes to get to a low Kerbin orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn short. The engine has far too high thrust and/or too low electrical consumption. As the engine is based on, and balanced against (the also severely overpowered) RLA resistojet, we cannot make it realistic without making it obsolete in game terms. What could be done is to reduce the thrust increase of the LARJ mode to 12 kN and not reducing the electrical need compared to the normal resistojet mode (it is halved now which there is no reason for). It\u0027s still hilariously OP, but that problem has to be adressed in the RLA mod too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#a9a9a9;\u0022\u003EI haven\u0027t play tested the change but I guess it would require more than double the battery power to get to orbit, and probably halve my delta-V.
