IIRC, those were the ones they wanted to use FLOX with. IMO, FLOX should, in fact, be usable in most LOX-burning engines (much like Syntin in all kerosene-powered ones). Astronautix says it was actually \u003Cem\u003Eeasier \u003C/em\u003Eto handle than pure LOX, for whatever reason. The main problem with it seems to be that it\u0027s very expensive, what with fluorine adding to the cost. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E As for pure LF2, there were two fairly interesting concepts (one US and one Russian). Some data for that is on Astronautix, and the Russian one was actually considered for the UR-700. Fun fact: not only would it boost Isp compared to LOX, it\u0027d also boost thrust, being noticeably denser than LOX.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pizzaman428","CreatedById":126532,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-29T01:55:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/80983870/RemoteTech_Settings.cfg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ERT2 Settings File - Adds ground stations to launch sites\u003C/a\u003E thing, how do you install?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Luscion","CreatedById":120200,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-29T02:58:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022pizzaman428\u0022 data-cite=\u0022pizzaman428\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFor the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/80983870/RemoteTech_Settings.cfg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ERT2 Settings File - Adds ground stations to launch sites\u003C/a\u003E thing, how do you install?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003ENavigate to the \u0022RemoteTech\u0022 folder located in Kerbal Space Program\\GameData\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EOpen the \u0022RemoteTech_settings\u0022 cfg file found inside with either notepad or notepad \u002B\u002B\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Ego back to the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/80983870/RemoteTech_Settings.cfg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ERT2 Settings File - Adds ground stations to launch sites\u003C/a\u003E and highlight everything (ctrl \u002B A) and copy it (ctrl \u002B C)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ENow back to the \u0022RemoteTech_settings\u0022 cfg file you just opened.

It seems like I\u0027m picking up way too much speed, If I launch straight up to 125,000M and come straight back down I continue picking up speed all the way down to 50,000M. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this normal or just an error?
