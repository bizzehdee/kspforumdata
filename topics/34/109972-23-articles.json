However, the next time any changes are made like docking/undocking or decoupling, that seems to force an update to whatever was already connected.\n\nFor instance, on this test rig I made while trying to work out the details of the bug so I could report it (which turned out to be unnecessary), it starts with a command pod, two docking ports coupled together, and another crewed part with a third docking port on top. Then there\u0027s a framework going up to a decoupler holding another capsule with a docking port just above it, so that when decoupled, the slight fall brings the two unmated ports together. If I close the hatches which start out coupled together before firing the decoupler, the result is three separate living spaces. Boarding and exiting any of the pods doesn\u0027t seem to do anything. But then if I decouple the ports that start out attached (after opening both hatches on the newly docked parts), then the two sections still attached to each other finally merge into one space.\n\nStill easier to just use the unrestricted transfers option for now though.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-01-31T00:52:38Z\u0022 title=\u002201/31/2019 12:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 31, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Tallinu**\n  \nCorrection"},{"CreatedByName":"taniwha","CreatedById":57176,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-31T01:47:38Z","Content":"Ok, I have done up an unofficial build.
