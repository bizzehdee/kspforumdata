Still those missions come up in the contracts all the time. Thats why there is a decline button. It would be nice to just install Kethane and Karbonite and have those contracts appear without having to fiddle with .cfg files. If a mission came up to mine a asteroid and the value of brining it back to Kerbin could bring a lot of money to the player, I bet alot more people would try ARM contracts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BudgetHedgehog\uFEFF","CreatedById":104112,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-17T00:00:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe difference is that in the stock game, you \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Ecan\u003C/span\u003E make bases and capture asteroids.
