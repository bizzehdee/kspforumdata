With the advantage that they will auto-mesh with every other vessel in range.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- In the case of directional dish links, both vessels need to be pointed at each other (or pointed at something nearby so that both vessels are within each others cone). Auto-linking is limited to pairs of sats that have each other in their view cone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- In the case of a sat with a directional pointed at a sat that only has an omni, it will work as long as both sats are within range of each other\u0027s antennas.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Celestials (planets/moons) block line of sight, breaking transmission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- If you have a setup where A/B/C all have directional dishes and A points at B and B points at C and C points at A - nothing will work. Instead, each of the three need (2) dishes pointed at the other two.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#1 - For Comm-16s - put up a box of (4) sats at 776km altitude around Kerbin, evenly spread around the equator, each with 45m00s orbits. The four sats will auto-mesh with their neighbors and one will always be within view of KSC. They should all have one DTS-M1 antenna, pointed at either the Mun or Minmus. Plan on having at least 750 battery capacity to drive the Comm-16 plus (1) DTS-M1 during the orbital dark period. You can drive these with (6) OX-STAT solar panels. Three at the top of the satellite, angled about 45-degrees and three at the bottom, also angled 30-45 degrees to catch solar from directly behind. For safety, you might want to put a final (3) OX-STAT panels around the middle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese cost as little as 12-15k funds. Not too difficult at the start.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#2 - For your longer-range craft, put a satellite (or two) at KEO above Kerbin. Use a DTS-M1 to down-link to KSC and use your best long-range dish (KR-7 or KR-14 in early-mid game) set to \u0022active vessel\u0022. Once that \u0022KEO-Active\u0022 satellite is in place, all future vessels that will leave low Kerbin orbit should have a DTS-M1 or Comm 88-88 pointed at the \u0022KEO-Active\u0022 satellite. These satellites should be fitted with a minimum of 1300 battery capacity (dark period is 1195 seconds). I usually give these a Comm-16 and place them 30 degrees apart at 2869km so that they cross-link.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlan on spending 15-20k funds on these. You can get by with just one to start.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#3 - Around the Mun/Minmus, you\u0027ll want at least (2) satellites with DTS-M1 and Comm-16. Put them in 800-1000km orbits, about 120 degrees apart. The DTS-M1 should point at Kerbin. Four sats at 1250km or so works very well, but you can get by with as few as a single one. Shoot for a battery capacity of at least 2000.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDue to the increase in dV, you should plan on 18-22k funds for each of these.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"futrtrubl","CreatedById":77310,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-16T09:23:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RocketBlam\u0022 data-cite=\u0022RocketBlam\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EETA: The relay constellation is at about 6 million meters.

The display panel claims it has an omnidirectional range of 2.5Million km. I\u0027m seeing it cut out at shorter distances than that. Is there a mismatch between what its displaying and the number the game is actually using? I have 3 comsats in an orbit of 700,000m each, and it can\u0027t cut the chord across between them. The diameter of a 700,000m orbit should be 1,400,000m, so any chord distance has to be less than that, and yet the green line only appears when they\u0027re about 110 degrees around the arc from each other. When I try putting them at 120 degrees around the orbit from each other (forming a triangle), the communicatron16s don\u0027t quite make the connection. And I\u0027m definitely not trying to pass signal through the planet either.
