The reason for signing up is because I have encountered a problem unfortunately. I have been enjoying this game more and more but have only recently installed this mod. The problem I\u0027m having though is that\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 1) I don\u0027t seem to have a toolbar icon(or any icon) to access the settings for this mod. Nor anything to monitor the resources aboard my craft that involve this mod;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2)(Forgot I had a second problem) When I\u0027ve built my craft with the resources onboard, it doesn\u0027t seem that anything gets used up. I still come back to Kerbin with the same amount of Oxygen, Water, etc as what I had installed into the craft. I do have other mods installed and rather than type a list of mods(partly because I\u0027m unsure of the exact amount of mods installed) I figured I\u0027d take a snippet of the GameData file - \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/o4ux02m5koo595z/Snip2.PNG\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/o4ux02m5koo595z/Snip2.PNG\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope someone can help me as I\u0027d really like to make myself more of a challenge before I try jumping into the RSS/RO mods.
