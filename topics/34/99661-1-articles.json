Formerly known as KAINET: KAA Artificial Intelligence Network for Exploration, with Techtree.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe public has had enough of disaster-prone missions and \u0022space cowboy\u0022 agencies whose ambitions are larger than their capabilities. KSC administrators\u0027 protests that new safety regulations would cause crewed missions to become impractically expensive have fallen on deaf ears. With heavy hearts, they have updated their hiring notices to reflect the new reality: \u003Cem\u003ENo Astronauts Need Apply.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022No%20Astronauts%20Need%20Apply%20logo.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kerbas-ad-astra/No-Astronauts-Need-Apply/master/No%20Astronauts%20Need%20Apply%20logo.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No Astronauts Need Apply\u0022 was inspired by an idle thought of mine: \u0022What would it take to make a space program with no Kerbals in it?\u0022 The more I thought about it, the more challenging I realized it would be. For all of our jokes about their lack of common sense, Kerbals are handy critters to have around -- they can repack parachutes, pick up science, transfer supplies, and repair broken landing gear. Unless there\u0027s a way for spacecraft to do the same things themselves (not to my knowledge), the only way to \u0022repair\u0022 things is to put it on a module that can be removed and replaced. This has to be done using docking ports, since no Kerbals means no Kerbal Attachment System. No Kerbals also means no building rockets with Extraplanetary Launchpads, so spare parts have to come all the way from Kerbin. I guess this means the Kerbal universe is safe from self-replicating machines for the time being, though taniwha did mention having ideas for a separate mod enabling robots to build things when I brought this up in the EPL thread...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, since tech-tree mods seem to be all the rage these days, I figured I\u0027d put together a little tech tree and contract tweak to enforce these restrictions. This patch will suppress any part with non-zero crew capacity, as well moving the Stayputnik to Start and the QBE to Stability (and tweaking their entry costs accordingly). It also suppresses contracts involving flags, station and base construction, surveys, and tours. (I\u0027ve decided to leave rescue contracts alone, because the capsule itself can be rescued in various ways.) I thought fiddling with the contracts was going to be really hard, but Arsonide put FinePrint\u0027s contracts in the same config node system as everything else, so thanks a million!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor extra immersion, go into your settings and disable the space center crew.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDependencies\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDepends on \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55219\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EModule Manager\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E to function.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDownload and install\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nDownload from \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/Kerbas-ad-astra/No-Astronauts-Need-Apply/releases\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EGitHub\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDownload from \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbal.curseforge.com/ksp-mods/227824-no-astronauts-need-apply\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECurseForge\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom there, just unzip the \u0022NoAstronautsNeedApply\u0022 folder into your GameData directory.
