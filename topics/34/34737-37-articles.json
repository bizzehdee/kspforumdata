However, that functionality gets a little limited by the complexity that comes from having a lot of robotic parts. The list of parts gets very long. What I would like to see added is a system of \u003Cstrong\u003Epages\u003C/strong\u003E. Basically apart from setting control parts in groups, groups could be placed in pages. A page would be used to represent an autonomous system (such as one of two robotic arms on a space station). The arm itself still has multiple groups to control the different motions, but each arm can function independently of the other. The trick is, that the parts on a page only react to key controls what that page is up. So it would be possible to reuse keys for different systems (once again the two arms example: the two arms could have the same controls but could be controlled independently without having to lock all the parts).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI personally see a lot of potential in this, anyone else?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a separate note, this is more of a question: is it possible to set numpad numbers as controls for robotics?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BahamutoD","CreatedById":72433,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-25T07:13:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Torminator\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Torminator\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that the wobbliness is an engine thing unfortunately..

Putting the main rotator right at the center of mass and making sure the armatures were symmetric front to back means that, in any configuration, the thrust is balanced with respect to the CoM. Now, if the CoM moves...\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s an awesome ship.

I need to learn to centralize the fuel tank so it doesnt shift too much. Also, this probably isn\u0027t the answer either, but at first I thought I didn\u0027t have speed control either until I realized it is only editable in-flight.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gristle","CreatedById":60589,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-25T08:05:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022BahamutoD\u0022 data-cite=\u0022BahamutoD\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI think that the wobbliness is an engine thing unfortunately..
