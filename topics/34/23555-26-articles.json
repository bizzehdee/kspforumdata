Any solutions? There seem to be a lot of people concerned, but I\u0027ve not seen any workaround in the thread.\u003Cp\u003EIt worked correctly on the Kerbin launchpad, but it doesn\u0027t in my Munar station in 1000 Km orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn case it helps, I\u0027m also using \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/36059-WIP-Attachment-pack\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis mod\u003C/a\u003E which may conflict, but it didn\u0027t on the Kerbin launchpad: I successfully attached struts to my ship, on the same surfaces I\u0027m trying to do so in orbit now, and it doesn\u0027t work either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk so in case it\u0027s useful, here is what I\u0027ve just done and I could successfully attach the connectors (and struts from the other mod):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- copied the exact same Mun station from the quicksave.sfs (\u003Cem\u003Ei.e.\u003C/em\u003E, assembled modules with docking ports);\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- placed it onto the launchpad, high altitude, by tweaking a new ship in the quicksave.sfs;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- triggered debug menu and enabled: pause on vessel unpack, unbreakable joints, no crash damage, and hack gravity;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- for some reason, the station fall on the ground despite the gravity hack, but without exploding thanks to the aforementioned cheats;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- got Bill EVA, tried to attach connectors and struts. It worked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere must be something wrong with orbit, right? Or Mun? Or velocity?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course \u003Cstrong\u003Ethis is not a workaround\u003C/strong\u003E - unfortunately! I\u0027d really hope to have one. This is just some tests I\u0027ve been done to try to figure out what\u0027s wrong. I still don\u0027t know, but here\u0027s exactly what I\u0027ve done to try to pinpoint the source of the issue. Just wanted to make sure that this was not a problem with the station itself, hence I wanted to try on the existing station, not a new ship. Noteworthy, on a brand new ship, it will always work on the launchpad, without tweaking the savefile, as mentioned in an earlier post. Is someone inspired?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[Edit] Putting the station 100 M Km away, outside of spheres of influence, doesn\u0027t help: attachments do not work. They appear to work only on/near (how much?) the Kerbin launchpad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[Edit 2] I tried the same situation but with Gravity hack, I apparently was able to attach connectors (well sort of: they did not stick, but I could drop them thanks to the green indicator). After removing the gravity hack... Still working. Weird.
