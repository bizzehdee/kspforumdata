For example, the old method considers a solar orbit near Eve or Duna easier than an orbit near Kerbin. We need a more nuanced method to figure out difficulty of missions based on the celestial body we\u0027re looking at.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe old code multiplies difficulty by sphere of influence to get maximum altitude for random sat missions. This is very simple to write, so I understand why you used it, just to get something in there and working. I spent a few hours thinking of ways we can improve it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI divided solar orbits into three regions: near Kerbin (low \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv), far from the sun (medium), and close to the sun (high, on average). In addition, high orbits near non-Kerbin planets are easier than low orbits, so I inverted the difficulty-to-altitude relationship for planetary bodies other than Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also used the high/low space boundary to split orbits into thirds, instead of difficulty*SOI. The SOI doesn\u0027t have a regular relationship to the \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00E2\u20AC\u00A0v required to reach orbits around that body. It\u0027s irregular because KSP uses simple one-body gravitational interactions. They had to set the SOI to values that are good for escape/capture, but don\u0027t match orbits well. This is why they set the hi/low science orbit boundary by hand for each planet and moon. The science boundary is a better indicator of difficulty for various orbits around a body.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor aerial and rover missions on Kerbin, consider centering them somewhere close to the space center, but not quite on it. We play the game to have fun, flying should be enjoyable, and the terrain around the space center is rather boring. It\u0027s mostly featureless flat land and water. I centered these missions around interesting landscape features to give people a nice view while completing the mission. Introductory flights go around the old-airfield islands to the southeast, and mountains to the west. Rover missions go around the space center at first, then the hills to the southwest. It\u0027s fun to explore these areas.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomething else to consider is adding more distance or waypoints for missions on Kerbin doesn\u0027t really make them harder, it just makes them take longer, which isn\u0027t very fun. The altitude range is a more important factor for aerial flight difficulty. Flying at low altitudes is easy because low speeds and high air density give us good control over aircraft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe descriptions for some missions make sense for other planets, but are odd for Kerbin. Why would the space center be a place we don\u0027t know much about? I rephrased Kerbin aerial missions to evoke the experimental test plane projects of history: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOld: \u0022There are places on Kerbin that we don\u0027t know much about, fly over them and see what you can see.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENew: \u0022Pilot a jet to these locations to collect test flight data for commercial aircraft engineering.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-01T12:03:17Z\u0022 title=\u002209/01/2014 12:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 1, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Thalassicus\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Arsonide","CreatedById":32604,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-01T12:02:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Thalassicus\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Thalassicus\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis is very simple to write, so I understand why you used it, just to get something in there and working.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis wasn\u0027t my code. This is stock behavior, and the multipliers for each planet are stock as well. I encountered the same issues you have with the difficulty to reward ratio, but at the same time, my mod is something that I intend to change stock behavior as little as possible with. I want to enhance the stock experience with more activities, not change it. For this reason, I left the stock behavior as it is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe aerial and rover missions behave exactly as you describe now. They choose a random spot on the planet, unless that planet is Kerbin/Home. If the planet is Kerbin, they check the difficulty, and the chances to spawn near KSC. At lower difficulties, they pick a spot near KSC, and spawn around that spot. At higher difficulties it can still spawn near KSC (though rarely) but the distance from KSC moves outward. This is all configurable, if you feel that the chances for this are too great or too low.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI agree that having some new titles for missions based on location would be cool! However, I try to stick to the convention of starting each title with the same word. You will notice that all satellite missions start with \u0022Position\u0022, all station missions start with \u0022Build\u0022, all rover missions start with \u0022Chart\u0022, and so on. This is not unintentional. I do this so that the mission list is easy to \u0022skim\u0022 with your eyes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis convention has caused me to keep the descriptions of each mission relatively static, but I do believe you are right. I can change the \u0022backstory\u0022 of each mission, without changing the first word. I will look into that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for difficulty/length of aerial/rover missions. I do believe that you will like my plans for the next patch. I intend to add variations of these missions that behave very differently. For instance, a \u0022chain\u0022 of waypoints that you visit in a certain order, or even little race tracks for rovers. I have lots of plans here. Keep an eye out.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Arsonide","CreatedById":32604,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-01T12:18:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI experienced something weird in my testing, so I need some help from anybody that\u0027s playing with my mod.

It would be nice if this mod supports a similar parameter. I don\u0027t like add-ons messing with part costs and the stock game is way to easy (especially when one uses add-ons like stage recovery). So a custom multiplicator seem like a simple fix for this issue.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe latest patch added dozens of settings per mission type for this per currency type per difficulty.

I would really like an ingame setting to temporary only create missions for a specific sphere of influence.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis doesn\u0027t really fit in very well with the game. Contracts are not a proactive thing. They are a reactive thing. The player responds to requests. This is a good setup, because before 0.24, players would often do the same thing over and over, and now, they have incentives to do things they never though of before, or things outside of their comfort range. Because of this, I will say that I don\u0027t really support this idea, however, I will also say that when I do add a settings screen in game, it will have a button to reload the configuration file, so you can edit the settings without having to restart the game. This should allow you to do this if you choose to.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-01T20:39:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Arsonide\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Arsonide\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWith all of that said, you should not see the majority of Fine Print\u0027s contracts in a new game unless you\u0027ve unlocked the technology for them.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m seeing this.
