It\u0027d be consumed slowly enough not to need frequent resupplying, and taking a lot of it along shouldn\u0027t take too much space in case of long missions. Also, nobody says this stuff has be be continuously consumed/generated. Unless there\u0027s some difficulty in making the consumption/generation occur once in about 8h, I don\u0027t see why couldn\u0027t there be a \u0022consumption event\u0022 3 times a day (should\u0027ve mentioned it, I suppose). TBH, it was mostly because BobCat\u0027s HOME features an awesome greenhouse and I wanted it to work properly. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, water is the real addition I wanted to propose. It\u0027d be consumed more often, once about 3-4h. The biggest problem with it is it\u0027s that it\u0027s rather heavy. For a space station, resupply flights should take care of it, especially when they won\u0027t have to carry oxygen (remember, you can generate oxygen from Waste Water). For interplanetary expeditions, a closed cycle water system would be needed, with most of the Waste Water being recycled and O2 coming from a CO2 recycling system. Those are real challenges that interplanetary expeditions have to overcome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and the toilet on Soyuz is in the OM, BTW. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, for balance, I\u0027d use HOME as a basis. On-board food rations in a habitat should last for an average length of a journey to Jool. Water system should be closed cycle, with an emergency supply provided by the fuel cell running off the main tank. Oxygen should be closed cycle with a decent emergency supply. Such a pod would have to use a powerful energy source, I\u0027m assuming the interplanetary bus would be able to provide that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpon landing, greenhouses would be deployed. One greenhouse should provide enough food to sustain population of one HOME pod (6 Kerbals, IIRC). Oxygen still in closed cycle, water would start to slowly be consumed by the greenhouse. Power would have to switch to the HOME power module, which should be able to keep up with two pods. That means you\u0027d only have to worry about water if you do it right (a big if, which is what makes mod like this fun), which would either have to be delivered periodically (hassle on a Jool colony) or found on site. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, in-situ water: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Stock system: Easy. Extract using HOME intakes, convert using HOME converter, feed into the fuel cell. You won\u0027t get net EC, but you\u0027re powering it with a HOME nuke anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Realistic system: Less easy, probably a long shot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Duna: This is a problem, since there\u0027s only CO2 ice on the poles. But that means infinite oxygen (via recycling system), which reduces your deliveries to lightweight H2. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Vall: Has enough ice to last a lifetime. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Eve: Lots of interesting elements in the air and oceans, hydrogen and oxygen would require some chemistry (and EC) to extract, but should be there somewhere. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Minmus: Seems to have plenty of ice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Eeloo: There\u0027s a lot of frozen stuff in there. Some of it is probably water.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Laythe: It\u0027s very Kerbin-like, so I assume oceans are water. If they\u0027re methane, then perhaps with some CO2 around you could the necessary hydrogen and oxygen. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Rockies: You\u0027re out of luck, bring a big water cistern.

Presumably all capsules contain some basic life support systems -heat (not concerned with this atm) and C02 separation. The only reason anyone would hold onto the CO2 is if they were going to do something with it, which the basic life support systems (as modeled in ECLSS) are unable to do.
