I kinda liked tacking MechJebs on to intermediary stages so I could deorbit them.\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s afaik no other surface-attachable CommandModule (so that\u0027s 2 more parts for a cubic strut and a probe) and certainly none as lightweight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith 0.21.1 KSP changed the way it choose the controlpod in command of the ship ( control from here ) and most of the time it choose the MJ2 module.

I\u0027m assuming right now the code is simply using part and part.vessel, but you can just as easily access the current vessel and control part using FlightGlobals.ActiveVessel and something like foreach (Part p in FlightGlobals.ActiveVessel.parts) if (p.isControlSource) controlPart = p; to set those up. Most of the stuff MechJeb deals with is outside part/partmodule anyways, so I don\u0027t think it would be all that huge of a coding change to make it partless.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot sure it would increase perf at all. Only 1 MJ2 is active on a vessel even if there is more thant one on it ( at least it should ) so it won\u0027t change perf.

So it makes it there, right on the bulls-eye, but spends a huge amount of fuel doing so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Tonight I tried an experiment where I flew a craft that was basically a fuel tank, engine, probe and power systems to see what the difference would be between landing at a target I chose and using the \u0022Land Somewhere\u0022 option which seems to work fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Both times were from a 100km equatorial orbit.

Often, it does a de-orbit burn that looks spot on and the info box says it\u0027s within about 200m. But then for no apparent reason the ship switches ends and starts burning prograde until the orbit no longer touches the ground and keeps getting higher and higher, pointlessly wasting gobs of fuel. This doesn\u0027t happen on airless planets, just those with atmospheres.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, this seems to happen only when you tell MJ to land at a spot that\u0027s too close ahead of where your ship currently is. MJ appears to need somewhere between 1/3 to 1/2 an orbit. So, the best way to avoid or at least minimize this behavior is to start the process with as much of an orbit to go as possible, like right after you\u0027ve passed over the target so you get it the next time around. USUALLY this will prevent the spurious \u0022wrong way\u0022 burning. However, what often happens instead is that the rocket will now burn at idle speed pretty much all the way down, saying it\u0027s doing a coarse correction of like 0.1m/s, but this number never changes and the landing error never decreases, so it\u0027s just a pointless waste of fuel again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo all in all, I have the best luck with not only engaging the landing autopilot a full orbit in advance, but also then disengaging the autopilot immediately after the de-orbit/plane-change burn when the error is about 200m. Then I fly it myself the rest of the way down, including opening any parachutes (which MJ doesn\u0027t do very well, either). Once the chutes are open, I tell it to \u0022land somewhere\u0022 and it goes down just fine from there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AncientGammoner","CreatedById":77111,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-05T21:52:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve flown a couple missions with the old dll and then this dll and honestly the only differences I noticed were actually regressive. The new dll turns towards nodes much less smoothly (almost whips around sometimes) and I\u0027ve seen it struggle to get to really simple node locations (fly right past them and then barely come back). And is there a reason why it sometimes spins on the long axis when turning toward a node, because that makes no sense. Also I\u0027ve seen the new dll warp right past nodes on multiple occasions (come out of warp at like \u002B4 minutes for a simple 5 second burn). It\u0027s the same with the old version, but is MechJeb ever going to stop oscillating the whole ship, especially large vehicles with gimbaled engines.

Nevertheless, I believe the oscillation I was seeing has to do with the flex of the ship. If you build large/tall vehicles (I typically use the 3.75m/5m KW and Novapunch2 engines for my first stages) they have some flex to them, so when mechjeb detects movement one way I\u0027m guessing it assumes the whole ship is going off course when in reality it\u0027s just the ship flexing a bit in that direction. It then tries to compensate which causes it to swing back, causing more flex, then oscillations, then (if you don\u0027t have enough struts) usually destruction.

I often wish MechJeb would jettison my fairings at \u0026gt;69k. Sometimes I\u0027m not really paying attention (or am literally afk), and if I come back with the ship in orbit and the fairings still on, ejecting at that point creates debris that needs cleaning, whereas ejecting on time usually leaves it sub-orbital so it just takes care of itself. Don\u0027t know if that requires a full blown stacking commands functionality, perhaps just a checkbox that says \u0022Stage as leaving atmosphere\u0022 or something like that. Obviously you\u0027d want to leave it off if your vehicle doesn\u0027t have fairings to eject...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA bigger nifty, though, would be to get the delta-V calcs for stages correct. Often my \u0022stage dV\u0022 displays as 0 when I clearly have plenty, and the stage before you eject fairings is one that\u0027s dV display is always broken... not a BIG deal, but annoying. The bigger deal is rockets that display 0 dV on their last stage or two. Bad enough when you\u0027re building the rocket and you can\u0027t see what kind of dV the probe at the end will have once it\u0027s on that stage, but worse when in-flight it just can\u0027t figure out your dV, and there\u0027s no apparent reason why it would be confused, there\u0027s no more stages to consider or anything, it\u0027s just a probe with a fuel tank and an engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStraying further off-topic with my gripe list, there\u0027s one big one that I\u0027d kill to see fixed before anything else: stop my bloody ships from spinning around and smacking the space station the moment I hit \u0022undock\u0022. At one time, I could have sworn, MechJeb\u0027s Smart A.S.S. would simply default to \u0022off\u0022 for any ship that undocked, but there was a serious regression in behavior some months ago, and now a newly undocked ship, which you\u0027re not in control of, will have its onboard MechJeb suddenly engage in violent maneuvers the moment it undocks as it tries to do whatever it thinks it ought to be doing, and there\u0027s simply no way to switch to the ship quick enough to stop it from smashing itself against the side of the station sometimes. I notice this doesn\u0027t happen if I quicksave and then reload the game before undocking, but if I\u0027ve been repeatedly docking and undocking during the same session (as I was the other day as I reconfigured an assembled-in-orbit station), undocking a previous docked craft causes its Jeb to run wild. It appears to have its settings something like what they were when it docked, but often they make no sense anymore, like it\u0027s trying to align to a target, except you now have a different target than you did when you docked, and it decides it needs to point in a completely different direction RIGHT NOW. Other times I swear it\u0027s getting confused about which ship it is -- it\u0027ll adopt some Smart A.S.S. setting that I\u0027m pretty sure a completely different ship had that docked previously. In any case, it doesn\u0027t help that my station tugs are designed with enough torque to manhandle heavy station components, so when they\u0027re undocking with nothing in tow, they can spin around with incredible speed and force. After a few explosions, broken pieces, and craft nearly kicked out of orbit, I just got into the save/reload habit before each undocking, but it\u0027s a pain... if I had to pick just one thing to get fixed, it would be that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGripes aside, I do love this mod. As complex as it is and as much as it does, obviously it\u0027s going to have some rough spots, but overall it\u0027s an insanely great piece of work.
