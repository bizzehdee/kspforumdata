I would have thought it would use the thrust vectors of the currently active engines so I wouldn\u0027t expect changing the \u0022control from here\u0022 part to ever make any difference. Of course, MJ might get a bit confused about how to control the vessel if the \u0022control from here\u0022 vector is not roughly opposite to the thrust vector...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat you are describing is technically possible to program but MJ is currently reliant on stock behavior to determine its control vector. It\u0027s natural and easy to code for. To make it behave otherwise requires extra coding. Maybe it\u0027ll happen someday....\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Prismatech","CreatedById":96313,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-16T13:28:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDo I have what Change in the cfg that all pods or probs at careere begin start with mechjeb\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-16T13:36:09Z\u0022 title=\u002210/16/2014 01:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 16, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Prismatech\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"smunisto","CreatedById":57789,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-16T15:19:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey, sarbian!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA long, long, long time ago I asked you about the possibilities to look into offloading part of the MJ calculations to other threads, which are not in use by KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have noticed that in the recent MJ versions the game doesn\u0027t stutter anymore with the usual calculation-heavy windows that I keep open (Orbit info, Vessel Info and sometimes my custom Rendez-vous window). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wanted to ask if you implemented something along those lines or is it just me upgrading from my old trusty Phenom II x4 955 to an 4970K i7?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xytovl","CreatedById":112756,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-16T18:14:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022smunisto\u0022 data-cite=\u0022smunisto\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHey, sarbian!\u003Cp\u003EA long, long, long time ago I asked you about the possibilities to look into offloading part of the MJ calculations to other threads, which are not in use by KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have noticed that in the recent MJ versions the game doesn\u0027t stutter anymore with the usual calculation-heavy windows that I keep open (Orbit info, Vessel Info and sometimes my custom Rendez-vous window). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wanted to ask if you implemented something along those lines or is it just me upgrading from my old trusty Phenom II x4 955 to an 4970K i7?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is not easy to offload to worker threads, most game objects will be modified by the simulation making it unsafe to use them.
