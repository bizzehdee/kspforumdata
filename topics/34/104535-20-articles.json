Might not be an IR bug, just something to do with the way KSP works.\n\nIf you have a cockpit with an IVA mounted on a servo, and then change the orientation of the cockpit via the servo, your IVA view doesn\u0027t change direction (even though the cockpit part itself does change direction).\n\nIf you set the cockpit as the root part then the IVA view does rotate correctly. Unfortunately, if you set the cockpit as the root part then the servos will behave differently, rotating the rest of the ship more than the part with the cockpit (because all of the reaction wheels on the craft will try to maintain the orientation of the root), although I\u0027m experimenting with workarounds and will post again if I can figure something out."},{"CreatedByName":"Perry Apsis","CreatedById":97519,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T04:44:31Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E hey,\n\u003E i am trying to rescale the parts using tweakscale.\n\u003E \n\u003E sadly, the larger the parts become, the more problems i get.

The side of the servo with the yellow \u0022tape\u0022 and arrows should be connected to the subsection of the craft that containing the root part. This won\u0027t always cause a transform problem, but I have seen it happen sometimes. I haven\u0027t been able to pin down exactly when it happens and when it doesn\u0027t. \n\n2) Struts. Even if struts aren\u0027t accidentally placed such that they cross the servo and fight against it, struts on the child of the servo part can sometimes cause issues. Again, I haven\u0027t been able to pin down the exact cause, but try moving or removing your struts.\n\n3) Certain mod parts resist transform by the IR servos. The KAS anchor part definitely does not like being moved by IR. I\u0027m not sure what other parts might have this issue. [Here](http://gfycat.com/SevereElaborateIndianglassfish) is an example where the anchor part on the left toe doesn\u0027t want to move.\n\n4) When using multiple servos in a \u0022closed loop\u0022 structure created by docking ports. My understanding is that IR parts figure out their orientation relative to the root of the craft in the VAB/SPH. Docking a craft to itself (or to another craft) can apparently cause the root part to change, which has a chance of messing up the servo orientation (ie, the two servos will potentially start to fight one another). No real solution to this problem since I don\u0027t think the change is necessarily consistent. IE, on one launch inverting the servo might fix the problem, but on another it might cause the problem. Related to case 1.\n\n5) \u0022Other\u0022. Sometimes the problem occurs even when the servo is the right way around, there are no struts, and there are no mod parts. I haven\u0027t been able to determine the cause in these cases, but reassembly sometimes fixes it. Example [here](http://gfycat.com/DemandingIdealisticAntarcticgiantpetrel), although this may actually have been an example of issue 2 (there\u0027s a strut from the girder to the structural fuselage piece)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-27T07:24:27Z\u0022 title=\u002207/27/2015 07:24  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by allmhuran**"},{"CreatedByName":"Perry Apsis","CreatedById":97519,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T12:06:46Z","Content":"Hi, Allmhuran.

Oh, right, mod parts. I\u0027ve got a lot of procedural parts. I wonder if that could be the cause. \n\nLastly, I should have mentioned that I tried this with a rotatron and it worked perfectly fine, but the poor little thing was just too floppy.

In one config that\u0027s not very different from the one in the pic above, when I started the rotation, the only thing that moved was the Gigantors that were attached to the science lab. Those moved first clockwise then counter-clockwise, about 1/8th of a rotation each way.

What I\u0027ve been doing for my new v1.04 mechs is turning them into, basically, a mod. I create an assembly, then weld it all together as a new part, then edit the config. This overcomes a whole bunch of issues specifically when it comes to using IR:\n\n1) It lets me set the mass to something super low. This may seem cheaty but given the limitations of the unity joints that IR has to use, there\u0027s really no alternative if you want joints that appear to be \u0022realistically strong\u0022. You can always add mass back to the root assembly if you want realistic overall mass for the craft.\n\n2) The part welding mod doesn\u0027t rely on tweakscale, *even if you use tweakscale to build your assembly*. Once the assembly is welded into a single part it simply sets the value for the scale on each model reference. Some stock parts don\u0027t work well with tweakscale, for those (like the mk1 structural fuselage) I literally copy the squad part config file, save it as a new part, edit the rescalefactor to what I want it to be, and add that to my assembly. Once the welding is done *you can delete the modified config you created*, because the welding mod just holds a reference to the actual model and the scale, *not* the part config file that was used.\n\n3) You don\u0027t need to strut pieces together \u0022downstream\u0022 of the IR joint, eliminating that as a source of transform issues.\n\nThe downside, of course, is that if you want to share your creations you have to distribute your welded parts as some kind of mod. Note, however, that AFAIK other users \\*do not need\\* the welding mod itself. They only need the \u0022welded\u0022 part config files and any parts that were used in the welded part."},{"CreatedByName":"TiBERiUM","CreatedById":148962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T06:09:20Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Did you look in a sandbox save (not career)?
