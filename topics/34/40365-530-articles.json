Those KSP-I radiators are going to be even handier now, although I kind of loathe that NERVA\u0027s now have THIS new mechanic on top of their weight and poor thrust to \u0022balance\u0022 them...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m afraid, on the short term you going to need another sollution for that because Interstellar only handles WasteHeat resource, not the Stock Heat. One the otherhand it might be an idea for the future, to somehow affect each other. KSP heat could theoreticly be converted into Wasteheat which would then be radiate into space with any kspi radiator.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-24T21:34:26Z\u0022 title=\u002205/24/2015 09:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FreeThinker\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
