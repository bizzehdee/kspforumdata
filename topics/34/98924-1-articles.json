Launch swarms of tiny, low-cost satellites when you\u0027re on a money or weight budget.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E If you\u0027re interested in the currently-growing area of Nanosatellite missions such as CubeSats, this is the mod for you. While these Kubes may not provide the most science compared to some other options, they\u0027re simple and inexpensive to make, costing between 160-500 Funds each depending on how you want to build it. Fly a swarm of 20 of them for less than 5000 Funds. They are very small and lightweight, having minimal weight impact on a rocket. You could even slap one on the side of another mission to get a little more from your launch. The experiments are designed to be repeated many times, so unless you want to spend a long time making one Kube do all the work, launching multiples is recommended.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Currently includes two experiments: A particle detector on the smaller-sized probe, and a combination magnetic field detector/particle detector on the larger one. The small one is a mere 10cm/side.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese Kubes are meant to reflect the simpler design of nanosatellites compared to larger and more complex satellites, so you can start flying them at tech level 4.

Do you think that a good middleground for a PPOD-like decoupler would be for it to to launch the whole pile locked together, which is then separated by the flingers after deployment?

Kilowatts was my starting point for setting power rates, but if I made the power values too small, all I saw in-game was power rates of 0.0, rather than 0.02. These things were intended to be as realistic as I could get in KSP while avoiding those things like an apparent 0 power consumption. If Realism Overhaul allows for more precise units, I do want to give that a try, and make a separate version tuned for RO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see from my join date, I mainly started on the forums here to make this thread, so I didn\u0027t see any requests for such.

My Flinger\u0027s force, as long as KSP\u0027s force units are in kN like I think, is 0.02kN, so it should still qualify as it is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn second thought, I think I also had to make these things \u0027physics-less\u0027 parts, in that they don\u0027t have mass or aerodynamics until they\u0027ve been deployed. Without this setting, a stack of cubes would act as though they were made out of rubber while on the ground and especially during launch, and look really silly. As in, the cube on the outer end of the stack would sag halfway down the height of the rocket. I\u0027m not sure if these quasi-massless parts would still qualify.

I haven\u0027t really done much using of mods since version 0.18, so my knowledge is out of date. Putting it into main/Parts and main/Resources worked for development, so that\u0027s what I thought would work for the distributed version. I took a look at some other [Part] style mods just now, and I think I have the basic structure down.

I remember using RemoteTech some time ago, and I do agree compatibility would be fun to add. Already got tuning things for RO-compatibility on my to-do list. Are there any tricks I can use to have one set of files to be cross-compatible depending on what the dowloader has installed in their KSP, or is it better to split my project into different versions for each mod?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure about KAS integration for the moment. Before I started making this 2-3 months ago, I hadn\u0027t even used Blender before. Making the cubes as one solid piece with every feature, though, while it would remove some configuration freedom, I guess, it would really help with trying to assemble them. No more fiddling with pieces smaller than the attachment nodes in the VAB where the camera doesn\u0027t zoom in far enough. Thinking ahead, the only part of making my Kubes self-contained that I don\u0027t know how to do is to allow for more than one solar panel per part. Can anyone help me with that? It may also fix the issue I had with making custom deployable panels as well. I had wanted to include a set for the 3U chassis, but the best I could get them, they only would produce power when edge-on to the Sun, rather than face-on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince the Kubes could be built with or without panels on the top and bottom, and there\u0027s currently no restrictions on where the kube\u0027s antennas can be placed, I think these choices would be lost going to a 1-part system. Would anyone mind if the antennas were integrated? And do I need to make another set of models that have both 4 and 6 panels, or just pick one type and discard the other?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wabbit","CreatedById":110502,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-09T18:24:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh, now this is cool!
