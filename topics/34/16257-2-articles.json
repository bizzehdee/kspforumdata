If it weren\u0027t for Tosh actually going out of his way and making the RC Antenna, this plugin would have no custom parts at all. Everything else is just my own semi-ugly reskins of stock parts and rescaled parts from probodyne (again graciously donated by NovaSilisko).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI intended the standard antenna to be that big in order to visually distinguish it from the small short-range RC Antenna. But I would wholeheartedly welcome additional parts to bundle with this plugin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegarding your Idea to add in dedicated signal processors to the individual antennae.

This way there is a measure of motivation to mount unmanned, contra, manned missions. And also it adds a measure of realism. A manned mission should have more mass than an umnanned one. Of course, if you combine my plugin with something like Zoxygene and balance tha mass (and energy requirenment) of the individual parts, you would have the same effect, just with way more realism in life-support.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor sure my parts could use some balancing in the mass department, if you\u0027re up to the task, you are very welcome to look into the config files and editing them a bit.
