You have to think about gameplay balance and the size of the parts..To be able to create a 4 or 6 or 8 Kerbal freezer you are looking at a part bigger than the CRY-1300 and smaller than the CRY-2300 (but not by much). Weight-wise there isn\u0027t going to be much difference. Now that being said, the original plan was for a 1,4 (which was changed to 3) and 10 kerbal parts. Once I fix up the next version you can go ahead and create your own X kerbal parts (although with no internal). But also there is a forgotten part here. Our original plans was for one more part. Which is a 1 kerbal RADIAL freezer. The idea of this part was you can slap it on the side of another part to change your vessel\u0027s freezer capacity.

My investigations thus far have found that whenever you EVA or switch vessels this problem can occur as well.\n\nIt\u0027s actually documented as a known issue on the Texture Replacer thread: \u0022Cabin-specific IVA suits don\u0027t persist through scene switches while on EVA.\u0022.\n\nI don\u0027t think this is actually a DeepFreeze bug, as so much as the way KSP works. DeepFreeze extends this known Texture Replacer issue to also include when you thaw a kerbal using DeepFreeze.\n\nIt won\u0027t be fixable within DeepFreeze but will require fixes on the Texture Replacer mod, if at all possible.
