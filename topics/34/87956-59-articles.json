As for the multiple styles of K Parts, it might be possible to run both, I think most people will now have the K parts from 4.01 so we could rename the humpback k parts to H parts. I believe there is also 2 sets of J Parts (they may not be in the stuff we currently have and if that is the case then we don\u0027t need to worry).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI only have the 1.8 test releases, and the J parts from them all match, so that should at least not be a problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChanging the names of the parts? That might be trickier. If we\u0027re lucky, I should be able to change the file names and the plain text .cfg files and be good to go, if not we\u0027ll have to edit the .mu files, which are binary and require a special editor in order not to break when re-saved. I\u0027m about to test it with a couple of parts right now.
