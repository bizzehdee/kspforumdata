Currently it is being done to engines in a config file before the KSP and DRE finish loading up because that was the easiest place to deal with overheating issues involving Real Fuels engines. When DRE actually loads in, one of the first things that happens is it looks at maxTemps on all parts and anything that didn\u0027t get handled in configs, or is still too high after configs were loaded is going to get cut down to either half of their current maxTemp or ridiculousMaxTemp, whichever is lowest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s also conceivable that your problem is not with the adjustment of maxTemps in engines, or that it is only part of the problem.
