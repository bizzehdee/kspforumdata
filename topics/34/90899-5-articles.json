Fly straight at where you want to go. When you get within the SOI of the body you are going to, reduce the drive throttle. As you approach the planet, steer the ship into an orbit reducing throttle as you go. Once you get into an orbit, any orbit, use low throttle on the drive to circularize the orbit the best you can and finish it off with conventional engines. Its extremely easy actually.
