So while the license technically allows reuse, etc. I would prefer that you do not roll in one of my active mods. This was built specifically as an alternative to the KSPI drive, and I intend to keep it as such. So yes, the license allows a derivative work (though I expect the CC license may conflict with KSPI\u0027s), so it\u0027s not an issue of allowing things. But if you\u0027re asking for a blessing, the answer would be a respectful no, for the reasons noted above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, as I have stated repeatedly, if you want to do a KSPI config, that\u0027s fine - assuming all the user has is KSPI and is NOT using the NFT or USI constellations (these are both easy MM checks). But I would not want it interfering with NFT, etc. which use alternate power scales.
