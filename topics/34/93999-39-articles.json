I was talking about increasing the maximum warp. Its very important to get to the outermost bodies. But TimeControl has bugs and I theres no ETA. You could make OPM warp rails a toggle-able setting, defaulted to off. However, I know OPM doesn\u0027t have a settings window so this might be a lot of work. I don\u0027t know if its possible, but you could make patching a new set of warp rails conditional: TimeControl not detected-\u0026gt;Patch improved rails.\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure you\u0027ve got plenty on your plate, I just want to keep the ideas flowing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo-one on the OPM team has any plugin-writing experience, which your suggestions seems to require.

When ever I get too close to the moons (close orbit, landing) the textures on the planet pop into a different default texture. Hale turns into a weird bumpy Minmus, Slate turns grey and flat, and Tekto turns into what I think is Laythe. The sizes remain the same, only the textures and hightmaps change. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have tried many time to install this on a clean copy of ksp .90 following all the directions but I\u0027ve had no luck, any tips?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptRobau","CreatedById":41695,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-17T16:04:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s very weird and it really should not do that (never heard of it happening). My best guess is that it\u0027s either related to Linux not interacting with the plugins that this mod uses correctly or that its related to the 64-bit version of Linux not interacting with the plugins that this mod uses. So there are two points of action you can undertake: test the mod on the 32-bit version of Linux and if that doesn\u0027t solve it, try it out on the 320bit Windows version of KSP (don\u0027t know how possible that is for you).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Asmosdeus","CreatedById":9051,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-17T17:50:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKerbinside seems to make this thing CTD during the loading screen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027ll hit 3.6GB then crash.
