I am not saying that it is important for the matter just for complete visual pleasure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if the thrusters do fire as expected physically then does anybody have any ideas why could such a weird thing happen?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs it a problem with module RCSFX? I always thought that the association between the thruster and the audible and visual effects it produces is hard coded in to the game? Right? I think this should be considered a bug worth fixing because apart from breaking the general immersion it makes it hard to tell right away whether they are on or off when you control thrusters on individual parts via action groups and have the global system enabled as well as making it quite impossible to watch out not to hit something or someone with your exhaust which is important in reality.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as I remember they have Remote tech modules that say something like local control which enables us to use the attitude computer and the task planner with them as well as all the pods whether manned or not do have an antenna. Anyway this is still required for sending any data via the visibility and connection conditions instead of the plane stock algorithm and can be quite useful for some other mods. And by the way there are lots of stock things that you have turned upside down completely for the only purpose of hardcore realism. Is not that the main idea of this mod? Why should this bit be consistent with stock? I think it was good in the previous release. Also there were suggestions to write a config that would automatically add the module to any active command parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope you will get it to work.

If you cared to read back a few pages you\u0027ll see that when RT modules WERE added it to manned pods it broke the capability of attaching an unmanned probe to the same craft and allowing it to function when all the crew left the station. If anything this is a limitation of RT. If you want better functionality then talk to them. It\u0027s not my problem. I actually fixed a bug I created by removing the RT modules from manned pods that I had originally put in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELook at it this way, if you hop into an airplane, you don\u0027t need a connection to the ground in order to fly it. You need an antenna to communicate but you don\u0027t need one to fly. So how the current implementation of stock function NOT realistic? If you want an attitude computer or task planner then you can use mechjeb or some other autopilot, just like real life. If you install an antenna on a pod. THEN it will say \u0022local control\u0022. Still no flight computer. But you can transmit science back, which is disabled in sandbox, which is the only thing supported at this time. So doesn\u0027t really matter then does it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThink of RT as a way of controlling objects in space via the ground (or command station also in space).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the suggestions for a config to add the module to command parts.

Maybe it is not of a thing of great importance but it is a function that does affect flying to some extent.

Hattivat provided some pretty good guidance, better vehicle design, better ascent profile. Both would make a world of difference. There is a reason why most vehicles are 3 stages, either 3 core, or 2 with boosters. Using SRBs will give you a push to get out of the thick part of the atmosphere, while using a smaller main engine that won\u0027t push your TWR sky high. Seriously, make some that mimic real vehicles first, see how it\u0027s done, then you can tweak as necessary, or don\u0027t tweak and just use them as is. Building your own rockets is fun, but with as many vehicles as there are out there, I find using real ones meet most, if not all goals. The fun for me is doing things IN space, not getting those things TO space. To each their own.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E@Hattivat:\u003C/strong\u003E Thanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E@kitspace:\u003C/strong\u003E Are you talking IRL or in game? IRL, verniers are used in different ways on different engines. While some single engine stages have gimbaled exhaust giving roll control or RCS for roll control, others have another small engine to provide roll. Like the LR-101 found on the Atlas series. Some stages have a single main engine and 2-4 vernier engines providing all 3 axis of control. The point is generally all vehicles have 3 axis of control in some way, shape, or form.
