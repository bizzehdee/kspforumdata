If it makes sense for nuclear engines, it would seem to make sense for ion engines too, at least to me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would also argue that \u0022cl_mini_asas\u0022 and \u0022cl_mini_sas\u0022 belong under \u0022precisionEngineering\u0022, but that\u0027s debatable and a rather minor quibble in any case.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI put them there to be above the stock ion engines. If I was to drop them anywhere, it would be with those, but I wanted them to be in a separate node because it felt weird to me to have both there. And I know that the standards are usually small 1.25m and large 2.5m, but that node is placed directly above the stock ion engines and the 1.25m ion engine is noticeably larger than the stock one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the SAS parts, I\u0027ll look again to see where I dropped them and if it would make sense where you proposed them, I don\u0027t know the tree by heart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Alright, where I placed them still makes sense to me. The small ASAS is along with the second probe core you get and next to the first solar panels. I would\u0027ve dropped it with the first probe core but it made little sence since the normal SAS part is researched there and it makes more sense as a progression to have the smaller one after. For the small SAS part, it\u0027s higher up because I made it more powerful than the ASAS, though more tech needed and makes more sense to have it higher up, where more probe parts come along.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Railgunner2160\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Railgunner2160\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EJust a warning to those using the new version, Everytime I\u0027ve stuck a KSPX part on my rocket the game freaks out.
