And a silver-gray-white texture.It\u0027s the stock ROUND-8 retextured to look like a xenon tank. There. I said it.\n\nSupport the ROUND-8!\n\nOh, and if it is against the rules (They say \u0022Outside of GameData\u0022, but I want to be sure), let me know, or take action, mods. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) We don\u0027t want this protest to violate the Community rules.\n\nThe reason this mod is public domain is to make a point that I, and many others, will go to any measure (within reason) to keep the ROUND-8 tank in the game, including \u0022developing\u0022 the parts ourselves. If the need arises, I\u0027m sure someone here, including me, can make a great new part to take the place of the \u0022new\u0022 ROUND-8.\n\nImgur Album courtesy of Columbia!\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
