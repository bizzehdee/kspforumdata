Something I did notice in my own limited-modding-knowledge digging, I downloaded both 5.2.1 and 5.2 and compared the .cfg files included in both. I noticed in 5.2 there is a whole lot more in your RedAV8R folder. Did things get moved around, or did I lose some files in extraction/download? Specifically, the realengines cfg\u0027s from 5.2 are absent in my 5.2.1 folder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust tried it with the latest RealFuels 6.3, still have the same specific bug with the RL10B-2 from Aerojet Kerbodyne and also the RD-0146 from SovietEngines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEditEdit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, none of the other engines have any sort of updated stats.
