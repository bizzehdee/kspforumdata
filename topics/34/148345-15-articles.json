Whether that\u0027s intentional or not, it makes for some interesting pad aborts if you have e.g. a stack\u00A0of two capsules and the top one is the root part: Kerbals get ejected into the ground. The fix is obviously quite easy: Just make the root part the bottom capsule, or even the heatshield underneath it if you want the ejection to lob the Kerbals up a bit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"linuxgurugamer","CreatedById":129964,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-26T19:22:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNew release, 0.2.0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nUpdated for KSP 1.8\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAdded InstallChecker\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDeleted old unused code files\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kev1n8088","CreatedById":189011,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-15T12:51:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWould be nice though if you just used the stock EVA chutes.
