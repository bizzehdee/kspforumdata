Originally I thought it was Texture Replacer because removing it fixed the problem, but like any good technician I cannot sleep until I know \u003Cem\u003Ewhy\u003C/em\u003E something causes a problem. After all, it never caused any before. So, three or four hours of playing around with various configurations I can say Texture Replacer reacts badly \u003Cstrong\u003Eonly\u003C/strong\u003E with B9 Aerospace installed. For whatever reason, having the two installed alongside the overhaul yields this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-4.steampowered.com/ugc/35227939650280700/D75B80F99F843C8CA5C414E43FE10921BD8A0CD7/\u0022 alt=\u0022D75B80F99F843C8CA5C414E43FE10921BD8A0CD7\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemove either one of them, and the clouds appear and everything looks fine. And trust me, I\u0027ve tried EVERYTHING I can think of to isolate this. All I can determine is for some reason ANY of B9 parts being installed causes this, but beyond that I am \u003Cstrong\u003Estumped\u003C/strong\u003E. I tried removing B9\u0027s dependencies which causes the clouds to appear again, but the atmosphere is still a bit darker and you get weird artifacts when you look to the west. The only solution I have found is to simply delete B9 Aerospace. But now I\u0027m back to where I was with Texture Replacer, why does removing it fix the issue if it works fine minus something else. I\u0027m so frustrated right now. I think I\u0027ve at least cleared mods like FAR, AJE and DRE as the culprits. Planetshine and Distant Objects don\u0027t seem to cause it either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point I\u0027m thinking maybe it\u0027s a memory problem? Since no mod by itself seems to fix it, and the only things that seem to alleviate it are mods that have textures. I dunno, I\u0027ll play with it some more and see if I cannot isolate it but it\u0027s highly aggravating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Well, I repeated a test that I thought I\u0027d already done and wouldn\u0027t you know, it ALSO fixed the problem. What was the test? Removing KWRocketry. So here\u0027s what I can gather from my various frustrating tests, if I remove Texture Replacer, B9 Aerospace or KW Rocketry, the overhaul works fine. Considering they are all my largest memory hogs, this leads me to believe that WHATEVER THE ISSUE IS, it has to do with texture memory. I\u0027m going to reduce the size of the kerbin1.png and see if that ALSO clears it up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT2: I\u0027ll let you guess what the results were.
