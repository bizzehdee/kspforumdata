Decided to play a few other games in my free time for a bit, so as I don\u0027t totally burn out on KSP. Lately, I seem to test configs more than actually play! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E But I\u0027ll keep an eye on these threads and I\u0027ll be back into it, no worries. KSP is too good of a game for me to be gone for too long!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
