I went to career mode, verified all the medals, mission time, etc. Put a ship on the pad, used the editor to throw it into orbit. then recovered it conventionally. Exit game, the reenter game and reload (from persistent.sfs). All medals are missing and all mission time/data missing from hall of fame display for that kerbal. its also missing from ALL of the kerbals \u0022after\u0022 that one in the data file in terms of what order they are read in, prior to that kerbal\u0027s mission. Basically take Jebediah (or Jeb \u0026amp; Val, tested that too), contrive to give a completion without a beginning, and everyone \u0022after\u0022 him (or him \u0026amp; her) loses their missions, medals, etc. Yet the data is in the file (verified).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat indicatest the data read-in is the issue, and that it depends on replaying the log for everyone successfully in order to get any kerbal\u0027s medals and history.

It may be the design that\u0027s causing problems, mainly in the way the mod reads in and recalculates things every time. It seems that the initial structure/design has been outgown. That could be causing code that is hard to write, hard to maintain and hard to fix. It is likely that the the initial implementation was written without any indication that it would be needing to provide all the things it provides now. (doing more and more is one of the hazards of success perhaps?) So its no longer a fitting design in terms of support for all the added functionality. In all likelihood, it was not \u003Cem\u003Edeliberately\u003C/em\u003E designed initially, it was just a quick solution around which the rest of this has grown du to the usefulness of this mod.

Once a kerbal hits a medal completion state, record that to the personal data (something like kerbalstats or other per-kerbal based addon uses) and simply save the medals awarded, increment missions completed, and increment times tracked. No need to add date/time or anything related to events. This by-kerbal section would be the ONLY data read to determine what shows in the hall of fame.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EChange how the mod tracks events. Don\u0027t write the events to the log until they are completed, and perhaps use a state machine (or a concept similar) per kerbal to track that. Save that state machine\u0027s state and use it to reload current status on startup, instead of reloading the log file and rereading all those events every time. Not only will this save time, it will pick up where it left off even if the event log is bad. But it will still need to validate the state machine as part of the initialization - and if its not valid, then simply write the completed things (single event or begin\u002Bend events but no partials) to the file, and reset the state machine - this way the only thing upon reading the logbook will be completed events, which can be used for setting the awards - this prevents ends without begins, which is the problem previously identified. I do assume there is some way of tagging a mission as \u0022ongoing\u0022 giving it a temporary \u0022on hold\u0022 terminal sate rather than an end, in the event of a save for missions ongoing; this would be counted as a begin/end pair for the purposes of logging, with the hold removed on the next load. If a new begin is noted (i.e. game crashed, got reloaded, and mission was ongoing but ended somehow) without the ending being recorded simply supply the end for it in the log as you start the new one (with a time equal to the last known event prior to the new start), as a way to recover proper state for this kerbal. This way mission times, etc can be updated without affecting other kerbals. Checking for an incomplete mission would be done every time a mission start is detected\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hate bringing up a problem and not giving at least a bit of a solution, so what follows is my first pass at this.

This has the advantage that the mod leaves the current reading in of logs, calculation etc in place to preserve current functionality, but puts into place a per-kerbal solution for the awards display to grow on, and no longer binds the awards display to their generation. This could help detect when your \u0022read the log\u0022 dynamic generation has erred and not properly gotten all the awards dynamically generated from events due to missing data. As a bonus, this method of storage would allow users to manually award medals - which is a nice addition for users that newly install the mod to a game in progress. It also serves as a backstop in the event of a failure like the one that originally brought on this post and other\u0027s previously. In that case we (the users) can edit the save and add the award data into the character\u0027s award section. Even better, someone could write a plugin (or you could add such an interface) that does this with a GUI in-game. Only after that is stable, then move to take on the hard stuff: the award generation mechanisms. The benefit of this is that the generation mechanism can be done independently of the actual awards for display, which opens up a lot of room for functionality and redesign. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne last, admittedly radical, suggestion: collaborate with kerbalstats or shipmanifest (or both), since all address the same issue, tacking individual kerbal experience. Although each mod handles different aspects of individual kerbals experience, there is likely overlap and synergy (I hate that term but it is apropos here). Consider integration with or leveraging each other\u0027s work; shared format/data/methods/code would likely benefit all of the mods. It might even save time/effort for the authors in the long run due to reduction of conflicts as well as abstraction of common issues to a common module. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(ninja edit - reworded things to make my meaning clearer, without citing personal background)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-09T14:52:13Z\u0022 title=\u002207/09/2015 02:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Murdabenne\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eput walls of text into spoiler tags\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nereid","CreatedById":68815,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T11:34:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Corax\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Corax\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFor me, it\u0027s an immersion breaking hickup. \u003Cp\u003EAdd an option to disable specific ribbons - yes, please.
