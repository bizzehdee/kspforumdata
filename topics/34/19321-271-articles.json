Are there good resources to help get a sense of what to look at and how to build to minimize issues? I got over my penchant for building rockets with giant bulbs on top rather quickly. Currently however I\u0027m struggling with re-entry. Pods are coming in just fine but when I try to get anything more complex to the surface I\u0027m running into a lot of stability issues. For instance, trying to land a pod with a science jr attached to it. It always flips over and goes pod first, tossing a chute from the top of the pod or even sides of the science jr rips my craft apart. How can I make my re-entry more stable with FAR?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhatever you build is going to want to rotate to put CoL behind CoM. Mass at the front, drag at the back; think about feathers and arrows. Not a problem on the way up, just put some fins on the tail...but then, come reentry, you want it to fly backwards...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are a few ways around it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Reenter with a bare capsule. That\u0027s what they\u0027re for. There is no need to return goo pods or Science Jr\u0027s to the surface; go EVA, collect their data, and store it all in the capsule.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Spend ages fiddling around to get a design that is aerodynamically stable both ways, and strut it enough so that it can cope with the pressure and g-forces. Usually not worth the bother.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Come back down the same way you came up, spaceplane style. Streamline your nose, and have enough control authority and lift on the reentry vehicle that you have full control of your altitude. Use the lift to control your descent as you slow, and don\u0027t drop deploy parachutes until you\u0027ve slowed enough to survive the deployment shock (i.e. \u0026lt; 300 m/s). Use struts etc to reinforce the structure of the parachute mounting points, and consider deploying chutes in stages to ease the impact and provide failure redundancy.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-21T00:21:40Z\u0022 title=\u002211/21/2014 12:21  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 21, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Wanderfound\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-21T00:04:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESmall feature request:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe max deflection on spoilers and flaps can be negative, which is good: it allows you to set opposed spoilers as airbrakes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1378.photobucket.com/albums/ah120/craigmotbey/Kerbal/Kerbodyne%2025/Kerbodyne%20Delta%20Glider/screenshot192_zpse3774f99.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot192_zpse3774f99.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the maximum negative is only -30, while max positive is 50 or so.

In the graph it shows that as you pitch up, the CoM moves further forward relative to the CoL, which will decrease pitch stability even more, like a positive feedback loop.

I would liek to try me some front engines too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo answer your (non-existing) question, when you reach higher altitudes, air gets thinner and thinner, having less air density requires a greater air speed to maintain same lift. Its a natural trade-off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever most engines tend to lose power going higher, jets will flame-out due to less oxygen. But this is specially more important on propeller engines, propellers works as airfoils, little wings rotating, as such their power depends on air density(less density less lift). Though, I\u0027m sure prob engines don\u0027t work as such on KSP, they are simulated by loosing power with height.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Jovus\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Jovus\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m having some problems designing a light cargo lifter spaceplane.
