Build Points aren\u0027t set per part directly. They\u0027re dependent on whether the part is in the inventory, how many times it\u0027s been used in a build, and an interaction of several settings. What is constant, at least in default KCT, is that the BP is based on the \u003Cem\u003Ecost\u003C/em\u003E of the part. So PP are broken up by cost. 1 funds of a procedural part is 100 \u0022parts\u0022 in the inventory. So when you recover something worth 1000 funds, you get 100,000 \u0022parts\u0022 for that specific procedural part. When you build something that costs 500 funds, 50,000 parts are taken out to build it. If you build something worth 1500 funds then the whole 100,000 parts are taken out (and are built quickly) but 50,000 isn\u0027t covered by the inventory and you pay full build times for them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause procedural parts are extremely flexible (and, from a roleplay standpoint they require retooling and rebuilding each time), they\u0027re only 1/3 as effective as normal parts (they only get 1/3 of the InventoryEffect, or they get 1/10 and after the square root it becomes 1/3 less time. I don\u0027t recall off hand). But that\u0027s still a pretty huge reduction in time. And they get the BuildEffect applied normally to them (which is nice because they\u0027ll be used in almost every build).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe formula that controls how Procedural Part BP values are calculated is actually one of the ones exposed for editing. You can\u0027t change how Procedural Parts are added/removed from the inventory, but you can change how their BPs are calculated if you want to make them stronger/weaker compared to normal parts, and if you want them to be mass based or cost based (but the inventory is cost based always).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Spock","CreatedById":116542,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T15:12:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOnce again, I\u0027m writing just to add a note of praise, not to flag a bug.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of many interesting parts of this mod is how it affects transfer windows.
