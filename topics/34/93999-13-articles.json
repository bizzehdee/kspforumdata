Okay this is going off topic of the planets plugin, but for the love of god, installing Linux is not the answer to everything for this game. I am someone that works professionally with Linux and UNIX for many years, I even went to college and learned UNIX. I tried Linux with KSP and my experience was downright awful. Ubuntu is not the answer to everything for KSP. I installed the Linux version of KSP and if anything, I had more problems with it than the windows including but not limiting to:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- problems installing graphical drivers to run games on linux, and even having to install hacks to force my game to use anti aliasing\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- mods crashing\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- other random graphical issues\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- a problem where I basically couldn\u0027t pan the camera correctly\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- not being able to right click on parts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI finally quit KSP on Linux when my game completely vanished and deleted itself from Linux on Steam for no apparent reason. I lost all my save/progress on that, luckily I had it backed up on Windows. Unless you know Linux really well and/or are willing to spend several days learning it yourself (Linux is MUCH different than Windows and if you don\u0027t like terminal you\u0027re gonna have a bad time) and potentially risking all of the above problems I have had, installing Linux just for KSP is not really worth it. I recommend this instead if you are having memory issues:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Installed \u003Cstrong\u003Etexture manager\u003C/strong\u003E the mod. There are different ways to set it up and it can drastically reduce RAM usage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Use \u003Cstrong\u003Eless mods\u003C/strong\u003E. Don\u0027t complain cause you can\u0027t use hundreds of mods. I\u0027m sure there are ones you don\u0027t utilize that often. Especially turn off the ones that improve the visuals. I only use the skybox one, clouds and atmospheres kill KSP and the game looks pretty nice stock already IMO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Try running the game in \u003Cstrong\u003EOpenGL\u003C/strong\u003E. There are launch parameters to start the game in Open GL instead, which is said to save up to a couple gigs of RAM for some people.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sedativechunk","CreatedById":112761,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-14T10:43:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI just made it to Ovak, it\u0027s extremely low G environment actually made it a unique challenge to get into orbit, I almost smashed into the moon and then almost blew out of it\u0027s sphere of influence!
