If you used a controller and set up binds on stock KSP settings and then install this mod and use the mods interface to program the bind for the same button and same action you will get potentially undesired effects. For example, I recognized this because I set the back button on the controller to Toggle SAS originally in the stock settings and then in the mods interface. This would result in it basically ignoring my input because it may have carried out the function through both of the binds for the action. This isn\u0027t a big deal because the mod\u0027s OP does state it doesn\u0027t override or interfere with the existing setup. My solution was to clear controller button and axes in the stock settings menu and kept the binds exclusively in the mod\u0027s interface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIssue #2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis one is slightly more of a pain simply because I couldn\u0027t come up with an idea for the cause of it. The cut-throttle bind option sets my throttle at 50%. I have it assigned to a B button press on the controller through the mods interface. I then took off the bind in the mod and went back to the stock KSP settings and set up the throttle cut-off to the controller B button. This worked properly and reduced the throttle immediately to 0% on button press. (edit: No it actually didn\u0027t but it never happened before I had the mod but having throttle cut off bound exclusively in the stock settings does not work reliably either. Before launch throttle cut-off was working but then later in flight was mostly unresponsive or would rarely set throttle to 50%.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry if any of this was addressed already, I quickly looked through a few of the threads pages and didn\u0027t see anything about it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOtherwise Thanks to the creator.

I found that the button actually resets my throttle to whatever the keyboard set the throttle to last. Because stock KSP now sets the throttle to 50% at take-off, pressing the \u0022cut throttle\u0022 button on my controller sets it to that, 50%. I found an easy fix was simply to lower my throttle to zero using the keyboard before I took off. I simply press the \u0022x\u0022 key on my keyboard and then the controller \u0022cut throttle\u0022 button performs as expected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) This one is a little more serious. Whenever the GUI is open, my memory usage continues to increase until the game crashes. I noticed this because I flew with the presets GUI open for a while so I would not forget the controls I had mapped. The game crashed a couple of times due to over memory, and I\u0027m fairly certain I\u0027ve traced it down to the GUI being open. I re-tested it on a vanilla KSP\u002BAFBW and got the same problem.

Closing the GUI immediately stops the memory increase, but it does not return it to pre-GUI memory (i.e. each time I open the GUI KSP utilizes slightly more memory).
