I have no doubt that this has increased its power consumption as well as its fuel consumption. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem with the RTG can be helped by increasing the rate that it produces power at. As you said though, balance. How much does it need to be bumped up by? I think I gave mine a value of 48 and that DOES feel overpowered to me. But there\u0027s no real baseline to lock onto to calibrate thing. Though some of the numbers for the ion drive seem familiar, as though someone looked at the specs for the NEXT drive and said, \u0022ok that\u0027s how much electricity the PB-ION should use. Except that it consumes that every time the drive consumes fuel instead of... hmmm can\u0027t think right now, my cat Melificent is crying at me right when I\u0027m trying to wrap my head around numbers.
