Check it. Download the pack and look inside: it\u0027s only textures, configs and some sounds. Only the navball changer is included, as public domain, and RSS was added in the last update thanks to NathanKell, but is only the plugin, not the RSS mod which uses it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo absolutely nothing here is \u0022needed\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that is why this is a pack, a compilation, because is created to be something more, especially as an overall of configs and visuals/sounds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally: Unrealistic is a 25% of pure white sky in the horizon. You can change the atmo color values in the RSS plugin, but just that: only the pure color. So you can\u0027t change the contrast or the saturation, wich is your real problem. Not the color.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut anyways, only the color was changed here to be more warm and realistic. The saturation is the same in the stock game, and in fact is little lower here: because in order to eliminate the white horizon effect I can only (for the moment) use the RSS plugin to change the start/end visual parameters of the stock game atmo. That makes, visually, the atmosphere a little bigger... but you can\u0027t see the effect, as this begins \u0022under earth\u0022 and ends at the same point as before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo you see the same stock atmo, but a little less saturated, since the original gradient starts a little earlier, and it becomes transparent at the end, as the original does.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you understand me?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe my english is just a bunch of \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00AA!\u0022\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B7\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B7$%... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;.;\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BudgetHedgehog\uFEFF","CreatedById":104112,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-06T13:17:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBut the point is they\u0027re not dependencies.

Yes, they won\u0027t have the full experience, it won\u0027t be as you intended, but it\u0027s entirely possible for people to pick and choose which bits they want from this mod without any bad things happening (apart from you getting a little saddened that they don\u0027t want to use your excellent artwork). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re right, absolutely nothing here is \u0027needed\u0027 and commonly used, a dependency means something simply will not work without it.

No-one\u0027s entitled or irresponsible, they\u0027re just confused at the term \u0027dependency\u0027 because, as I said, they\u0027re not what people usually refer to as dependencies. Yes, you need them in order for KSPRC to function as intended, true, but it\u0027s also completely possible to not use some of KSPRCs settings and textures (for whatever reason. Personal preference, memory limit etc). None of us are suggesting that Proot provide bespoke installation instructions for every person, because if we have all the mods required for KSPRC, chances are we know how to pick and choose the bits we want. Also, chances are that we realise this will mean an incomplete KSPRC and we should be fine that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProot has undeniably done a fantastic job, but I and several others, think a clearer description about the \u0027dependencies\u0027 required for KSPRC would be appreciated. Yes, they\u0027re needed for \u003Cstrong\u003Eeverything\u003C/strong\u003E in KSPRC, but some players might not want or need \u003Cstrong\u003Eeverything\u003C/strong\u003E (for whatever reason) so can safely leave them out. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think Proot is taking these questions about the dependencies the wrong way - people are just confused because this is an odd situation. It\u0027s just settings/textures/artwork for other mods - if you don\u0027t have the other mods, you don\u0027t get the full pack, simple as. But some people are fine with that. No-one suggesting that he ignores a part or provides individual installation instructions, they just want clarification on if it\u0027s ok to not use some parts of KSPRC. Yes, it makes Proot sad, but they are more than able to do so with no ill effects to other stuff included in KSPRC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: FWIW, I think the atmosphere looks absolutely fine and I love it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-06T13:44:27Z\u0022 title=\u002205/06/2014 01:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 6, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by ObsessedWithKSP\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
