This is roughly the space shuttle\u0027s ascent trajectory, and it seems to work pretty well for pretty much all my designs. From there, watch your apoapsis - ideal is 100 km, 150 is acceptable, any lower than 100 km is going to be a bit dangerous. Also keep an eye on your vertical speed - make sure at first stage cutoff that you\u0027ve got a good 500 - 800 m/s, if you\u0027ve got a really low (0.6, 0.5) T/W on your second stage - then simply hold about 30 or 15* pitch and wait until your T/W climbs to about \u0026gt;1.1 or \u0026gt;1.2 to pitch higher than that to keep from plummeting. From there, simply adjust your pitch to try to keep vertical velocity nulled out, and cut off when you\u0027re at orbital velocity. (7,850 m/s for 100 km).
