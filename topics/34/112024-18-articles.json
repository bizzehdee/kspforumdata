Without all the lander\u0027s and habitats, rovers, etc. I tried separating it all myself but the parts folders are not labeled well. The reason I\u0027m asking is because this mod uses a lot parts from other mods that I already have installed for instance KW Rocketry, so having so many duplicate parts slows and crash\u0027s my game.\n\u003E \n\u003E Thanks!\n\nIn the past we released an Orion \u002B EMLV version, however those parts represent such a large footprint of the pack that you would loose more capability than you would memory use. Adding SLS to that light version would make it even less value. The parts licensed from contributing packs are all modified to fit and work with each other and have unique textures, sizes and configs.\n\nThat said, we recognize that this is a high memory use pack, and we can look into separating Orion and SLS from the pack and see what size we get by the time the next update is ready.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Wasn\u0027t there a delta rocket in this at one time?\n\nKartoffelkuchen released a Delta II which we were contributed some texture work and you can find it here [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/78741-1-0-3-Launchers-Pack-V-5-3-Career-Mode-support](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/78741-1-0-3-Launchers-Pack-V-5-3-Career-Mode-support) if that was on your mind"},{"CreatedByName":"Amilianus","CreatedById":33996,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-22T03:40:10Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E In the past we released an Orion \u002B EMLV version, however those parts represent such a large footprint of the pack that you would loose more capability than you would memory use.
