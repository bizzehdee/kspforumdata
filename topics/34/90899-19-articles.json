Even though it works by translation though it moves in the direction you are pointing and sometimes when activating your navball shakes or turns which then causes you to go in a weird direction. My advice would be to just give it enough throttle to activate and start moving you then wait for it to stabilize. Once it stabilizes it usually doesn\u0027t move and you can smooth throttle it to max with out problems, usually.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NikoKun","CreatedById":136647,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-28T21:02:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DaniDE\u0022 data-cite=\u0022DaniDE\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAre you sure you are talking about the warp drive?

Some learning on the drive below. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etl;dr \u0022Alcubierre-Like\u0022 is actually right in both cases because we don\u0027t know and there are good arguments for each.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first version is effectively what we already have. The drive decouples anything inside the warp bubble from space-time and you retain your current travel direction and raw velocity, your linear momentum is conserved. Upon turning off the drive you resume at your current velocity wherever you happen to be in a gravity well. This grants you a ton of free energy in the form of potential energy. FTL is possible because you are not actually a part of the universe while warping so the speed limit law doesn\u0027t apply to you. In my opinion this one has a lot of problems and most of the criticisms to the drive being physically impossible come from this one (being able to arrive before you left, not being able to shut off the drive because you can\u0027t interact with space time to tell it to stop warping, and other such problems that come with trying to get around relativity)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second version (what Serino and I are working on), is based on the idea that the Alcubierre drive does not decouple you from space-time. Instead you are surfing on a wave of space. You do not move, space moves you. This is the original way I saw an Alcubierre drive described and its the reason we see two rings on a lot of warp ship concepts, the one in front contracts space the one behind expands it. Or in the case of our single part the ring torques space in a similar pattern. In that case to have no g-forces while moving through space on your space wave as you gain potential energy by \u0022climbing\u0022 a gravity well your raw velocity would have to drop so your orbital energy and magnitude of angular momentum is conserved while your direction of travel is also preserved so you do not pull g\u0027s upon de-activation of the drive. If you think about it the only times you pull g\u0027s while doing orbital maneuvers is when you change your orbital energy. This means when warping from Kerbin to Jool, you need to gain energy to match orbits rather than lose it. So in this version you do not get any free energy. However the differences in energies involved are not as huge with the first version so I find it\u0027s easier to use and more intuitive. FTL is possible in this case because you are not moving, and there is no known limit to how fast space can move itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis one is less problematic because you never leave space, you are only cheating as far as the speed limit goes. But, you\u0027re not because you\u0027re not moving any differently than you were before you activated the drive. Relativity still applies based on your reference frame when you turned on the drive and current gravitational effects. However, this is the one where there\u0027s a legitimate concern that you would build up a gamma ray shockwave on the front of your ship that would be released upon shutting off the drive, however, that too is also disputed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Side note: the way KSP\u0027s engine works while warping your g-meter bounces. This is krakensbane at work. Usually the game isn\u0027t registering any g-forces if you press F3).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat all said, KSPI\u0027s Alcubierre drive is the velocity drive. If you all would like this one to be the orbital momentum only version it certainly simplifies things for me as my test DLL is already built that way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@cantab: It\u0027s not linear momentum being conserved, it\u0027s orbital momentum (angular momentum). Your kinetic energy decreases as your potential energy increases so your linear momentum at any moment is not going to be the same, but this is true when orbiting as well. You have your maximum linear momentum at periapsis, and the least at apoapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Serino","CreatedById":127188,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-09T18:11:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ein layman\u0027s terms one possible version, the kind that KSPI and Rover have, contracts space, imagine 1km of real distance turns into 1 meter of distance for you, so that you effectivly travel faster without actually having to while the other version, what helaeon and I are trying to do, is like if the ground under your car ripped free of the earth zoomed off to another place and then set itself back down.
