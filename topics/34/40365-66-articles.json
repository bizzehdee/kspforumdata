I get TWRs, how to work them out, etc. My main thing is concerned with the amount of fuel. For instance, a 1.01 TWR will have you accelerating somewhat slowly (going through the calculations, a 11,111kN thrust at 1.01 TWR gives 111.11kN usable force. Applying f=ma gives an accelleration that\u0027s got far too many 0\u0027s before it for my liking), and basically hovering over the launch pad until you\u0027ve burnt enough fuel to get a useable TWR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was really just asking for a general rule of thumb that people used (such as mine is that my standard launch vehicle can take 30t to a 100k with no issues, above that, and fuel issues come into play).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NeoAcario","CreatedById":24645,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-11T16:07:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bibblejw\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Bibblejw\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMight have a look at KAS.

I get TWRs, how to work them out, etc. My main thing is concerned with the amount of fuel. For instance, a 1.01 TWR will have you accelerating somewhat slowly (going through the calculations, a 11,111kN thrust at 1.01 TWR gives 111.11kN usable force. Applying f=ma gives an accelleration that\u0027s got far too many 0\u0027s before it for my liking), and basically hovering over the launch pad until you\u0027ve burnt enough fuel to get a useable TWR.\u003Cp\u003EI was really just asking for a general rule of thumb that people used (such as mine is that my standard launch vehicle can take 30t to a 100k with no issues, above that, and fuel issues come into play).\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen it comes to the thermal rocket engine, you don\u0027t really need a launch stage, they can lift themselves, unless your using nuclear reactors. I have a 2.5m AM ship that can land on most planets that weighs over 300T on the launch pad. I have to limit its thrust since it uses LFO, it has a TWR of like 2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd forsaken1111 you are so spot on with that lol:)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NeoAcario","CreatedById":24645,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-11T17:15:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022forsaken1111\u0022 data-cite=\u0022forsaken1111\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHehe... \u003Cp\u003Enew people to this mod: OMG SO COMPLICATED AND NOTHING WORKS, ITS ALL SO WEAK\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPeople who understand the mod: Holy crap this may be overpowered... can we make it more complex?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell I\u0027m still testing this mod.. so this is my test ship.
