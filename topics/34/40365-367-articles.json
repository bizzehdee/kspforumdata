I use planetary gravitation to change the velocity. If you need to burn off V simply fall away from the planet and keep warping back next to as close as you can. It helps if you do planetary transfers when both of the planets are lined up in relation to Kerbol (eg. Kerbin at 12 oclock, Jool at 12) This means that their relative velocity will be at their closest, requiring the fewest deltaV jumps. Otherwise you may end of with an orbital velocity of 10-20 kM/s.

For the thermal generators, the lower your radiator temperature, the more efficient the generator will be (heat engine efficiency gets better as the high temperature gets higher and the low temperature gets lower- the radiators are the low temperature, and the reactor temperature is the high temperature). Solar panels aren\u0027t thermal generators, though; they don\u0027t care how hot your radiators are.

They just don\u0027t generate enough heat to really notice, because their power levels are so low compared to the thermal reactors.
