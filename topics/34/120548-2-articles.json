Problem is though: if you build a stack the size of the proton from 2.5 and 1.25m stock parts you will get roughtly the same amount of fuel, oxidizer and mass, as the parts use the same rules for density and volume. So far, so good. But then, you need the engines to be as powerfull as they are to lift that thing. Soo.. ISP would be a place to attack the problem and cut her down a bit in terms of op-ness in the stock environment. But then, I am already lower on thrust, isp, burntime and dv than tantaresLV proton.

Normally, you need no extra separation motors, as the fairings have invisible ones already built in (invisible thrusters, invisible flame, no damage fx) to give the fairings a torgue while the decoupler force pushes them off. The real ones do this by spring loaded pushers, therefore i have these little helper engiens hidden.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: they don\u0027t miss a thing and decouple good on the ground.
