The thing is engine throttle =/= fuel burn rate, you need to factor in the thrust curves as well (AFAIK. fuel burn rate in KSP as of the current version is proportional to the actual thrust that they are providing.). Also, going faster with the same fuel burn rate is more efficient. In general I have found that going mach 0.7-0.8 for subsonic (altitude does not seem to be important), or as fast and high as possible for supersonic.
