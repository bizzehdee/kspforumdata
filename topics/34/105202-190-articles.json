Maybe scale it against the max distance from Kerbin that the Kerbal went?   Like if you\u0027re within 10 percent of the max distance travelled, then it scales back somehow?\n\u003E \n\nIf this is a problem for you, set the home altitude to 250km(or higher if you do a lot of slow braking burns) or include a probe core.\n\nEven the integrated antenna of a probe core should keep you flying at any altitude where you might consider a kerbal \u0027close to home.\u0027  It is not like the small ones weigh much or take much EC. \n\n(just the other day I landed a couple of delivery drones on Minmus where they would be disassembled for additional material kits for my new Minmus base.  They were down to one bar, but still had full probe control out at Minmus orbit with no supplemental antennas)"},{"CreatedByName":"Kurtvw","CreatedById":83214,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-18T22:12:07Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 12 hours ago, RoverDude said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E No, it\u0027s not what he was reporting.
