The SIP format automatically suffixes the SI scale character. As for it exceeding the formatting code (like the -419u case), it\u0027s behaving as it was designed - it attempts to fit the 3.1 formatting string - in this case, since the value is in the range 0 \u0026lt; x \u0026lt; 1, it drops the format, so it\u0027s effectively SIP3. However, it must include the sign character and the SI character, so it requires 5 characters to render that number. At the absolute minimum, if you really want the .1 to show, you need 7 characters (3 for the digits to the left of the decimal, one for each of the decimal and the fractional digit, one for the sign, and one for the SI prefix).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, if Mihara\u0027s not around to take requests and do updates, I could probably work up a change that would behave like you want.
