It goes up so quick that you reach maxQ and the vessel starts to dismantle its self, or becomes completely uncontrollable well before reaching it. If you do manage to launch and maintain terminal velocity with an intact vessel, it will be experiencing atmospheric shock waves and re-entry heating effects practically all the way up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a side note, I am planning on creating readouts for practically all the FAR data which it provides through its API. NEAR on the other hand does not have an API to hook into, so it\u0027s not possible to retrieve pre-calculated data. The time and effort required to create readouts for use with NEAR is just not worth it, and the time could be better spent on other things. When I start working on the FAR stuff, I may ask Ferram if he can create an API for NEAR, but don\u0027t hold your breath. NEAR after all is a cut down version of FAR. So I wouldn\u0027t blame him for recommending people use FAR if they require the extra data.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cybutek","CreatedById":32393,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-23T00:44:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF0000;\u0022\u003EVersion 1.0.6 is now available!\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Added: Time and Angle to equatorial ascending/descending nodes in the orbital display.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Added: Time and Angle to relative ascending/descending nodes in the rendezvous display.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Added: Overlay tooltip information delay adjustment slider to the Build Engineer settings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Added: Ability to rename the stock displays in the Flight Engineer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Changed: Build Engineer is now hidden when not in parts view.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Changed: Custom display panels will only show in the control bar if an abbreviation is set.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Changed: Licensing and readme structures are now more verbose to satisfy the new add-on rules.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Fixed: Updated MiniAVC to v1.0.2.1 (fixes remote check bug as well as other minor bugs).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF0000;\u0022\u003EVersion 0.6.2.10 is now available!\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Added: More verbose licensing to stay within the updated add-on rules.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Changed: Separated out the changes from the readme file allowing for future KSP-AVC changelog support.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Padishar\u0027s Fixes:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Various bugs in the simulation logic.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TrooperCooper","CreatedById":110599,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-23T01:03:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWoot!

Then just terminate all the detached KER parts (debris, usually on 30km/s kerbol escape trajectory \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E) and you can save, delete old mod and paste new one.
