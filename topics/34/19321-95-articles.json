FAR\u0027s screwing up on the decoupler calculation, since it\u0027s a very large change in diameter from top to bottom on that part. The best solution would be to manually define a FARBasicDragModel to handle it; look in the FAR readme for what to put in the config file. Give it very low drag, but a non-zero area so that things don\u0027t break. Since the strap decoupler is a very strange case, I don\u0027t think it deserves me trying to code in some type of special exception.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, some of the models didn\u0027t resize with that config, or resized too much. The shroud around the Mercury retropack was too big and one of the side tanks on the Atlas was much taller than the other.

Then, if the CoL is offset with both attached, you need to \u0022mirror\u0022 the surface attach on one of them so that the CoL is shifted properly. What it sounds like is that the right wing places the CoL properly, but the left wing places it in the proper place \u003Cem\u003Eif the wing was clipping through the fuselage\u003C/em\u003E. Does that make sense?

The thing is though, you won\u0027t be able to reach terminal velocity without risking a loss of control on your rocket by going ridiculously fast.
