In this case, you\u0027re treating the waste heat component of the code like fuel or oxidizer where specific amount fills up a bar like water filling up a bucket. And since that resource mechanism treats any given set of heat levels like one big bucket of X size, it doesn\u0027t really operate the way heat behaves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you can find a way to break away from the Waste Heat bar and abolish it, I would think that you\u0027d be able to improve it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps working the code towards objects that produce heat, like power production or capsules, send that heat outwards in a fixed amount, where as each \u0027part\u0027 has a value for \u0027sink\u0027 and a value for \u0027radiate\u0027 based on mass and model shape. I\u0027d ask Ferram how he gets FAR to find the dimensions of unknown parts to assign aerodynamics to.

If I can articulate what I\u0027m thinking right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA part, such as a capsule, produces a small amount of heat. The temperature of the capsule is a function of the heat it produces against its sink value. As temperature approaches the max sink value, the part transfers a greater and greater portion of that heat into a \u0027dispersal\u0027 mechanic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeat dispersal can do one of two things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: It can contact-transfer heat into another part of lower temperature value. (Heat ALWAYS goes from high to low.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: It can radiate into space. (Or get convected based on atmospheric pressure)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen heat transfers into another part, it increases that part\u0027s temp until its dispersal too starts to climb, pushing energy out into other components in a cascade that slowly falls off as \u0027distance\u0027 from the heat source increases. Ideally, this configuration leads to the heat dispersing until it reaches equilibrium. The heat transfers across enough parts that the heat sink effect and radiation effect neutralize all heat produced by the vehicle. Most ship configurations can handle natural heat production such as that from crew pods or solar panels. Thus, they need no special radiating mechanisms to disperse heat. It should be noted that elevated heat levels are okay, as long as they haven\u0027t hit the Crticial (fail) level.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, with large thermal sources such as a fission reactor, heat would disperse through the ship much faster, causing temperature across the vessel to slowly climb, heating it up starting with the parts closest to the reactor first. If the heat builds faster than the dispersal mechanic can distribute it across the ship, temperature of a given part will reach a second \u0027critical temp\u0027 flag (fail value), where the part begins displaying the overheat alert... If the part overheats, it explodes/fails/stops working/whatever. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERadiators, which contain the heat pump flag, actively draw heat away from the rest of the craft, usually starting with the largest heat source. Thus, they don\u0027t have to actively rely on the heat dispersal mechanic to protect the ship and don\u0027t require the player to plop them right on top of major heat sources. (Makes sense right? All said and done, you\u0027ll be piping the heat out to the radiators somehow.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe important mechanic here is the function of heat dispersal rate based on temperature. That is, to try again to articulate... The higher a part\u0027s temp, the more heat it pushes out in an attempt to find equilibrium. If the heat source is producing heat above a certain level that the part can\u0027t handle getting rid of, then equilibrium falls ABOVE the maximum thermal tolerance for that part. \u0022Kaboom!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d articulate this better if I could, I think I\u0027ve fumbled around with words enough now that you can see what I\u0027m getting at.

In the case of what I laid out in my previous post, heat production, mass, size (surface area approx.), critical temp, and heat pump flags. Make use of values that already exist in the stock part cfg files. They both have a mass and a max temp already. If you go talk to Ferram, I\u0027m sure he knows how to get part size for a dissipation algorithm.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext, dealing with time acceleration. Biggest mistake I think is assuming that you have to operate full computational cycles on every pass. Really, this isn\u0027t true. You don\u0027t have to fool the computer, you have to fool the user. If doing real-time calcs is impossible to enact at timewarp, DON\u0027T enact full calcs at timewarp. All you need to do is give the player the illusion that this is going on. We\u0027re not machines... we can\u0027t tell the difference unless there\u0027s a big error.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this case, every X number of passes, take a snapshot of the vessel\u0027s rates of change across all parts. Whatever the change rates are at that moment, you sample and hold. When Timewarp is started, suspend the physics passes on the heat engine and simply pull that data from the rate-of-change snapshot and apply it in controlled passes at intervals YOU set. To error correct, take a single physics check every x hundred or x thousand suspended passes and update the snapshot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurther, to prevent spikes, have a normalizing code run at a desired interval or at start-stop points for time warp.

Even if you can\u0027t get accurate time stamps, you should be able to identify the largest time interval possible between stamps before the engine absolutely MUST throw one out there. (Otherwise I would assume KSP would just stop working and display garbage.) It should be simple to have the code go \u0027the maximum possible change in value for this interval is \u0027Q\u0027 no matter what. Anything above Q is flat out wrong.
