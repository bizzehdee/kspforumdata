Turns out they aimed for a much lower periapsis, at around 38 km, so they hit thicker atmosphere quickly to slow down. Once they reach about 2g or so, they steered the capsule up again (by rotating around the offset center of mass, which changes the aerodynamic properties of the lifting body and gives quite some amount of controlling your vertical trajectory; in RO you can do this by enabling \u0022Descent Mode\u0022 for your capsule). The capsule goes up more or less ballistically at this point, reducing g-forces back to zero, however not leaving the atmosphere again.
