Or instead of \u0027schemes\u0027 you could just have 2 buttons and raw colors. One for changing the numbers and the other for the descriptors. All that is needed is a basic set of colors, not every color known to man. I would however avoid primary colors. Instead of Red and Blue, use Burgundy and Navy Blue for example.

It sounds very much like there is an issue with the RF engines, either their stats are being modified once you activate them or their active state is not correct which can confuse the simulation code in KER (make it try to calculate stats for the currently active engines rather than what should be active but the UI still show the figures for the should be active ones).

It\u0027s probably due the 6.4x mod changing the size of the planets and moons. On the surface of Kerbin i\u0027ts coreect for the dV and TWR, but its way off on the Mun, and other planets and moons. For example it shows me that i have 4000dV and 2.3TWR on the Mun but when i get there with the same rocket it only shows me that i have 500dV and 1.1TWR? Any idea to fix this problem?
