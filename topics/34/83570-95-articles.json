Since Porkjet introduced his vastly superior cross section, this was long overdue, and with changes to stock and FAR aerodynamics making all old aircraft unstable anyway, it makes sense to completely ditch specific shapes and types of old B9 MK2 and come up with an entirely new set of parts that will play better with Porkjet pieces, will give you more options to build stuff, and will look far better than old stuff ever did. And as usual, it\u0027s all extremely optimized, with everything depicted in the following screenshots using just two texture atlases. Here is the album of some new MK2 parts (click on thumbnail to open):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/S4uCORMh.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://i.imgur.com/S4uCORMh.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo specific dates yet, though, remaining work is enormous and I have a nasty habit of having a job, so we can\u0027t be sure when stuff will be done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESweet smoky barbecued baby jebus, that looks magnificent\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jrandom","CreatedById":74522,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T05:06:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThey\u0027re... they\u0027re beautiful!!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mighty1","CreatedById":95750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T05:08:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Hellbrand\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Hellbrand\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI know it\u0027s kind of a bit of a .... move to ask.. but can we have a Cargo bay that is similar in profile to the old Mk.iv cargo bay of touhou torpedo\u0027s design perhaps a bit more B9 styled? since transporting rovers via HL/Mk.3 fuselage parts seem to limit the size signifigantly.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei second that motion. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I read this correctly TT has given premission to modify his parts: \u0022\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/29661-TT-s-Mod-Releases-Development-suspended-till-further-notice\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMK4 Fuselage Developers Kit\u003C/a\u003E\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-21T05:18:29Z\u0022 title=\u002205/21/2015 05:18  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mighty1\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bac9","CreatedById":57757,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T05:18:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tutumra\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Tutumra\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ethose look great Bac9.
