I have no log of it as there is nothing to point out where the spam comes from, so a log does nothing for this other than show it starts when I get a stable orbit and goes no stop as long as I am in orbit. It has killed 3 careers trying to find out where this unlabeled spam is coming from. If you are positive it isn\u0027t RealFuel, and as much as I hope it isn\u0027t I hope it is just so I can end the witch hunt, then I apologize for the accusation I just am at wits end with this being spammed and only me apparently suffering from it.
