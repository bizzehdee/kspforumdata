Thanks, a direct comparison will be faster to find than generally reading through - although 0.9 is a fair bit changed over 0.85f, still, less than everything is good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been spending time trying to understand where the VAB lag with large rockets comes from and how to deal with it. I\u0027m not sure if any of you are interested but I\u0027m going to tell you anyway \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnity3d (and thus KSP) have 2 routines that mods inherit to do their work: Update() and OnGUI(). Update() is called once per frame only and it cannot call anything which works on the GUI (ie draws things) - this makes it useful as a controller/timer. OnGUI() is called multiple times per frame based on how many events there are, it is the piece which can create windows and display things. Now the lag comes when a flood of events makes every mod installed run it\u0027s OnGUI() per event - unfortunately just moving the mouse is an event along with many other things. Skipping OnGUI() calls is not viable because your window then disappears for the frames it didn\u0027t run on - flickering ensues. Plus if those events were actually directed at your window (say a click to open the settings) your mod would miss it and settings doesn\u0027t open. So what I\u0027ve done now is leave the pieces of the GUI which must be seen and need to react to events exposed to every event and set Update() to tell the mod 3 times a second that it should run a full frame calculation. This keeps the windows displayed, GUI items reacting to input and seems to cut the lag down considerably.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m thinking of trying a few other things to filter down the events but it might not be worth it. If the calculations to decide if I need to render a frame take as long as rendering it, it\u0027s not worth bothering.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was planning to do the next release in 0.24 since it\u0027s close and I still have a bunch of things to look at but if I find the memory problem I\u0027ll drop an interim DLL into this thread.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ratzap","CreatedById":75982,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-01T19:56:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have a feeling that most of what people are seeing is C# behaviour. The runtime won\u0027t GC unless it needs to or if you change scene (ie VAB to center). I found 2 items that could be declared static that came in between 0.8f and 0.9 but they couldn\u0027t possibly account for filling up multi GB of memory as they were never instanced anyway. I left a 0.9 running for 3 hours (only toolbar and squad with it), it grew certainly but it didn\u0027t crash and it grew because the GC simply did not run until I changed scenes. There are also a number of people talking about not using foreach with unity3d (and a number who say it\u0027s fine) so I can look at refactoring anything with a foreach - buuut those were all in place in 0.8f and earlier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI still can\u0027t get it to change the line spacing of the font either. It\u0027s a KSP skin with 15 pixels of height per line and no way to change how it fits together. You can only control the style of the font: normal, bold etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just ran this version for a couple of hours, it stays rock steady on memory usage (again, just FB, toolbar and squad), you might want to try it.

Which is not such a bad thing given the use it\u0027s being put to but it does make dependencies between objects important and KSPs plugin scene is very fluid.
