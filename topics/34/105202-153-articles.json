I had assumed based on some prior comments from RD that habitation was directly tied to mass, but it seems that isn\u0027t the case (or there\u0027s many other factors being taken into account that I am not factoring for).  Another big wrinkle is how to factor in parts that offer additional kerbal-months, a multiplier, and a recycler at the same time, or an option to switch between them.  I\u0027m not sure how that\u0027s all intended to be balanced together.  And maybe I\u0027m rusty, but I\u0027m also not sure how to factor in \u0022Crew Affected\u0022, because the Hab Ring and Tundras say they affect 0 crew.  I thought Habitation Months were simply totaled up for the whole ship, then multiplied by the total of all Hab Multipliers, and then the resulting number was divided among the total crew on board.\n\nFor reference, this is my current calculations for parts hab months per ton,  when configured to give additional hab months only and when capable parts have been expanded and filled with their maximum Machinery:\n\n- Habitation Ring - **8.2** *(497.5 months for 60.6 tons, needs machinery)*\n- 2.75m Tundra Expandable Hab - **4.1** *(19.8 months for 4.765 tons, needs machinery)*\n- 4.25m Tundra Expandable Hab - **6.3** *(77 months for 12.1 tons, needs machinery)*\n- 2.5m Kerbitat - **2.6** *(20.4 months for 7.6 tons, no machinery)*\n- 3.5m Kerbitat - **7.2** *(69 months for 9.48 tons, no machinery)*\n- Ranger Hab Module - **7.8** *(83.6 months for 10.656 tons)*\n- Ranger Mini-Hab Module - **6.89** *(10 months for 1.45 tons)*\n- Hitchhiker: **10** *(25 months for 2.5 tons)*\n\nAm I missing something really obvious here, or are these numbers all over the place?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-02-04T12:14:14Z\u0022 title=\u002202/04/2017 12:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 4, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by tsaven**\n  \ntypos"},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-04T12:49:59Z","Content":"You are missing something obvious ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022;)\u0022)\n\nHabitation is limited more by volume than by tonnage.  \n\nAlso, crew capacity allocates a portion of both tonnage and space, as does resource storage (including separate allocations for battery mass/volume).

If you launched these ships before installing \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS, it won\u0027t know about them until you focus them once. Or maybe you somehow lost the tracking information in your save file at some point.\n\u003E \n\nThanks, I\u0027d been using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS before.
