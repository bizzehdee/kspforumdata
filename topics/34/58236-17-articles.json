So let\u0027s just talk about the transform specified in gimbal module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERotating gimbals based on vessel\u0027s reference transform is the original way the stock gimbal module uses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis works well with yaw/pitch control coefficients in my plugin, but gives bad results when dealing with roll controls when we have symmetric counterparts sharing same roll coefficient value of tweakables. (because inverted pitch/yaw commands should be generated in order to achieve roll control)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, in order to constrain the gimbal (in order to implement the single-axis gimbal feature), it is needed to convert the control (based on vessel\u0027s reference transform) into gimbal transform first, then calculate the local rotation (constraints get involved here) and convert it back to vessel\u0027s reference transform because my module is not replacing the stock gimbal module but more like \u0022parasitizing\u0022 on it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-22T05:06:14Z\u0022 title=\u002201/22/2014 05:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 22, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by HoneyFox\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Agathorn","CreatedById":99662,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-22T05:06:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NathanKell\u0022 data-cite=\u0022NathanKell\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAgathorn, HoneyFox: it uses (or doesn\u0027t use) whatever LazarasLuan originally assigned, and/or Scripto23 changed in the realism patch for it.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as I can tell Laz\u0027s original uses no gimballing, no plugins at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScripto does add this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E    MODULE\u003Cbr\u003E    {\u003Cbr\u003E        name = ModuleGimbal\u003Cbr\u003E        gimbalTransformName  = thrustTransform\u003Cbr\u003E        gimbalRange = 0.8\u003Cbr\u003E    }\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I don\u0027t know if that is something special or just stock.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ssgavin1250","CreatedById":87357,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-22T05:08:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eso yeah...
