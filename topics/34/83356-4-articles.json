Would it be more or less efficient?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei think we would have to test it. having it in a texture compresses it more but you would have to do more calculations to get the data out. you are trading space for cpu time. keeping either in memory is a bad idea anyway unless they aren\u0027t very detailed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea file might be the best way though now that i think about it. you could format it in a way where you can just read a few specific lines if you are doing continues updates or you can read through the whole thing and dump it again if you build up your whole thing, the way my overlays do it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
