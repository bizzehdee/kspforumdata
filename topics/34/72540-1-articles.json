I\u0027ve been looking for a mod to do this. The Mun and \u003Cem\u003Eespecially\u003C/em\u003E Minmus yield too much science for me to feel any sense of challenge or accomplishment playing career mode. Kinda hoped those values would have gotten tweaked in the 0.24 release, but no such luck.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m gonna try this as soon as I get home.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jaxx","CreatedById":95312,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-29T03:35:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELet us know how it works.

The final piece in my mod-puzzle was making science more precious. Being able to do so myself in a config makes it even better.
