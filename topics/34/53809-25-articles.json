The virtual one is actually a copy, that can be accessed in the scripting interface. Once textures are in GPU space, they can\u0027t leave, so leaving it readable, leaves a copy of that texture in userspace memory. This is one reason why this mod works so well. It commits as many textures as it can. It should be noted though, that MBMs are already committed by squad (but pngs and tgas aren\u0027t). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the other suggestion, I\u0027m not sure what you mean. I avoided disk space as lots of people didn\u0027t like the fact that it was updating their system, and moving to MBMs made textures unreadable, etc. SO I decided to go this route, where textures are just re-loaded if need be, and then resized in memory, not disk. Adds startup time. But keeps the disk/install original.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rbray89","CreatedById":48847,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-08T23:39:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022landeTLS\u0022 data-cite=\u0022landeTLS\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe newest version is really working well.
