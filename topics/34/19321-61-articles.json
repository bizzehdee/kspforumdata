On Kerbin, this is somewhere between 50 - 500 m/s, depending on the vehicle design. On Eve, we\u0027d have to go faster to get to orbit, spend more time in the atmosphere, and the atmosphere is 5 times thicker. So let\u0027s guess 5 times the drag losses, so 250 - 2500 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo all of this guesstimating leaves us with ~5250 - 7500 m/s to orbit.

Based on that, you have the data for your manned mission. Keep in mind that you will have to try and design a vehicle that will be able to remain stable during reentry but will be stable during the return flight as well; I would advise adding some type of aerodynamic extensions to the bottom and top of the rocket to try and invert its stability characteristics for the initial landing and jettison them just prior to touchdown.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jrandom","CreatedById":74522,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-16T04:32:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause of the hard-mode rules I play under, no unmanned probes, sadly -- I don\u0027t fly any until RemoteTech 2 is done...
