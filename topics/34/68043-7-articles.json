Use this to extend EVA resources for longer spacewalks, rover trips, or more ambitious orbital supply runs and refitting activities. Also tweaked the Sabatier reactor, mainly cause i felt it was too plain for such an important piece of equipment. Considering its a massive power hog, i justified adding another 700 tris to the model due to the fact people aren\u0027t generally going to need more than a couple. Common resource containers like food water and gas, will be revised to be more conservative poly wise as you\u0027ll always have more than a few on your craft. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XenAwqL.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022XenAwqL.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso testing out transparency for potential see-through parts in the future \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
