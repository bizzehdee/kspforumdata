Now its working just fine! Was my fault, I did not scroll down long enough on that page.\n\n@Avera9eJoe:\n\nIn theory, this would work, as KSP does search through all folders. But, especially with Effect nodes, texture definitions etc some of the scripts have paths defined relative to the gamedata folder, like nearly every mod does, even squad. You had to adjust all of these in all the scripts. And if a new version gets released, repeat the whole process. Its just not worth the effort. It will be a mess, if not at the beginning, then after the first few new released versions, or if you add other mods that want to make use of another one.\n\nBesides this, the directory structure is quite logical, IMHO. You have smokescreen as the base mod, realplume making use of it, and realplume-stock adjusting realplume for stock. If you also have hotrockets, and/or coolrockets, they also use smokescreen. So all those mods residing in their own subdirectory of gamedata is rather logical.\n\nAnd last: CKAN is one of the best things that happened to ksp. Its not only the \u0022burden\u0022 of the installation process that it takes from you (dumping some files into gamedata isnt that hard), but keeping everything updated and managed even with many mods that have different (inter)dependencies.

Engines like the RS-68 for the Delta series have a much more red color, due in large part to the ablative material in the combustion chamber, and engines like the RS-25 have a much more purply-blue color, with tinges of red at the edges of the plume where the plasma is cooler. In the end, the plume is mostly transparent, and really only presents a color at the edges. Ferram4 in his infinite free time is tinkering with making a better hydrolox particle to use, so in the meantime the blue color will just have to do."},{"CreatedByName":"HafCoJoe","CreatedById":80363,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-01T22:10:51Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Kinda, SmokeScreen won\u0027t be happy about it.

There should be a large enough array of plumes to choose from to fit all your needs. Have a look through the guide [here](https://github.com/KSP-RO/RealPlume/wiki/Adding-a-Plume-to-an-Engine) on how to attach the prefabs, though presumably you\u0027ve already figured all that stuff out. I\u0027ve got screenshots of most of the pre-existing plumes so you don\u0027t have to tweak with those too much.\n\nThat being said, you\u0027ll be looking for the \u0022size\u0022 curve, you can find here in the Kerolox plume: [https://github.com/KSP-RO/RealPlume/blob/master/GameData/RealPlume/000_Generic_Plumes/Kerolox-Lower.cfg#L122-L128](https://github.com/KSP-RO/RealPlume/blob/master/GameData/RealPlume/000_Generic_Plumes/Kerolox-Lower.cfg#L122-L128)\n\nWhich will adjust the starting size of the particle by pressure. \n\nThe simpler (not necessarily better) way is to just adjust the fixedScale (or plumeScale|flareScale) parameters in the PLUME node, and let the RealPlume Module Manager patches do all the heavy lifting for you. The PLUME system in RealPlume is quite robust by design, I\u0027d highly recommend you try it out.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I see not how my first paragraph is redundant if not lead by the last statement; not seeing red is a far less serious deal than not seeing any FX at all, at least in my opinion.
