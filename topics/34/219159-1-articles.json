They will approve any mission, sign any funding request -- as long as the cost falls within what they deem \u0022acceptable risk\u0022. If you want to launch more expensive (and thus, in their estimation, inherently riskier) missions, you will need to prove yourself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFunding Floor evolved out of my desire to play a career game where I never had to worry about \u003Cem\u003Erunning out\u003C/em\u003E of money, but where money and reputation still had some use and I couldn\u0027t just unlock everything from the start. Mods like Play Your Way and Daily Funds were closer to what I wanted, but not quite what I was looking for. So, once I figured out what I \u003Cem\u003Ewas\u003C/em\u003E looking for, I wrote it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E\nHow It Works\n\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour funds, rather than being a pool of money that can be emptied, are now an upper limit on how much you can spend at any one time. If your budget is $100k, you can upgrade your launchpad and fire a dozen rockets that cost $90k into the sea, and still have $100k to use -- but that $101k rocket remains out of reach.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour budget is calculated directly from your reputation. Increase your reputation and it goes up; lose reputation and it goes back down. In this way, as your reputation increases, you can plan bigger and more ambitious missions, without ever needing to choose between launching rockets and upgrading \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, grind contracts to afford that last comms satellite for your constellation, or fast-forward for a month to accumulate the funding for your next mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E\nConfiguration\n\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFunding Floor has a number of options, configurable via the difficulty options menu at any time.

It should otherwise be broadly compatible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is highly recommended that if you turn on the options that increase/decrease reputation baesd on income/expenses, you do not use any strategies that convert to or from funds, such as Appreciation Campaign (funds to reputation) or Patent Licensing (science to funds). These can cause weird side effects like gaining more/less reputation than you should, contracts being counted as income and expenses at the same time, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E\nDownload\n\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s available on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E!
