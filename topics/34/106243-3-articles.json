This only applies to tanks that have IFS enabled at all, other tanks work fine in RF.\n\u003E \n\u003E I guess IFS will always remain incompatible, so maybe add an incompatibility note for the release. \n\u003E \n\u003E Especially CKAN users might get scared, because [CryoEngines](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117766-1-0-Cryogenic-Engines-Pack-%28high-Isp-chemical-rockets!%29) currently lists IFS as dependency.\n\u003E \n\u003E However, above CryoEngines actually still work, as the required resources exist in RF (LqdHydrogen, LqdOxygen).

For instance, today, I did a basic test run with the microwave receivers and I immediately made 2 observations. A: line of sight, doesn\u0027t work for planets (like Kerbin) and B: Transmitters/Relays in the atmosphere do not suffer any amount of penalty. This means there is no point of building a energy station in orbit and no point of building a relay network. Problem A might be a result of the KSP 1.0 changes but problem B is strange as the KSPI Wiki mentions it specifically. Has no one ever noticed this? Anyway, I fixed both issues. Transmitterers in the atmosphere are now also effected by the same penalty you receive when the microwave-receiver is in the atmosphere. This means putting your Atmospheric power station on the top of the mountain will pay off.\n\nWhen you\u0027re inside a mod, you have a knowledge of it better than anyone other. You found those two little bugs, but can you suppose that any of the player would remember how much energy a reactor would generate and transmit? \n\nI\u0027m a very long time user of Interstellar, and until some months ago, I divided reactors in two categories: less than 2.5 GW or more than 2.5 GW, cause 2.5 GW it\u0027s what I need to make the Vista work... Interstellar it\u0027s a huge and complicated mod, and in this moment, you as a developer of it, will notice something that just you can. You coded it, you know it. The player see just the result, not the source...\n\nP.S.
