As time warp is KAC\u0027s core business, I suspect there\u0027s little room for improvement if you want to be punctual. My suggestion was to trade some punctuality for convenience -- construction times are no maneuver nodes, after all. Coming to think of it, a point could be made that construction times should not even be given to the nearest second.

All of KCT\u0027s times are in seconds and are just converted into hours or days from there. With the default settings you often see 2 day build times, and if you use purely inventory parts then you can see build times of just a few hours. Still doesn\u0027t need 100% accuracy. Part of the reason I want to avoid overshoots is that KCT has typically had issues with overshoots in the past (where timewarp never stops and suddenly you\u0027re a week past where you should be) and I\u0027m just kinda nervous about them. I know I can prevent that with careful code, but I\u0027d rather have it warp down a bit slower and have to take a few seconds extra time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do know that the buffer zone can be made smaller, to reduce the amount of wasted real time, so I\u0027ll try that first.

Does it become longer with a lower multiplier, or is it the opposite?\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShort answer: It depends on the Preset.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELonger, but actually useful answer: For the Default Preset and likely any derivatives of it, the overall multiplier gets applied directly (1.0 is normal, 0.5 means all build times get cut in half, 2.0 means all build times get doubled). Build Effect and Inventory Effect work the opposite way, where bigger numbers mean less time (since they\u0027re in the denominator of the EffectivePartFormula).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a single part ship, here is what the Build Effect does to the build times:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 - normal build times, where the fourth build takes half as long as the first one, 16th build takes 1/4 the time\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E0.5 - first build \u003Cem\u003Ewould\u003C/em\u003E take 1.4 times as long, \u003Cem\u003Eexcept\u003C/em\u003E that it\u0027s limited to not take longer than 1.0 times. 8th build will take half the normal time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.0 - first build will take 70% as long as a brand new part with a 1.0 Build Effect, second build will take half as long as a brand new part with a 1.0 Build Effect, 8th build takes 1/4 time\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInventory Effect is similar to Build Effect. For this example, let\u0027s totally ignore the Build Effect:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E100 - If the part is not in the inventory, it takes 1.0 times as long as normal. If it is in the inventory, it takes 1/10 as long as normal (0.1 times)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E50 - Not in inventory -\u0026gt; 1.0 times. If in the inventory, takes about 1/7 as long as normal (0.14 times).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E200 - Not in inventory -\u0026gt; 1.0 times. In inventory -\u0026gt; takes about 1/14 as long as normal (0.07 times).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you can\u0027t tell, there\u0027s a square root involved with the Build Effect and the Inventory Effect, which makes the changes non-linear. The Overall Multiplier is just multiplied directly onto the final calculated build time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith a different Preset it might be totally different, since the Preset author can choose how the different Effects and the Overall Multiplier play into the formulas, including totally removing them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESmall update to KCT 1.2.2\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMostly fixes some issues observed with RP-0 and tech node rates when making them not all research at once.
