These are the upgraded versions, running in Sandbox mode, so don\u0027t expect to be so wonderfully endowed with power so quickly in career mode.\u003Cp\u003EThese Tokomak fusion reactors (2.5m and 3.75m) are a bit different to the smaller ones, they are really geared towards Deuterium/Tritium power and consequently have an onboard supply of Lithium and Tritium-breeding is their default behaviour. During normal operation, you\u0027ll see Deuterium and Lithium get used but the Tritium should only be being lost to radiaoative decay. Their ongoing power requirements are in line with their smaller counterparts relatively speaking but are, in absolute terms, vastly larger due to power scaling - indeed the 3.75m fusion reactor requires more power than the total output of a single 1.25m (upgraded) fission or (un-upgraded) fusion reactor just to heat its plasma to fusion temperatures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want, you can switch the fuel types over to Deuterium/Helium-3 or Helium-3 but this will up the power requirements even further and \u003Cstrong\u003Esubstantially\u003C/strong\u003E decrease the reaction rate. The only advantage of this is that, due to the increased energy density of Deuterium/Helium-3 reactions, the upgraded 3.75m fusion reactor can produce ~4GW in this mode for more than 10 years if fully fueled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth the 2.5m and 3.75m reactor are heavy, similar in mass to their fission counterparts. Indeed, unlike its fission counterpart, the 3.75m reactor is even suitable for SSTO rocket operations once upgraded. (By this I mean vertical takeoff rocket SSTOs with thermal rockets, you can obviously use thermal turbojets particularly coupled with aircraft to achieve the same thing earlier), in fact the rocket below was launched as a single stage using LOx augmentation to accelerate off the pad, followed by a low-power limp to orbit using LiquidFuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe new DT fusion picture:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/dt6hkTK.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/dt6hkTK.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YprwvzH.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/YprwvzH.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/PSHpMrV.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/PSHpMrV.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking really good Fractal_UK \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Northstar1989","CreatedById":91005,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-23T23:35:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGlad to hear the fusion reactors are getting upsized- even though I\u0027ve not yet progressed far enough in my Career Mode game to utilize them (I\u0027ve followed a sort of slow, logical progression in technology- so I still haven\u0027t yet discovered fusion power...
