For example, the diameter of the real TKS was 4.15m, which in KSP should equate to 2.656 - however, the TKS parts in this pack are 3.75 meters in diameter. This isn\u0027t really a problem, since the proportions are mostly correct. However, I\u0027m trying to make a 0.6666 scale config to make it have the \u0022proper\u0022 size, but this causes the parts that are mounted above the VA to be quite small.
