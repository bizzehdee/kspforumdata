You can\u0027t do anything until you\u0027re away from Kerbin\u0027s influence. I use the node editor for this, as I can not only set the burn value, but I can adjust the start time to \u0022fine tune\u0022 the path. More often than not, just burning such that the path winds up 90-degrees outbound from Kerbin will be sufficient for most rendezvous.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E OPTIONS:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Intercept Target At Designated Time -- If your probe does not have a close approach already on the map view, use this option. Select a time about 1 day past the SOI escape point as the burn time, and calculate an intercept about 2 days ahead of the asteroid\u0027s encounter. If you do this early, it often takes less than 700 m/s of Dv to reach the intercept point. The farther away you do this burn, the less you have to burn.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Fine Tune Closest Approach -- If you see that your probe already has a reasonably close approach with the asteroid, then try this maneuver instead. Set the approach distance to anywhere from 100 - 300 km (I use 200 km) and trigger the burn at wherever the map view says you currently have closest approach. FTCA will narrow the gap, not always in your range, but well inside 1000 km. Close enough. This maneuver is often less than 300 m/s of Dv. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[*] Match Velocity At Closest Approach -- No explanation needed here.

At the start of this burn, you should be well inside 1000km, probably within 600km, and maybe even closer. You might even be able to see the target, but if not just \u0022point and shoot\u0022. You need only about 100 m/s here at best as a closing rate. As soon as the burn gets you that rate, shut it down, flip to TGT- and wait until you see the target show up. Burn short spurts to kill the velocity down to zero until you\u0027re inside 5km. Get closer if you dare, but don\u0027t overshoot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[*] Rendezvous AP -- Set a distance-to-target of about 75-100m, and per earlier recomendations, set a reasonably high number of \u0022orbits\u0022 (30-50), then engage.

I docked the last segment last night, topped off fuel and monoprop in all tanks and components, and then asked MJ to plot a transfer burn to Jool. MJ gave me a burn of about 1930 m/s roughly 6 hours from the time I requested. By contrast, KAC tells me the window to Jool begins in about 66 DAYS. I decided something wasn\u0027t right here so I returned to the Space Center and quit the game. I reloaded it this morning and just for grins, I deleted the planned maneuver node and told MJ to calculate it again. This time, I got an estimated burn of ~1907 m/s but in 54 days rather than 6 hours. That\u0027s still 10 days sooner than KAC\u0027s alarm but at least within the range of reasonable if we presume KAC\u0027s alarm is an idealized lowest-energy trajectory point in the window.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know you guys have bigger fish to fry in the MJ world but any insight is appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELameLefty : I can\u0027t help much with that.

You toggle them with a radio button on the \u0027transfer alarm\u0027 page. Mechjeb\u0027s transfers generally seem to end up close to one or the other of them, but which isn\u0027t consistent. I\u0027m guessing that each method in KAC varies in accuracy and particularly efficiency, and that Mechjeb\u0027s using a more sophisticated and detailed method that\u0027s both more accurate and more relevant. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechjeb\u0027s also accounts for the ejection angle you need and thus where your craft will be in its orbit when the window arrives, to some extent or another, which I\u0027m pretty sure KAC\u0027s alarms don\u0027t do at all. KAC seems to just note when the planets are in the right position relative to each other. Back before the fix that made mechjeb always find the first transfer window, I twice tried to use KAC\u0027s alarms to execute the burn manually out of sheer frustration. One time it worked okay-ish. The other it sent me in the exact opposite direction from where I needed to go. I was on point of re-downloading protractor for the first time since before Mechjeb 2 came out when the fix went in on the dev version.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-09T23:41:20Z\u0022 title=\u002205/09/2014 11:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 9, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Tiron\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwaster","CreatedById":71262,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-09T23:51:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022falken\u0022 data-cite=\u0022falken\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIs there any way for me to take control of the throttle on the ascent guidance?
