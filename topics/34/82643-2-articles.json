We\u0027ll probably make a 10cm BoxSat someday, but that\u0027s so small in KSP that it\u0027ll have to be a 1-2 part satellite, which might be too boring. Although we based a lot of the design off of cube sats, ultimately this turned out to be an exercise in modular, serviceable satellites instead. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"orcmaul","CreatedById":19612,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-24T00:17:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ZodiaK\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ZodiaK\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Edon\u0027t mind me, but doesn\u0027t that need to be a bit smaller?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe one on the very top center is 10cm along with some of the other sizes we tested. 62.5cm was the clear winner in terms of usability within KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/oC9iaZs\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/oC9iaZs.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022oC9iaZs.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CluelessModeler","CreatedById":58172,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-24T01:04:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is pretty neat!
