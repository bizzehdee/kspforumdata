Luckily this game doesn\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@Cliph: How does the new target system works? I lost a probe, because it antenna was located at \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Csun\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 and when it got into a solar orbit it didn\u0027t connected to the other probes in the solar orbit. I know this is the default behaviour of 0.5.0.1 but it\u0027s kind of strange that within Kerbin\u0027s SoI I got a connection and suddenly it left the SoI and the connection terminates. This is even weirder when you are between Mun and Kerbin: A relay satellite points at Mun with the 50 Mm dish, but a satellite between Mun and Kerbin outside Mun\u0027s SoI got no connection.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually I don\u0027t have a good solution for this, except allow multiple targets and when a connection failed it tries the next one. For example I would add Kerbin to my probe as a secondary target and I could establish a emergency connection from Kerbin with another satellite. And at lest the satellite between Mun and Kerbin could target all relay satellites around Kerbin. It won\u0027t fix the problem for this satellite as I still have to manually target the satellite from a relay satellite. Another \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cworkaround\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 is to target the Mun, but this only works with a relay satellite network around the Mun and there is the same hazard of losing connection forever, when this target isn\u0027t changed to Kerbin and it is entering the Mun\u0027s SoI. Although this could be fixed by an omnidirectional antenna (as there needs to be a relay network already) or another dish pointing at Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd another thing about the expandable 50 Gm antenna: It\u0027s quite heavy, twice as heavy as the fixed one, although it looks relatively small. Now I did reduce the mass to 250 kg and I\u0027m now able to control my little probes (and those go into interplanetary space so I need the 50 Gm one), but I personally want to be as \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Coriginal\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 as possible so maybe there could be another way to reduce the antenna\u0027s mass? For example to use a less effective one with a lower bandwidth, but I don\u0027t know how the plugin can simulate bandwidth. It only seems odd that you always have to use the very large antenna. And afaik real world satellites use different types of antennae allowing connection without pointing at each other (like the omnidirectional ones) but with a very low bandwidth simply as backup to fix the satellites orientation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut in the end I\u0027m pretty happy with the plugin!
