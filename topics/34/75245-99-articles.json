We felt that enabling something that clearly violates the laws of physics would not fit with the theme of the mod.\u003Cp\u003EWe need to have a better safety net for when you go out of range and there are a lot of ideas on how to do this. Adding a hack that lets you contact probes with no connection is, in my opinion, just a lazy hack. Which is why i denied the pull request.

If your probe is dish-only, then you\u0027re SOL - poor design decision. If your omni isn\u0027t active or you\u0027re out of power - too bad, you turned off the backup and you\u0027re SOL. But if there is an active omni, available power, and clear LOS to a command station that has the range to reach the probe normally, then it can be used to reorient the high-gain antenna - just like on real-world craft. No other flight control, because this is a super-low bitrate we\u0027re talking about, but just enough to point the dish and regain full connectivity. I\u0027d further suggest that the integrated omni in probe cores wouldn\u0027t count for this purpose.
