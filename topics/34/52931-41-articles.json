I see the new values in the part description in the VAB (when you hover over the part and right-click for More Info), but if I toggle info from the part\u0027s right-click menu, it shows different diameters and material (they do not match the part description\u0027s values). When I use the part, it also fails to cut at the specified height. I double checked that I am using the config file that shipped in 1.0.3 (with my changes manually added to that config). Is there a disconnect between the config values and the values applied to the part when one is not using an editable \u0027chute?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHm, I\u0027ll admit I haven\u0027t messed a lot with non tweakable parachutes. There might be a bug I\u0027m not aware of, I\u0027ll take a look.
