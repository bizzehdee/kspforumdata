Should I fire that up to side-step the memory issue, or will I just be opening up a whole new can of worms?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks again for the response. I\u0027ll report back the good news tomorrow night.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[EDIT] Just noticed the \u0022KSPLua throwing errors\u0022 part. Is that something I should worry about? Not even sure what KSPLua is. Came along with PartCatalog, right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[ANOTHER EDIT] Couldn\u0027t contain my excitement. Got out of bed and tested it out. Running 64-bit seems to be a solution. At least the solar system looks just as beautiful as I imagined. I\u0027ll play around tomorrow night and see if I get any crashes. I haven\u0027t been having any of the 64-bit issues I keep hearing about in my non-RO install, though, so fingers crossed!
