I\u0027ve been a bit critical of the balancing at the beginning, but the inclusion of boil-off\u002Bincreased performance really created a cool dynamic! Also meshes similarly well in the Kerbal Atomics pack.

To me, this is one of the very few feature-heavy mods that could be well implemented into vanilla.\n\n**edit:** Seems like the nuclear engines have a very similar low eve altitude fall off.

That is how it works IRL too. High Isp is achieved by having the most lightweight exhaust gas possible; for hydrolox engines, it\u0027s largely water vapor and related exotic species, and for NTRs, it\u0027s pure hydrogen. Much lighter than CO2 and the various incompletely burned carbon compounds exhausted by kerosene engines.\n\nThis lightweight gas can achieve a high exhaust velocity in a vacuum. But for precisely the same reason, it\u0027s poor at pushing against atmospheric pressure. Hydrolox engines lose huge amounts of Isp during atmospheric operation. Example: the RD-180, a staged combustion kerolox engine, posts a vacuum Isp of 338s that drops to 311s at sea level. That\u0027s 92% of the vacuum value maintained. The RS-25, a staged combustion hydrolox engine, posts a vacuum Isp of 452s which drops to 366s at sea level. That\u0027s only 81% of vacuum value maintained, losing more than twice as much as the kerolox engine.\n\nAt Eve, you have vastly more than just normal sea level pressure. Hydrolox engines, by their nature poor performers under pressure, are going to cave in dramatically, perhaps to the point of being unable to support proper combustion - due to the nozzle not being sized for this pressure, the exhaust will be strongly underexpanded, leading to flow separation that will kill your performance and can damage the engine. While none of these effects are technically modeled in KSP, reducing the Isp to zero at a value lower than Eve\u0027s pressure is a decent stand-in to represent it.\n\nNTRs meanwhile, even though they don\u0027t need to worry about stable combustion, certainly won\u0027t fare any better. Their exhaust is even lighter, by an order of magnitude, than that of hydrolox engines. And the lack of combustion also leads to much lower internal chamber pressures.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 21.3.2016 at 1:41 AM, Stone Blue said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [@Nertea](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/83952-nertea/) any chance to get updated Dropbox \u0026 SpaceDock links?
