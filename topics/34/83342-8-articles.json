Simply build the subassembly ahead of time, \u0022scrap\u0022 it, and then use it in a new build. The parts from the subassembly will add nearly negligible time to the total build time for the craft. Alternatively, if what you\u0027re adding on is very inexpensive (like a small satellite onto a prebuilt launcher) you can \u0022edit\u0022 the constructed launcher and add the satellite in (should save more time than scrapping the subassembly).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI purposefully designed the inventory system to not treat subassemblies specially, but instead to treat all parts separately. This provides far greater freedom than if I required the use of subassemblies for similar functionality. Also, actually checking for subassemblies would be much harder to program, in addition to being more restrictive. Hopefully you can see that what you suggest is already implemented (since the very beginning) in a more abstract way and I hope that is satisfactory. A total rewrite of that system is virtually impossible at this time (in the manner you describe at least, it is actually being rewritten right now to use a different mod for handling the inventory system, which has been a real pain to get working properly, which will make it even harder to do anything specific to subassmeblies).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027ve got any other suggestions, I\u0027m always willing to hear them. I try not to shoot them down too often, and a large amount of KCT\u0027s features came out of user suggestions.

Simply build the subassembly ahead of time, \u0022scrap\u0022 it, and then use it in a new build. The parts from the subassembly will add nearly negligible time to the total build time for the craft. Alternatively, if what you\u0027re adding on is very inexpensive (like a small satellite onto a prebuilt launcher) you can \u0022edit\u0022 the constructed launcher and add the satellite in (should save more time than scrapping the subassembly).\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had not thought of build and scrap - but that makes sense thinking about it - given the part reuse ect ect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eis there any benefit to not completely building something before scrapping it - does none complete progress impact or only complete?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emy one querry/suggestion/thing im not overly enthussed by - launchpad refurbishment. i feel it is currently too long. i have noticed that it is proportional to the size of the vessel that used it last. my suggestion would be instead to have it setup-time for the next launch. to put it a bit clearer: the size of the launch shouldnt have a huge influence on postlaunch refurb... its just a slab of concrete til the next launch is in place, but it would make sense for it to take twice as long to move a rocket onto the pad if its bigger.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eother than that i do immensely enjoy your mod - getting to the stage of setting up my first moon bases (mun closely followed my min). taken me 100 days to get to the moon!
