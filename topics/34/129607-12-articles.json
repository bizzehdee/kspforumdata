This bug is causing the previous best settings button not functioning correctly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second bug is when saving the launch results to the file, if the StartSpeed and TurnAngle are the same with one of the previous launches, it overwrites that entry. This can cause problems. For example, If I use previous best settings to launch to a different orbit, and the new launch has more total loss, in future launches the use previous best settings button to launch to the original orbit will not give the true best settings because it\u0027s overwritten.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, the initial guess for 1.25m rockets seems to have too large TurnAngle.
