AmpYear can only guess the power usage in the editor (VAB/SPH) so it guesses the MAXimum amount. The part list was added to assist people in seeing what each part is being reported at.\n\nThe main problem with command pods is reaction wheels. And life support mods etc that add variable power consumption to a command pod. I\u0027m guessing in this case your command pod has large reaction wheels and they are heavy EC user. I might look at splitting command pod modules up to show every power consumer within them as this has been asked a few times now.\n\noh, and Megajoules - that is from KSP Interstellar and Ampyear does not support that mod right now. See posts above, it\u0027s something I\u0027m working on re-adding but it\u0027s taking time as KSPIE has so many parts.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-23T17:57:24Z\u0022 title=\u002202/23/2016 05:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 23, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by JPLRepo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Deimos Rast","CreatedById":157420,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-23T19:24:39Z","Content":"The Orion Capsule from the Shadow Works mod, [here](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/115593-part-105-shadowworks-stockalike-sls-and-more-v132-2212016/).\n\nLink to [OrionPod.cfg](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B_AYBjUurJu_eUVlZUpZR3Y0eFU) or the relevant Reaction Wheel info below:\n\n    MODULE\n    {\n        name = ModuleReactionWheel\n        PitchTorgue = 18\n        YawTorque = 18\n        RollTorque = 18\n        RESOURCE\n        {\n            name = ElectricCharge\n            rate = 1.4\n        }\n\nI mentioned another mod, CTN\u0027s Cube Sat, which also have Reaction Wheels, so it might be a similar situation, but they\u0027re tiny probes and AMPYear comes back with numbers of 25 and 40 for drainage.

Solar Panels are automatically excluded for power calculations while you have the Dark-Side Calculation window open. When you close the Dark-Side Calculation window Solar Panels are reset to their previous selection state (it remembers if you had them selected or not).   \n    Added support for ToggleFuelCell mod, which is a tiny mod that changes the Fuel Cells from ModuleResourceConverter to it\u0027s own ModuleFuelCell (which is just a wrapped ModuleResourceConverter). When using this mod Fuel Cells are now handled.   \n    Fixed bug with Alternators and updated to handle negative power alternators (ie. Atomic Age Rockets).   \n    Changed PartsList to provide a break-up of parts that contain multiple modules that consume or produce EC.   \n    Corrected EC usage for AmpYears own ION and PPT RCS parts in the editor.   \n    Implemented colour coded Icons - Green will always appear in the SpaceCenter (will look to see if possible to change the colour based on any of your active vessels EC status in a future release).   \n    It\u0027s fairly rudimentary for this version, happy to look at any feedback anyone has.   \n    In flight colour will change for the active vessel from Green to Yellow to Red and back again based on EC status.   \n    Default ReservePower on all Probes and Pods has been boosted from 50 to 80 units.    \n    If you have RealismOverhaul installed the default ReservePower on all Probes and Pods is now 2000 units (haven\u0027t fully tested game balance, so happy to change this based on feedback).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-28T03:23:33Z\u0022 title=\u002202/28/2016 03:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 28, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by JPLRepo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Deimos Rast","CreatedById":157420,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-28T05:39:33Z","Content":"Good work and glad to see some of what we talked about made it into this update.\n\nDownloading now."},{"CreatedByName":"JPLRepo","CreatedById":114736,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-28T06:00:00Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 19 minutes ago, Deimos Rast said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Good work and glad to see some of what we talked about made it into this update.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Downloading now.\n\u003E \n\nNP.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 24/02/2016 at 0:24 PM, Deimos Rast said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Oh, and an idea that might a nice feature: the power savings feature you have - let the player customize what actions to take. It could be as simple as choosing from a predefined list (turn off lights, antenna, deploy solar panels, etc) or action key/groups compatible (maybe even tie in with the Action Group Extended Mod).
