Tried to research the problem and read about cumulative g-loads and such, so I tried a few more times. Each time my crew dies from \u0027exceeding G-force limit\u0027 and I NEVER go over 2Gs! In fact as far as I can tell my g-meter stays between 1 and 1.5 the whole flight. It\u0027s a big heavy craft so I\u0027m not even accelerating that quickly. What am I doing wrong?
