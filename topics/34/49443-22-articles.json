Nothing, that is a vacuum, consisting of nothing at all, weighs less than hydrogen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA balloon \u0022full\u0022 of vacuum would have quite a bit more lifting power than one of the same volume full of hydrogen or helium, 14% more than helium. The problem is creating a vessel strong enough to keep the atmospheric pressure from crushing it AND light enough that the non-contents can float the container in the atmosphere. Not even a container made of homogenous diamond can withstand the pressure AND be light enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps a \u0022honeycomb\u0022 or other porous material, with impermeable inner and outer skins, pressurized with hydrogen between the skins, could be strong enough to contain a vacuum while being light enough for the vacuum to lift and outperform a conventional envelope of equal displacement filled with hydrogen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn airship envelope of a given size always has the same theoretical lifting power, no matter what it\u0027s filled with. To get the usable lifting capacity, calculate the volume of air displaced (thus how much maximum weight can be lifted) and subtract the weight of the filling (and the envelope). That pretty much leaves four choices, in order of decreasing weight. Hot air, helium, hydrogen, vacuum. There are others that have been used but have less lift capacity and/or are flammable and/or toxic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wonder if anyone has tried hot helium or hot hydrogen? In \u0022The Clouds of Saturn\u0022 by Michael McCollum, he had floating cities on Saturn using double layer dome envelopes. The inner layer held a heliox atmosphere (like what deep ocean divers breathe) because the 70% of normal air that is nitrogen is *heavy* and between it and the outer layer was heated hydrogen. If the city builders hadn\u0027t wanted an \u0022outdoor\u0022 space they could have just used a smaller amount of heated hydrogen to carry the same load. And yes, everyone talks in a high pitched voice. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPeople have been trying to do vacuum airships, with zero success, since the 1600\u0027s. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_airship\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_airship\u003C/a\u003E But in a computer simulation it\u0027s easy to have fictional materials with the right properties to make it work. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifting_gas\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifting_gas\u003C/a\u003E says vacuum is 7% lighter than hydrogen and %16 lighter than helium.
