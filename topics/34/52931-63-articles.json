Its sole interaction with Real Chute is that it checks to see if any parachutes are deployed and if they are then it treats them as unshielded no matter what other parts might be shielding them and they can burn up. (reflects the chutes themselves being subject to hot reentry gasses). But DREC does not cause any acceleration whatsoever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReal Chute doesn\u0027t affect how FAR works nor is it affected by it (except to the extent that the ship itself is affected by FAR). RC works by applying deceleration forces directly and does not interact with either FAR\u0027s drag model or even the stock drag model. It independently calculates drag for its parachute parts and applies those forces to the part.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nanowinner","CreatedById":100275,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-24T20:53:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOkay, that\u0027s all nice to know, I didn\u0027t knew some of them.
