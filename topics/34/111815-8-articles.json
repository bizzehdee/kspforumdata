A complete refactoring of the code (the plug-in should be about 1/4th of the size it was before) This included any bug fixes I have come across or have had reported, as well as make the code ready for a toolbar based GUI that\u0027s in development for the next update! \n\n**Full Changelog:**\n\n- Complete refactoring of the code! Alot more efficient (hopefully!)\n\nBugs fixed:\n\n- All Rent related bugs are finally fixed! Your kerbal tenants have stopped being deadbeats and are now paying properly! (Note: RabidNinjaWombat and Associates\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u017E\u00C2\u00A2 are not responsible for any back rent not collected ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif) )\n- Note: Rent is only collected when you visit your ships/bases(but it does accumulate while the ships isn\u0027t focused) So Land-lords check in with your tenants often!\n- Added a check to rent code to make sure player was in Career mode before trying to pay them money, avoiding null refs for those playing in Sandbox (thanks for the report Maraz!) (note for sandbox players, right click menu \u0022Time Until next Pay\u0022 field will still go into the negatives but it can be safety ignored till I get the GUI up and running which will removed this field completely)\n- Several code fixes eliminating Reeeaaaaly annoying log spam. (thanks for the heads up Oaktree42)\n- USI-LS support should now properly cost you supplies for your Civilians.\n- Add Placeholder IVA to Movie theater (to make it easier to access your recruited Kerbals) New IVA soon.\n\nEnhancements/Balance:\n\n- Added a check to the rent code to see if your landed on Kerbin. (no rolling a CivPop Apartment just off the runway and raking in the cash, you dirty cheating alpaca ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif) ) Its not perfect, But works for now, will take another look at the rent code, once the GUI is finished.\n- Buffed/Balanced the Laser Drill - was pulling far too little out for its size/cost and relatively high point in the tech tree.\n- Lowered weight of landing legs, given their size, while large, compared to other parts they were still overweight.\n- Rent Slightly Buffed\n\n**Also a big shout out to Reddit user Faraway\\_Hotel** for his permission to use the awesome Kerbal Icons he created, and that you see on Reddit as Flairs, within the CivPop GUI (licensed Creative Commons 4.0 BY-NC) **COMING SOON!** \n\n![hBVnkbE.pngp](https://i.imgur.com/hBVnkbE.pngp)\n\n**Download link in the first post as usual!**\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-07T12:48:13Z\u0022 title=\u002208/07/2015 12:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by rabidninjawombat**"},{"CreatedByName":"Weywot8","CreatedById":146603,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T07:40:14Z","Content":"Rent!
