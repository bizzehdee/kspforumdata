I remember when I was too new to anything coding related to even wrap my midn around the scripting system in Morrowind, and back then we basically had to create a GUI keyboard that was very slow because of a standard \u0022heartbeat\u0022 delay to the script execution system. what we really need is something for RPM that will temporarily lock all keyboard input (and perhaps lock your camera to the specific terminal while doing so, though I have no clue on this one) and relay it to the input in a specific terminal. I already know that locking input to the game is possible while still allowing GUI access with a mod I installed a while back (forgot its name, oops) but for relaying the keyboard input to the console afterwards... the only idea I have is somehow setting up every key on a standard keyboard as a hotkey that, when the conditions of the game-action lock and the focus on the terminal are set, output their corresponding key designation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, one idea comes to mind which might help figure this out. We already know how to lock game-action input when a text-field in a mod\u0027s GUI is active. Perhaps we can find a way to spawn a GUI-based text-input field when a specific RPM cockpit button is pressed. It\u0027s not ideally immersive, but it might be a good stepping stone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomehow (I\u0027m not sure why or how) this all leads me to mention an idea I\u0027ve had for some time. It\u0027s kind of like a reverse RPM monitor thing. The idea behind RPM was to put the console monitor into the cockpit, but there are times I find myself wishing I could undock the monitor from the cockpit and take it with me into other camera views. This is something I have missed since starting to run KSP after a year or so flying in the Orbiter Flight Simulator. It\u0027s the external MFD. I\u0027m wondering how hard it would be to basically take the RPM system, with all of it\u0027s side buttons and stuff, and put it into a GUI window so that you could display a complete RPM screen separated from the physical scene.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow that I\u0027m becoming more familiar with the RPM code, I may start looking into that myself... but I am horribly uneducated in the ways of C# and I\u0027m really just a fiddler when it comes to KSP modding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUPDATE: I meant to mention this, but I thought that someone had already tried to make a few steps in integrating RPM with kOS. It might be Aa feature in the ALCOR pod. all I remember is a kOS folder in the RPM pages that comes with the pod, but as I am not a kOS user (yet...) I just removed it. It may just be a re-state of whatever is already in the standard input for kOS, but it would be a start.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-23T18:25:17Z\u0022 title=\u002202/23/2015 06:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Gaalidas\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wavechaser","CreatedById":125058,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-24T15:14:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Wavechaser\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Wavechaser\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOK, MOARdV, after some analyzing, which is basically excluding anything I installed after RPM, and all part mods (like KW) and some plugins that are known to not conflicting with RPM (like MJ, TAC Fuel Balancer, Trajectories, etc.), and these are the suspicious ones:\u003Cp\u003EProcedural Parts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKarbonite that uses Regolith ISRU plugin, which, Regolith is kind of suspicious\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome other not very likely to conflict with RPM but I\u0027m not really sure about: Texture Replacer, TweakScale, Tweakable Everything, Community Resource Pack\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHello?

Try backing up your game folder, reinstall a new one in steam, then add RPM with the necessary dependencies and test again (I am assuming you\u0027re using 32bit on windows). If it works, start adding mods and see what breaks it. I recommend using a mod manager, I use a simple one like JSGME (Generic Mod Enabler). Ain\u0027t perfect, but makes reinstalling mods easy, plus it warns you when you overwrite something. Normally, neigher Regolith, nor Procedural Parts should cause problems, I\u0027m using all of them with no bugs in forever. I\u0027ve also used it with Realism Overhaul. No issues there either, and that one uses Real Fuels on top of Procedural Parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a few things you should be aware of:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- As stated before, OpenGL mode breaks the hud, it\u0027s there, but it\u0027s black. DirectX11 mode works well. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- In Career, the orbit screen is bugged (you can\u0027t see the orbit circle) until you unlock the Tracking Station Conics. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- KerbQuake works fine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Quick IVA works fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E- B9 might not have the latest RPM. Delete the JSI folder in that mod before you install it! You don\u0027t need it, the B9 cockpits work just fine without it. \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Modified IVA. No problem, doesn\u0027t overwrite anything, just make sure to use the ASET Props in the correct folder. For the MK1 inline cockpit you need to have the correct cockpit mod. Otherwise you\u0027ll just have the closed RPM cockpit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Vesel View doesn\u0027t overwrite anything so it\u0027s safe. It has an issue with one screen, but nothing gamebreaking. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Nav Tools doesn\u0027t overwrite anything so it\u0027s also safe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Docking Port Alignment must be installed AFTER RPM. If you don\u0027t, the screen will freeze when you try to start that page, it will lock the buttons for that screen, and mess up a few pages on the other screens too. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Probe control room is safe, but the new interior remake uses B9 cockpits, you can easily turn them into normal RPM screens in the config file. You must use the required dependencies, B9 props/sounds and ASET Props.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The only one I didn\u0027t use lately is Engine Igniter, but I don\u0027t recall any issues with it before, except that in B9 you had to modify the screens (look for the link in my previous post here, previous page).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-24T22:06:13Z\u0022 title=\u002202/24/2015 10:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by karamazovnew\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
