I have personally looked at log files that were in excess of 50 megabytes. Something as short as loading the game, accepting a contract, performing a flight, and recovery would actually be fairly short and can be done in a minimum of about 6 scene changes. The most important part, if you can\u0027t include a full log, is the scene where the error happens. If you can easily recreate the problem with a \u0022slimmed down\u0022 version of a play session, then that does make it easier/clearer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I can\u0027t speak for every mod author as to whether they\u0027ll accept large log files. I might have an easier time looking at them because I\u0027ve got a program that breaks them down by scene and displays the number of errors in each. But any file \u002B a descriptive description of what you did and what the error is can make bug fixing go from taking days (mostly trying to recreate the issue) to taking 5 minutes (fixing the one line of code that is causing the issue).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe issue as described sounds like an NRE during saving of the persistence, which will have a definite entry in the log file but is only speculation by me as to the cause. I haven\u0027t used FMRS before, nor do I know how it works internally, so I don\u0027t know if that\u0027s even a possible bug for it. I don\u0027t imagine the fix is particularly difficult if it is that.
