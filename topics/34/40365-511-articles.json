Much faster than that and they get hard to control. By watching what I was doing on successful launches, I found a rule of thumb of pitching over 5 degrees every 50 m/s (i.e. 85 degrees as you pass through 50 m/s, 80 degrees at 100 m/s, etc.). Depending on exactly how my TWR changes in flight, I usually pass through 45 degrees and 450 m/s at 10-12 km, at which point I follow the bottom half of the prograde marker down to the horizon. Try to set up your fin arrangements so FAR shows you moderately stable (I shoot for Cm between -0.5 and -2) out to \u002B-8-10 degrees angle of attack through the full range of speeds and fuel conditions. If you go by the in-game center of mass and center of lift markers, look for the CL to be moderately behind the CM. Different rockets need different amounts of margin, so learning to use the FAR graphs will help you get the hang of it. Again, anything you learn with a Mainsail and stock tanks should carry straight over to the methalox launchers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBased on the flavor text and spindly appearance of the engine, I thought it was a lander/return vehicle engine at first too. The concept of in-situ methalox production will open up new possibilities like the flavor text says, but doing it in Interstellar will have to wait until someone contributes parts that aren\u0027t launch vehicle parts. Looking at the Firefly design, I\u0027d suggest doing its plug aerospike as a 1.25m engine, fitting the role of \u0022small launch vehicle,\u0022 and then a smaller engine based on fitting one of its eight combustion chambers with a standard vacuum-optimized bell nozzle.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"undercoveryankee","CreatedById":103505,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-05T17:37:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ruptga\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Ruptga\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnd nothing of value was lost, whatever.\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould it be rude to name an in-game AI core \u0022Mariyate\u0022?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
