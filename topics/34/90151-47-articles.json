I just had a glitch so my ScanSat stuff wasn\u0027t being updated correctly. I corrected the glitch and reloaded and now the components have the correct values. Although I\u0027d question the SCAN RADAR Altimetry Sensor values as max is still set to 500km. Before RO/RSS, that 500km put you at \u0022high space\u0022 but that same 500km in RO/RSS is definitely well within \u0022near space\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother possible issue I found is the DTS-M1 dish (with RemoteTech installed) has a range of 400Mm but in the stock game, that dish is supposed to have enough range to cover about 80% of Kerbin\u0027s SOI. 400Mm is less then half the SOI with RO/RSS and isn\u0027t a great enough distance to cover Minmus (with Kerbin 10x). I\u0027m not sure if that was an intentional change or an oversight.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jandcando","CreatedById":66121,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-21T00:56:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like to get back to you on that idea for RO creating its own engines and using mod models. You said that the only danger was that MM would try to use models from a preferred mod (like FASA) even if the models were deleted. I found a way around this, but I\u0027m not sure about the copyright implications. What would happen if we bundled engine models as a part of RO? All the models would be readily available, and the user wouldn\u0027t need to install mods for getting more engines. But I\u0027m not too confident about the mod makers being OK with that...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we can\u0027t do that, we can just stick to the original idea of using models from installed mods and using fallbacks as necessary. That autoprune tool looks useful for avoiding tank clutter in the VAB. If that tool had some sort of user interface for allowing the user to selectively remove parts from the VAB, that would be ideal so replica rockets could still be made.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that this idea would really make life easier on our side, not having to account for so many different engines.
