A Mark 1 pod is only good for 20 Kerbal days (as a point of reference, Gemini 7 was in orbit for nearly 14 days and was some seriously cramped quarters).  So having more space - either in the form of less crew than crew capacity, or in purpose-built hab modules - can extend this.  Furthermore, some modules serve as \u0027extenders\u0027, making other hab modules more effective (the MKS Kerbitat is an example of this).\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E We also track a few things - how long you\u0027ve been in your current vessel, when you were last on Kerbin, and the most comfortable hab you\u0027ve been in.  We then compare two things - have you been in your current vessel for too long (i.e. have exceeded it\u0027s hab value compared to your time in vessel), and have you been away from Kerbin too long (by looking at your Kerbin time and your best historic hab time).  This lets us do scenarios like having crew in a nice multi-year base still have issues if they go gallivanting off in a rover for too long (and justifies the Karibou\u0027s emergency shelters).  It also lets you set up nice R\u0026R stations that you can rotate larger crews through to bump up the time before they get homesick.  At the same time, it prevents players from \u0027resetting the clock\u0027 by just hopping in and out of a base.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Lastly, and more critically, is the idea that all of this stuff wears out.  A rigid shell will last longer than a flimsy temporary structure.  Rips and tears happen, and equipment wears out.  So over time, even though a base might be rated for several years, if you keep pushing new crew into it over decades, it\u0027s effectiveness is going to degrade over time.  Fortunately, there will be mechanics for using MaterialKits to \u0027patch up\u0027 your old bases and extend their life.  From a gameplay standpoint, this lets the player get away with lighter inflatables for temporary bases, while having the option of investing in heavier components and infrastructure for more permanent installations (which goes hand in hand with how MKS has always worked).\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E As always, feel free to post questions ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E P.S. - Not sure if the big recycler changes will make it in since those require more parts to be built and modeled - we\u0027ll see ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022;)\u0022)\n\u003E \n\nSo how do we find out the habitation of a ship?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-10T22:12:52Z\u0022 title=\u002202/10/2016 10:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 10, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by ThaZeus**\n  \nWrong word!"},{"CreatedByName":"loki130","CreatedById":64492,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-10T22:26:27Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 11 minutes ago, ThaZeus said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E So how do we find out the habitation of a ship?\n\u003E \n\nThe USI life support window--the little green cube on the toolbar--should show the habitation time."},{"CreatedByName":"Whovian41110","CreatedById":155794,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-10T22:30:24Z","Content":"When I have K\u0026K Planetary Base mod the tanks disappear and I\u0027m left with the system from that mod.
