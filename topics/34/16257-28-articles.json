Did notice while creating this patch that it was hard, and a little messy, some things could do with re factoring.

While this did make changing things and understanding the code a little tricky, I totally respect where this has come from, and what it is!

When it came out I used the sh*t out of it. I had dedicated bases that were transmission stations, and my Kol-orbit bases gave me a round-trip constant cycle of any signal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever- I am in college now, and since I started getting into some of the more specialized courses, such as Signal Propagation Planning and Communication Relay Logic, I found that my game became too much like my classes, and it, well, stopped being as fun- it felt like homework.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I made this patch. It seems to work, and I am thankful that the creator of this mod made it work, But I am also grateful that these partmodules were developed in such a way that I can keep the fun of the mods that I found and get some later ones set up in such a way that I can get the results I desire.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you, JDP, and Squad, for making this easy for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, you got to admit, the AeroProbe is awesome, and makes a great probe for atmos planets.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sHORTY","CreatedById":488,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-25T16:39:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJDP - \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould I make a suggestion to edit the changelogs into the first post, or at least a link to the newest changelog?
