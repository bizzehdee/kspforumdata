It\u0027s a long, ungainly stack of modules docked to one another with Senior Docking ports that I\u0027m decelerating into orbit around Jool to setup a Laythe encounter, where it will be disassembled and landed onto the surface piece by piece. At any rate, the 2.0 version of KJR turned this stack into something very similar in dynamics to the a child\u0027s foam noodle pool toy. Reverting to the 1.7 version (and reverting to my last quick save!) behaved properly.
