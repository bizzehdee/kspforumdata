Sometimes not even lining itself up with the docking axis. I can even park it in front of the target docking port and it will start thrusting long and hard away from the docking axis. My solution in times like that is to toggle the autopilot on and off and see if it starts docking correctly. Sometimes I have to repeat that a few times but eventually it will start to dock properly.

And that\u0027s definitely true most of the time but not when useLegacyAtmosphere = true, but when it\u0027s false (for Real Solar System) the pressure has no lower limit and is dependent on pressureCurve.
