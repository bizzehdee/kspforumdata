I use \u0022Extraplanetary Launchpads\u0022 and in 1.0.2 everything worked fine with that container out in space. But in 1.0.5 I can\u0027t build that container in space any longer since it requires the resource \u0022EVA Propellant\u0022, which I have no way of producing up there (at least that I know of, and Monopropellant will not do the trick it seems).\n\nI CAN, however, build and \u0022launch\u0022 that container on Kerbin, but it would be madness to fly it to Gilly just for a bit of EVA Propellant :-)\n\nCan somebody confirm this?

It definitely extends the possibilities of the game into a more comprehensive and joyful experience.  \n\nEven though I use it now for a few months already I only noticed it yesterday that when my Kerbal is on the surface of the Mun, he is not able to take off with its jetpack when there is too much load on his shoulders. First I supposed it is a bug introduced with 1.0.5 which I started evaluating yesterday, but then I understood that the effect was there already before and it physically makes sense. However I wonder how tiny amounts of mass lead to this effect - precisely, there seems to the a limit of 0.190 mass units on Mun - which is only a bit more than the kerbal with its suit alone (0.094).  \n\nIt would be a deal if the extra EVA-fuel tank would also provide some extra thrust to overcome this limitation. Or a separate booster pack.  \n\nIs there a possibility to tweak the thrust of an EVA suit in one of the config files?  \n\nAny feedback is welcome."},{"CreatedByName":"taniwha","CreatedById":57176,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-23T01:18:53Z","Content":"[B]Maestro22[/B]: I\u0027m not sure if your 190kg (yes, kg) is just the parts, or the total, but even 96kg extra is really quite a lot for those little jets to push. Mun is getting close to the limits for an unladen kerbal (not as close as Duna, true), and thus there just is not much leeway.  \n\nReally, you are better off accepting the challenge of how to carry that stuff from A to B on Mun. Some things to remember:  \n\n[list]  \n\n[\\*]You can attach ladders where you need them.  \n\n[\\*]Kerbals can often clamber over things. This makes pretty much anything you can attach useful for getting to high places.  \n\n[\\*]You can use the winches in KAS to lift (or even drag) heavy stuff).  \n\n[\\*]The above is actually surprisingly fun:)  \n\n[/list]  \n\nJust yesterday I took a kerbal from 50km above Minmus to the surface carrying the electric screwdriver, the mallet from EL, and 20 survey stakes (also EL). It took three tries to get her down safely: first try, misjudged vertical acceleration and plowed into the ground. Second try, ran out of fuel and plowed into the ground (saw it coming, tried to rotate so she was head down, but just that was enough to exhaust the fuel and she just continued spinning... splat). Third try worked well: she grabbed the ladder on the base with just a puff remaining in her tanks :) (yes, precision EVA landing). Also, carrying the screwdriver and 2 connector end-points just 6km on Minmus proved to be rather iffy for her tanks, but it was all very fun."},{"CreatedByName":"Maestro22","CreatedById":147697,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-23T12:38:28Z","Content":"[quote name=\u0027taniwha\u0027]  \n\n[LIST]  \n\n[\\*]You can use the winches in KAS to lift (or even drag) heavy stuff).   \n\n[/LIST]  \n\n[/QUOTE]  \n\nYes, this is probably the main point which I missed until now.
