For typical users this update adds the ability to have Kerballed command pods increase the recovery modifier from (default) 75% up to 100% of stock (just like the last update did for probe cores).

There are two Events exposed by the API, RecoverySuccessEvent and RecoveryFailureEvent. Whenever a stage is recovered, all the methods listening to RecoverySuccessEvent are invoked with the Vessel and a Dictionary\u0026lt;string, int\u0026gt; containing the part names and quantity. The same goes for stage recovery failure, but with the RecoveryFailureEvent. The listening methods must be of the type \u0022void\u0022. The wrapper contains methods for adding your listeners to or removing them from the events without requiring a hard dependency on StageRecovery. There\u0027s a link on the front page to the wrapper class. Kerbal Construction Time currently uses the API to let SR do all of the recovery processing and then just uses the returned parts for itself. The whole vessel is returned though, so you could do anything on it that you could with a normal vessel passed to the onVesselDestroy stock event.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA note on future support:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven if I don\u0027t try to compete directly with DebRefund, this mod lets me add a lot of things that I would like to have optional in KCT but don\u0027t feel comfortable adding directly to KCT.

I\u0027ve got a couple fun ideas I want to implement (powered landings, Deadly Reentry support, in-game checker for if stages will pass recovery tests), that would enhance the KCT experience but would also work nicely on their own in this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jarin","CreatedById":71395,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-22T19:28:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENothing wrong with different flavors of similar mods anyway.

I received 46.1% return on a solid fuel rocket booster. The information below says \u0022Stock Module used. Terminal velocity of 3.85 (10 needed).\u0022\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m assuming that means it was okay, and needed to be below the terminal velocity of 10? Or does it mean I need to have it land at 10 for a higher return?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s supposed to say \u0026lt;10 needed, so yes everything is ok. For some reason the less than sign doesn\u0027t appear, but the greater than sign works. Higher returns are gotten by using a probe core or kerballed command pod (make sure you enable Kerbal recovery if use a command pod) and by dropping the stages closer to KSC. You get a flat return percentage (modified by distance) as long as the velocity is below 10.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jarin","CreatedById":71395,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-24T14:52:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EProbably thinks you\u0027re opening a tag.
