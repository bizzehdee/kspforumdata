Had I deleted notes 0.4 completely before installing 0.7, that would not have happened. In the end it seems like old files were kept, while new files did not go where they should have. I actually let an automated mod manager do that update the first time, so the different structure of the mod versions may have caused some garbling. When I resorted to do the install by hand (the second time) all went well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Papa_Joe","CreatedById":10788,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-23T04:03:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022agises\u0022 data-cite=\u0022agises\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHi Papa_Joe,\u003Cp\u003EYeah forgot to mention that, but cause I think it will not be a problem as I was mixing old and new files and dirs during development lol.
