Especially the 1.25m and 2.5m versions, I think I\u0027ll figure the 3.75m to fill the same role. So they\u0027ll all have the same balance philosophy vs the USI drives with that in mind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I want to see what RoverDude does with the USI ones, so I\u0027m going to balance the ZZZ versions against those for the in-system warp drives. So, for default it\u0027ll be for stock system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- For interstellar travel or different scaled solar systems MM patches will be needed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I don\u0027t think there is a good way through configs to have a warp drive use non-trivial amounts of fuel in system if it\u0027s capable of interstellar travel as well. And each interstellar mod is implemented different so I can\u0027t even write a somewhat universal MM patch for that case (and I don\u0027t use them personally). One idea would be the more gravitation you feel total, the more fuel you need - so warping at 300km orbit of Eve would require more fuel than warping at 300km orbit of Duna, both due to the gravitational differences of the planets and proximity to the star. Could also have it that the ISP stays the same but the top warp speed scales with that total felt gravitation. I can think of at least one physics reason it may be so such a thing might happen, and either would work well for gameplay I think. Those would be the best ways I could think of to do a one size fits all warp-drive, such a change would be well after adding in these new models next weekend and only if RoverDude is on board as that would need to be a global change and one I\u0027m not entirely sure how to implement off the top of my head.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WPENG730","CreatedById":97260,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T23:28:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022helaeon\u0022 data-cite=\u0022helaeon\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWPENG730 do you have Regolith installed too and the current version?
