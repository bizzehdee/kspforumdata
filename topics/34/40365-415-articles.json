Though still comparably cheap, additional reading on the subject only makes in marginally cheaper than a comparable chemical rocket. Thus, a reasonable cost for a 1.25 meter receiver would be 600-700, which when combined with the 100-200 cost of the Thermal Rocket Nozzle, should add up to a cost of approximately 800-900 for a 1.25 meter Microwave Thermal Rocket propulsion system- placing its price at jsut less than the LV-T30 (costs 850), which is an example of a medium-cost (between the LV-T45 and the LV-909) stock-game chemical rocket...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep in mind that the Microwave Thermal Rocket won\u0027t operate in the same thrust range without a jaw-droppingly expensive external power source, however.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently the 1.25 meter version of this dirt-cheap nozzle, \u003Cstrong\u003ETHAT DOES NOTHING BUT PROVIDE A DUMB SURFACE FOR A LOW-TEMPERATURE STREAM OF HYDROGEN TO PUSH AGAINST\u003C/strong\u003E is a jaw-droppingly expensive 25,000 Funds to purchase. \u003Cstrong\u003EIf funds are equivalent to dollars,\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.silverpriceoz.com/silver-price-per-kilo/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E it would be cheaper if it were made of solid silver\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E.\u003C/strong\u003E (400 kg in silver would only cost about $2685)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is saying nothing of the cost of the Microwave Thermal Receiver (which receives the power, and should be modestly-priced), the Microwave Transceiver (which beams the power, and should be expensive), or the power source (which should be exorbitantly expensive). \u003Cstrong\u003EThis is just the one, cheapest, component of the whole setup that costs more than TWO of my current low-cost (heavily SRB-based) Career-game 1.25 meter launch vehicles at the KSC, WITH PAYLOAD (each about 12K- keep in mind that\u0027s for 5K Delta-V, vs. 10K to orbit IRL), and more than a half-dozen low-end Contracts.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EA single, small, low-temperature exhaust nozzle with no thrust vectoring shouldn\u0027t cost more than an entire rocket.
