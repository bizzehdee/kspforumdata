I currently house my Zoxygene and Electricity mods in a 1-3 meter adapter, a 3 meter bulkhead, attach my crap to the bulkhead, then skin it in the half walls so it has lines and matches the rest (albeit it\u0027s white so it sticks out a bit) then bulkhead and adapter to finish the look of it being a \u0027module\u0027, fits in flawlessly, I\u0027d recolor it myself (those parts, renamed) and give it to you but I don\u0027t know how.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7.

Make a nice dock just for a perma-docked Soyuz ODS. I currently use an Odin, then I jerry rig a Zoxygene drill bit on an explosive bolt on the side so it looks like a fuel/elec/air line mounting, along with one of those decouplers which are two rings with exposed metal zig zagging between them.

Payload management, using remote control, allow the movement of individual delivery modules so we can send stuff back to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. Stuff to do, experimental modules, things that take time to complete (simply have a bar that runs up to 100% over time) that require things like a solar panel, a radiator panel, a nucular reactor (PLEASE recolor the existing one so the gold foil wrap looks gold) and **** that we can add into the element in 4. (or at least make it a size we can make the above explained module to house, so varying sizes). Make the experimental modules a size that fits inside the current used shuttles (Odyssey and Intrepid, I believe.) so we can deliver them and deorbit them either using the payload management system, or using shuttles again. Thus the experimental modules will need to be able to be captured / docked with the space station, and detached from and grabbed by the shuttle. You may have to make a payload arm for the shuttle that uses cheaty automation to grab and load it and grab and unload / attach it. Experiments could include growing corn in space, anti matter / dark matter discovery, particle accelerators, how long a Kerbal can survive inside a 20 gallon drum full of snakes, all kinds of wonderful things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you can attain even four of these eight things you will, without a doubt, have the most popular and in demand mod in this game. You are SO close to amazing success, but you seem to have lost a bit of steam. I truly hope these ideas help you continue you work. Your mod will, if you can complete all 8, become the only real purpose for playing this game besides the first few \u0027lol space\u0027 exploring dilly dallies (you have no idea how long I\u0027ve wanted to use that in a sentence, damn that felt good, dilly dally.) and give us a reason to keep coming back to your page on kerbal.net!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hereby forfiet all claim of right to the above suggestions for free use to anyone willing to adapt such suggestions. I can explain any one of them in great detail should it be required. I am, however, keeping a few things to myself as I am looking for fellow developers to get together with to create \u0027The Reality Mod\u0027 which will hopefully work well with this chaps space station should he manage to hit six or seven of those eight suggestions, TRM will hopefully make this beta feel like a finished game with purpose, missions, and micromanagement (including fully functioning life support!) so stay tuned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the interim, please provide adequate cheering, peer pressure, and begging that OP create the add on\u0027s I have suggested, especially reskinning the 3 meter adapter, bulkhead, and half walls so we can add other modules crap to our stations, and ESPECIALLY the experimental modules.
