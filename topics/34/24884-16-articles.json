I was attempting to deliver a life support module to a base, just the large recycler and a large oxygen tank as a single unit. I was planning to just plonk it on the ground next to the base and connect it up using the KAS mod. However when I winched the module out of the delivery craft and lowered it onto the ground it just sunk into the terrain! I thought that maybe it was a KAS related problem so I did some tests. I made a small craft with stock parts that just held the life support module under it, when I decoupled the life support module it sunk into the ground. I did this test at KSC and on the Mun with the same result. I then replaced the life support module with two standard fuel tanks and did the same drop action and those rested on the ground just fine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo there seems to be an issue with these parts not being able to be placed on the terrain. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other odd thing I noticed, not sure if this is intended function was that when I hit critical CO2 levels and a kerbal \u0027died\u0027 he just reappeared back in the available crew at KSC.
