I haven\u0027t tried the shrouds with any of the stock panels (that do not allow surface attachment.)\n\nAlso, gravity may cause the shrouds to pull down and hang on the panels, instead of floating safely away. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 4 hours ago, VenomousRequiem said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Wow that is gorgeous... \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Yes, [@Tristonwilson12](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/136353-tristonwilson12/), RP as in Real Plumes.
