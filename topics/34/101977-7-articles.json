Since many RL data are not available with ASET or RPM MFDs stuff like dynamic pressure, Mach, flap/spoil state and thrust vs throttle. I don\u0027t know if its up your alley, but a nice screen like the old B9 APFD:ADI shown [here](https://bitbucket.org/Taverius/b9-aerospace/wiki/Multi_Function_Display_Manual). Otherwise I would really appreciate some gauges for info not available on a MFD page. IVA is looking great!\n\nI dream of the day someone integrates BDArmory radar stuff into a MFD page, but a plugin would have to be made for them to talk. \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-11T06:26:11Z\u0022 title=\u002204/11/2016 06:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 11, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Svm420**"},{"CreatedByName":"martinezfg11","CreatedById":59995,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-11T15:05:31Z","Content":"I actually was thinking of making a prop that controls the BDArmory weapon manager.
