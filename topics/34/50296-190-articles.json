I\u0027m repeating the test both with and without FAR to see exactly at what angle of attack things stop being occluded. (with stock, it happens somewhere between AoA 20-25 degrees except that the parachute stops being occluded much earlier)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a suspicion that your orientation might not be dead on. You\u0027re not using MechJeb so that means you\u0027re using stock SAS so you\u0027re keeping it oriented manually? (with MJ you can maintain orientation of exactly 0.0 AoA with very little electrical usage because stock SAS sucks and MJ doesn\u0027t)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EEdit:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E Ok, with FAR installed, occlusion starts to end at AoA 3 degrees. That shouldn\u0027t be taken as an absolute figure; it could be more or it could be less for various parts on the stack. Check your angle of attack during reentry. FAR has an option to display that. Click the FAR button then Flt Data. Look for Angle of Attack and Sideslip Angle. The further those are from 0, the more exposed your parts are going to be. I\u0027m betting that\u0027s why you\u0027re seeing heating and it\u0027s probably by design as FAR is supposed to be a more realistic aerodynamic model. Believe it or not, in real life, you wouldn\u0027t see 100% occlusion on those parts either. Hot gasses would be slipping up the sides and scorching them. Even hitting the sides of the capsule, though heating would not be as severe because the shockwave expands and cools once it slips past the blunt end but even the sides have to be shielded to some extent.

That\u0027s interesting about the ladder, I wouldn\u0027t think it would matter much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think another factor is that the capsules (because of their shape) have less surface area, which affects skin mass which affects skin thermal mass.

That doesn\u0027t sound too OP. In your case I don\u0027t think it would help that much except to delay the inevitable. You could also add back some of the ablator that you removed (5-10 pts would probably get by) but that won\u0027t save the science part. I think ultimately you need a bigger shield, or use an aeroshell made of Procedural Fairing and add some ablator to it. (e-dog\u0027s fairing parts, not the stock ones which throw errors when shields are added to them). Just right click the fairing piece and you\u0027ll see you can add ablator to it.

It only gets worse the closer I get to actually achieving orbit. I just had a craft make it about 1/4 of the way there and was travelling around 5500 when it hit the atmosphere and Val just instantly went smoosh.
