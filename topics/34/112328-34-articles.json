Perhaps I assumed too much tone from our miscommunication.\n\nIf I write, \u0022the mod \u0027BackgroundResources\u0027\u0022, though, I won\u0027t ever mean the mod \u0022BackgroundProcessing\u0022. I will always mean the set of folders, DLLs, and module manager configs named in such a way (BackgroundResources subfolder of gamedata, BackgroundResources.dll, \u0060FOR[BackgroundResources]\u0060, etc.) as to constitute the BackgroundResources mod. I still disagree that it\u0027s not a separate mod on that naming basis, on it\u0027s separate licensing, and because it is included in other mods (at least TACLS, no?). I finally located the source code for BackgroundResources, also. I failed at a combination of google searching and looking at your repos and did not expect it to be at REPOSoftTechKSPUtils.

I myself used to think \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E was a bad way to get mods but reversed that position over time, so I\u0027m sympathetic to modders and users with criticisms AND creators\u0027 rights to support those distribution methods they choose.

Just wanted to ask if your mods are backwards compatible? For example this mod, DeepFreeze, has 0.31 version with KSP 1.12.0-1.12.99 in .version file and 0.30 version with 1.11.0-1.11.99 in .version file. Should I strictly use v0.30 for my KSP 1.11.2, or the latest one is fine as well? Same question is for your other mods. And there are some cases (i.e. JSIAdvTransparentPods) when you only have versions for, lets say, 1.12 and 1.10/1.9/1.8. Which one is preferable for 1.11, newer or older?\n\nThanks.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-03-09T22:11:16Z\u0022 title=\u002203/09/2022 10:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 9, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Miruzuki**"},{"CreatedByName":"JPLRepo","CreatedById":114736,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-03-27T00:43:21Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 3/10/2022 at 8:04 AM, Miruzuki said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Hi [@JPLRepo](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/114736-jplrepo/).

This is because generally a verison of a mod is compiled against a version of KSPs DLLs. So it may be using code that is introduced or changed in KSP for a particular version.  \n\nBottom line is: You should use the version of the mod to match the version of KSP you are using."},{"CreatedByName":"mmb300","CreatedById":219039,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-04-28T00:03:18Z","Content":"Hey, I\u0027m expiriencing some issues with deep freeze, it\u0027s nothing game breaking but the ingame console is getting spammed with \u0022part not found\u0022 messeges (refer to the picture), I\u0027m not sure if this is capable of causing any sort of errors with the mod or if it can cause any lag/performance issues, if not then I don\u0027t have anything to worry about, but in the case that is causes the latter issues is there something that can be done to fix it?
