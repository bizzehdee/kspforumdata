CrewRoster changed names in the assembly and he\u0027s getting a TypeLoadException during SpaceCenterManager::Start() because the old binary isn\u0027t compatible with KSP 0.24. TaranisElsu will need to update his code for the CrewRoster changes (I hear it\u0027s called KerbalRoster now) before TACLS will start up correctly.\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a little deceptive, because a lot of the TACLS functionality does appear to start up correctly, but there is at least the one definite incompatibility there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope that helps!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"enneract","CreatedById":56759,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-18T08:33:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYep, 0.9 Pre2 does not work in .24.
