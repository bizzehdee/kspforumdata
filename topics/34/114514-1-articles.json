Ever thinked that there should be problems on the bases? Have you ever wanted to scan, then explore and after that make the actual base?** Now you got this:\n\nThis is a Contract Configurator contract pack for base constuction and mantenaince. This CP is made for letting the player build a base on any body and then expand it and maintain it. The stock base contracts are disabled. All the vessels listed as a base are going to be affected by the mantenaince contracts. Since the contracts doesn\u0027t need docking, just land very close to the core, MKS and KAS are supported. This also support SCANsat for the scanning contract. And USILS, TACLS and IFILS are supported for the life support contracts.\n\nThis is how a complete base look like: \n\n![screenshot0_zpsr7yohnsb.png](http://i1148.photobucket.com/albums/o574/CosmoBr0/screenshot0_zpsr7yohnsb.png)\n\nYou can clearly look at the rover and notice there are no phisical conections between the Base phases.\n\nThis had a [dev thread](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/124301).\n\nThis is a little summary of the contracts\n\n\u003E \n\u003E //Create Contracts\n\u003E \n\u003E 1.
