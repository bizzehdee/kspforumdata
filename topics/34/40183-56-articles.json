Added a Few Hotfixes to make an official Version change Name change in contract Mission Part name OrbitalResearch (this is only a contract name change vessels are STILL SAFE)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Added a few fixed to Stock ComSat Missions Got rid of time count and Passive Mission parts (passive mission no longer works)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Fixed Random Contracts Mid Years Large Orbital Mission for you get Max APA and Min PEA instead of Max APA and Min APA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Fixed a possible time bug with the time countdown. remember you can only do 1 timed mission at a time.. Not including Orbital Reserearch or roverResearch Both these types have own countdown timers. If your having issues with the timer its possible that the timer is set up for another mission. If you check your .sp file this line should read like this. timeStarted = -1 (thats a Minus 1 its important) if not then set it to -1 to restart the timer. Its not important if you don\u0027t do this. Just that if the timer is set to an older time (other mission not finished) the timer will continue from that time, and either give you an instant finish, or possible longer countdown then what current mission is. I will fix this at a later more extensive update.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELast thing I noticed and will get a fix for next update.. In the Mini Objective view you will see old objectives that have been completed still as RED.. This does not mean your objectives are not working.. Just the mini screen does not hide finished objectives yet.. So you can ignore those red objectives. The normal screen should show that they are done, with the hide Finished mission objectives.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022romie\u0022 data-cite=\u0022romie\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ethank you very much for you quick work i love this mod so much\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETell me if this update fixes the problem romie..

I know you said that not everything gets a debug line, but it looks like it does give out a debug line when it decides to use fuel.

It looks like it has debug lines commented out, so I\u0027m assuming those got looked at at some point, and that block of code is, in fact, running. However, I do notice that amt is set using \u0022Tools.GetValueDefault(r.resourceValues, \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#DD1144;\u0022\u003E\u0022amount\u0022\u003C/span\u003E, \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#009999;\u0022\u003E0.0\u003C/span\u003E)\u0022, but then in the debug line it\u0027s reported as \u0022\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#999988;\u0022\u003Er.amount\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u0022. It\u0027s possible that r.amount is just outdated, and the commented out debug code didn\u0027t get updated, but it looks highly suspect to me. Is it possible that amt is always set to the default of 0.0?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LORDPrometheus","CreatedById":61414,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-17T18:08:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk I\u0027m sure this has been asked before but do I have the option to enable this ONLY for some saves and leave others unaffected?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
