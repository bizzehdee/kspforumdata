With 1.0.4 downloaded, I started up KSP with no mods. I noticed right away that, even with the graphics settings turned down to the minimum, I was getting very poor performance. Mind you, my circa-2008 laptop (Dell XPS-M1530, 3GB RAM) didn\u0027t get me great performance even back in 0.24, but it was perfectly playable. Now, though, the lag was horrendous. I guess that the increased scope of the game has increased its RAM footprint since beta. The worst slowdowns happened whenever Kerbin was in view. When looking into the sky and when in the map screen, the framerate jumped dramatically.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI couldn\u0027t determine my FPS accurately (switching between situations that caused and relieved slowdowns, the debug-menu FPS counter did not respond much), but it was slow enough that I could actually count the frames myself. I estimated that during slowdowns, I was pulling a whopping 8 FPS. Yes, eight--not quite a slideshow, but it made launches take an unacceptably long amount of time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENonetheless, I wanted to play around with the new aero, parts, and other improvements made since beta, so I persevered despite the lag. Several launches later, when switching to the launchpad screen, the game crashed. I looked at the error log, and saw a familiar report: mono.dll caused an Access Violation (0xc0000005); 95% memory in use. I ran out of RAM. (I used to run into this issue with the Outer Planet Mod installed in beta.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack in 2008 when I got my laptop, there were real concerns that 64-bit Windows Vista would cause driver issues, so I opted for 32-bit Vista. I\u0027ve since come to regret this decision, especially when I found out that KSP\u0027s Unity has problems with 32-bit Windows and Dual-Core processors, which happens to be just my situation (Core-2 Duo). I happen to have a dual-boot installation of 64-bit Linux Mint, so I tried to run KSP under that OS. In addition to being 64-bit, Linux Mint has a comparatively small memory footprint, so there was more free RAM to go around. KSP launched successfully, and I had much more free RAM available. Unfortunately, it ran even slower than in Windows. Even navigating the title screen menu was painfully slow. I guess this is because, in Linux, Unity runs on a sort of emulation mode, and is thus slower.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother fix for the 32-bit Windows/Dual-Core issue is to make sure that extended ram support was turned on. After some investigation, I found out that it already was turned on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was about ready to give up on trying to play KSP again; I thought that my laptop just wouldn\u0027t cut it anymore with the newest KSP. There was one last hope, though: Active Texture Management. Recent posts in this thread generally say that it doesn\u0027t do much for stock KSP, so I didn\u0027t think that it would do anything. It was worth a shot, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EATM installed and a couple minutes later, KSP was up and running. This time, it was smooth as butter! I played for a few hours today, and thus far, there are no more issues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERecent posts say that ATM doesn\u0027t do much for stock KSP. I\u0027m here to report that, in my case, this assessment cannot be further from the truth. For me, the difference was night and day.
