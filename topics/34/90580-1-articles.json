The payload bay is one of a few changes that I\u0027ve made to the Dream Chaser (all of them optional... you CAN build and set it up to fly true to the prototype if accuracy is your thing.) because I want this to be a mod that people can actually use - rather than being like some of the awesome mods on here that realistically capture every detail of a real world craft... but don\u0027t really have any \u0027playability\u0027 - so you launch them once to marvel at the model... then either delete it or let it slow down your game load times forever... but never really PLAY with it.

This is lower detail, as I wanted to spend CPU cycles and memory on the ship you actually fly all mission, not on the launcher you discard in three minutes. But it\u0027s there, and both stages terminate at 2.5m so they\u0027re useable with other payloads... though you\u0027ll probably have to have an adapter fairing of some sort for the upper stage, because the top of the centaur isn\u0027t flat.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe other little parts to make it work\u003C/strong\u003E - wings, tail, landing skid and wheels, a rear docking port (true to the prototype design) OMS engines and a 2.5m adapter.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve now added integrated airbrakes.

My Atlas V has increased gimbal range to let you counter act the instability instead of fins (just like the real thing) so if you launch this on stock parts, you may need quite a few fins at the base of the rocket. \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003EThe IVA requires: (not necessary if you don\u0027t want to IVA)\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003ERaster Prop Monitor - \u003C/span\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/57603-0-25-RasterPropMonitor-putting-the-A-in-your-IVA-(v0-18-3)-8-Oct\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/57603-0-25-RasterPropMonitor-putting-the-A-in-your-IVA-(v0-18-3)-8-Oct\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Ship Requires:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirespitter.

I highly recommend planning your missions and adjusting the fuel in these two stages appropriately. As it loads, the launch stack will put the Dreamer into orbit with aproximately 400 m/s left in the Centaur, and 1100m/s in the ship itself. You could make a mun orbit and return with that... If you fully fill up the Centaur, you can almost make the Trans Munar Injection burn on the Centaur alone, before you ditch it. If you fill up both tanks AND add the LFO payload bay module... you can BARELY make a complete Duna transfer, aerocapture, escape and return. If these delta-v numbers are too high for you... feel free to take some of the fuel out in the VAB to tune it to how you want to play! \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003EThere\u0027s an electric generator built into the capsule.
