However, CKAN already does a truly admirable job managing nearly arbitrary archive formats and configurations, collating it into a form that is relatively uniform to use and making it installable. However, in order to do that, it needs metadata that will tell it how to digest a particular file into something it can install. It\u0027s only a computer program after all, it can\u0027t follow instructions the same way humans can. And you get a lot of mods that use entirely arbitrary conventions wrt. their download files and where they\u0027re installed, what is installed when and how to do it. A great strength of for example npm is that the packaging is relatively uniform - generally you adapt your library to npm,, not the other way around. Here, rather than trying to herd cats until modders can agree on a package format, the attempt was made to adapt to the myriad formats conventions adopted already. It works most of the time, which is nothing short of amazing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wizisi2k","CreatedById":63864,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T18:11:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am having a problem with your application.

CKAN is all about consistency and taking control of a mod you manually installed isn\u0027t as easy as one might think. CKAN need the mod to be exactly as it would be if CKAN installed it to handle it and it also needs a way to autodetect it (which is done using ModuleManager naming scheme). All mods don\u0027t have identifiers = MM names and as such can\u0027t be located. Our spec only defines that an identifier _should_ be the same as the MM name and as such CKAN can miss out on a lot of mods. The plugin for migration by nlight can fix some mods but not all, same limitation with MM syntax.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe best experience with CKAN is always to start with a clean install and handle all modinstalls with CKAN. pjf has mentioned that one thing he\u0027d like to have working better is the ability for CKAN to take over manually installed mods but this is something that probably won\u0027t be at the top of the list right now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Metanolo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Metanolo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHello guys, and many thanks to whoever has been supporting/developping this mod manager, great and so much needed job!\u003Cp\u003EMy problem is game crashes on start if I install Astronomer\u0027s pack mod.

However, there have also been cases where third-parties have added CKAN manifests for mods, and this has been upsetting and/or disconcerting to the modder making it, or worse, has been done poorly so that the modder has had to field support requests because it did not install the mod correctly. It\u0027s one of those situations where it would be ideal if modders came on board of their own accord, but if they choose not to, there\u0027s going to be a risk of problems one way or another. Many package managers have faced this and still do - JavaScript development (my profession) has its share, especially given that there are multiple competing package managers of differing features and quality out there (npm, bower, etc.). It does not seem to have a good solution, other than telling people to be polite and to not step on toes.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022John FX\u0022 data-cite=\u0022John FX\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIn the spirit of reducing modders time being taken up with CKAN related issues I would think the best way forward is to automate the process as much as possible so modders don\u0027t need to come on board but this would put the onus onto the devs of CKAN to write code to do that. The integration with KerbalStuff is a good example.

However, CKAN already does a truly admirable job managing nearly arbitrary archive formats and configurations, collating it into a form that is relatively uniform to use and making it installable. However, in order to do that, it needs metadata that will tell it how to digest a particular file into something it can install. It\u0027s only a computer program after all, it can\u0027t follow instructions the same way humans can. And you get a lot of mods that use entirely arbitrary conventions wrt. their download files and where they\u0027re installed, what is installed when and how to do it. A great strength of for example npm is that the packaging is relatively uniform - generally you adapt your library to npm,, not the other way around. Here, rather than trying to herd cats until modders can agree on a package format, the attempt was made to adapt to the myriad formats conventions adopted already. It works most of the time, which is nothing short of amazing.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis discussion is good even though an outburst of sorts started it. I\u0027ll be the first to point out what an abnormous pain in the behind it is for us, esspecielly those of us maintaining metadata, that not all error reports are posted in this thread (or in an ideal world, on github). Browsing every single modthread looking for CKAN issues is impossible and this is also why mods which are used by metadata maintainers are often the most updated ones since we have a personal interest in those mods and therefore read their respective forum threads. Some mod-makers also have their own liasons of sorts into CKAN staff/contributors meaning they poke that person when something isn\u0027t working and we fix it as painlessly and fast as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course some modmakers will for various reasons not want to associate themselves or their mods with CKAN, which is their right, but might see their mods added by third parties when that wish isn\u0027t known by CKAN staff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA solution which was proposed earlier in this thread and peaked both my own and dev interest was the ability to add a maintainer field to mod metadata where it can be pointed out who to hassle when stuff isn\u0027t working. If this was easily available in both the clients and our metadata it might lessen the load on mod-developers a lot since people adding mods will be the ones responsible for making sure they work. However the same people spamming \u0022omg when 1.0 compatibility !!11!!elventyone!\u0022 for the umpteenth in threads will probably not care so some overhead will always exist. If the solution with a maintainer field sounds acceptable I\u0027ll see if I can find an issue report and if none exists I\u0027ll create one and bump the severity a few notches and see how hard it would be to get it fixed. However updating the metadata (we\u0027re currently indexing ~600 modules) won\u0027t be done over night even if this is added.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for automation only so much can be done right now, we do get updates from Kerbalstuff when new mods are added which desire to be on CKAN and we do our very best to get them onto CKAN in a timely manner. The files we generate are written in JSON though so a web frontend for adding them is far from impossible if someone feels like writing one. Lately a lot of discussion on irc and, to some degree, github have been about improving infrastructure and creating effective workflows and improved processes. We\u0027re currently in an ongoing process of making sweeping changes in how our github repositories are set up which will free up devtime and make it easier for us to field error reports and provide faster and better support.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen it comes to maintaining metadata and making sure it\u0027s up to date the best thing would be if all users experiencing issues posted them onto github or atleast to this thread. Therefore if we want to work ourselves away from this problem I kindly ask each and every person reading to this to *please* point everyone reporting mods having CKAN issues, no matter how small, to github or atleast to this thread so the right people are blamed when stuff breaks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022johnsonwax\u0022 data-cite=\u0022johnsonwax\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMechJeb has been updated to 2.5.1\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPretty sure there\u0027s a request to add it on github but I\u0027m awaiting a small fix before it can be merged, aka it\u0027ll be out soon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MDBenson\u0022 data-cite=\u0022MDBenson\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIs there a central place to report repository issues that doesn\u0027t require a separate login (i.e. not on Github, as a lot of people love to whine about not having accounts there)?
