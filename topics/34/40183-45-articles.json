So the only thing I still need to lift from Kerbin is the fuel. And once I get some kethane mining facilities set up, that will go away too.

And these vessels are usually very cheap because they dont need the delta v you would waste to take off from kerbin (around 4500 m/s). Right now, MCE only charges you for orbiting the infrastrucuture, not for any assembling or further materials (unless you take off cannisters of parts, if you mine ore and smelt it, MCE cant charge you for that). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now, a analogy would be you setting up a factory, government taxing you for doing so, but no futher taxing from that point onwards, and you dont pay anything for materials or labour. In fact, a combination of kethane and EL allows you to fully build and gear vessels in outer-space, trow in TAC Life support and BioMass, and you can get everything you need from places like minmmus. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe best solution would be some \u0022assembling cost\u0022 at these launchpads, altough MCE cant do that very well because of plugin interactions and the way EL creates a new vessel, in Docked mode if i am not wrong\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ph34rb0t","CreatedById":4291,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-23T20:11:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022malkuth\u0022 data-cite=\u0022malkuth\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENow that I think about this, I should fix this.

I have a very modular approach to playing the game because if you load too many parts you\u0027re going to run out of memory. So I have a special \u0022Flight\u0022 folder I use to fill up GameData with everything but parts and interiors. Then I have folders for each ship that contain the parts that I copy over into the GameData folder. So I\u0027m only loading the parts I need to play the ships that are active in the game (plus a folder for any debris). When building I load the game with all the parts but they mostly use reduce/compressed textures and I lower the texture resolution of the game overall to prevent crashes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, when you research a new tech level you get all the parts unlocked - parts you have not yet used to build anything with. So since I can load a version of the game with only parts I have used, when I do so the game no longer considers me owning the parts that are not included. So when I switch back to my building version, all the parts that I unlocked have now reverted back to being unowned and sport their buy-in price (not all parts have this field filled out). Now I can click on the ones I want to research them and make note of their cost. After I\u0027ve built my new ship and have to reload the game with my hi-res flight profile, before I do so I edit the *.sp file for my career found in the MCE Plugins/PluginData/MissoinController folder and subtract the cost of the parts I purchased.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, a good deal of manual work but it happens to fit well with the modular parts system I have, and gives me another way to spend money to slightly increase the amount of management I need to keep in mind when trying out new rocket designs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: easier way of doing things.

New way Mission Goals are saved. Now when You finish a mission any missiongoal that belongs to that Mission will be deleted from the .sp File (this is to help with Mission Goals not being completed when doing missions again) Please note there is still one issue that\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emight happen that I was not able to address. And that is if you do a mission that can only be done once... Finish say only 2 of 3 goals of mission, then die. Then start over. You will have issues doing this mission with new vessel and its ID. In this case Read Number 3.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Added a New Button to Settings. Clear All Mission Goals. This will clear every single mission goal in the .sp file. This will help if you have issues completing goals that might be stuck looking at Different Vessel ID.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Added a New Button to Settings. Clear All Completed Missions. If for some strange reason you want to do all single type mission goals over again. Pushing this button will completly wipe everysingle Mission Ever done in your .sp file Forever (will also clear missions from Manifest so be careful) It will keep all other parts of space program intact. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Added the ability to go back to Current Mission pack. No longer have to reload the Packs anymore. (yes the button is back sorry for getting rid of it)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. New Tabs added to the Finances screen. Other payments and Other Cost. these buttons bring in the ability to see what other mods might be charging you if they are using the new API. Read part 1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. The dates now Read like year 1 Day 5.. In all manifest now. Before it was reversed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. Added the BootStrap Missions to MCE default Downloads. I like most of these missions and decided to add them to the pack. I will not support them though. I did get rid of some of the launchgoals though (not all of them though)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Why.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow come I didn\u0027t fix the missiongoals with missions that can only be done once? To be honest I could not get it to work. (yes the code to delete the Goals is easy) the part I had issues with is that originally I had the idea of having a Screen pop up that would allow you to Delete all goals and do mission over.. Or Keep the goals and use revert or QuickSave.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way I was calling this was with OnDestroy.. And or ActiveVessel... and all kinds of other options. The problem is that either something is wrong with active vessel (even isactivevessel) or I was doing something wrong. But anyway the pop up was coming from even parts that were staged.. Staged parts being destroyed. And it was really annoying having to clear the Pop Up every second.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf any other modders have any ideas on best way to make the pop up happen only When the Player Vessel is destroyed.. And Am open to suggestions. The code is pretty much still intact to get this working. I just need to figure out how to make it pop with ONLY the player vessel is destroyed.. And not everything around it, or that use to be attached to it.
