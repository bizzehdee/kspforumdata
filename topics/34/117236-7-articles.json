Shape is not simulated (straight bottom vs curved top of wing) neither is modeled in game. On higher speeds it is of less influence, compared to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\nSo, you need to design wings to push plane down instead of up. You might need more than one wing surface for that, to avoid flipng of craft. Also be careful with downforce, too much and your wheels will explode."},{"CreatedByName":"jrodriguez","CreatedById":130617,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-18T18:21:40Z","Content":"Hi [@Crzyrndm](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/92871-crzyrndm/) .
