The dll is version 1.8.4.1. If any mod which uses the mumech dll is added after the camera mod, it could well be that the dll is overwritten by version 1.8.4.0. The camera won\\\u0027t work with that version. The dll has to be added to the plugins directory, the part to the parts directory of KSP. (Use JSGME if possible).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAltering the cfg in the way described in a previous post in this thread will add a \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Ecommand pod\u003C/span\u003E camera, without you having to add the camera part.
