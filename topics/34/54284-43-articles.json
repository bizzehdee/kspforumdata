I\u0027m glad you\u0027re getting the chance to have fun with KSP since I use your mod to have fun with it all the time. Just as long as you know about it. You\u0027re really good at tracking these things down. Thanks!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS: I got my Pol base to build a ship by loading the base from the tracking station and pressing time accel before it jumped it down to the actual surface. Then, while in time accel, I clicked finalize and it built it properly while jumping back to 1x. This only worked once, though, and I forgot a Kethane tank on that ship. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
