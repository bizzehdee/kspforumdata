The higher your temperature, the higher Mach number you can aerodynamically expand your exhaust up to. It\u0027s variable specific impulse because for a given electrical energy input, you can vary the temperature of the \u0022combustion\u0022 chamber, more mass at lower temperature for high thrust, or less mass at higher temperature for high ISP.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K3-Chris","CreatedById":61664,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-28T12:42:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022optimusjamie\u0022 data-cite=\u0022optimusjamie\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m about to install this, but I\u0027ve already got some B9 planes on my career save.
