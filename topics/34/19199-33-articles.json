That said, ISS will soon (I hope) be re-released, then (maybe) updated with a better, Infernal Robotics-based truss on a latter date. HOME3 had some serious issues, but I\u0027ve already fixed a large amount of them (not all, though, the crew vehicle is still barely usable). I\u0027m not giving any dates yet, though.

Could someone send it my way? It might be useful to update those, too, while we\u0027re at it.

The animation are even beyond me. Ill dig through my old mods and see if I can find the patch you are talking about. I do remember downloading it and I never delete the parts. If I cant find them Ill just zip the ones I have working on my own version of the game.
