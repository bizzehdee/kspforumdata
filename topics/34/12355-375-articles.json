The problem manifests itself when using only RCS to control vehicle orientation, wherein it will turn to the appropriate direction and then sit there blasting RCS fuel out of all of it\u0027s thrusters indefinitely until either RCS is turned off (leading to the vehicle drifting off of the desired orientation), or time warp is engaged.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve come to the general conclusion that the issue rests somewhere in the interaction between Mechjeb, Real Fuels, and ModuleRCSFX, as the latter two both affect the general characteristics of the RCS thrusters. That being said, I\u0027m at a total loss as to how to get around the issue. Yesterday, I spent about 2 hours tweaking the settings in the attitude adjustment page while trying to follow \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/49381-Mechjeb-How-to-make-SASS-chill-out-stop-wasting-RCS-and-shaking-things-apart\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis guide\u003C/a\u003E, and, while I was able to significantly reduce the amount of overusage, I\u0027ve been unable to completely stop it and the changes seem to have introduced the new issue of Mechjeb constantly overshooting the desired orientation (by a little or a lot depending on the situation) and oscillating back and forth slowly. Noticing some mentions of RCS adjustments, I\u0027ve also upgraded to the newest stable dev build, which seems to have helped a little, but still leaves my craft oscillating in space if I try to use only RCS to control their attitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there some trick that I\u0027m not getting here?
