I had some ATM issues when I first tried it. However, after looking more into the problem I found out it was poor installation of my mods that created ATM issues. I found that if a mod is dependent upon another mod to work, that is when there is potential for hangups. Double check all your installs, if you already haven\u0027t. If you still have a problem, come back to the thread with a mod list and possibly your error log to get better help than just stating a vague issue.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thesonicgalaxy","CreatedById":71406,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-03T06:23:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Brownhair2\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Brownhair2\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI downloaded ATM; it freezes when it gets to Jool\u0027s aurora texture \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes it crash or is it not doing anything when it reaches it?
