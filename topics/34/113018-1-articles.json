Now we\u0027ve expanded our line of technology and engines to include adaptations of Nazari1382\u0027s Aurora Atomic Thruster part, nil2work\u0027s Retro Future Planes parts, dtobi\u0027s Asteroid Cities parts, and various of Zzz\u0027s parts.\n\n**This shows all the parts the mod used to only have, it currently has a full set of comprehensive components.**\n\n![C09349900C3B54F79F010FE4EA4AAC1CB7449E41](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/510377980969397484/C09349900C3B54F79F010FE4EA4AAC1CB7449E41/)\n\n**Long ranged designed for high speed aerocaptures, the Fafner Descent Vessel.**\n\n![34725A2B76299D1DB97A214665249F5BAD5AF061](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/634230361582613777/34725A2B76299D1DB97A214665249F5BAD5AF061/)\n\n**CRAFT FILE DOWNLOAD LINK:** [**http://kerbalx.com/Carbonjvd/Fafner-Descent-Vessel**](http://kerbalx.com/Carbonjvd/Fafner-Descent-Vessel)\n\n**Massive IPV meant to transport small vessels and modules within its cargo bays to any destination.

We now also have a wide range of parts that utilize the exotic reaches of magnetic fields and dust, yes dust! Our scientists and witch doctors have devised ways to make dust useful like getting xenon out of it or compressing it into ore, which is actually useful. For our line of magnetic fields research, mostly from our bored co-workers playing with the fridge magnets in the break room, we\u0027ve figured out how harness their power as an ablative to keep systems cool! How cool is that?! Thanks to some serious work with an unmentioned scientist, we\u0027ve devised even more ways to get power from various resources, nuclear power here we come!\n\n**I\u0027m sold, so what parts does this pack actually have?**\n\nPassive Intakes for collecting compressed atmosphere.\n\nHuge Docking Port for connecting really big ships.\n\nNuclear Fuel Tanks for holding blutonium.\n\nIndustrial Nuclear Facilities for refining ore into blutonium.\n\nAdvanced Grabbers for more options to attach to asteroids.\n\nStasis Tanks for storing virtual particles.\n\nVirtugenics for generating virtual particles using lots of power.\n\nKannae Drives for moving vessels and probes using only virtual particles and some serious power.\n\nSide Adaptor for attaching things on the side.\n\nVirtual Ore Reactors for powering things from ore and virtual particles, the bigger one even has a backup reactor that uses xenon instead of ore.\n\nCatalytic Engines for higher thrust rocket propulsion and the ability to draw dust from any atmosphere.\n\nMagnetic Drag Array for atmospheric entry with huge vessels, uses its magnetic charge as an ablative, has a built-in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E system and cooling system.\n\nNuclear Jet Engines for travel through an atmosphere without having to worry about needing oxygen.\n\nRetro-Propulsive Unit for a heat shield and an engine all in one part, uses it magnetic charge as an ablative.\n\nNuclear Plasma Engine for when need the absolute biggest space borne propulsion using liquid fuel and electricity.\n\nIonic Plasma Thruster for when don\u0027t need a monster engine, but a modest propulsion using liquid fuel and electricity.\n\nMagnetic Cooling Unit for dropping the temperature at the cost of power, perfect for fighting overheating.\n\nVirtual Dust Containment Tanks for storing dust and virtual particles, though the compression requires constant power or it\u0027ll leak virtual particles.\n\nSpherical Dust Tanks for storing dust and only dust.\n\nDust Accumulator for gathering dust in any environment over time, but requires constant power to keep the magnetic trapping field up.\n\nDust Processing Unit for extracting xenon from dust or compressing dust into ore, both using a lot of power at the risk of slight overheating.\n\nNuclear Reactors for using ore and a bit of electricity to produce a ton of power, but it tends to overheat so make sure to use the built-in cooling system that also takes power.\n\nNuclear Forge for producing power like a reactor but can also transynthesize virtual particles directly into dust, also has a cooling system built-in.\n\nThermal \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E for maneuvering massive ships without then need for an army of normal \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters.\n\nSpectrometer for getting an area\u0027s composition to get some juicy science.\n\nVirtugenic Refinery for processing dust into more ore and converting dust into virtual particles.\n\nDust Ring for higher speed drawing in of dust.\n\nSolar Wind Panel for truely passive dust collection from the Sun.\n\nMicropulsed Magnetic Drive for high efficiency burst of acceleration at the cost of endurance.\n\nZurbin Nuclear Drive for massive propulsion on par with the Indominus in and out of the atmosphere.\n\n**Gallery of Parts and Usage Details**\n\n[http://imgur.com/a/TFdao#0](http://imgur.com/a/TFdao#0)\n\nPRIMARY DOWNLOAD:
