All it takes is for one kraken-like disintegration due to structural failure, and I\u0027ll slap 10 struts in a place that could probably just use 2. I\u0027ve got a few spacecraft with 350 parts, and I\u0027ll wager 150 of them or more are struts. This is also with Kerbal Joint Reinforcement installed. Maybe it\u0027s my job.
