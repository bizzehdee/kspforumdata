I have good, or at least decent (i.e. not super blurry), surface maps for Io, Europa, Callisto, and Ganymede, so it will only be a matter of time before I\u0027m able to create some sort of height map for them and get them into the game. Also, we will be getting access to a better PQS loader in the not too distant future, so once this becomes a part of the DLL, I will be going back and revisiting each planet I\u0027ve already done to create a more realistic and less blocky terrain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Yes I know I copypasta\u0027d my original release, but I haven\u0027t made many significant changes yet, so it seemed appropriate.
