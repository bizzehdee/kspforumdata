It is not going to revolutionize SSTOs or anything like that. It is a workable airplane engine in low altitude kerbin, with basically no VTOL ability whatsoever. On EVE and Jool is has way more thrust, apparently with the higher atmosphere density; If you ever want to explore the atmosphere of either it will probably be your absolute best choice.

It\u0027s really challenging to fly, or even boost it up to sufficient speed to get self sustaining thrust, but also much fun smashing through the landscapes a few meters above the ground at mach 3. Gotta be real careful to keep up enough speed at all times, too slow and it couldnt keep up the thrust. Also it overheated quickly, had to turn on cheats etc. Anyway, this is much fun and would fit nicely so I\u0027ll definetly make a proper nuke ramjet at some point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Starbuckminsterfullerton\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Starbuckminsterfullerton\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWow, what an update!
