Kudos!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, it\u0027s nothing that Chris can do about in RealChute. Looks like a problem in the stock game. There should be some mechanism in place in stock KSP that cleans up contracts which are missing parts that the contract requires for completion.

Instead he added a config file that adds RealChute and Wenkel Corporation as Agents. If any part has a manufacturer listed which has the same name as an Agent, then the stock contract system can generate contracts for that part. This is outside Chris\u0027s ability to do anything about other than to not add Agents to his mod.
