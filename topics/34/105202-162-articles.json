Larger vessels help, and will increase the amount of time they have on the counter - but it never resets until they get back home.  No amount of switching vessels will keep it from running out.

That should let you have well-stocked planetary stores by the time you get there.\n\nYou do not even need to launch them all before you send out your mothership, just at any available transfer-window.\n\nJust make sure that your resource retrieval vessel has both logistics and a pilot, so you can fill your tanks and holds without needing to land close your facilities.\n\nNote: actually making things and advanced refining(refined exotics and silicon) cannot be done with automated parts and may have greatly slowed production without kerbals."},{"CreatedByName":"NermNermNerm","CreatedById":174264,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-26T05:02:31Z","Content":"I\u0027ve been trying to understand how the Tundra Medical Bay works and having no luck.
