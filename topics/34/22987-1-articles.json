Originally attracting investors throughout Kerbin for their promise of \u0027permanent manned-facilities\u0027 in orbit, this ragtag group of what Jeb likes to call \u0027college-jockeys\u0027 produced enormously heavy hunks of science for years before anyone in the investment game realized that no rockets available could propel them to orbit. The company then quickly went bust, and it disappeared from the public\u0027s knowledge. Years later, long after rockets became available that could lift the heavy loads, the Kosmos company warehouse was discovered fully intact, undisturbed, and full of dusty modules. The KSP was able to purchase the entire company (including the engineers, who were found living in the warehouse subsisting on tube-food and several types of rodent!) The station parts themselves were sold cheaper than the metal they were made from. Freshly employed and entirely grateful, the Kosmos engineers strive to continue to not live in a warehouse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E-Space Station Parts Pack-\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF0000;\u0022\u003EAs always, delete earlier versions of Kosmos from your parts folder before installing new ones.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/HN7P5JI.png\u0022 alt=\u0022HN7P5JI.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/kosmos-tks-spacecraft/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/kosmos-tks-spacecraft/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELow resolution version for older machines: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/kosmoslite/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/kosmoslite/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Space Station Parts Pack contains everything needed to construct big, beautiful space stations. The pack includes the Kosmos VA capsule and TKS functional cargo block, a rugged and reliable vehicle for orbital operations, trusted by Kerbalnauts everywhere. Also included are the Salyut series of space station modules, which are split into customizable segments to build any station configuration. Using Kosmos parts, you can control your station without manning it by using the Pravilo computer system, or dock to it using the androgenous APAS-69 docking ring. Recent additions to the pack include the Balka series of ISS-style solar panels, truss pieces to connect your intersteller infrastructure together, and engines to propel you to new heights.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVersion 4.7 (8/27/13)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Changed many textures to .tga format, allowing users to resize textures and reduce memory requirements as needed\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Added several new small parts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Added URM 1.25 meter parts package\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Now includes procedural fairings with matching Kosmos textures (special thanks to E-dog)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVersion 4.6 (8/18/13)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Includes updated Firespitter Plugin\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- RD-210 mistakenly released in previous update changed to RD-275K\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Added new enhanced strut connector\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Some textures changed to .tga format for personal resizing and compression \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVersion 4.5 (8/10/13)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Added RD-33NK and RD-0146 engines\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Fixed glitch with Balka solar panels\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- User Satcharna has provided translations for the included flags: \u0022For Peace and Progress\u0022 - \u0022Glory to the heroes of the fatherland!\u0022 - \u0022The Soviet People are Space Pioneers, Glory!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVersion 4.4 (7/30/13)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Replaced final remaining first-generation Kosmos parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Battery, ASAS, and reaction wheel modules added to various parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVersion 4.3 (6/2/13):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Files are repackaged to comply with post-0.20 KSP builds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Several silly flags featuring Soviet propaganda have been added.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVersion 4.2 (4/19/13):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Added smaller solar panels based on early Salyut series.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVersion 4.1 (4/8/13):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- All reasonable pressurized modules now have crew manifest support for non-EVA crew transfers.
