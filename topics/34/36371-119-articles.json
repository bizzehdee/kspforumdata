I can reproduce the problem consistently. I discovered it in the most serendipitous way. I got a notice that there was an update from 1.09 to 1.11 of TE so I updated. Then I started a fresh game to see if I could reproduce the problem before I satarted puslling out mods to check for a conflict. But as soon as I picked part and then a fairing base I could not get to the fairing base context menu. I thought gee the only thing I just changed was ... tweakableeverything. So on that I decided to pull TE and see if the problem went away and it did. I put the old 1.09 back in and it was lagging like mad again.

This was affecting interactions with a lot of mods, especially mods that didn\u0027t use rate limiting on the event requests (FAR did, but we still made it rebuild every half second or so). This is a Squad bug; the tweakables should not be triggering event calls when nothing has changed. I\u0027ve worked around this issue by introducing a dependency on a stripped-down version of KSPAPIExtensions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second issue was an animation issue that would have been affecting TweakableAnimateGeneric and TweakableLadders, where I was inadvertently putting animations into an inconsistent state. FAR monitors animations every Update, and when it detects a change it requests a voxel rebuild. Because the animations were inconsistent, FAR flagged them as changed every time it checked, leading to the same problem as above. I\u0027ve resolved this issue by rewriting my animation handling code from the ground up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI should have a release tonight (UTC-7).\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can guess from the last sentence, TE has been updated to remove the lag.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ctbram","CreatedById":99635,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T12:36:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ObsessedWithKSP\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ObsessedWithKSP\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt\u0027s (partly) a stock bug that\u0027s exposed by TweakableEverything, technically speaking:\u003Cp\u003EAs you can guess from the last sentence, TE has been updated to remove the lag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThx for the quick update.
