The base of the procedural wing can have the thickness changed. Does this change the sheer stress experienced by the wing trying to provide lift to a heavy plane i.e. does the surface area in contact with the plane help?\n\nAdditionally is that \u0027sticky\u0027 part of the wing limited to the part the wing is initially attached to, or do other parts that the wing is in contact with play a part too?\n\nI see in the notes something a .cfg file being generated. Is it possible to examine this file? If so where is it located? Or is this merely a reference to the planename.cfg file which is found in the saves directory?\n\nI am experiencing wings being ripped from the body of the craft when attempting lift off .i.e. craft is on the runway, speed roughly 0.8? mach, comes to end of runway, nose pulled up slightly to perform a gently climb.\n\nI am using the B9 SH wing. Is there another wing that I might use that has better \u0027stick to the plane\u0027 properties?\n\nThis is my first time trying to use procedural wings, I thought it might be a good idea considering I am trying out the B9 HX parts for the first time.\n\nThanks."},{"CreatedByName":"kcs123","CreatedById":127158,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-13T14:33:01Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 10 hours ago, Apaseall said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I am experiencing wings being ripped from the body of the craft when attempting lift off .i.e. craft is on the runway, speed roughly 0.8? mach, comes to end of runway, nose pulled up slightly to perform a gently climb.\n\u003E \n\nNo wonder. 0.8 Mach at sea level and even slight push can cause high G load on wings.

I am new to using this mod though. Mine take off about 200 m/s. I tend to use little wing area, so need the speed for the lift. I also go very fast horizontally. But this is beside the point.\n\nBuilding a space plane [\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E] like how I have without this mod, causes the wings to rip off. This is because of the massive weight of B9 HX parts.\n\nI use KJR, tried rigid attachment, autostruts, extra struts, reinforced struts etc. Not all at the same time, one after the other etc. Then all etc. Normally I don\u0027t need to mess with that sort of stuff. Now fiddling with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Thrust\u0022\u003ECoT\u003C/abbr\u003E \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E, boy have I done lots of that. lol.\n\nI just wanted an answer to my question, not help with designing the plane. Thanks for the offered suggestions. I know you meant to help. I only wanted to know, well the stuff I asked about. For the moment I have ditched wings altogether. Not a plane anymore but \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003Evtol\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\nThis is not meant to be rude to you, despite how it may be worded.

What you ask for to get superstrong wings might not be possible, at least not without cheating by removing aerodinamic failures and similar. And it is good not always have superb parts to create what you imagined how it should behave. It suppose to make you thinking out of the box to get different solution.\n\nUnlike you, I have created SSTOs with both design aproach, with small wings and high \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E crafts and oposite, with large wings and small \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E. What I was suggested is to try different aproach to solve your problem, would you follow advice or not it is up to you. As far as I know thikness of wing does not influence strength of joints between wing and other parts. It does help with fuel storage inside wings, though.\n\nSo, you can\u0027t make wing joints much stronger than currently is without altering config files or changing game engine physics."},{"CreatedByName":"fatcargo","CreatedById":93302,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-29T20:06:22Z","Content":"[@jrodriguez](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/130617-jrodriguez/) \n\nBeing the one to update B9 for 1.4.2 (big thanks !),  i\u0027m asking if this plugin supports anything with more complex geometry than planar surfaces like boxes, tubes or hollow spaces enclosed with multiple colliders ?

Interim Fix: Disable symmetry in the editor, place the control surface, press ALT \u002B Mouse 1 on the part, duplicate, then roll/flip as needed with the QWEASD keys and place as close as you can to the opposite side of your craft.
