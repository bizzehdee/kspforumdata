I mean, I am absolutely fine with a normal Kerman consuming 1 of each resource a day, but in a \u003Cstrong\u003Enormal condition\u003C/strong\u003E only. With \u0022normal condition\u0022, let me default to being relaxing on Kerbin, or enjoying a spacetrip without causes of concern. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are a lot of circumstances when conditions are less-than-perfect for a Kerman. So, let me introduce the concept of \u0022\u003Cstrong\u003Estress\u003C/strong\u003E\u0022. A Kerman experiences stress in a variety of situations, like when doing hazardous jobs (EVA ?), heavy jobs (had they to lift and carry around some items during their walk on Duna?), training to keep his/her body fit (they must, if they have to reach Laythe and be of any use once landed), but most of all when experiencing high-G acceleration (in case you don\u0027t believe me, just look Bill or Bob, their horrified faces during launch tells enough).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the contrary, we could have a device for long space journeys with the effect to reduce consumption rates. A sort of \u0022partial life suspension\u0022 that will also make Jeb \u0026amp; Co. less reactive when activated (so, you have to switch that device off, or Jeb will take 10x more time than usual to perform even the simplest duty).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn top of that, we could also have a device measuring \u0022stress\u0022 in real time for each Kerman aboard a ship. Sort of a \u0022Life monitoring system\u0022, I reckon that was a standard item with human crews in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am actually not asking you (yet) to make all of the above. But to start, to allow that to be implemented in future versions, allowing consumption rates to be calculated with regard to the \u0022stress\u0022 variable. In case you allow this, I am going through your source files to see if I can understand how your mod works and if I can be of any help to implement any of the above (no promise, I have some expertise with other games but I am just starting with KSP).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aknar","CreatedById":68073,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-24T17:23:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is what I said earlier on the subject :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Aknar\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Aknar\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDo you think a Kerbal reaction script is within your reach?

But certainly there are points in common among the two proposals.

While I have to wait and see what Squad will be cooking for us in the future versions, I certainly expect Kerbonauts to be given much more attention; possibly with added values, performance statistics, training devices.

This variable must be initiated to be = 1.0 at game start (No logic to actually calculate its value until somebody takes that task, me included). And of course, to have this variable enter the calculation about resources consumption/transformation (I believe are at lines 133-135 and 139-141 in GlobalSettings.cs, with the source of this mod).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have begun looking through the methods exported by Unity DLLs, have seen a few about animations as well but can\u0027t say which does what (while still looking for proper references).

Coming out I assumed that even aside from the process of reviving someone there is going to be a time when the Kerbal is recovering from the procedure and is still unable to do anything, or to go back into hibernation. Too stressful without some nasty side-effects. Honestly the 12 hours I picked was a bit of an understatement. I could easily see days of recovery while the body gets used to operating normally, even re-training dis-used muscles etc. Actually, basing the recovery time on how long they were in hibernation might work, though I\u0027d make it logarithmic, or at least a fixed base amount of time with an added time per day spent in hibernation so it doesn\u0027t ramp up too drastically on longer jaunts.
