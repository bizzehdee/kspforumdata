I\u0027m not thaaat good with such things, so... that\u0027s why I ask XD\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Comparing them side-by-side is a bit difficult.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Cryogenic Engines compared to stock engines seem to cost something like 60-70% more and take up about 50% more in tankspace, but also get a bit better \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E in that case.  \n\u003E \n\u003E But I wonder the application of that... It\u0027s larger, more expensive (even excluding energy-generation for the tanks), a bit lighter and stronger... But the same result (acceleration and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E) can be achieved with stock chemical engines for less cost and size.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Kerbal Atomic engines compared to an unmodded NERVA are 6 times larger in tankspace, cost double as much as the same stock-solution and weight about the same.  \n\u003E \n\u003E Again, I\u0027m a bit lost for the application when the KA-engines need that much more volume (which you could ignore in space, although x6 is still ludicrous) and cost double as much as the same stock-solution.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E To get those \u0022numbers\u0022, I built a small benchmark-ship (2.5m pod \u002B Jumbo as payload) and aimed for a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E of 0.4 to 0.5 with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E of 1900-2000 m/s). Compared where different arrangements of (Sq) NERVAs, (Sq) Swivels, (CE) VL1-Volcanoes and (KA) LV-100 N100 Neptunes.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I think I am missing something... Maybe larger (2.5m, 3.5m?) Cryo Engines / Atomic Motors have a better performance? But on the other hand, so do some stock engines... I\u0027m really confused. I like the look of Nertea\u0027s engines, but at the moment (well, see above), I don\u0027t see a way of profiting from them...\n\u003E \n\nYour comparisons are kinda weird. You\u0027re comparing apples to oranges in a lot of cases there.\n\n**Cryo Engines**\n\nFor a target \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E and a constant payload, a cryogenic vehicle should be lighter than a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E vehicle. It should be somewhat larger and slightly more expensive as a result. This has knock-on effects in that if your vehicle is an upper stage, it should be lighter to lift into orbit, and thus reduce the required LV size.\n\nThis is quite easy to show - use an example payload of decent size (sat 20t) and compare a Terrier and a Chelyabinsk. Optimize for the same \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E (say 2500 m/s), the mass should drop with the cryo type configuration. This won\u0027t work with very small payloads but with a larger one it\u0027ll become evident. Optimize for larger DVs and the benefit grows. \n\n**Kerbal Atomics**\n\nThis is more complicated. KSP set a terrible precedent in basically giving the LV-N all the advantages of a cryogenic fuel (great delta-v) with none of the disadvantages (volume, mass ratio). There were 3 options then when developing KA:\n\n1. Stick with the crazy balance (all KA engines become completely superior to everything)\n2. Stick with the crazy balance and artificially degrade KA engines in some way to make them internally balanced\n3. Repair the crazy balance at the cost of needing to patch 1 stock engine.\n    1. Patch LV-N Isp to reasonable for a denser fuel (500-600s)\n    2. Patch LV-N fuel to LH2\n\nEvidently I chose #3.1. The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E NTRs patch implements 3.2. So if you compare a KA engine to an unmodified LV-N, you\u0027re comparing two balance systems that are not compatible. You either have to use all of 3.1 or all of 3.2\n\nYou can find a lot more discussion as you page through this thread and KA."},{"CreatedByName":"cy-one","CreatedById":74874,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-26T23:43:39Z","Content":"Cryo: But if the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E and Payloads are the same, why pay more for a larger rocket?\n\nAtomics: Yeah, i noticed that too...

The basic idea is to make sure that the patch runs after nearly every other patch.  So if something is modifying some resource volumes or copying parts with modified parameters this patch will only operate on the final state.
