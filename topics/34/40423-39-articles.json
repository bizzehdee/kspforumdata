No indication of larger/smaller, and definitely not a permanent part of the indicator. Less is more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlus I\u0027m not sure if you can reliably determine the relative sizes of two ports. I\u0027ll have to dive back into the docking module logic to figure out what makes ports copacetic. Thanks for the reference to Universal Docking Ports, as I can probably look at that code to figure it out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E----\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem I\u0027m facing at the moment is that due to unity 4\u0027s sheetay GUI support, I had to create two completely separate rendering pipelines in order to support RPM. RPM draws to a texture, while the normal gauge uses deferred rendering unity GUI functions, and the two pipelines simply do not talk to each other. So any change made to the display has to be made twice. This gets really finnicky because the display sizes aren\u0027t uniform (RPM displays can be any size, for example), etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, it\u0027s a hassle and I\u0027ve been thinking of ways to improve it. Particularly if I ever want to put the code up on github - right now it\u0027s not very fun to look at. And, DPAI seems to be sticking around, so, might as well keep it well-maintained! Then comes along the Unity 5 announcement. This is good and bad. Bad: unless Squad decides to completely \u0027emulate\u0027 the Unity 4 GUI pipeline for backwards-compatibility of mods (I doubt they will), certain chunks of DPAI (and most other mods) will require a re-write. The Good: The new GUI system should allow me to unify the rendering pipelines. Hurray.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I\u0027ve been hesitant to write any updates to DPAI prior to Unity 5, as it\u0027s going to require a re-write at that point anyway. If the switch does break mods, i just hope Squad sends out a development version or something to allow modders to fix their stuff in advance. Again, doubtful. Maybe I can get on the experimentals team.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway.

Glad you like it. That mod you saw was \u0022Lazor Docking Cam\u0022, which I believe is now defunct (not sure). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Docking Cam\u0022 is an increasingly requested feature. I\u0027ll add it to my list of things to explore, but it\u0027s not a high priority because the perceived payoff vs effort isn\u0027t too high. I can\u0027t imagine that implementing a render target in a plugin is too easy. Then again, I don\u0027t know - I\u0027d have to look at some of the external camera mods etc to see what that would take. But I still don\u0027t understand what it buys you as the player. If you\u0027re doing EVA view, you can see the port with your main camera. If you\u0027re IVA you can use RPM to display a view from your docking port. So other than perhaps a touch of atmosphere or \u0027cool\u0027 factor, what does it buy you? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot trying to be negative.
