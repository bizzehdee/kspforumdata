This has already been partially implemented in 1.1.0 with Solar Radiation Pressure drag, but this is only a small component of real lunar (and beyond) perturbation. As an example, Apollo-17 prior to leaving Lunar orbit, deployed a small satellite to measure gravitational changes in the lunar surface and subsequent perturbations to orbiting satellite, this mission, intended to last many months, lasted just afew weeks before the orbit of the satellite destabilized and it crashed into the surface of the moon. This prompted research into Gravity Anomalies and Mascons (Mass Concentrations); although gravitational fields are assumed to be regular in KSP, in reality gravity is pretty variable. On Earth, the effect to satellites is negligible since: A) the satellites are forced to orbit much higher (above 140km) and B) gravitational variation is relatively low.\n\nOn the moon however, gravity can be disturbed by Mascons by up to 0.00045 of a G-Unit. This seemingly small change effects the local gravity of the moon at a position by up to 0.03 m/s^2, this causes massive changes in satellite orbits, in Inclination, Semi Major axis, Eccentricity and Mean Anomaly. Completely changing vessels in unstable/non station keeping orbits. So my intention is to map the current models of Mascons of the Earth and the Moon into the game, this will not be easy and will only be beneficial to RSS, but this is the next logical step for realistic decay modelling, I will also produce estimated maps of every other solar body to complete the system. \n\nWhitecat106 ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)"}]}
