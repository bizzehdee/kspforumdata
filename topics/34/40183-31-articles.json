For the first couple of missions I\u0027ve used the included RandomMissions pack. It was recommended for career mode (searched the thread) and I also tried to but couldn\u0027t find any other mission pack that was fitting for my needs. I like that the missions don\u0027t (usually) depend on each other (except for where it actually makes sense, like refueling stations requiring a station first) and I also appreciate the generic nature, where I can find a fitting mission for most things I\u0027m doing or planning on doing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat being said, I do have a few issues with the package (most are rather minor), which I can of course just fix for my personal use but I thought I\u0027d share my thoughts on what I have to change and why.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am playing with a few mods (like I assume most people are), but the only one that affects the missions I can do (or rather the progression) is RemoteTech2: I can\u0027t just go and fly to the poles or to the crater with a probe just because I have the Stayputnik unlocked (as I\u0027d loose radio contact with KSC and therefore control). I\u0027d have to put up some ComSats first. By the time I\u0027m done with that such early home-world exploration missions make little sense anymore (and strapping a Stayputnik to a manned mission is just silly \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E ).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince there is only one (generic) suborbital mission in the beginning, I\u0027ve lowered the required altitude to 10-20k instead of 50k\u002B. This allows me to get some science with little flights to different biomes. I\u0027ve considered changing mission 2 accordingly (which is basically identical to mission 3, see below) but didn\u0027t have any good ideas as to what to change it to...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI obviously need to put up communication satellites sooner or later, I\u0027ll probably use either the random probe missions (removing the inclination requirement from the high orbit mission (18)) or mission 27 (high orbit satellite) with a more relaxed apoapsis range. I\u0027m also thinking of changing one of those to be more specific to polar(-ish) orbits with adjusted payouts. Not sure about those yet though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince we now have the new science lab module, I thought I\u0027d use it instead of the Communotron on the station, but it doesn\u0027t seem to be recognized by the name \u0022Large_Crewed_Lab\u0022 (which is the one from the corresponding part.cfg). I haven\u0027t tested if it works, but at least the name isn\u0027t resolved correctly as the other names are...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly, a few inconsistencies I\u0027ve noticed (which may or may not be intentional)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMission 2 \u0026amp; 3: (touched on above already) In practice these are identical. Yes, the ranges for valid orbits differ a bit, but since both require a Kerbal to be on board, the only difference is that you have to click \u0022EVA\u0022 once for the second one. At least in a career save you\u0027ll likely do that anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMission 5: The \u0022crater land formation\u0022 isn\u0027t exactly precisely specified. It only specifies a Latitude range, but no longitude. Where is the intended spot? Is it the crater along the coastline (about 105\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 west of KSC) or the bigger, fully land-based one at about 30 longitude? For both the given Latitude of 7.5-10.5 doesn\u0027t make too much sense (both are roughly around the given latitude though), or is it meant to cover both?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMission 8: Minmus FlyBy has no \u0022land at Kerbin\u0022 goal, but the Mun version does (and so do most missions up to that point). Is this intentional, like for a probe leaving Kerbins SoI?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMission 19: Nothing odd about the mission itself, but it seems a bit out of place, with the other missions for Kerbins moos being 6-9. It seems it might belong between 6 and 7, progression wise?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile I\u0027ve thought about and started editing the missions for my needs I\u0027ve quickly wished for a new feature or two in the specification language: Often the PartGoal is just an indirect solution to the problem. For example to specify a \u0022communication satellite\u0022 mission, I don\u0027t want to ask for 3x Communotron 16, but I want to ask for three parts that are an antenna. So I\u0027d like to ask for 3 parts that contain the module \u0022ModuleDataTransmitter\u0022 or (for when RemoteTech2 is installed) the module \u0022ModuleRTAntenna\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis leads to the second thing: being able to ask for one of many goals to be fulfilled for the mission to be completed. It\u0027s already possible to combine conditions so they need to be met at the same time (SubMissionGoal is basically an AND of all subgoals), it would be excellent if we could also ask for one of multiple subgoals (implementing an OR). This would also allow to \u0022fake\u0022 the module-goal from above, as you can just list all antennae in one such goal. If it let\u0027s you (optionally) set a replacement name (and doesn\u0027t display all sub-parts when this is defined) it would just show as \u0022Module: 3x Antenna\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESide note: also a \u002B1 from me for using the toolbar. While I\u0027m not a huge fan of the aesthetic, I love that I don\u0027t have buttons for various mods in random places, but a central toolbar for all additional buttons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk that\u0027s enough wall-o-text for now (sorry, got a bit carried away).
