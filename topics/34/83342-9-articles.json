The trade off with them is that you typically aren\u0027t simulating an entire rocket (launcher\u002Bpayload) but instead just the payload when you\u0027re starting in orbit (or soon-ish, landed) so the total cost goes down.

And how its implemented it will work with any mods that add extra planets. I think orbital sims just need to be brought down in cost pretty substantially. I do kind of like the idea that subsequent sims shouldn\u0027t be as costly, so maybe if you revert to the editor any sims at the same place don\u0027t cost as much until you leave the editor. That way you can make small changes as necessary without blowing the bank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust thought of a way to make it so you couldn\u0027t just simulate a command pod and then get the discount on your mega-awesome expensive ship. Keep track of the total funds spent on simulations that session and once it gets above, say, 2 times the cost of the most expensive one you don\u0027t have to pay any more. Otherwise you pay the total cost as normal, or the difference of the max amount and the current sim cost, whichever is less.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEx: Sim costs 10k funds. Max amount then is 20k. You simulate that, then go make some changes. New sim costs 11k funds so the max goes to 22k. Total is now 21k spent. You make some small changes and the newest sim will be 10k funds again. Max is still 22k, but you only have to pay 1k. Future sims, as long as they\u0027re below 11k initially are free. If one is, say, 12k the max goes to 24k and you pay 2k.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had originally considered ending simulations when you entered places you hadn\u0027t been before (space if launching from Kerbin early on, atmosphere/landed of other planets/moons) but decided against it for simplicity. I do want to require that you actually have landed on another planet/moon before you can start simulations there though. I haven\u0027t decided between letting you input any landed coordinates you want, or requiring you to start near a flag/probe/base that currently exists. At the very least there will be a list of those objects you can choose from and it will pull their coordinates and input them automatically.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will add a maximum amount of time for reconditioning. Maybe like 7 Kerbin days before the Overall Multiplier gets multiplied in.

I have two choices.

You need to be able to test if a craft will work prior to spending days/weeks/months building it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d rather see simulation price/scale factor included as a setting.

Although it would mean you shouldn\u0027t be allowed to start a sim in orbit of Eve and then just deorbit yourself into the atmosphere, the sim should stop at that point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you wanted to take it even a step further (I love thinking of ideas for other people to work on \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E) you could say that atmospheric flight requires having been there and landing requires having been to a location in the vicinity or having scanned it (possible tie in with scansat or similar). Want to sim a Moho landing? Better have a scan of the surface, otherwise your sim engine won\u0027t know what it\u0027s doing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo you\u0027d have orbits unlocked by the fact that you have giant dishes at KSC, atmospheres unlocked by being there (either manned or unmanned), and landings unlocked by either already landing within x kilometers or having done a surface scan of the area.
