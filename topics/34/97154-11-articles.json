Everything was going fine. I saved the game, went to bed. Next day I load the save and go to the lander to make my Munar insertion burn but, alas, when I throttled up my lv-909 I was met with a feeble splutter of thrust. It wasn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t a constant splutter; it would splutter a little, then stop, then splutter some more. KER showed me that the amount of thrust coming from each splutter was variable too. While inspecting the right click menu of the engine in search for the problem I saw that the thrust limiter was going up and down with each splutter. This made me realize it was likely a TCA issue, even though the engine was set as a main engine. Surely enough, after changing the TCA option to manual control the problem went away and I was able to complete my burn and keep Jeb from drifting hopelessly into a solar orbit.
