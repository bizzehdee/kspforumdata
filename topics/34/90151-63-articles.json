Regarding the question, the problem that altitude-compensating nozzles often have is lack of thrust vector control. If you have data showing that the J-2T had switched to multiple thrust chambers (allowing differential throttling) let us know; I certainly can\u0027t imagine SASSTO would work without TVC, but I haven\u0027t seen anything on how J-2T was supposed to have TVC...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I was playing around with the J-2T, I ran into this issue, and I agree that I can\u0027t imagine actually using this engine for its intended purpose without any kind of vectoring. Some searching on the internet found the following paper: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1059\u0026amp;context=spacegrant\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1059\u0026amp;context=spacegrant\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt looks fairly recent, and clearly they haven\u0027t actually flown rockets with this configuration, but they did actually do experimental testing (as well as theoretical modelling). The effective vectoring range may be more limited than some types of bell-engine gimbals, but it looks like it\u0027s at least possible to do this kind of TVC on a toroidal aerospike type engine. The study wasn\u0027t specific to the J-2T, and it was pretty recent, so I doubt this was really part of the \u0022original\u0022 J-2T design. But given that the J-2T was never put into production anyway, it seems reasonable to me that we could extrapolate these results to let the RO version of of the J-2T have at least a few degrees worth of thrust vectoring control. It would make it a heck of a lot more useful; without any kind of TVC, it\u0027s pretty useless in atmosphere (since you can\u0027t compensate for drag while doing a gravity turn), which rather defeats the point of it being altitude-compensating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBaring that, we could postulate a HydroLOX version of a vernier (e.g. LR-101 or equivalent), which could help compensate, but it would be significantly less elegant.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
