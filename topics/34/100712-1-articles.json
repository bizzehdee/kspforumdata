This Planet Pack adds a texture for Plock, along with a bunch of moons !\n\nLet\u0027s take a closer look at the new stuff...\n\n**Chokon**\n\nChokon is the Charon analog. It orbits very close to Plock and it\u0027s quite large compared to Plock itself.\n\n**Adryx**\n\nAdryx is the Hydra analog in this mod. It\u0027s a little moon orbiting not so far from Plock, but it\u0027s small.\n\n**Xin**\n\nXin is the anolog for Nix. It\u0027s very dense, causing it to have a very high gravity for it\u0027s size, and it also have a large weird spike on it\u0027s north pole.\n\n**Mli**\n\nMli is the analog for Styx. It have weird colors all over it\u0027s surface.\n\nPICTURES and GALLERY\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Really nice to have a Pluto-Charon system analog, as like in the real solar system, the Gas Giants and their moons are inevitably really similar to eachother.\n\nBut\n\nLike others who have posted though, the only real criticism I have is with a few of the textures. Please don\u0027t get me wrong, the work is great and I use and like this mod but one of the great things about OPM is that everything looks very much like it could be stock. \n\nRainboros, as others have mentioned, in particular stands out. Maybe if the transition between the colours (not just on Rainboros) was less abrupt, and if they were a little paler or more pastel, it would keep that original idea while at the same time keeping everything looking like the mod it all adds to.\n\nTL/DR: I like the mod, but some textures could be more \u0027natural\u0027 looking."},{"CreatedByName":"Cornholio","CreatedById":94349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-27T17:30:54Z","Content":"Will there be any conflict if I have the minor bodies mod installed too?"},{"CreatedByName":"Olympic1","CreatedById":79730,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-27T20:26:13Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Will there be any conflict if I have the minor bodies mod installed too?\n\nOPM doesn\u0027t work with other planet packs, Only this one and Outer Planets Plus"},{"CreatedByName":"Elowiny","CreatedById":117659,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-28T07:09:05Z","Content":"Rainboros is now darker., as many of you requested."},{"CreatedByName":"Cornholio","CreatedById":94349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-28T09:43:54Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E OPM doesn\u0027t work with other planet packs, Only this one and Outer Planets Plus\n\nThere is a compatibility with OPM and Minor Bodies.
