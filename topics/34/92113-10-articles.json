PlanetShine and TextureReplacer can be options installed later in the process...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I realize that you have configs that are applied to PlanetShine and optional features added to TextureReplacer - but consider the current order of operations:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea - Install EnvironmentalVisualEnhancements, PlanetShine, and TextureReplacer\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eb - Add volumetric cloud texture pack of quality desired to EnvironmentalVisualEnhancements\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ec - Add 8K Cloud Texture Pack to EnvironmentalVisualEnhancements, and also configure Chatterer, DistantObjectEnhancement, and PlanetShine\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E -- On a clean x86 KSP install on a sufficient Windows machine, AVP is unable to load into KSP at this point and thus is unusable (unless tweaked)\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ed - Optionally add \u0022Essential features\u0022 with 2K, 4K, and 8K options and further configure PlanetShine\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ee - Optionally add \u0022Extra features\u0022 with 4K \u0026amp; 8K options, add TextureReplacer optional textures, and install Chatterer (\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF0000;\u0022\u003Eoverwriting option installed in operation c\u003C/span\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ef - Optionally add \u0022Must-Have Mods\u0022 which includes DistantObjectEnhancement for the first time (\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF0000;\u0022\u003Eoverwriting option installed in operation c\u003C/span\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo to resolve this minor issue, you could suggest that in operation a EVE, PlantetShine, TextureReplacer, DistantObjectEnhancement, and Chatterer are all installed in operation a. However, given the resources are a game breaking issue for machines with maximum RAM available, perhaps an installation order such as the following is warranted as it would allow the core AVP functionality to be usable.

I did tweak the BoulderCo settings to cut large textures in half, with this change I am able to get AVP Interstellar to work. That is partially why I think AVP just needs some texture size options in Step 3. But you might also consider giving ATM another try and suggesting it for use with this pack - the load time improvements it now provides are wonderful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E*NOTE TO ANYONE USING NEW ATM*\u003C/strong\u003E It takes several runs, and quite a few minutes, for it to process and cache all the textures. If you keep running KSP it gets further each time...if it\u0027s never getting further try temporarily moving something out of GameData such as the Sqaud folder. Once the game loads, quit, re-add the folder(s) removed, and run again.
