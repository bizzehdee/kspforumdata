When it happens, setting \u0027control from here\u0027 doesn\u0027t fix it. Two craft of identical mass were docked and when I undocked them one would consistently set its Tf to 1.0 even though it was a 2 ton craft. (typically before docking they would set Tf to 0.04 which IMO is too low but that\u0027s what they would set it to BEFORE docking \u0026amp; undocking)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso while (re)testing this I also noticed then when I undocked craft 1 and craft 2, sometimes while setting SmartASS commands for Craft 1, Craft 2\u0027s RCS thrusters would sometimes start firing. Typically this would be KILL ROT and Craft 2 would just start firing/counterfiring repeatedly. Keep in mind this is while setting commands for \u003Cem\u003ECraft 1\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow... even while submitting this report/feedback and also keep in mind that I do feel docking/RCS in general do need a good bit more work, I want to take this opportunity to showcase a (IMO) nearly impossible task that I set MJ2 to perform. For those who don\u0027t know, I\u0027ve been working on a set of parts to re-create in KSP the Copernicus MTV (Mars Transfer Vehicle). And possibly the Terra Nova from Race to Mars if you\u0027ve ever seen that. One thing that I wanted to make possible is the re-docking of the drop tank so that the craft could be re-usable, even though the NASA proposal calls for the thing to be dumped in heliocentric orbit. (what... really NASA?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did not think MJ2 could perform this task given its tendency to approach the target at something like a 45 degree angle and I meant to try tweaking this before attempting this task but somehow forgot to actually apply the fix that I wanted to try. (dunno why, it\u0027s not like it was mindbogglingly hard but I just forgot). So, anyway... here it is. Tonight, it did it. It bumped the tank a few times and nearly threw me into cardiac arrest but it somehow did it. And, even when it lines up successfully and moves forward, there\u0027s no guarantee that it can dock the thing because the truss is not a convex shape so it can\u0027t actually contain the tank! Even so.... \u003Cem\u003EMJ2 DID THIS\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Edit: So, when someone comes in here and complains about how crappy the docking AP is and how it smashed their station to bits, just direct them to this post. RCS on this thing was a bit off balance because of the mass of fuel in the back, the engines and the fact that it didn\u0027t fully line up with the truss so the RCS thrusters were a few degrees out of alignment)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/rvdVm\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

It might well be that the procedure MJ follows does not work for bodies with particular characteristics that do not exist in the stock game.

If it wasn\u0027t the control point issue and it was the previously discussed bug AND he was using something older than 158 (I think that\u0027s where Sarbian said he fixed it?) then IMO it was something intermittent.
