Everything works fine at first, but when orbital velocity reaches about 750 m/s, attitude controls stop responding correctly although forward translation continues to work. If I get the craft turned back to prograde and can increase my orbital velocity back above 750 m/s, everything works as expected again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI confirmed the same behavior in high Kerbin orbit: above 750 m/s orbital velocity, all\u0027s fine. Decelerate to less than 750 m/s, RCS attitude inputs don\u0027t work. Accelerate back above 750 m/s, everything works again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tested the analogous craft in stock KSP \u002B HyperEdit, and the problem does not occur (at Kerbin anyway; Mun\u0027s orbital velocity is already less than 750 m/s so I couldn\u0027t test there).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny ideas?
