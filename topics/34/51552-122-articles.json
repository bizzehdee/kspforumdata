The narrower the angle, the farther you need to get from Kerbin before you can point the antenna at the planet and be guaranteed to have a satellite in the cone. While all the planets -- even Eve and Duna -- are far enough away that it\u0027s not a problem, the minimum range can cause trouble when you need to do course corrections.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the Communotron 88-88, you\u0027ll need to manually point the antenna at a specific satellite until you get about 5.7 million km away from Kerbin (assuming your interplanetary-capable comsats are in kerbostationary orbit).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-03T22:08:42Z\u0022 title=\u002203/03/2014 10:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 3, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Starstrider42\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EMath error\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hpf","CreatedById":104605,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-03T17:19:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe only thing that I think remote tech 2 currently needs is a data storage tank/device(have one on a command station that isn\u0027t KSC so you can send data to that when you don\u0027t have a connection to KSC and the station can send the data to KSC when it has a connection) or a way to take data from a command pod somewhere on the network and send it to another command pod(if you do this would it be possible to also make it so you can send non-command pod experiments like mystery goo).

Along with FAR, Deadly Reentry and TAC life support, it is must have mod for the KSP. However I found actual time delay and more importantly antenna alignment sometimes is very tedious. Especially when you decouple the probe or lander you have to re-adjust your satellite network to support it. Some of this shuld be automated such as probes will search for any available connection in range themselves. That will improve gameplay and spare us from the probes lost to wrong antenna alingment. I think it is challenging enought to keep up with signall lost due to connection occlusion and loss of power. If the author consider that it will simplify the game too much than it shuld be available as an option in cfg. Same with local control station I would like to be able control the lander or probe from the mothership with crew less than 6 it put too much on TAC life support for long term missions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sidfu","CreatedById":70409,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-04T16:50:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eghost thats why u have interplanatary com relays. to build a good network u have to have some sats pointing at other sats to have good connetion wise\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ghost13","CreatedById":78837,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-05T01:32:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eghost thats why u have interplanatary com relays. to build a good network u have to have some sats pointing at other sats to have good connetion wise \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have, but when there is a dosen of comsats and other craft around it is become tedeous we shuld at least have a com network view mode so I can uplink the satelites without switching to them but rather just point and click.
