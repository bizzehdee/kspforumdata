Methane Pyrolysis followed by (implied- not shown) oxidation of the resultant graphene and re-cycling the recovered hydrogen through the Sabatier again to make more Water for electrolysis is one solution, and probably should also be an option- but it\u0027s annoying and much more energy-inefficient to perform that additional pair of reactions rather than simply performing the Reverse Water Gas Shift (RWGS) Reaction- which yields just the desired Water without any of the unneeded Methane... (and thus is also more useful for life-support systems)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReal-world ISRU proposals actually frequently suggest utilizing two parallel reactors that perform both the Sabatier and RWGS reactions simultaneously off the output of a single electrical powerplant (usually nuclear), which would probably also be the optimal strategy in KSP- assuming the reaction rates could be properly balanced/calibrated (reactor calibration is *NOT* a feature I\u0027m suggesting/asking for anytime soon, or ever, mind you).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI, and another player even earlier also pointed out- the current reaction for Hydrazine (Monopropellant) synthesis also needs to be fixed- as currently implemented it consumes *FAR* more ammonia per liter of Hydrazine produced than the actual net equation for Hydrazine synthesis (\u003Cstrong\u003E2 H2O2 \u002B 4 NH3 --\u0026gt; 4 H2O \u002B 2 N2H4\u003C/strong\u003E).
