There seems to be an updated Kopernicus.dll available [here](https://github.com/Kopernicus/Kopernicus/tree/development/Distribution/Development)\n\nThanks so much! I will try this asap"},{"CreatedByName":"Generalstarwars333","CreatedById":151938,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-15T19:13:08Z","Content":"I really have to make a ship with this and put some of the BigS Delta wings with maybe some Goliaths and have the wings at a high angle of attack and see if it will fly. I also need to add struts to my ship *Space Battlecrusier Amagi*. And something to hold it on liftoff so it doesn\u0027t do weird things while I hyperedit it to orbit. though I might just need to add struts...The superstructure doesn\u0027t seem to be securely fastened to the hull near the back, and the fact that I have the bridge oriented in a logical LOOKING way means controls are messed up...might just have some cupolas facing forwards instead of the mk2 landercan... The guns seem to work fine, but I probably need more RCS, since it is huge! And maybe more engines, though I don\u0027t really have room for more and it would mess up the center of thrust, which I made sure was as close to the center of mass as possible. (by which I mean it was lined up with it, not in it.) It has five oerlikon milleniums for a main battery, with three fore mounted in superfiring, the other two mounted the same way on the back. For AA it has three goalkeepers a side, and for AA/point defense it has a large number of vulcan turrets mostly mounted broadside. I have yet to count them. Power comes from a pair of gigantors on the back of the bridge that when extended look rather dashing, as is they\u0027re streaming out behind it in the wind. Most of the power, however, comes from a pair of nuclear reactors from the Orion pack in the superstructure. (the orion engines don\u0027t work, or more correctly, the magazines don\u0027t I think I\u0027ll have to reinstall it. I just want nuke propelled spaceships!) Engines are four nuclear engines that I think are called \u0022Masamunes\u0022 that can work in atmo with just intake air and in space with just liquid fuel, and have more thrust than the Nerv. It is sluggish to respond to the tiller, and I have yet to test its interstellar/interplanetary capabilities. (I know it\u0027s in space and that it doesn\u0027t have a tiller. I\u0027ve been rereading the brotherband chronicles and couldn\u0027t help myself.) I also have a WIP version that will be a landship. ALthough I normally use the Abrams turret as a main armament, I felt the Oerlikon Millenniums were cooler and mroe effective, seeing as of how they shoot high explosives far faster than the abrams and are probably just as damaging. True AA capabilities will be tested with the landship version, since I don\u0027t currently have nay space fighters in that save and a space test would hardly be fair, plus I don\u0027t know how I would due it. Any way, the parts in this mod have now made it into a circular 100km by 100km orbit of kerbin, courtesy of Hyperedit and probably more than an hour of my time."},{"CreatedByName":"GERULA","CreatedById":40633,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-15T20:26:47Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Any chance of a craft file?
