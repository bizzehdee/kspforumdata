Rule when designing a rocket using procedural SRB\u0027s, never place 2 procedurally generated srbs onto eachother. I created an SRB sepatron motor and stuck it onto the 5 segment SRB. this screwed up the engine when it loaded onto the pad somehow. I removed the sepatrons I created and that fixed the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-04T02:32:03Z\u0022 title=\u002210/04/2015 02:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TeeGee\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jovus","CreatedById":117163,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-04T03:34:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFWIW, if you need to insure clean separation, you can probably use an asymmetric fin arrangement instead of a sepatron.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shoe7ess","CreatedById":114974,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-05T06:03:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m having the strangest issue occur when using Procedural SRBs.
