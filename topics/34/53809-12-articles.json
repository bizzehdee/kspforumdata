If you own the game through the ksp store just download a fresh copy and overwrite your current squad folder with it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rbray89","CreatedById":48847,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-30T07:37:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Motokid600\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Motokid600\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell I am at a bit of a stand still here. I have too much time invested on my current mission to reinstall my game and mods. So I need this to work.. All my stock textures are a white out. So I tried what you said rbray a few pages back. Delete the folder lines in the config, run ksp-close-delete mod-restart. Game locks up just before main menu. I figure ok because I have no more compression.. so start deleting mods. One major part pack at a time I stripped my gamedata folder. Each time the same lock up ( and again this is without the mod idk wth happened). Something is wrong.. down. So as is I cannot run my game without 2-4 ( and only 2-4, 1-1 locks up ) and with it I have white textures. .. quite the pickle. Logs don\u0027t show much.. they just end abruptly.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDid you restart ksp after installing and running once? That is likely the cause for stock white textures. It probably siezes if it doesn\u0027t compress the textures to save enough memory to run.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Galane","CreatedById":77949,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-30T08:12:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI put 2-4 in and now I\u0027m getting what looks like Z-order rendering errors in the UI where textures are displayed out of their correct stacking order.
