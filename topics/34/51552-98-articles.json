It totally changes the game and gives you more reasons to do launches other than gathering science. I\u0027m playing with it in conjunction with a variety of \u0022realism\u0022 mods, and it is a great addition to them. But there is an issue that I\u0027m running into: the power demands of antennas! The power demands seem much too high and mean that communication satellites based on real satellites don\u0027t work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, the antennas which seem like logical choices for the main antenna on early, low-orbit comm sats (omnidirectional ones with a few thousand km range) requires power to the tune of 0.1-0.2 units per second. The only photoelectric panel available at the start is the ST1 which generates 1.1 units/min. So to power your antenna you need around 10 panels facing the sun. Fitting this much on a single satellite makes for a pretty big satellite. The smallest I\u0027ve managed able to power an antenna like this had a fueled mass of 5.4 t (admittedly, I could have built it with empty fuel tanks, but as long as it has to be this big I figure it might as well supply a good portion of its own delta v). To make a higher orbit satellite with a dish (say the Comms DTS-M1) the smallest satellite I\u0027ve managed is 6.1 t and a ridiculous part count of 405 because of all the panels. I\u0027m not convinced this even has enough power (I\u0027m still getting it into orbit).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor comparison, early comm sats like Syncom and Intelsat had fueled masses under 100 kg. They only used surface mounted photoelectric panels, like what the early game panels are trying to model. So it would be good for realism if the power demands were such that we could build satellites in this size range and have them work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow of course, if you\u0027re not using ECLSS, you can rely on the power not draining when you aren\u0027t looking at the satellite, but this feels like cheating and it doesn\u0027t solve the problem of how you maneuver the satellite into place without constantly running the batteries dead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut like I said at the start, this is a great mod!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Peppe","CreatedById":51446,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-24T19:27:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Cilph\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Cilph\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOkay, here\u0027s the idea for dish targeting:\u003Cp\u003EMode 1: Target planets.

Without a cone to worry about you could use dishes to relay a signal in much more flexible arrangements. Seems to negate the above, where now you don\u0027t have to worry about picking the right dish for the job. Sizing the dish and cone angle I think makes for an interesting game-play element.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy mode 3 would look at a cone mode to fixed points around the body.

A dynamic way for the sat in this situation when kerbin goes behind the sun/jool to try to relay to a backup planet or list of backups -- until kerbin is available again might be good.

All dishes create cones, and typically anything within those cones, capable of receiving that frequency would be possible to communicate with. this is the entire basic idea behind dishes. whe you point the dish at an area, such as a part of space, anything that passes through tthe cone surrounding that area, within range, will be able to communicate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for your mid-range suggestion, i disagree wholeheartedly.
