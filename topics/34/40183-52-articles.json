MCE compatibility should be working fine in pre-release 4d of KCT. There is an issue when creating a new game and the first launch being a simulation. When reverted the backup isn\u0027t loaded because it doesn\u0027t exist yet, so you still get charged. I think you already know about this bug, but I\u0027m just letting you know. I think you can either go into the VAB, then go back to the Space Center, then back to the VAB once or you can just reset your MCE save after the revert.\u003Cp\u003EMore to malkuth: I had a bit of trouble using the API as even when including the MissionLibrary.dll I was getting null references when calling the LoadBackup function without MCE installed (I realize that won\u0027t do anything, which was the point. The code needed to exist whether it was installed or not) And I also didn\u0027t see a function in the library to tell if MCE was installed or not (to only call the function if MCE was there). I ended up working around it in a way that also made it not required to include the MissionLibrary.dll with my mod.

KCT does have support for RealChute based parachute recovery. I personally have noticed that a drag to mass ratio of about 8 or higher will result in a landing of below 10m/s, which is the primary requirement for me to recover spent stages. Feel free to check out my source (included with the download). It\u0027s in the Kerbal_Construction_Time.vesselDestroyEvent() function.

Then you could give them out for doing missions related to that thing - i.e. do a docking mission and get points dedicated to the tech tree path that leads to better docking rings and rcs thrusters and so on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI imagine an implementation like this: You define a few \u0022lines\u0022 through the tech tree and give them names like \u0022docking path\u0022 and \u0022efficiency path\u0022 and \u0022instruments path\u0022 and so on. Each line is a fixed list defined in the mod: a list of nodes that forms one particular line path from the root of the tree out to one of the leaves of the tree, hitting some tech nodes that relate to a particular type of tech along the way, like the names suggest. Then you track separate totals of MCE science voucher points - one such number for each path defined above, as in \u0022you have 120 points of \u0027docking path\u0027 points, and 50 points of \u0027instruments path\u0027 points right now\u0022. These points are given out as rewards for MCE mission completions in lieu of the current practice of sometimes giving out KSP\u0027s generic raw science points. How do you use them? Well, KSP itself doesn\u0027t know about them, but what you do is that when a player is going to buy a new tech tree node in the science center interface, you check to see if that node is on one of the paths described above, and if the player has any MCE science voucher points for that path. If so, then you discount their purchase of that tech tree node by the amount of voucher points (or add the voucher points back in to their science points after the purchase if you can\u0027t quite force what I\u0027m talking about through the KSP API).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus you\u0027ve invented a sort of dedicated science point system that melts in with KSP\u0027s own generic science points system. Players still get normal KSP science points from normal KSP science things, but then get MCE science voucher points as well that are more dedicated and specific.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy applying each dedicated type of voucher point to a PATH through the tree rather than to one specific node of the tree, you\u0027re ensuring that the points will be usable on whatever the next purchase along that path happens to be. The voucher points would only become useless when you hit the end of that path at the leaf node. At any stage prior to that they\u0027d still be usable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Proply","CreatedById":65418,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-09T09:57:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAm I doing something wrong with this mod?
