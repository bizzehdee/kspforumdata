It is, in fact, usually due to the planet rotation, which moves the \u0027air\u0027 which you fly through. As the air moves with the surface, it pushes you too. So, basically, the rotation does it. Even in real life, pilots must compensate for this, or get a Karmin GPS Unit...lol.

Slower vessels (and fast ones that can\u0027t turn) may not be able to stay aligned with this and small errors will accumulate causing you to not go directly over the polar regions.
