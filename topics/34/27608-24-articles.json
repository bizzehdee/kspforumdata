I hope all parameters be set with tweakables.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso it\u0027s a good idea to set weight per area for wings, and make it proportional to the dynamic pressure limit in FAR. Low-speed planes should be able to have less mass than supersonic wings. Otherwise it\u0027s impossible to make solar-powered planes for example, if realistic engine data is used. That\u0027s what I found when balancing for the electric propeller engines for AJE\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is actually an important feature and would be great if it\u0027s done\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-05T03:01:50Z\u0022 title=\u002205/05/2014 03:01  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 5, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by camlost\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-05T03:12:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIndeed yes!
