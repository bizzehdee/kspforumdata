Even though I\u0027m using 2.1.1.168 I\u0027ve seen this for the past few builds. Maybe starting around 160 or so. I have MJ on a small refueling station with the RCS balancer enabled. When I turned on Smart A.S.S. I got HUGE RCS plumes. I mean freakishly huge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI turned off the RCS Balancer and the behavior stopped. I turned it back on and it resumed. The funny thing is it didn\u0027t seem to be any more powerful than normal RCS as the station didn\u0027t go flipping end over end or use any more fuel than normal. What\u0027s also odd is the game really slowed down while the RCS thrusters were firing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis has been happening on just about anything I put RCS on. Rockets on the pad, stations in orbit, satellites, etc. It doesn\u0027t happen all of the time either. It\u0027s kinda random. If it starts I can focus on something else and come back and it\u0027ll generally stop. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been trying to find a trigger event but so far the only common thing is MJ.
