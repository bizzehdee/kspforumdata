Good counter argument. Maybe just nerf its reaction wheels a bit. I feel like it should be a far cheaper, weaker alternative to the currently OP Mk1 capsule. The Vostok decoupler is just kinda pointless for anything else besides Vostok recreations. It\u0027d be nice if it were a bit of a multi-tasker.

I use both the white and the gray radial mono prop spheres for all kinds of other things, so I\u0027d be sad to see them go. I think Squad\u0027s part count restriction is silly anyways. I understand mass and cost restrictions, but not \u003Cem\u003Enumber\u003C/em\u003E of parts. I should be able to put as many parts on as I please as long as the pad doesn\u0027t crumble underneath the weight, and I can afford it. What can I say, I like greeble.
