With the \u0027extra height\u0027 function the fairings work pretty decent. I don\u0027t know what you mean by \u0027play well\u0027 regarding the RL-10, seems to work just fine.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDidn\u0027t know it was a known issue, sorry about that. And by play well I mean when you attach the engine to the bottom of the DCSS LOX tank it doesn\u0027t form the truss and fuel piping if you use a proc fairing to circumvent the adapter sizing issue. All minor graphical concerns, as always you guys do a wonderful job. Keep it up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
