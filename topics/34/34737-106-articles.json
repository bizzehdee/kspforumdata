This part is about the max volume that I permit. The lifter is my light/medium Soyuz style launch system. The payload is very light for this and so I have no aspargus staging and in fact the boosters are only 50% full of fuel and the center (spindly) stage 2 has the lower tank section locked or I could put this into orbit on the boosters alone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is a link to a video I made of the entire launch sequence.
