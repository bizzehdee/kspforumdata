It was my first resource mod and i remember it fondly. I did like the hex grid layout and scanning. What I didn\u0027t like was the fact that I had to be focused on the ship. What I preferred to do with Karbonite (which should come back once scansat is updated) is get my satellites scanning around several bodies in the background while flying something else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, regarding stock, everyone keeps harping on the instant orbital scan, which is only one part of the process, and only gives you a basic \u0022is it there\u0022 result. In order to really know an appropriate location you really need to actually like, LAND and take a sample. Actually this becomes more time and work than Kethane. Honestly I have found it to be a fun and different challenge. With Kethane I just need to send out a scanning satellite. Pretty much the same satellite works for every body in the game. But when I have to ground truth, I then have to develop a landing system that doesn\u0027t just work everywhere, depending on gravity/atmo/# biomes etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe bottom line is that everyone can use what they find suits them best (yay mods). I just wanted to clarify what seems to be the perpetuation of somewhat misleading and incomplete information.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"novogeek","CreatedById":62377,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T05:41:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi everyone ... have mainly been a lurker around these parts for a while ... but this morning I compiled Kethane against KSP 1.0.2 and ran some quick tests ... everything seems to be working as expected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have uploaded the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/xoe7t3alwc7tg6g/Kethane.dll?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKethane.dll\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/idm71gjr91jt2ai/GeodesicGrid.dll?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EGeodesicGrid.dll\u003C/a\u003E up to my DropBox if you guys want to try it out.

First off, yours was actually quite legible MisterFister. I\u0027m not sure about the run-on sentences comment, it was a thoughtful and specific response. Secondly, goldenpsp clearly said what he thinks was missing information: he believes the stock system isn\u0027t a magic button one-and-done approach as you described. He said while it is true it lets you know whether or not the resource is there, you still have to consider the landing vehicle depending on the location you are trying to land to take a surface sample.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
