The last release you made fell awkwardly from my perspective, I wanted to try it but by the time I found out about it 0.90 was out and it\u0027s listed for 0.25, so I gave it a miss after trying it and the engine values being off in stock KSP. I\u0027ve always liked KOSMOS and I\u0027m sad it\u0027s not being updated. I\u0027d use it (with an alternative Soyuz and Proton, if they come along) instead of Tantares in a heartbeat if it was up-to-date, and maybe used a shade less RAM, as it\u0027s more accurate and realistic and has URM (which is a great system).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy suggestion would be if you have little or no time to work on it then turn it over to the community and let someone else help or carry it on.
