The existing adapter definitely fits 2.5m rockets, assuming you attach to the correct node. If you attach to the wrong one, there will be an air gap, but that\u0027s a user-error, not a problem with the mod. But I suspect you\u0027re not committing that error, but are instead arguing about the aesthetics of the slight size difference, which is, of course, an opinion.

I get no money either way, it\u0027s a free gift to you, and if you don\u0027t want it, that\u0027s fine by me.

I get paid $40/hr for professional development work. Fixing the problems you cite shouldn\u0027t take more than a few hours. I\u0027ll get a contract prepared, and then we can both treat this like a professional transaction. If you aren\u0027t prepared to do that, then disabuse yourself of the notion that the hobbyist you\u0027re talking to who gave you a free gift is required to provide any level of professionalism or support merely because you downloaded it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
