Taking him back inside woudl be very hard.\n\u003E \n\u003E How about draining life support resources from nearest ship? Right now, if resources run low player can take all kerbals on eva and wait few month for right phase angle without using his life support ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\u003E \n\u003E So even on eva kerbals woudl use nearest resources avaible and even when these are depleted, just arraving with rescue ship (with supplies on board) woudl be enough to \u0022bring back to life\u0022 stranded kerbal and allow him to crawl back to pod.\n\nI am actually... believe it or not... kinda ok with it. Because it still prevents mission fulfillment. And if you take that EVA Kerbal and try to have them, after months, re-enter a pod they will promptly ransack it.
