Originally, the hybrids fell into the gap between nuclear engines and ion engines in terms of Isp, but they got rebalanced at some point to be so much closer to nuclear engines in Isp that, once you added in the extra weight needed for xenon and electricity generation, they are strictly worse than just using a nuclear engine in almost all cases, the hybrid\u0027s Isp advantage isn\u0027t large enough to compensate for the delta-V lost to the extra weight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I just took all the hybrid engines in the pack and made them into plasma thrusters of unspecified type that simply used xenon gas and fell betwen nuclear and ion engines in terms of performance.
