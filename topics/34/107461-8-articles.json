I\u0027m not sure how to change that to move the .csv files to the /PluginData folder. I think its a good idea to leave the .png outputs writing to the /Screenshots folder, I guess.. Unless someone presents a better case against it..??.. vOv  \n\nHowever, a BIG thing I noticed, is that the Part folder, specifically the textures, are HUGE, compared to what they could be.
