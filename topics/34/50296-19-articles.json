When re-entering I disintegrate (yeah, I\u0027m still learning about proper re-entry angles etc. and having great fun) but the problem is that every time that happens and I go to the space centre, my mouse won\u0027t highlight any buildings like the VAB etc. I can interact with other tabs as well as the exit tab on bottom right. However, when I do that and exit to main menu, the mouse won\u0027t highlight anything on the menu thus forcing me to alt-tab out and kill the program. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know this isn\u0027t specifically related to this mod (I apologize if this is mucking up the thread), but I\u0027m thinking that some of you must have re-entered badly and burned up or sustained too high gload for too long and ended up disintegrating like me.
