I\u0027m in the process of playing a career and it\u0027s still early in my game. I\u0027m trying to set up a satellite communications network (I use Remote Tech, among other mods), and I don\u0027t have access to a battery bigger than 400 units, nor anything to feed my hungry dish antennae other than solar panels and (wait for it!) fuel cells. I built a workable prototype sat, but in testing I noticed that even though my batteries are fully charged and my solar panels are deployed on the sunniest of days at the KSC, my fuel cell keeps producing electricity (and eating resources) whether or not there is any drain and whether or not there are any other power sources.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I would like is to have a system in which the fuel cell is only active when the solar panels are not, either by detecting activity at a given flow rate or detecting that battery levels are below a certain percentage. I suspect that neither of these are possible, but I\u0027d like to be told I\u0027m completely wrong in my suspicions. Or if anyone has any suggestions, please let me know.
