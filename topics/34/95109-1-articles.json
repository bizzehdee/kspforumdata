Thus, 10x scale Kerbin was born. Regex \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E(I have to capitalize it. It\u0027s at the beginning of a sentence)\u003C/span\u003E realized that this is improper scale for stock parts, which are approximate 64% real life scales and have very bad efficiency. He created the first 6.4:1 Scale config. (Turns out that this is false, a myth created by regex, the stock parts scale is around 40-50%) Others have created forks of this. 6.4x and 64K both do the same thing, but perhaps with a few extra bonus features. Then I, having long played 64K, realized that it was just a tad bit too hard for me, but I didn\u0027t like playing FAR-less, and I didn\u0027t like playing Stock Scale. And playing \u003Cem\u003Ewith\u003C/em\u003E FAR in Stock Scale is just unbelievably easy due to the lack of a souposphere to add an extra kilometer-per-second of delta-v. So I realized that I should roll up my own config. Thus Jumbo32 was born, designed to be a medium-sized challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome have thought of the number 6.4 or 3.2 and thought \u0022That\u0027s not a round number!

Eeloo has an atmosphere, and Dres is spinning waay too fast. This gives the two least visited locations, some more interesting physics to work around, so that you might actually want to visit them for the challenge. Of course, at 5x scale, it will be a challenge. It also includes AtmosphereFromGround adjustments from Kerbal Renaissance Compilation, so the air looks better at ground, also (if you want to try) making it more compatible with KSPRC itself.
