Super realistic. I\u0027m very new to this mod and struggling to learn the science. \u003Cp\u003EI am having real beginners problems so I\u0027m hoping someone can advise me. I have Realism Overhaul, Real Fuels, Race for the Stars pack, FAR and Engineer (I think they are the relevant ones). I have a really simple rocket with a stayputnik and a small stretchy tank and an A4 engine. The tank is filled with the recommended proportions of Kerelox. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen attached to the launch clamp, it ignites and burns. I usually let it burn for a few seconds and then release the clamp. About 1s after I release the clamp the engine turns off, the rocket gets to about 30 m. Why is this happening and what can I do to correct it? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried looking for information earlier in the thread but to no avail. Thanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Tried using thrust limiter on the engine but still shuts off the engine after maybe a second.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat sounds strange, is your rocket spinning fast?

You can\u0027t communicate with the rocket so it doesn\u0027t matter if it is running or not (okay maybe it would have risen above the horizon but that is not a given). I had for example forgotten an antenna so I did notice that problem and tired to figure it out. So you get immediately an notification that no connection is established.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.) Cutting power is (I guess) in most cases the safest way. You should be in orbit when it happens and then it doesn\u0027t really matter.
