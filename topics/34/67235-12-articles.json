This new save/load system is a total rewrite and so not compatible with the save/load system from version 1.12 or older and is the reason no actions will be found if you upgrade a previously played game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you use an auto-save mod? Let me know as I need to add support for these. (See my next post for reasons.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am not aware of any issues or errors and all the tests I do with vessels in game work. However I have not yet don\u0027t a long term game with this version and there are always people who use the mod differently then I expect and test for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETherefore, please run your own tests before dropping this version into your current game, at the very least make a backup of your save file so you can recover just in case I\u0027ve missed something critical.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs this version no longer uses partModules, ModuleManger is no longer required. If you have a previous version of AGX installed and are starting a new game, please be sure to delete the part.cfg file in the AGExt directory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, if you are upgrading AGExt and continuing the same game, I recommend leaving part.cfg in place. By leaving the part.cfg in place, ModuleManger will still add the AGExtModule partModule to all parts even though it is no longer used by AGExt. By doing this, the partModule will still be present in the game for existing ships to use. If you delete part.cfg and continue the same game, the partModule will be missing and KSP will re-order all the partModules on a part and probably causing the resetting to default of all the partModules it moves. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis bug (the re-ordering of partModules) being the reason I re-wrote AGExt to no longer use partModules. Most mods if their partModule resets to default it is not a huge deal from a fun perspective. Because AGExt uses partModules to save its actions though, when this happened all the Actions assigned on a vessel were lost and it was frustrating for the player to have and reset their actions all the time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn terms of using the mod, there are no UI or behavior changes. Features talked about in the last pages of the thread will be implemented over the next few versions.

If a group has a name on Vessel A or Vessel B and they dock, that group on Vessel C (docked vessel) will have that name. If both Vessel A and Vessel B have a group name, the group name of the vessel being docked to will be used and the group name of the vessel doing the docking is lost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn undock, both vessels will have the same list of group names that the vessel did before undocking. This means that there will probably be groups with a group name but no action assigned, but as these groups are hidden when not editing actions, this is not a big deal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeysets:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe current version (1.13e) does not save Keysets. When you dock, the vessel created by the docking will have the keyset of the vessel that was docked to. On undock, both vessels created will have the same Keyset that the big vessel before undocking did. I am currently investigating how to return this to the old way of saving keysets on the docked vessel, but we will see what I can come up with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVersion 1.13f:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Add mouse over detection so when you are mouse-over a part in the selected parts list, or mouse-over an assigned action in the current actions list (these lists are in two different windows), a black and yellow square will now display over the center of that part.
