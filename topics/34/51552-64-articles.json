If that means you have now closed the final communication channel, so be it. The last thing the satellite was told was that it should no longer communicate. However, it is very easy for you to render a satellite inoperable by doing something to some other satellite, or just passing through a black spot for those few satellites it is set to communicate with. In which case, for me at least, I would like to still be able to tell this now connectionless satellite where to point to to try to get that connection back, and I would rationalise it as saying it is a tiny boot strap program on the satellite but it is easier for the mod to simulate it via having me tell it where to connect to. Now I realise there are some who feel even that is too \u0027cheaty\u0027.

I can see the appeal of options 1 for most players, it is the most stringent way of dealing with the situation. Options 4, 5 and 7 all allows dishes to be activated, which I think is a bit too much, especially when you consider the last thing you told that satellite was to stop listening for commands. I think 6 is nice ideas from a players point of view, but implementation wise would be too much. So yes, option 2 or 3 is where my money is at, I think that the delay imposed by option 3 would be a PITA to have to deal with, but it would be a fair punishment for not planning things out properly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI see 3 and 8 as the best options.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother option, though unlikely, complicated and other negative words, is to work with Maijir and set up some kind of data tether that would allow a spacecraft to communicate with it allowing the dish to be pointed, though ultimately the EVA idea would be easier to implement and perform.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall I support 3 because software already plays a major role in antenna pointing for spacecraft as evidenced by the cause of signal loss for the Viking 1 lander (code update overwrote antenna\u0027s tracking software) so one could assume that software would be written to assist during communications loss. There also is at least one case of re-acquisition of communications with a satellite (thought it was still launching to be honest) after it lost it\u0027s main signal with the launch craft. I believe it was the recent launch of the IRIS craft and the pegasus launcher lost comms with the launching plane and was re-acquired by NASA TDRS.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rokker","CreatedById":15359,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-23T17:30:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022thecoshman\u0022 data-cite=\u0022thecoshman\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EPersonally, I think the correct thing for RT2 itself to do is cut all engines if the vehicle loses connection.\u003Cp\u003EWhat would be really nice is tight integration with kOS. KOS is a mode that let\u0027s your write small scripts, such as \u0027launch to orbit\u0027 scripts, that will be executed on your probe (or manned vessel). It would be nice if there was some way of letting kOS scripts run even if the vessel has no comms connection. Of course the script would have to be started before connection is lost. This does still have the slight issue of what happens if there is a bug in your script that stops it from ever ending, and it keeps the throttle held high and thus unable to change from the vessel... for the sake of game play, might need a way to kill a script... but this is a kOS issue really...\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf/when kOS and Remotetech can work together it would be nice to see an ability to set a program to run in the event of signal loss and also be able to set comms targets from kOS, it would certainly solve this whole failsafe issue and allow me to write my own failsafe.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Evilchicken","CreatedById":12738,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-23T18:46:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat if you set priority levels for each target, with the highest level being the first place to target and more onto the second if the highest priorrity fails to connect, and keep going until the list has run out, after which point the signal is lost and the saterlite keeps checking the list for a connection.

I assumed that the dish would continue pointing in the direction of the active vessel and establish communication with satellite dishes around the body, but this didn\u0027t happen. My solution has been to have two \u0022mission dishes\u0022 on each Kerbin satellite, one pointed at the active vessel, one pointed at whatever celestial body that vessel\u0027s mission is going to take place at. Having \u0022active vessel\u0022 continue to target the active vessel but connect to other dishes in the cone even if it can\u0027t connect to the targeted vessel would be nice, and possibly a bit OP for game balance purposes, as it would eliminate the need for multi-dish satellites around Kerbin in addition to not forcing me to go through my kerbin satellite constellations changing the planetary target as needed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EatVacuum","CreatedById":72754,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-24T22:17:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kami_sama\u0022 data-cite=\u0022kami_sama\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI have a problem, when trying to load the game, the loading bar stops at /RemoteTech2/Parts/Gigadish1/RTGigaDish1, any way to solve it?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDitto - loading version 1.2.7 from Spaceport.
