With version \u00221.whatever\u0022 resources were listed in the same order the standard resources panel works, and in particular electric charge at top, then monoprop, and after other kinds liquid fuel and oxidizer close to each other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I believe they are listed in the order resources are defined when files are parsed across GameData.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIMHO, electric charge at top (given the variability and importance) and LF -OX close to each other (as they are used together with rockets) is best.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW, thanks again for making and still improving this wonderful mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe initial layout in 2.x is the order they get parsed from the resources file yes, but once running you open the Resource Settings and each player can configure up the order and visibility as they see fit (same place where you set the alarm levels for each resource). As you can see in the manual pic below - I do have my Electric, etc at the top, with a separator so I can easily see where fuels start. Clicking the name of the resource or the Alarm percentage button will toggle the display of details for a resource type\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://sites.google.com/site/kspalternateresourcepanel/images/KSPARPMap2-ResConf.png\u0022 alt=\u0022KSPARPMap2-ResConf.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes that make sense?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Oh and you can see that in play in the Youtube Video in the OP\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-19T11:02:43Z\u0022 title=\u002202/19/2014 11:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 19, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by TriggerAu\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"diomedea","CreatedById":93700,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-19T11:49:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Trigger Au\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Trigger Au\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E... each player can configure up the order and visibility as they see fit ...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAWESOME.
