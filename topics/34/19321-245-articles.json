But after this update, NONE of my planes have been flying well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) I have a large plane with loads of wings surface in a delta fashion. This should create tonnes of lift but it isn\u0027t. I require ludicrous speeds to generate any sort of feasible lift. Yes, the plane is heavy but the takeoff speed is 150m/s. Doesn\u0027t seem right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) As I was saying before, with the 20\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 off prograde? Yeah I can\u0027t do that anymore either. 5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 MAXIMUM is what I can do. That same large plane I had can\u0027t stray more than maybe 2\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 away from the prograde marker before I get a \u0022Minor Stall\u0022 warning and start to lose lift. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan anyone explain this to me please? Is it an error in my design, a bug in KSP or bug in FAR itself? I really would appreciate the help because at the moment, I can only \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E make VTOLs and Rockets. Also, cargo bays aren\u0027t shielding any parts. I think lots of people know this now, just letting you know. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ferram4","CreatedById":21328,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-14T21:09:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry the dev version on the github repo.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wermut","CreatedById":121918,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-14T22:03:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESilly question, but how does one go about downloading the dev version from github?

At mach 2, it would instantly bleed off at least 300m/s (at 15km), cause me to pitch way up (even though my CoL is behind the DCoM) and disintegrate.
