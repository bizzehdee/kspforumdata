For example, you could have a single tank hold LiquidFuel, Oxidizer, and Monopropellant in any proportions you like or you could have separate tanks for each. Also, adding new fuels to the tanks is now just a matter of changing one resource config instead of changing each individual tank\u0027s config. It\u0027s a bit more flexible for customization, I feel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) This is just personal preference, but I prefer having a GUI to switch the texture rather than holding a key and clicking to change it. This can also be easily expanded to be able to switch both the band colors and the tank colors (if I ever get other textures for them made up) independent of each other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t really looked at the Stretchy Tanks plugin much, so I\u0027m not completely aware of it\u0027s capabilities.
