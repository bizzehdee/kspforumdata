How it\u0027s done is as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. You put a small QBE probe with wheels and solar panels and a single docking port onto the end of a KAS winch that has a stack connector attached to it.

When you want to use the KAS mouse, you release it via the winch and undock it via the KAS GUI. Then, drive it up to the fuel tug and dock it as its own independent craft.

(The mouse is very light, so you\u0027ll definitely want to drive it in docking mode!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Open up the KAS GUI for the winch and dock.

Order of operations is critical here!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6.

How it\u0027s done is as follows:\u003Cp\u003E1. You put a small QBE probe with wheels and solar panels and a single docking port onto the end of a KAS winch that has a stack connector attached to it. This effectively makes the QBE a separate craft that you can undock, but also keeps it permanently attached to the miner.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. When you want to use the KAS mouse, you release it via the winch and undock it via the KAS GUI. Then, drive it up to the fuel tug and dock it as its own independent craft. This gives you the miner as one craft, and the KAS mouse \u002B fuel tug as another. (The mouse is very light, so you\u0027ll definitely want to drive it in docking mode!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Open up the KAS GUI for the winch and dock. Now the miner, mouse, and tug are all docked together safely. You have to do it in this order.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Mine and convert fuel to your heart\u0027s content!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. When done, undock the mouse from the miner via the KAS GUI, then switch to the fuel tug/mouse and manually undock the mouse from the fuel tug. Order of operations is critical here!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Retract the mouse to docked-with-KAS-winch position, send the fuel tug on its way, and there you have it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI highly recommend quicksaving before doing any docking or undocking with KAS. If a craft gets \u0022stuck\u0022 after undocking, quicksave and quickload and it will revert to being able to be moved.
