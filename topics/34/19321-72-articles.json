I myself quit placing engines at angles due to the difficulty in controlling the craft when under thrust. But later I found out that it also increased drag. \u003Cp\u003EJust wait till you get it flying correctly then you put a cargo in the bay and it throws the whole thing out of whack again!

SAS will take care of adjusting the gimbal through the center of mass. However the static angling is still necessary to give it some headroom. This way, its perfectly possible to launch a piggyback shuttle with varying payloads that is stable at ascent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, SSTOs have advantages and disadvantages... well lets not bring this discussion to this thread.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI do love your shuttle though.

I know the real life shuttle has a really high landing speed, 214-226mph (94-101m/s) according to the NASA site. In comparison a F-16 lands around 138-195mph. I am glad that you have it working, from the graph it is far more controllable than one of my less stable SSTOs. That thing is a nightmare when it drops from supersonic speeds.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
