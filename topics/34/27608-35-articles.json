I just don\u0027t know, i managed in previous versions to make more or less successful SSTO\u0027s... but with the current version I just can\u0027t, they won\u0027t make it... and i believe i\u0027m pretty experienced when it comes to gameplay... Though I watched dozens of tutorials and I know most of the rules that apply to building an ssto... I know FAR was changed to better reflect real life aerodynamics... Is it harder with the current version or am I doing something clearly wrong???\u003Cp\u003EBasic rules i follow=\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) CoM slightly ahead of CoL\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Control Surfaces only managing the needed movement (pitch or roll or yaw, could do pitch and roll or yaw)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Most times delta wings or some kind of modification of it...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Ascent profile, as fast as you can until 10k \u002B/-reached, then decrease the AoA to gain as much speed as possible while still raising altitude a little bit, when engines are about to choke, throtle down and keep doing it until you have to change mode or switch engine, by then you should have around 1.3/1.5 m/s at least... then circularize, blah blah...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAm i that bad when it comes to building a SSTO????\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI believe you mean km/s, unless you want to be going a few inches forward every second.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blowfish","CreatedById":119688,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-15T19:46:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think the attachment node on the SP\u002B procedural wing might be off by a bit - as it is the wing doesn\u0027t even intersect the hull of the ship it attaches to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i274.photobucket.com/albums/jj251/blowfishpro/KSP/Debug/2014-10-15_00001_zps2e6f03ac.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222014-10-15_00001_zps2e6f03ac.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, it seems like under FAR the CoL isn\u0027t updating as a bring the wingtip back. ferram4 informs me that this may be an issue with PWings:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i274.photobucket.com/albums/jj251/blowfishpro/KSP/Debug/2014-10-15_00002_zpsf0598e98.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222014-10-15_00002_zpsf0598e98.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-15T20:03:53Z\u0022 title=\u002210/15/2014 08:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 15, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by blowfish\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GabeTeuton","CreatedById":116756,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-15T21:57:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022blowfish\u0022 data-cite=\u0022blowfish\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell what\u0027s going wrong?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell i continued to work on it, and I got better at the design i guess... the best i got was getting to 25k, after that it just starts to stall in every possible way... it\u0027s not a flat spin only, or just one deviation... basicaly i loose control of it... entirely...
