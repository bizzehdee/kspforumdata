So you actually made the problem *worse*. Remember that \u003Cstrong\u003EMeth/LOX *is not* Kerosene/LOX, it\u0027s an entirely different fuel-mode\u003C/strong\u003E (more similar to LH2/LOX in ISP and fuel-density). \u003Cstrong\u003EHow many LH2/LOX engines have you nerfed so they match Kerosene/LOX engines in ISP? (that\u0027s basically what you did the equivalent of here)\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou also more than DOUBLED the cost of the part (from 3050 to 6554), while only reducing its mass by 1.3 tons (from 3.5 to 2.2) and increasing its thrust by 25 kN (from 1425 to 1450). And you over-corrected the burn ratio (the ratio you uses is about stoichiometric, whereas the *real* engine burns fuel-rich. The *correct* fuel/LOX ratio should be about .4 to .6 or .39 to .41 instead of .443 to .557 (the previous RealFuels ratio) or .375 to .625 (the ratio you are now using).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, OVERALL, you actually made the engine *less* realistic than it already was. The costs are now too high (the per-unit costs were correct before: Raptor engines would be cheap to manufacture for their performance- remember, they\u0027re meant to be used in clusters of 9 or more... To increase costs realistically, increase the \u0022EntryCost\u0022), the ISP is LOWER when it needed to be made HIGHER (remember, the real-world figure is 321/380- \u003Cstrong\u003Ewhich the RAPTOR *needs* to be able to compete with LH2/LOX, due to its much lower fuel-density than Kerosene/LOX\u003C/strong\u003E), and the mass is too low for an engine that size (the thrust needs to be 59.1% higher than the original instead of the mass being 37% lower if you want to maintain the TWR you choose). Also, remember \u003Cstrong\u003Eif you reduce engine mass without reducing heat production (like you did) you cause the engine to overheat much more easily (I\u0027m not even sure the engine can safely be fired at full-throttle now: which is *not* as issue the real Raptor would have.)\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI drew up and posted below a revised config I\u0027d like you to include.

Players who don\u0027t use EntryCosts can/should be able to still get the engine cheaply- one of the MAJOR advantages of the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raptor_%28rocket_engine%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ERaptor engine\u003C/a\u003E is that it would be *much* cheaper to manufacture due to the less stringent engineering margins Full Flow Staged Combustion enables... (despite its higher performance, the Raptor as currently designed is actually *further* from its theoretical maximum for an engine of its type than current rocket engines designs- to reduce costs and improve reusability...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure you\u0027re aware of the exponential relationship between engineering margins and cost- and the engine was already a bit pricey for a 2.5 meter engine (at least compared to several other mod engines from KW Rocketry and NovaPunch2), so it didn\u0027t make sense to change the per-unit costs... The engine also requires the extremely-advanced Experimental Rocketry tech node- so between the high Science and part buy-in costs (which were already high, and I more than doubled) of the engine, there ought to be more of an economic advantage when simply using it as a heavy-lift engine (considering this is its design real-life role), from a gameplay-balance perspective, or players will never bother to unlock it in the first place...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I changed the ISP to 321/380, the real-world stat. Yes, that\u0027s much better than any Kerosene/LOX engine (as you noticed with the XLS file), \u003Cstrong\u003EAND IT SHOULD BE. Meth/LOX is an entirely *different* fuel-mixture than Kerosene/LOX, more similar to LH2/LOX in its performance *and fuel-density*.\u003C/strong\u003E You wouldn\u0027t nerf LH2/LOX engines to match the ISP of Kero/LOX engines, would you?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I increased the thrust to 2270 kN maxThrust. \u003Cstrong\u003E*This was to respect the TWR you selected before.*\u003C/strong\u003E I came up with this number by calculating the TWR you had before, and implementing it for an engine that weighed 3.5 tons instead of 2.2 tons, then rounding it to the nearest multiple of 5 (from 2267.x to 2270 kN, to make it easier to look at). Keep in mind the *real* 2.5 meter Raptor would produce 8200kN of thrust with a mass of just under 7 tons (6.973 tons, according to calculations from its known thrust and TWR predictions)- so the TWR is still roughly half what it is in real life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I changed the fuel burn-ratio to .39/.61, to make it more fuel-rich (like the real Raptor). The real Raptor burns fuel-rich to improve ISP and reduce heat generation- although I can\u0027t seem to find any hard numbers of precisely how much so. The new ratio you selected before was nearly stoichiometric, however, and thus far too LOX-rich.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease use my version of the config instead in the dev version and next release (I would suggest just pasting this in and pushing a release, if you have the time).

As an explaination:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of this config is produced by the XLS. I don\u0027t code these by hand at all! If I did, I\u0027d never play KSP ever due to my hands cramping from typing. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E As such, if I can\u0027t get the XLS to work with me, it doesn\u0027t happen. So, to make a fundamental change (like adding a new combustion cycle) I kind of have to invent a different wheel. So, for this one I\u0027ve created a FFSC flag that will give a Raptor-like \u0022filter\u0022 to any engine. In detail, the entry cost of the engine is doubled (research costs), the \u0022goal TWR\u0022 target is doubled (to adjust for the lower mass of these engines), and the part cost formula has an additional factor added to halve the cost. What this means is that if you increase the ISP of the engine to match a Raptor-like engine, you\u0027ll get something close to what you described in the posts above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, the new KSPI methane engine has an IspSL of 311 and a IspV of 379. The mass sits at 1.9, and the cost rounds out to about 4200. Thrust is still 1450. Entry cost doubles what is in the KSPI config. All of the other details follow the XLS computations (like heat production, max temp), which I\u0027m inclined to let be. I did realize I goofed up the mass ratio of methalox by a good bit, so I adjusted that to 3.5 from 4.5. Found some data on other methalox engines which finally had this number (the old one was a guess based on \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_rocket_propellants\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis Wikipedia page\u003C/a\u003E with a fudge). \u003Cstrong\u003EAll\u003C/strong\u003E methalox engines have been adjusted as a result.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECost is something I just started adjusting with these configs, so that is still in flux. As of right now they are scaled to thrust/efficiency/mass. So, more thrust = more cost, higher efficiency = more cost, lower mass = more cost. I haven\u0027t had time to dig into the formula that was set up to calculate this, I\u0027m just using it as a base. But as I mentioned somewhere on the thread, the cost is scaled so that the Mainsail cost in stock = Mainsail cost in RFStockalike. Everything else has probably changed some. This also comes with the reduced fuel costs of RF (which I have not touched). So, it\u0027s not really a question of how the costs change from stock, but how they are balanced to each other now. The way I set up the FFSC cycle it should be comparable to another engine of similar thrust/size at a given tech level. So, more efficient for same cost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I really don\u0027t intend on making any real-life analogs in this config. None of the numbers in mod configs are really close to true engine stats, so I\u0027d have to do essentially what the Realism Overhaul folks have already done, but with the added annoyance of scaling these engines to the stock size steps.

So, to make a fundamental change (like adding a new combustion cycle) I kind of have to invent a different wheel. So, for this one I\u0027ve created a FFSC flag that will give a Raptor-like \u0022filter\u0022 to any engine. In detail, the entry cost of the engine is doubled (research costs), the \u0022goal TWR\u0022 target is doubled (to adjust for the lower mass of these engines), and the part cost formula has an additional factor added to halve the cost. What this means is that if you increase the ISP of the engine to match a Raptor-like engine, you\u0027ll get something close to what you described in the posts above.\u003Cp\u003EFor example, the new KSPI methane engine has an IspSL of 311 and a IspV of 379. The mass sits at 1.9, and the cost rounds out to about 4200. Thrust is still 1450. Entry cost doubles what is in the KSPI config. All of the other details follow the XLS computations (like heat production, max temp), which I\u0027m inclined to let be.

The numbers you used (311/379) are still too conservative for Full Flow Staged Combustion (321/380), and don\u0027t allow the Meth/LOX engine to compete effectively with LH2/LOX launch-stages...\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Raptor831\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Raptor831\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ECost is something I just started adjusting with these configs, so that is still in flux. As of right now they are scaled to thrust/efficiency/mass. So, more thrust = more cost, higher efficiency = more cost, lower mass = more cost. I haven\u0027t had time to dig into the formula that was set up to calculate this, I\u0027m just using it as a base. But as I mentioned somewhere on the thread, the cost is scaled so that the Mainsail cost in stock = Mainsail cost in RFStockalike. Everything else has probably changed some. This also comes with the reduced fuel costs of RF (which I have not touched). So, it\u0027s not really a question of how the costs change from stock, but how they are balanced to each other now. The way I set up the FFSC cycle it should be comparable to another engine of similar thrust/size at a given tech level. So, more efficient for same cost.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECost increased from 3050 to 4200 according to your latest post. The thrust is 1450 (compared to 1500 for the Mainsail in stock- but higher in RealFuels with tech-levels). So it actually seems to be about right for the per-unit cost, considering FFSC is *much* more advanced technology (and the EntryCost is doubled to reflect this) designed with greater cost-effectiveness in mind. However, the overall thrust is still too low- the Meth/LOX engine should have a *higher* thrust than the Mainsail (the Raptor has a higher thrust than almost any comparable-sized engine). The mass should also be increased proportionally (the Raptor isn\u0027t as much lighter compared to comparable-sized engines as what you have in the config).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo basically, \u003Cstrong\u003Ethe Meth/LOX engine is still too light and produces too little thrust...\u003C/strong\u003E Players can still lift heavier payloads with a Mainsail in LH2/LOX mode, which should *NOT* be the case (the Raptor enables larger payloads for the same diameter rocket due to the fuel-density advantages of Meth/LOX and the overall thrust advantages of FFSC). Remember, Meth/LOX is a *lower ISP* fuel than LH2/LOX- so if the engine thrust is also lower, players will be stuck with a *much* lower payload-capacity for the engine...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the current balance, players still have ZERO incentive to use the Meth/LOX engine over a Mainsail (which has a lower EntryCost, is available earlier, can achieve higher ISP when in LH2/LOX mode, and still has a higher base thrust even in LH2/LOX mode...) This needs to be changed. Please adjust upwards the engine mass, ISP (to 321/380), and thrust. I would recommend adjusting the XLS equation so that the cost stays at what it currently is (about 4200) when making these changes, with the new figures becoming the FFSC baseline (there needs to be SOME incentive to use the Meth/LOX and other FFSC engines- if you increase cost much further it won\u0027t be worth the *huge* EntryCost...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Raptor831\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Raptor831\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAlso, I really don\u0027t intend on making any real-life analogs in this config.

This should more closely mimic the FFSC improvements that the Raptor engine is trying to achieve. You could technically drop the Isp requirements and decrease the mass for a really hefty TWR. But, really, when using the XLS for this, you\u0027re going to need to play fair, because you can get some insane costs/TWR if you wanted to at respectable Isp, or get some insane Isp for respectable TWR/mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn specifics, the Deinonychus is down to a mass of 1.3, with a thrust of 1425 (which is the \u0022stock\u0022 value I messed up before).
