You know , looking through the config files... seems like this is gonna be a very big job to add it to every single part in the game. Is it possible to make the MM simply add a single module ( and then let the dll take care of generic curves and such? The dll could just read specific values of the part (mass, cost, thrust, fuel type) and provide automatic variation. One single config file could provide global variables. It should make adding the mod to all possible modded parts a breeze. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn top of that, you could make specific tweak to specific parts by adding more parameters to those parts (pretty much as you\u0027re doing now). If not, the generic options and formulas would be respected. This would mean that we\u0027d get all parts from all mods done in one go, and only need to tweak the parts that seem wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESoon it might be a good idea to post a list of proposed parts/failure types in the OP. So people can start to bring in ideas to make the process faster. For example, for engines I\u0027d add \u0022cooling failure\u0022, forcing you to prematurely throttle back (or, in RO, shutdown).
