It\u2019s always bugged me that Kerbals don\u2019t boil or freeze to death when cabin temps are wildly all over the map.  I recognize that the thermal transfer code and time warping make for an almost impossible situation, but Heat Control and NFE seem to have the bits and pieces (and knowledge base) to make for a crude approximation.\n\nI propose a part (or family), tiny enough for Mk1 pods up through 3.75 Station parts and command modules, that utilizes EC to transfer heat between the part(s) they\u2019re attached to, such as a habitable module, and either the existing or alternate heat exchanger parts to maintain an internal temp of 293K on that attached-to part (note: may warrant a tinier heat exchanger and radiator part set for small craft).  Transferred internal part heat and waste heat from the process could be built up as exchanger core heat and removed from the heat exchanger utilizing the existing heat management parts that reach out to the whole vessel.\n\nFor shadowed or outer solar system use, the \u201Cthermostat\u201D would expend EC to heat the hab part.  This may be necessary for solar powered craft only as anything with a reactor should have waste heat to spare, or perhaps not at all in the inner system if there\u2019s plenty of stored core heat from cooling solar loaded hab parts.\n\nIdeally, this \u201Cthermostat\u201D part would also regulate one level of adjacently attached parts, as the stock conformal radiators do, but that might make for too hard a balancing act/feedback loop, which would suggest an unobtrusive tiny part to radially attach to each hab part.  Rather than put the author on the hook for balancing the tech parameters (aside from maybe efficiency), I\u2019d recommend an inflight and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E GUI similar to the NFE engines, where max EC usage can be adjusted by the user, as well as acceptable variation in cabin temp (say up to \u002B/- 10K) to buffer any unforeseen feedback loops.  Without knowing the trade space on solar loading rates and conduction from the rest of the vessel vs overall cooled part size, it may be best to have a logarithmic type EC slider, allowing anything from say 0.01 to 1000 EC/sec to be expended in cooling and heating.\n\nLastly, the heat exchangers may need a core heat temp limiting \u201Ccircuit breaker\u201D that keeps the exchanger from \u201Cpopping\u201D with excessive heating under crazy warp physics and temporarily turns off the \u201Cthermostat\u2019s\u201D heat transfer functions, at least until the radiators get things back under control.  Based on previous experience playing with the DeepFreeze cryosleep mod, ambient parts in the sun at Kerbin can exceed 460K when warp effects and/or reactor heat conduction gets wonky.  I currently set my cryopods to still operate at 500K, then baste the crew while they have a good crust going\u2026.\n\nIn summary, this may still fail when going into or coming out of non-physics warp, but at least the habs would eventually get comfy again, faster than they would with just passive conduction and radiation.  I\u2019ll log this as a GitHub part request and probably link to the post rather than paste it all in."},{"CreatedByName":"Wyzard","CreatedById":162363,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-03T23:48:46Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, KSPrynk said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E It\u2019s always bugged me that Kerbals don\u2019t boil or freeze to death when cabin temps are wildly all over the map.

There\u0027s a fairly simple killer thing - at 1000x\u002B timewarp, all heat in the vessel is redistributed and recomputed to ease calculations. This means that a crew pod with a temperature of 330K will be merged with an engine which has completed a burn at a temperature of 2000K. This fairly unpredictable merging essentially kills most complex uses of the thermal system, particularly in applications that require more than physics timewarp.\n\nSuch a system would have to be implemented completely within the Core heat paradigm, which has it\u0027s own problems.\n\nHowever, throwing aside implementation details, I can\u0027t really fit this into the mandate of HC, which is to provide tools to manage heat in the useable context of KSP... which is more or less limited to cooling devices that produce heat. Limiting and adjusting the temperatures of crewed spaces isn\u0027t something that either KSP or the rest of my mods deal with so it\u0027s pretty strongly out of scope. Really, what I think you want is a whole new mod ([It is very cold in space](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vwHLMs04XA)?) to manage the temperature of crewed spaces as a life support consideration. This could be quite a complex challenge if you are up to it, I don\u0027t think it has ever been really handled by any mod. I mean, you\u0027d ideally create some kind of separation between the stock heat system (let\u0027s call it high flux heat) and the LS heat system (low flux heat), which is important for not dumping reactor heat into crew quarters.
