Version 0.22.0.0 available for KSP 1.1 Turbo Charged!  \n\nThere are still a number of little issues - see changelog. but they are only minor and do not stop DeepFreeze from functioning. I will circle back in the next version to try and resolve these issues but I have to move on to my other mods to get them going for KSP 1.1 first.\n\nChangelog:\n\n    V0.22.0.0 \u0022KSP 1.1 Turbo Charged! - Release\u0022\n    Added first-cut KSPedia Pages - this is really just testing out this feature and is a very rough first cut. Plans to expand and improve this.\n    Support for NEW RPM - JSIAdvTransparentPods - no longer supports the OLD RPM TJSITransparentPods. You need RPM - JSITransparentPods V0.25.0 or above.\n    Support for Kerbalism Mod.\n    Minor Bugs (can live with):\n    ---------------------------\n    1) When you freeze/thaw from internal cam (alternate camera) the camera loses the transform reference point at the end of the process.\n    2) When inside the CRY-0300 with the External Doors closed, if you zoom out strange camera effects mean the door is only partially visible.\n    3) The screen messages when in Cryopod-Camera mode are not showing all the kerbal\u0027s names.\n    4) When you change settings from Stock to Toolbar and change scenes, the toolbar appears, but stock button is still there. A restart or several scene \n    changes fixes it.\n    5) When there is a Kerbal on the ladder in front of the CRY-0300 and the doors are open the Internal Overlays the kerbal and blocks them from view.\n    This is actually an RPM - JSIAdvTransparentPods bug.\n    6) The CRY-0300R has lost it\u0027s ability to show cool Window Freeze/Thawing animation effects.\n    Issues with release:\n    --------------------\n    Background Processing is not available under KSP 1.1. Unless the mod author updates it soon I will look to put my own EC background processing\n    into DeepFreeze. For now if you are using EC usage the non-Background Processing method still works (it plays catch-up when you swith to the vessel).\n    There is no version of TAC LS for KSP 1.1 - so it is not currently supported."},{"CreatedByName":"Apollo13","CreatedById":74572,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-24T16:42:23Z","Content":"Thanks for updating.

Sorry, I haven\u0027t browsed the whole thread so quite likely I\u0027m not the only one mentioning some of these. I\u0027ve made up pack with this mod and USI kolonization and what felt lacking.\n\n1) Needed 1 big round canister for cryoliquid with no symmetry problems whatsoever.\n\n2) Needed \u0022recipe\u0022 or module to manufacture cryoliquid from say polymers, chemicals and water.\n\n3) needed possible option of making cryovats slowly drain their machinery pool under USI and that pool being only replaceable via someone\u0027s EVA and KIS.\n\n4) with all of the above in mind, might want an extra model of cryovats with everything included, even a non-refuelable reactor with 2 years of fuel comprising a two year (\u002B- temperature around) escape pod that could, besides other things, be used as a contract item.\n\n5) late tech emergency awakening system. If connected to a pod, catches conditions leading to kerbal death and interrupts cryosleep using separately stored energy (in maybe a one-use turbine generator) and possibly sends out a game pausing message like a kerbal alarm clock.\n\n6) possible different variations of \u0027difficulty\u0027 or complexity of this mod toggleable through config, the complex one being a choice between several modes of kerbal storage. a) major freeze being what it is now, but needing scheduled reanimations for two weeks every half a year to let damaged bodies recuperate, decativation due to power failures etc has 80% chance to kill and 20% to wake, missing scheduled reanimation sequence leads to increasing chances of death from 1% at day one to 50% from overdue day 100 and on. Last feature of this mode is several hours long thawing. b) stasis - full freeze requiring late game tech and energies of 300\u002B/sec per kerbal to run with 95% fatalities on power failure. Extra feature of this mod is that activation and deactivation of stasis field could require 20Kish energy, and possibly the working devices could also require larger drain on machinery and specialized parts. c) sedated sleep. This could be an alternative early mod to (a), requiring less power, being safe from fatalities, but instead of switching kerbals off completely it would make the inactive command wise while still draining 1/5 of NOMS or other life support items they\u0027d normally drain. this mode might require a different chemical type to be constantly drained during such forced inactivity.\n\nThis post was brought to u by a selfish user who does not care how u do things, he just shares what more he\u0027d want from an item. The positive side is the item was actually good enough for people to enjoy it and hope it gets even better.
