I\u0027ve spotted two bugs, came up with a suggestion, and coded out a submission for your consideration. Snjo said I should post them here, so....well here they are XD\u003Cp\u003EFirst, the bugs. Transferring ammunition into a turret that isn\u0027t in transfer mode eats it. Instead of being returned to the ammo crate, it just blinks out of existence. Also, the CWIS turret \u0022jumps\u0022 off its mounts when you try manually aiming and firing with it. I\u0027ve also encountered the jumping when I set up an anti-air test using the IFF tags and a plane. The final bug is that objects attached to the top of the tank turret or the barrel of the cannon fail to move when it does. They just hover in place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHi, Thanks for the post.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ammo one I was aware of, one of those things that I just haven\u0027t had the time to squash!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe CIWS \u0027shouldn\u0027t\u0027 be manually aiming. You simply double click a target and it will rotate to the target. I\u0027ll be looking into this if you\u0027re saying it\u0027s moving when pressing keys! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne issue with jumping might be the code for KSP connection strengths was changed. The connection strength on the turret is probably now too high, also the turret since it holds so many rounds is very heavy - a common issue is that if mounted to a part that has less than 1/10 it\u0027s own mass.. it gets \u0027attached like a wet noodle\u0027 syndrome. I think I may have made a mistake by connecting it to a stock KSP panel. Try a redesign with the breakingForce = 200 and the breakingTorque = 200 - attach it to a heavy part and see if it still behaves strange. Could also be that it attaches in a clipped position. I intended it to clip in a bit on the surface attach. Making a bottom stack attach point and using that might make for an improvement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes... Nothing on the turret will move. Unfortunate but that is really a mod in itself in the form of DR or IR (robotics). I simply didn\u0027t have the time to see how they managed to do it and implement my own code. I suggest slapping an IR rotatable of the correct size under the turret. It then supports adding items to it as it should! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the suggestions, I\u0027ll look at your node placement for the vehicle tub, as you assumed it\u0027s one of the parts that was a placeholder - that was never finished, it\u0027s mostly covered in many applications so I cut a corner with that one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETanya: I\u0027ll surely talk to you about ideas.

Not sure if that is still the plan but that frame work could play wonders in the area of npc combat vehicles and bases. But even more so it implies with this mod and territory control, KSP could be the ultimate 4x type RTS multiplayer experience.
