Our Director of Kerman Resources and Facilities Maintenances, Sigourney Kerweaver prides herself on a 100% success rate with her patients. To that end, if she were to schedule another session with you she would no longer have a 100% success rate. An unacceptable situation which would lead to her suffering depression and immediately being reassigned to a convalescent position on our SRB test firing range.\n\nAs a result of careful consideration, she has pronounced you cured! Congratulations! \n\nIn Good Mental Health,\n\nThe Grand Designer\n\nVoidryder\u0027s Aerospace\n\nPost Script: Pleases send CMES remittance for psychiatric re-education session.

Yanfret It was awhile back I inquired about the very large reaction wheels in the fuel tanks. I can\u0027t quite remember what you said, but I think it was something along the lines of it being for testing. Now I\u0027ve really yet to sink my teeth into your mod so I\u0027ve not actually tried much of the parts. But when scrolling through I see the fuels tanks have some 50-100 units of reaction wheel torque. What\u0027s the purpose of this? \n\nI plan on.. if possible... Making a module manager .cfg that removes any and all reaction wheels from my game, including this mod. I personally find them way too convenient. So when it comes to CMES will removing those large reaction wheels harm anything other then maneuverability?"},{"CreatedByName":"YANFRET","CreatedById":90547,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T20:15:00Z","Content":"Yeah great question.\n\nSince we last talked about that something else came up related to 1.0.2...\n\nThe Bobcat core stage for SLS and MLS no longer has working gimbal, as of 1.0.2 it is reversed and there is no way to fix it. Until our next generation core stage model comes online, the only way to fly the part is with gimbal disabled, and huge sums of reaction wheel force to compensate. \n\nAnother reason we are still using reaction force on a number of parts relates to KSP gameplay vs how real space missions are flown.\n\nWhen you have giant big heavy things that need point a certain way, the RCS force affects orbital trajectory. In real life they sit down and do the math and plan out every single RCS firing according to a plan.\n\nThis is not fun or convenient in KSP. To make it easier on the user, the option of using SAS force to orient a vehicle while transferring to another planet is available, because many Chaka parts have substantial SAS power."},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T20:34:27Z","Content":"Right on Yanfret thanks for the explanation. Maybe I\u0027ll rethink my anti reaction wheel approach for CMES lol. Yeah I noticed unbalanced rcs will wreak havoc on your trajectory. Unbalanced SAS will do that too I find. Not saying your stuff is unbalanced, but I imagine it could be given a user\u0027s creativity. For instance if someone tried to make that mars ship posted a few pages back. \n\nI can\u0027t imagine what the large SAS will do on such a craft if the SAS wasn\u0027t aranged accordingly."},{"CreatedByName":"YANFRET","CreatedById":90547,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T21:24:07Z","Content":"Yeah, one place we run into trouble in particular is the Duna landers and Monkey Transfer Vehicle. The Duna landers all have high power RCS ports at their top area to give the user the most possible control on entry. If a heatshield tumbles back due to a particular entry angle and rate, and the craft were to become unstable, we want the user to have the best chance of getting to the ground safely. Those high power RCS ports are small, low geometry and have zero texture mass ( single dark grey pixel )... so they are somewhat hard to find in space, and requiring the user to disable and then re enable them individually to do a balanced RCS guided transfer orbit would be a mess. So SAS steps in and makes the process more *Kerbal*.\n\nOn the Transfer Vehicle, those giant drop tanks need the high power RCS ports to maneuver for assembly docking, and are pretty handy for certain maneuvers, but having to rely on them alone to guide the transfer orbit adds all those trajectory variances, so it\u0027s nice to be able to shut them all off and still orient the ship.\n\nIn previous versions of KSP all that was more of a struggle, but in the newer versions the SAS is pretty smart so it does a fair job of balancing things as we have it set up now."},{"CreatedByName":"Drakenex","CreatedById":114246,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T23:31:11Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E AKA the Giant Wet Spaghetti Noodle Ship.
