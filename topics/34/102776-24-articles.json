I found with the (default) settings that a stock install of KSP adding Kopernicus and your alternate textures increased RAM usage by an average (I did 5 runs each scenario) of 195MB from stock. Texture replacer will not remove textures, but it does destroy them when it is swapping out to a new one!\n\nBy using Texture Replacer to add dummy textures to all of the original planets when the game loads, you can vastly reduce how much RAM is used when Kopernicus goes through and adds your new textures. I have created 8x8 pixel pink textures (1x1 loaded inconsistently or INCREASED RAM usage- wth?) for all of the original planets for use with Texture Replacer. These tiny textures can be swapped to by Texture Replacer and then overwritten by Kopernicus, they will STILL be loaded but they are incredibly tiny and still net a positive outcome.\n\nUsing this method I had the following results (RAM usage, not disk space):\n\nKopernicus \u002B New Textures = \u002B 195MB over stock\n\nKopernius \u002B New Textures \u002B Texture Replacer \u002B Dummy Textures = \u002B 46MB over stock\n\nI am not sure if you would want to add the dependency of Texture Replacer, but if you wanted to check this out or maybe include it in a future pack I wanted to inform you about what I was messing with.\n\n[NH_DummyTextures](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_CrRC_HheiDdUVQemQtQXFEYmc/view?usp=sharing) (copy over TextureReplacer- should be no overwrites unless you already have alternate planet textures in place)"},{"CreatedByName":"KillAshley","CreatedById":128696,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T21:31:01Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \\*snip\\*\n\nYeah I was thinking of creating a texture replacer dependancy too, I knew it would increase the usage considerably using just kopernicus however creating the config for it is pretty simple for me so i thought at least it\u0027s an easy test to see how they look properly and get some feedback on any tweaks. I\u0027ll have a look further into it when i delve back into that part. I want to get some more work done first on other things, such as the clouds and the stars. I\u0027ll use your example for the beta 2, cheers...texture replacer is still a little new to me, so I didn\u0027t want to dive straight into it before I had feedback on the basics ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T21:47:16Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E @eddiew, I\u0027m gonna PM you a config, can you test it out and see if it helps?

The contracts for \u0027explore planet X\u0027 are generated by distance so you should get the closer ones first, and the expanded contracts for individual planets (temp scans/EVA/rovers/etc) should come in after the \u0027explore planet X\u0027 are completed. Of course I have no idea how to properly trigger them, whether its based off rep or something else is beyond my knowledge!\n\n@fallout, if you find any major issues, or have any suggestions just let me know dude!
