And as I\u0027m using the Outer Planets mod, this is a key component of my long-distance missions. But alas, I digress!), but I\u0027ve encountered a bit of a problem with that plan. It is that the \u0022kontainers\u0022 do not appear to have the ability to store monopropellant, liquid hydrogen, xenon, or resources from other mods(such as Argon from Near Future, which I\u0027ve been using to fuel most of my long range ships).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could use other fuel tanks for the other resources, but that would ruin the entire idea of having each freighter be identical except for the type of stuff it carries.

I immediately built a high-rise apartment and put it on the Mun... The thing was carrying 64 kerbals! The mission was successful though i didn\u0027t pick the best landing spot, then lost my landing gear when I tried to reposition... Anyway. Here are my rambling, disjointed thoughts... The more 5m parts that become available, the more I\u0027m hurting for a 5M coupling solution. My idea, which I am thinking about doing myself, is to build an orbital spacedock using the newly abandoned Stanford Toruses kit with the IXS spacedocks... (recruiting 3D d00dz for that effort) A 5M docking system does not seem reasonable. Extraplanetary launchpads seems to have a severe (and unspecified) limitation with respect to the scale of the ships it can construct, therefore a system to use KAS-like assembly at large scale might be a viable solution. Especially with respect to payload modules that can weigh upwards of 1,000 tons. This brings me to my problem...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI want to design a propulsion module consisting of your nukular (sic) reactor, a few LH tanks, and a quartet of 2.5m motors from a certain specific unspecified mod... Ok... that\u0027s going to weigh a few hundred tons, which is not a problem, but your 5m -\u0026gt; 2.5m quad adaptor does not have any provisions for mounting on a lower stage, I would have to launch it upside down and balance everything on a 3.75m docking ring... (0.90 has severe wobble/oscillation problems...) The Proc Fairings thrust plate might work but that center node could be a problem. The future of that mod and that procedural thrust plate are in doubt as that mod is being assimilated by the Borg.... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe provided engines look quite good for medium-duty cruising but they would need to be at least ten times more thrusty to be used as first stage engines... On orbit, you generally want to concentrate more on payload and high efficiency...\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
