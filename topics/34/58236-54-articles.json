That part will happen pretty definitely unless steps are taken to correct the problem. Right now that means deliberately venting the gas off before the pressure buildup becomes a problem. Refrigeration has been talked about a lot (such as \u0027zero boil off\u0027 or ZBO) but to my knowledge no ZBO systems have ever actually flown. Another solution that has been discussed is enclosing a LOX tank inside of an H2 tank. As the H2 tank boils off it carries away enough heat to prevent the LOX tank from heating above its boiling point.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DracovaXIV","CreatedById":97121,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-21T10:11:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EInteresting.

Some have ablative combustion chambers (which will go boom if you keep firing long enough and the wall ablates away), some have ablative nozzles, and all of them will suffer component wear in the super-high-temperature, super-high-pressure environment that is the pump, the turbine, the combustion chamber, and the nozzle. If the engine is pressure-fed you can ignore the first two (which would go a long way in explaining why almost all \u0022orbital maneuvering engines\u0022 like Transtage, SPS, the Shuttle OME, etc, are pressure-fed.*)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*And, for that matter, all derivatives of the same Aerojet engine that was designed for the Aerobee sounding rocket in the early 50s, used on Vanguard (our first launcher), and is even proposed for Orion. Note that the RL-10 is also a common \u0022space taxi\u0022 engine, but its cycle (expander) is also a decent one for relighting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, to ensure that propellant *stays* in the feed lines and the pump doesn\u0027t have to work too hard, you need to pressurize your tanks to a higher level than you might otherwise (note that *all* tanks are pressurized, but the ones for pressure-fed engines are much, \u003Cem\u003Emuch\u003C/em\u003E more pressurized).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo: pressure-fed means lower performance. Reliability means lower performance and higher cost. Adding multiple uses to an ignition system lowers reliability and increases cost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, there\u0027s nothing preventing many rocket engines from being ignited more than once as long as the total runtime doesn\u0027t go over-limit and the three issues are seen to: engines undergo acceptance testing (a test fire) before they\u0027re launched, generally. But that test fire is done on a test rig, where 1-3 are assured, and is short enough that there\u0027s still enough life left for the actual use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPart of what made the Shuttle so insanely costly was the requirement to refurbish rather than replace the SSMEs (after, it must be pointed out, they were subject to an entire ascent\u0027s worth of firing, *and* a reentry).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-28T05:03:42Z\u0022 title=\u002208/28/2014 05:03  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 28, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by NathanKell\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shad0wCatcher","CreatedById":98819,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-28T07:36:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFair enough.
