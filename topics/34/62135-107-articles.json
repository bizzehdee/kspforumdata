Either because that rocket design has a flaw or because the rocket engine being used lacks a bottom attach node. Far uses attach nodes size in its drag calculations. Engines without attach nodes of the appropriate size would be prone to flipping. I\u0027m going to test that out later today. I\u0027ll specifically check if adding an attach node to the engine or leaving the bottom of the fuel tank bare with multiple radially attached engines helps with the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-17T20:30:04Z\u0022 title=\u002204/17/2014 08:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 17, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Starwaster\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Westi29","CreatedById":80595,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-17T19:52:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/afDOTDS3yFY?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe 48th of my STS KSO Shuttle Missions and 4th flight of the Rebellious!
