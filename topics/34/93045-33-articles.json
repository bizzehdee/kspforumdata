After the ejection burn, I still had about 1/3rd fuel left on the Centaur stage. Normally for an interplanetary flight I\u0027d dump the Centaur after the ejection burn but I knew I was going to make some very minor course adjustments and wanted to use the Centaur\u0027s RCS to make those adjustments. First adjustment wasn\u0027t going to be until 120 days into the flight, though, so I went back to mission control and did other stuff. Day 120 comes around so I jump back to the flight and my Centaur still have something like 2500dV of fuel. I can\u0027t say for sure exactly how much fuel I had after the ejection burn but I assume that a 120 day flight would boil off basically all the LH2.
