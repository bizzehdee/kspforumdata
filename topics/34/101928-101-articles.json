Until you complete the action the part is considered to be in the container, and distance is checked relative to the container. If I do mass check on the drag start then limit will start checking even when moving items between two containers. Though, may be it\u0027s a right thing to do: if you cannot pull out heavy part then you also cannot move it into another container.\n\u003E \n\nI see currently two mass\u002Bdistance checks, one on mouse hover with \u0027G\u0027 key pressed and second on \u0027drag complete\u0027. I think that the mass\u002Bdistance check on \u0027drag complete\u0027 is unnecessary and it wasn\u0027t there in 1.0.5. The first mass check on mouse hover will disallow grabbing the part anyway.

Otherwise you\u0027ll be able to pull out 2t from inventory but won\u0027t be able to put it back. I agree that carrying parts outside of inventory is continent but I\u0027d not say it should be implemented this way. I\u0027ll see if I could restore old behavior while not breaking or over complicating other things. Technically, checking limits around active kerbal when completing drag operation may fix the issue.
