(my computer is rather weak and I heard MechJeb is not good cooperating with FAR...)\u003Cp\u003EThe launch rebalance after the patch is OK, I can reach the orbit with two- or three stage rocket of reasonable cost and start weight. But when I try to reenter, the capsule is exploding in upper atmosphere. I am using MK-1 pod with stock 1.25m heat shield. With default thermal settings it exploded even before burning the ablator, because shield surface temperature was too high. I tried to install Death Reentry and tweak heating in alt-f12 menu. It got somewhat better, but but it still burns all the ablator very fast and explodes at altitude ~90km at speed ~6.5km/s. I guess, DR 1.25 shield would be even worse because it has less ablator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess it is because the pod become much heavier due to MM patch, but thermal parameters were not adjusted properly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs it even possible to have a working reentry with the abovementioned MM patch?
