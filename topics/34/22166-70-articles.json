Liquid fuel and Oxidizer has to be connected directly to the convertor, either stacked to it or via fuel line. Kethane tanks, Monopropellant tanks and zenon tanks can be anywhere to be filled/used.

(There\u0027s really no way for KW to conflict with Kethane except by eating up RAM.) I\u0027m surprised you\u0027re getting graphical glitches rather than a complete crash, but who knows what tricks Unity tries in low memory conditions.\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve analyzed the grid changes several times and concluded it uses less memory. The savings are even greater when you start using mods that add additional resources. The geodesic scan masks are a lot more memory-efficient than the old uncompressed textures. Not that any of that matters; the plugin never used more than a few megabytes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason this is showing up in 0.7 is probably because Unity is doing something behind the scenes to avoid crashing, and the presence of the grid object in the map view trips it up. This is a case of Kethane revealing an unrelated problem. Like I said, the grid renderer is completely disabled when you uncheck the box; there\u0027s nothing I could have done wrong with the shader or anything else that would cause the artifact to appear when the grid is turned off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not the standard response.

I did not mean that is your standard response, only that is what I usually get when there are glitches, or graphics problems on any software. Before I installed KWRocketry your Kethane 0.7.2 worked nicely for me.
