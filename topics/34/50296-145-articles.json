One of the highest real-world values is the reinforced carbon-carbon leading edges on the Shuttle, which are structural and rated for up to 1,500 \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C, although RCC can be very brittle. RCC may even be able to go higher than 1,500 \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C. A lower-temperature but tougher material is titanium metal, which can maintain structural strength at 600-800 \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C (600\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 is the safe end, 800\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 is pushing it pretty hard and may lower lifetime). Stainless steel can do a similar temperature range as titanium but is generally too heavy for aerospace uses. The Shuttle actually used an aluminum structure that could not go above 175 \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C without failure, plus lots of lightweight non-structural insulation to keep the heat away from the aluminum. The \u0022high-temperature reusable surface insulation\u0022 tiles (rigid silica-fiber foam, 94% empty space) are ultra-lightweight and can tolerate up to 1250 \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C, but are very delicate with respect to mechanical impact. The \u0022flexible insulation blanket\u0022 is a lightweight silica-fiber cloth that can handle up to 650 \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C, probably a good minimum value for part maxTemp unless it\u0027s something explicitly never intended to handle reentry. Easier to work with and less likely to shatter than the tiles. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShort summary: Reinforced carbon-carbon = 1,500 \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C or higher, titanium 600-800 \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C, other structural materials rely on insulation rather than inherent temperature tolerance. Space Shuttle silica fiber foam tile insulation = 1,250 \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C, silica fiber cloth insulation = 650 \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C.
