View full album](//imgur.com/a/NpfaW)\n\n**Radiator Panels**\n\nAvailable in two sizes, the radiator panels offer a solution for actively dissipating heat from your vessel. While they passively (in terms of actual heat removal - the heat draw across the vessel is an active function of the stock module) function in the same manner as the stock radiator panels, they have an additional active heat dissipation function which will help quickly remove heat from your vessel. This mode must be activated via action groups or the right click menus. As a trade-off, they are a good bit heavier than the stock panels, and they are significantly less effective at drawing heat off the vessel in passive mode as they rely more on conduction. This means they will actually need to be attached to a heatsink or AHMS unit for maximum effectiveness.\n\n**Heatsinks**\n\nHeatsinks are simply large chunks of metal with high heat tolerances designed purely to soak up heat, preventing your fuel tanks or other sensitive parts from doing the same. They do not actively get rid of the heat (except for a small amount that is naturally radiated away from any hot surface) and will require Radiator panels to remove the heat from your ship. Single node models are available in all standard sizes, and multinode models are available in 2.5m (two node) and 3.75m (four node) diameters.\n\n**Active Heat Management System (AHMS)**\n\nAHMS units actively combat heat build up past 600k via an NH3 cooling system. They are *extremely* effective in this heat range and will not require radiator panels to maintain it, but they will not effectively cool off at lower temperatures. The coolant will eventually overheat if subjected to high levels of heat over (very) extended periods of time, reducing the effectiveness of the unit. Running the coolant pump to cycle the coolant will restore it\u0027s effectiveness. The pump requires electricity to run. These are primarily intended for non-stock engines and even other sources of heat. Single node models are available in all standard sizes, and multinode models are available in 2.5m (two node) and 3.75m (four node) diameters.\n\n**Thermal Washers**\n\nA simple, low-tech solution for restricting heat coupling between parts. These simply slow down heat conduction across your vessel. It is advisable to place one of these between your heatsink or AHMS unit and the fuel tank or reaction wheel you are attaching it to. Available in all standard diameters.\n\n**Interstage Decouplers**\n\nDesigned for use with multinode heatsinks or AHMS units, the interstage decoupler provides the necessary ability to include your clusters in upper stages.\n\nNote: The interstage fairing will not appear until you place something on the bottom node of the decoupler itself. **THIS IS INTENTIONAL** and allows the placement of struts between the multinode part and the decoupler.\n\n* * *\n\n**Installation:** Drag the HeatManagement folder from the zip into your local GameData folder.\n\n**Q: So how do I use these parts?**\n\nA: Place a heatsink between your LV-N engine and whatever you are attaching it to. Don\u0027t forget to add the radiator panels! I recommend at least four per heatsink. None of these parts will prevent your ship from accumulating high levels of heat, but will make it easier to avoid catastrophic overheating situations. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Basic Usage\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The heatsink and radiator parts are relatively straightforward.

Although they are slow to build up heat, they pass relatively little to attached parts. The radiator panels function in a similar method as the stock panels, with an additional active heat dissipation mode. They must be deployed to function properly.\n\n**Q: What about the AHMS units?**\n\nA: These units utilize NH3 (Ammonia) coolant to prevent overheating. The coolant can only absorb so much heat and will become less effective over time if the cycle pumps are not used (activated by action groups or right clicking on the part). Running the pumps will consume a significant amount of electricity, so plan accordingly.\n\nThe parts are located under the COMMAND AND CONTROL tab by default to ease locating them.\n\n* * *\n\n**Additional notes**\n\nDue to the explosive nature of the fairing being decoupled from LV-Ns, it is advised that you avoid dangling the radiator panels below the edge of the heatsink when attached.  \n  \nInstalling the new tech node distribution config in games in which the parts have already been unlocked under nuclear propulsion will cause the parts to show up in both the new nodes *and* the original nuclear propulsion node. \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-26T02:00:40Z\u0022 title=\u002202/26/2016 02:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 26, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Randazzo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaugeforever","CreatedById":110684,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T02:29:37Z","Content":"Heads up, there is no convection in space, so the most efficient color for radiators is black.
