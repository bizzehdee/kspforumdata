(This is my dissenting opinion)\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t agree that microwaves need a nerf. The system as it is is both incredibly powerful and incredibly limited, which is great.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, launching becomes trivial, but first - when is it not trivial? The only difference is you\u0027re upgrading from 200 tons of fuel to 5 tons. You say \u0022it kills progression\u0022 but first - if you\u0027re getting launch thrusts, you\u0027re just about at the end of the tech tree, so you don\u0027t have much further to progress. Second, after launching the 25 moon/minmus missions and/or spending the better part of a day navigating the whole solar system you need to max out the vanilla tech tree, you should be just about over putting together huge asparagus monstrosities. Third, late game goals like returning from the surface of Eve and getting to Eeloo are still challenging with microwaves going around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFourth, microwave power is very ill-suited for some applications. Landing, for instance. With your power fluctuating wildly and even potentially shutting off completely, landing with a plasma thruster is a nightmare. I still use chemical rockets for landers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re playing sandbox I can understand the sentiment, because it totally makes all those rockets worthless, but this mod isn\u0027t intended for sandbox. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout labs - well, I don\u0027t disagree, but getting the Alcubierre drive without them - well, I\u0027m not even sure it\u0027s possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDefinitely do agree about ISRU, it needs a massive bump.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI only play career now, which is what I\u0027ve been using when playing with the mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, launching isn\u0027t a challenge anymore (even without KSPI) and when it is, slice it into parts and dock them in space. I disagree with your limitations for microwave networks since many of them could be solved via relays. Even for missions where I am planning a lander/return, which is pretty much all of them, I can easily setup a bunch of small relay probes around a body because the transceiver is very light-weight and because heat isn\u0027t handled for inactive vessels. If heat was handled for inactive vessels I would probably be singing a different tune. I am also coming in with a lot of experience setting up networks for RemoteTech which might mean I\u0027m really good at setting up networks already? I am tempted to say that microwave receivers should have to feed into electrical generators to produce power, or something along those lines so they aren\u0027t as incredibly powerful (then make it upgrade in a later node to no longer need the electrical generator?). My issue with microwaves is not how they are really powerful in the late game (which is expected with the mod near the end, and how we essentially have unlimited resources in 0.23), but how quickly a player can build up a decently high power network with really good coverage over the Kerbol system. If you feel it is challenging enough, then we will have to agree to disagree.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lightwarrior","CreatedById":93585,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-17T16:00:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022AndreyATGB\u0022 data-cite=\u0022AndreyATGB\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDo you get the same amount for taking a second surface sample in a different mission?

I disagree with your limitations for microwave networks since many of them could be solved via relays. Even for missions where I am planning a lander/return, which is pretty much all of them, I can easily setup a bunch of small relay probes around a body because the transceiver is very light-weight and because heat isn\u0027t handled for inactive vessels. If heat was handled for inactive vessels I would probably be singing a different tune. I am also coming in with a lot of experience setting up networks for RemoteTech which might mean I\u0027m really good at setting up networks already? I am tempted to say that microwave receivers should have to feed into electrical generators to produce power, or something along those lines so they aren\u0027t as incredibly powerful (then make it upgrade in a later node to no longer need the electrical generator?). My issue with microwaves is not how they are really powerful in the late game (which is expected with the mod near the end, and how we essentially have unlimited resources in 0.23), but how quickly a player can build up a decently high power network with really good coverage over the Kerbol system.
