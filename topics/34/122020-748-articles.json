Then the Eisenhower Administration did the unthinkable.\u00A0\u00A0 They took Space away from the military and gave it to a re purposed agency NACA... which became NASA.\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 ABMA would be transferred to NASA as would many other entities.\u00A0 This would cause a lot of political problems between the military, ARPA (soon to be renamed DARPA) and the new NASA administration.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the confusion and chaos at this time, ARPA who still had 10 million dollars to spend offered to fund the continued engineering effort on the E-1 rocket engine for ABMA.\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 Von Braun, Koelle, and company decided that it was better to have a fully engineered design than one that was mostly engineered to hand to the new NASA administration at the start of the new year.\u00A0 So instead of funding the E-1 engine for another year (and it had probably 2 or 3 years of additional engineering and testing to g before it would be flight ready.)\u00A0 Instead, they contacted Rocketdyne (now spun off of NAA) and asked about a slightly up-thrusted S-3D variant for the new Saturn I stage, as a temporary measure until a F-1 powered first stage could be developed! \u00A0 Rocketdyne looked the gift horse right in the mouth and took the 10million to make the X-1 and quickly there after the H-1 engines.\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 Yes, you read that right, Koelle and Von Braun were looking at replacing the cluster tank S-I stage with a single tank, single F-1 engine even before NASA took over the Saturn program.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThus ends the story of the E-1s development.\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 If the E-1 had be completed, it is doubtful that it would have done anything except make the Saturn I rocket more expensive.\u00A0 The gain in First stage thrust, while more than capable of launching an all up Apollo CSM stack, would have little use that we can see with hindsight.\u00A0\u00A0 However if the E-1\u0027s engineering and design had not been undertaken, the Saturn V rocket would have taken much longer to develop due to the much longer development cycle that would have resulted for the F-1 engine and likely the LR87-LH2.\u00A0\u00A0 So without the E-1 we might not have made it to the moon before 1970.\u00A0\u00A0 Without the E-1 more perilous engineering choices might have been made.\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 Without the E-1 the Saturn Moon flights might have HAD to be Earth orbit rendezvous instead of the Lunar Orbit Rendezvous that was actually flown.\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 Instead of the Saturn V we might be seeing Saturn C-2 and Saturn C-3 rockets flying.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe results of the E-1 cancellation can clearly be seen throughout the Apollo program as well as with various other programs:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nThe Engineering staff that was devoted to the development of the E-1 was transferred to developing the J-2 engine\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe know how of why the E-1 did not work well in early tests directly solved the same problem with the mighty F-1, helping to reduce the F-1\u0027s development time.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nNASA threw Rocketdyne a bone by giving them the J-2 contract.\u00A0 Their proposal was 2nd best overall but Rocketdyne had the engineering staff ready to take the ball over the finish line... and they were not in a CRASH program like the number one proposal...\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe Fact that NASA gave Rocketdyne the J-2 contract and supplementally the J-2X contract, lead to the development of the HG-3 which itself was scaled up to become the RS-25/SSME.\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is interesting to consider what would have happened if the E-1 \u0022won\u0022 the Titan Engine contract.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nRocketdyne would have to make a Hypergolic fueled E-1 for the latter Titan II.\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 This alone would lead to a lot of \u0022fun\u0022 times for Rocketdyne as they had very limited experience with hypergolic and caustic fuels.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe above might have resulted in the cancelation of the F-1 engine by Rocketdyne\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBy the time of the Saturn Flights the E-1 would have grown in thrust even with Kerolox fuel.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nE-1 would likely have been in production right through the 1980s at-least meaning newer versions would be developed.\u00A0\u00A0 After all the USAF/NRO preferred the Titan rocket for it\u0027s larger payloads.\u00A0\u00A0 Even though Atlas could lift nearly as much the Titan rocket was preferred.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAn updated S-I stage would likely have been developed assuming additional Saturn Purchases....\u00A0\u00A0 with 4 E-1s instead of the larger and more expensive F-1.\u00A0\u00A0 Because Engine development and engineering costs are spread across both Titan and Saturn.\u00A0\u00A0 Even if Saturn was Kerolox and Titan Hypergolic, the costs would still be less than continued engineering costs for the much larger F-1.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAerojet General would likely see the LR87-LH2 power the upper stages of Saturn, as they would not have been in a CRASH program to convert the LR87 to hypergolic fuel.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAerojet General engines would likely power the Space Shuttle with all it\u0027s engines. main LH2 as well as the OMS with the

source material available on the E-1 itself.\u00A0 Most everything comes from books on the Titan, F-1, Apollo Saturn program, notes from ABMA, ARPA and NASA and in each and every case the E-1 is mostly just a footnote itself in these documents.\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 There is a lot we don\u0027t know about the E-1.\u00A0\u00A0 I have tried to string what little info that was available in this document as well as the connections to other major rocket engines (the LR87, the J-2, the X-1/H-1 and the F-1) on how things fit together.\u00A0 And I pray that my trained conjecture is close to the mark. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe facts that we actually know about the E-1 are pretty simple\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nordered as one of two competing engine

prior to actual Titan I prototype launches\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDe-funded in 1959 by ABMA/ARPA in lieu of the X-1/H-1 program to make Juno V easier to present to NASA and we know this was a decision by Koelle with the full support of Von Braun\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThere is not a good photo of an all up E-1.\u00A0 There is a distant shot of one being tested under a Titan I

hardware.)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll in all, the E-1 engine represents one of the more interesting \u0022WHAT IF\u0022 changes that are

and really the first production variant for the original end-user is the S-3D, for use on the Jupiter IRBM.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EUnlike the Bluestreak which was a rather large missile, the Jupiter was small enough to only require one LR79 on board.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u003C/span\u003EThe LR79 (S-3D) in this case would have it\u2019s turbopump exhaust used for roll control by a pretty significant pipe extension out the side of the rocket.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EAny sort of jet pipe extension like this results in a net reduction in thrust, but this was almost an unknown phenomenon at the time in question and while a reduced thrust from this extension was noticed it was not enough to cancel the use of the extension and the turbopump exhaust would be used for roll control on all Jupiter and Juno II launches.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAbout the same time while the soon to be BAC was developing Bluestreak, and Army Ballistic Missile Agency was developing Jupiter, the USAF was developing, with Consolidated Vultee (Convair) the Atlas.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EAtlas would use 2 modified LR79 engines in a 2 booster in conjunction with 1 sustainer and two trim/roll control motors, in it\u2019s production form.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EHowever initially using the designation B-2C, the Atlas prototypes flew with just two booster engines.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EOnce combined with the S-4*** upper stage engine as a large bell sustainer the engine name for Atlas would change to MA-2.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThe Boosters would be nearly conical versions of the LR79 designated the LR89.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThe LR89 is optimized for maximum thrust at sea level and forget about efficiency.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EWhere Atlas shines however is in the over-all efficiency of the Rocket pound for pound and early in the flight, when the acceleration approached 4 times for force of gravity the skirt containing the two LR89s would be jettisoned leaving just the LR105 big Rao bell engine.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThe LR105, with roll and trim control by two small LR101 engines, would provide enough acceleration and thrust to get the significantly lightened Atlas space frame down-range to either place an object in orbit or drop a nuclear warhead on target.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EAs the LR89s and LR-105s were upgraded, the Atlas engine name changed from MA-2 to MA-3, and finally one iteration or another of MA-5.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EOf all the original LR79 variants the Atlas engines would serve the longest**, they are by no means the last of the LR79 variants.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThor was the next rocket built with an LR79 variant.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EIn fact, the S-3D of the Jupiter and the LR79 of Thor are identical except with how the turbopump exhaust is handled.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThe USAF choose to rely on a separate trim/roll control rocket known as the LR101 for it\u2019s first-generation ballistic missiles.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThe LR101s would equip all but the last few balloon tanked Atlases and every Thor based rocket to ever fly, including the Delta III.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThis is important for Thor because it means the turbopump exhaust is now being used to directly generate thrust and nothing else.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThis simplified Thor in relationship to the Jupiter and made it more reliable.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EWhile Jupiter and Thor were designed for significantly different roles, Jupiter for the Army and Navy and Thor for the USAF, in the end only the USAF would operate Thor AND Jupiter.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EHere the differences in design philosophy, the Thor with it\u2019s separate control engine system vs the Jupiter with it\u2019s integrated control turbopump, would complicate and result in a low-reliability rate in service (comparatively) for Jupiter vs Thor.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EBasically, by having separate main engine and control systems the Thor was easier to maintain and therefore easier to keep at a reliable state.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EMuch of the control components on Thor were also used on Atlas in a slightly modified form.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThor and Atlas had more in common with each other than they did with Jupiter.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003ENow Jupiter did provide an important role for the USAF prior to it\u2019s withdrawal from service but that role was that of spoiler and threat leading to political negotiations that would continue on through today\u2019s strategic weapons treaties.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EDuring the time Jupiter was in service several \u201CJuno\u201D series of rockets ranging from Juno II all the way to the Juno IVB would be proposed by the Army Ballistic Missile Agency.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EA thin vale on Von Braun\u2019s purpose since he got into rocketry\u2026. Space exploration.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is at this juncture that the USAF started looking for a 2\u003Csup\u003End\u003C/sup\u003E Ballistic missile as a backup and potential replacement for Atlas.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EHere Rocketdyne took the LR79, and realizing that they needed significantly more thrust and it would not be needed at high altitude developed the giant, by comparison to other LR79 variants, E-1.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThis has already be covered in a previous post so I won\u2019t delve further except to say that without the E-1, the technology developed for it and it\u2019s cancelation, the latter Thor engines would not exist.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBack to the standard-sized LR79 variants, as we know from the E-1 post previously, when faced with it\u2019s near future absorption by NASA the ABMA had to choose between a 2 or 3-year development cycle on the E-1 engine or an alternative near CRASH program to upgrade the LR79.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EGiven the LR79 had shown it was relatively easy to upgrade into various improved engines it was decided to replace the E-1 on a 2 for 1 basis with an improved LR79.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003ERocketdyne took the 10 million dollars offered by ABMA/ARPA in 1959 to uprate the LR79 to a 200,000lbf thrust level.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003ERocketdyne first started the X-1 program to develop technology for this new engine.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EWhile this was a rush order, the X-1 program would allow technology to be folded back into the new LR79 variant that would actually be produced.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThe X-1 would be tested up to 880kn or 200,000lbf approximately.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThe production version, known as H-1 would go through two series of prototypes (the A and B prototype engines and the C and D production engines.)\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThe only difference between the A and B as well as the C and D was how the engine was mounted to the thrust structure, was it fixed or on a single plane gimbal, and how the turbopump exhaust was handled.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThe H-1 would of course power the Saturn I and the Saturn IB rockets to orbit.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EIt would also\u2026 with some minor changes to the Turbopump exhaust and the engine bell, power the latter Thor/Delta variants!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo jumping back to Thor and Delta Rockets, we now have 8 different engines to power these McDonnell or McDonnell Douglas rockets.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThe LR79, the MB-3, the MB-3-3, the MB-3-Pres-Mod, the RS-27 (H-1) the RS-27A, B and C (further H-1 Modifications for Delta.)\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EAll of these engines are directly connected to the original LR79 for the Original Thor.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EBut it gets even crazier when you realize that Atlas would also be affected by these upgrades\u2026\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAtlas, in it\u2019s final years as a stage and a half Rocket would gain the RS-56-OSA and RS-56-OBA engines.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThe OBA is a repackaged H-1 engine designed to work in lieu of the LR89 booster engine.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EAs the engine is designed to be jettisoned early in flight it has a low altitude optimized bell.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThe RS-56-OSA is not an LR79 derivative but rather a further improved LR105 utilizing some technology transfer from the X-1 program.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EIt is interesting that the H-1, with a different bell, was proposed as a replacement for the LR105 as early as 1961 for stretched Atlas versions\u2026 yet when the H-1 finally appeared on Atlas\u2026 it was to replace the LR89 booster engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere ends the short history on the LR79 family and why it was so important to US rocket

follow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe North American Aviation Rocketdyne Division (henceforth Rocketdyne) started after the 2\u003Csup\u003End\u003C/sup\u003E World War by developing a more reliable version of the German V-2 Rocket engine.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThrough several iterations named A-5, A-6, A-7 it would power the Redstone short-ranged Ballistic

this engine, a whole host of engines were developed, mostly for the Navajo cruise missile.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EInitially with one engine, then 2 and finally 3 engines grouped together.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThe Navajo engine is where the LR79 family gets it\u2019s start.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you take the combustion chamber and bell from one of the Navajo engines and scale it up approximately 33% you get the original S-3 engine, the first of the LR79 engine family.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003ENow the S-3 in this form was not efficient and had some bad combustion issues.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EChanges to the combustion chamber shape solved the burn issues in the combustion chamber and changing from a conic nozzle to a Rao* designed bell shape would dramatically improve the efficiency and performance of the engine.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EOnce it was determined changing the shape of the exit nozzle could change how the rocket engine behaved, Rocketdyne had unlocked a lot of potential.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first variant of the LR79 we should mention is an export.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThe Rolls Royce RZ.2.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThe rights to the S-3/LR79 engine design were acquired by Rolls Royce early in the development of the LR79 for the Jupiter rocket.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EIt was so early on that the actually produced RZ.2 for the Blue Streak IRBM missile still had the slab-sided conic nozzles of the early production S-3 rocket prototypes and not the final Rao programmed bell.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EGiven the verbiage of the technology transfer contract, it is likely that production Blue Streak would have flown with a more updated version of the RZ.2 with a Rao bell which would have improved it\u2019s potential by as much as 15%.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second LR79 and really the first production variant for the original end-user is the S-3D, for use on the Jupiter IRBM.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EUnlike the Bluestreak which was a rather large missile, the Jupiter was small enough to only require one LR79 on board.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u003C/span\u003EThe LR79 (S-3D) in this case would have it\u2019s turbopump exhaust used for roll control by a pretty significant pipe extension out the side of the rocket.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EAny sort of jet pipe extension like this results in a net reduction in thrust, but this was almost an unknown phenomenon at the time in question and while a reduced thrust from this extension was noticed it was not enough to cancel the use of the extension and the turbopump exhaust would be used for roll control on all Jupiter and Juno II launches.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAbout the same time while the soon to be BAC was developing Bluestreak, and Army Ballistic Missile Agency was developing Jupiter, the USAF was developing, with Consolidated Vultee (Convair) the Atlas.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EAtlas would use 2 modified LR79 engines in a 2 booster in conjunction with 1 sustainer and two trim/roll control motors, in it\u2019s production form.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EHowever initially using the designation B-2C, the Atlas prototypes flew with just two booster engines.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EOnce combined with the S-4*** upper stage engine as a large bell sustainer the engine name for Atlas would change to MA-2.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThe Boosters would be nearly conical versions of the LR79 designated the LR89.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThe LR89 is optimized for maximum thrust at sea level and forget about efficiency.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EWhere Atlas shines however is in the over-all efficiency of the Rocket pound for pound and early in the flight, when the acceleration approached 4 times for force of gravity the skirt containing the two LR89s would be jettisoned leaving just the LR105 big Rao bell engine.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThe LR105, with roll and trim control by two small LR101 engines, would provide enough acceleration and thrust to get the significantly lightened Atlas space frame down-range to either place an object in orbit or drop a nuclear warhead on target.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EAs the LR89s and LR-105s were upgraded, the Atlas engine name changed from MA-2 to MA-3, and finally one iteration or another of MA-5.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EOf all the original LR79 variants the Atlas engines would serve the longest**, they are by no means the last of the LR79 variants.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThor was the next rocket built with an LR79 variant.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EIn fact, the S-3D of the Jupiter and the LR79 of Thor are identical except with how the turbopump exhaust is handled.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThe USAF choose to rely on a separate trim/roll control rocket known as the LR101 for it\u2019s first-generation ballistic missiles.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThe LR101s would equip all but the last few balloon tanked Atlases and every Thor based rocket to ever fly, including the Delta III.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThis is important for Thor because it means the turbopump exhaust is now being used to directly generate thrust and nothing else.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThis simplified Thor in relationship to the Jupiter and made it more reliable.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EWhile Jupiter and Thor were designed for significantly different roles, Jupiter for the Army and Navy and Thor for the USAF, in the end only the USAF would operate Thor AND Jupiter.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EHere the differences in design philosophy, the Thor with it\u2019s separate control engine system vs the Jupiter with it\u2019s integrated control turbopump, would complicate and result in a low-reliability rate in service (comparatively) for Jupiter vs Thor.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EBasically, by having separate main engine and control systems the Thor was easier to maintain and therefore easier to keep at a reliable state.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EMuch of the control components on Thor were also used on Atlas in a slightly modified form.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThor and Atlas had more in common with each other than they did with Jupiter.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003ENow Jupiter did provide an important role for the USAF prior to it\u2019s withdrawal from service but that role was that of spoiler and threat leading to political negotiations that would continue on through today\u2019s strategic weapons treaties.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EDuring the time Jupiter was in service several \u201CJuno\u201D series of rockets ranging from Juno II all the way to the Juno IVB would be proposed by the Army Ballistic Missile Agency.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EA thin vale on Von Braun\u2019s purpose since he got into rocketry\u2026. Space exploration.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is at this juncture that the USAF started looking for a 2\u003Csup\u003End\u003C/sup\u003E Ballistic missile as a backup and potential replacement for Atlas.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EHere Rocketdyne took the LR79, and realizing that they needed significantly more thrust and it would not be needed at high altitude developed the giant, by comparison to other LR79 variants, E-1.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThis has already be covered in a previous post so I won\u2019t delve further except to say that without the E-1, the technology developed for it and it\u2019s cancelation, the latter Thor engines would not exist.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBack to the standard-sized LR79 variants, as we know from the E-1 post previously, when faced with it\u2019s near future absorption by NASA the ABMA had to choose between a 2 or 3-year development cycle on the E-1 engine or an alternative near CRASH program to upgrade the LR79.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EGiven the LR79 had shown it was relatively easy to upgrade into various improved engines it was decided to replace the E-1 on a 2 for 1 basis with an improved LR79.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003ERocketdyne took the 10 million dollars offered by ABMA/ARPA in 1959 to uprate the LR79 to a 200,000lbf thrust level.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003ERocketdyne first started the X-1 program to develop technology for this new engine.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EWhile this was a rush order, the X-1 program would allow technology to be folded back into the new LR79 variant that would actually be produced.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThe X-1 would be tested up to 880kn or 200,000lbf approximately.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThe production version, known as H-1 would go through two series of prototypes (the A and B prototype engines and the C and D production engines.)\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThe only difference between the A and B as well as the C and D was how the engine was mounted to the thrust structure, was it fixed or on a single plane gimbal, and how the turbopump exhaust was handled.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThe H-1 would of course power the Saturn I and the Saturn IB rockets to orbit.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EIt would also\u2026 with some minor changes to the Turbopump exhaust and the engine bell, power the latter Thor/Delta variants!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo jumping back to Thor and Delta Rockets, we now have 8 different engines to power these McDonnell or McDonnell Douglas rockets.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThe LR79, the MB-3, the MB-3-3, the MB-3-Pres-Mod, the RS-27 (H-1) the RS-27A, B and C (further H-1 Modifications for Delta.)\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EAll of these engines are directly connected to the original LR79 for the Original Thor.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EBut it gets even crazier when you realize that Atlas would also be affected by these upgrades\u2026\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAtlas, in it\u2019s final years as a stage and a half Rocket would gain the RS-56-OSA and RS-56-OBA engines.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThe OBA is a repackaged H-1 engine designed to work in lieu of the LR89 booster engine.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EAs the engine is designed to be jettisoned early in flight it has a low altitude optimized bell.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EThe RS-56-OSA is not an LR79 derivative but rather a further improved LR105 utilizing some technology transfer from the X-1 program.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EIt is interesting that the H-1, with a different bell, was proposed as a replacement for the LR105 as early as 1961 for stretched Atlas versions\u2026 yet when the H-1 finally appeared on Atlas\u2026 it was to replace the LR89 booster engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere ends the short history on the LR79 family and why it was so important to US rocket

ignore all the math formulas the document can either be a waste of time or a treasure trove of data. \u00A0 The example I am going to use is the Titan CT3 and Titan IV.\u00A0\u00A0 They had new engines that few documents seem to want to talk about. \u00A0 In fact I have found no all up comparison (or complete data set) for the AJ-11A engines on the CT3 and Titan IV Rockets. \u00A0 \u00A0 I used 4 sets of documents to come up with my proposed suggestions for changes to both BDB and the Wiki that put requests in for yesterday. \u00A0\u00A0 One such document that I read last week talked about the KH-10 and the Titan IIIM and how the man rating hardware on the LR87-AJ-11 would add about 380kg of mass to the first stage and a smaller mass to the 2nd stage for the LR91.\u00A0 But that the improvements in thrust vs the then production standard AJ-9 would offset the extra mass. \u00A0\u00A0 Then read a document on Titan IV stating that the LR87-AJ-11A for Titan IV and CT3 did not have the man rating hardware and it was designed out of the appropriate stages. \u00A0 \u00A0 Knowing that the man rating hardware was used in two ways on Titan rockets can be gleaned from all the NASA Gemini Titan LV documents.\u00A0 They lowered the pressure in the Turbo-pumps(which lowers thrust) and added many built in test features.\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 So the differences between the LR87-AJ-11 used on all the Titan 23, 24, 33 and 34 rockets EXCEPT 23G, and the LR87-AJ-11A used on Commercial Titan 3 and Titan IV, are the 11A has higher thrust and the entire stage weighs less because the built in test equipment was either removed or lighter replacements added in (new technology.)\u00A0\u00A0 That makes the -11A engine a significant upgrade over the -11 even though the thrust is only about 10% more.\u00A0\u00A0 It is the mass \u002B the thrust increase that make it significant.\u00A0\u00A0 I combined 4 sets of documents to come up with these facts and figures.\u00A0\u00A0 ONE was a NASA document about the Titan IIIM as well as the proposed Titan IIIE.\u00A0\u00A0 Another was a series of 3 documents on man-rating the Titan II to become the GLV and the third was a document from Martin Marietta talking about the proposed Titan IV as well as another document from the same source on the Commercial Titan 3 (CT3.)\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 You will notice, that I have to make several assumptions here.\u00A0\u00A0 My data on man rating the engines comes from the AJ-5 to AJ-7 program.\u00A0 That was how NASA man rated the original Gemini Titan II LV.\u00A0\u00A0 The man rating hardware in the early Titan III(2x) family massed 380kg in the first stage.\u00A0\u00A0 DID it mass 380kg at the end of the Titan III 2x/3x program? \u00A0 Sadly we have to ASSUME so since no document states the stages got lighter as they \u0022improved production\u0022... but it is the first assumption.\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 Now we have to ignore most of the data on the Titan CT3 because it\u0027s first stage was quoted as a \u0022Titan IIIM first stage\u0022\u00A0 when it really wasn\u0027t.\u00A0 Most the data on this stage just quotes the same info as the original Titan 24B data for the stage (including the base AJ-11 engine!)\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 So we really can\u0027t do a stage mass vs stage mass calculation because every public source seems to use Titan 24B data... and quote the wrong engine version.\u00A0\u00A0 Titan CT3\u0027s first stage was built to Titan IV standards, but with smaller tanks (and a shorter length similar to the earlier IIIM tanks.)\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs the Titan IV first stage is stretched with more fuel... again we can\u0027t do a mass vs mass calculation worth mentioning.\u00A0 So I have a known-ish thrust gain of around 10% and a POSSIBLE mass reduction of 380kg in the first stage (that is about 840lbs for those of you trying to think in the Standard scale.)\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 I have to make the assumptions that these changes are accurate sadly.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMind you none of this takes into account the Transistorization and later integrated circuits being used in the Avionics.\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 That could be a further mass reduction.\u00A0\u00A0 And something to consider.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope that answers your question and does not sound like

use... no matter how much we might try to hid it. \u00A0\u00A0 For example, I may be able to make a 3d model in a CAD program.\u00A0 But I have no real capability at making 3d models for games like KSP.\u00A0\u00A0 And don\u0027t ask about my ability to Texture.\u00A0\u00A0 Cobaltwolf looked at my crude attempts and thankfully did not laugh in my face (he is too upstanding of a guy to do so mind you!)\u00A0\u00A0 But he can make 3D art that is beautiful and actually looks like it was made in the real world.\u00A0 I can not and I have spent a lot of hours learning and trying...\u00A0 well
