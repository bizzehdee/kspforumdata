If it\u0027s blinking yellow then you have a physics-lag in effect. This slows down the \u003Cem\u003Eentire\u003C/em\u003E game to keep things in sync. The countdown is actually a bunch of 1-second audio clips so if the game is taking longer than 1-second of real world time to render 1-second of in game time, you will get stuttering between audio clips in the countdown. The only good solution I know of other than upgrading your PC or reducing your ship\u0027s part count is to just go into the Settings menu (outside the game, not in the Esc menu) and adjust your physics time frame slider further to... crap this slider still confuses me to be honest in which way is better or worse for performance, I just have it in the middle \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E But adjust it to the right I will say to have the game dump out some physics calculations in effort to keep the game running at a 1:1 ratio between game time and real world time.
