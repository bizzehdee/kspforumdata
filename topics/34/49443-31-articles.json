For instance, Hooligan Labs Airships requires Toolbar.

For starters if the order that you put mods into KSP mattered then there would be a LOT bigger issues with making mods. ALL mods are written so that if they need something then they grab it at load if it is there, regardless of what \u0027order\u0027 the mods were added to the GameData folder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, it doesn\u0027t take long to ask a Mod author or put a post asking for any incompatibilities or do a search in the thread. CKAN doesn\u0027t protect you from that as all it takes is some tiny code update in one mod to crash everything depending on it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThird, mods in the legacy format were a nightmare. The new GameData format is quick and simple.
