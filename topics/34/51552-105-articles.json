I mean the freezing of Tracking Station screen. It happens every time I switch to any of my Laythe colonies - once I\u0027m back at KSC and click the tracking station, it freezes (UI does not respond, the only way to quit is killing KSP process). After this freeze, the tracking station becomes unusable: it would freeze again after quitting and reloading. But apart from this case, I can not find any way to reproduce it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe possibly interesting thing about these colonies is that they were establiched before I started using RT. There are some landers, rovers and planes there, some of them have (stock) antennas, which become (as expected) deactivated on load. I have noticed, however, that after I switch to any craft of these colonies, several extra modules appear in persistent.sfs. Again, this is most likely an expected behavior, and some of the modules may not be related to RT, but the save file with this modules freezes at tracking station; here is the diff
