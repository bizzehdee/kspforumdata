And to my surprise the craft was intact. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMission success. But my concerns.. Does this mod NOT recognize mod parts? It was a KW engine with a StretchySRB fuel tank. On the sides were two large batteries that I thought would be the first to burn off. Nothing bad happened. So.. did I save my craft by firing the engines at the right time? How hot does a part need to get before it explodes? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etl:dr A heat shieldless craft with mod parts enters the atmosphere from LKO. Burns engines for a few seconds at around 32km. And survives. Is this right? Or is the mod not working correctly?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou actually saved your ship. Generally things have to be above the Max Temp parameter (Found in the VAB) before they explode.

Thanks that was buggin me. This is my first play through with DR and Ive yet to have an incident.

Not really. The closest I\u0027ve seen with stock is that I hit periapsis high in the atmosphere, started climbing back and and exited right before atmospheric drag brought periapsis back in so I climbed out for a little bit then dipped back in for final reentry. But no actual lift was generated, it was just the specifics of that orbit and its passage through the upper atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, if you have FAR installed you can indeed generate lift and this is useful for keeping g-forces under control. My understanding of real life is that it can also lower reentry heating, but my observations of DREC is that what will actually happen is that I generate more heat because the heat shield reflects some heat back before even absorbing any. That\u0027s based on whether or not your angle of attack is lined up with your reentry vector. The closer it is, the more of your rated reflection you will see. IIRC it\u0027s the dot product of the two vectors so facing full into it means full reflection (typically 5% for ablative, 25% for tile based non-ablative shields). Is that how it is IRL? I don\u0027t think so but I\u0027m not 100% sure of that...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, tl;dr, more lift/less drag means you\u0027re absorbing more heat from reentry. More drag / less lift means less heat because you\u0027re reflecting more heat.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
