Before you unlock Very Heavy Rocketry, you\u0027re limited to a volume of only 20 kL, \u003Cstrong\u003Esuch that it\u0027s not even possible to build a 2.5 meter tank as tall as the Rockomax-64\u003C/strong\u003E (which is available at this tech-level) due to both volume and length-limits...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo not even be able to build as wide as the SLS parts at Very Heavy Rocketry, or as great a total volume as the Rockomax-64 at Heavy Rocekry, once you would normally have access to *both* at these tech-levels seems excessively restrictive...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a MAJOR issue for me because I have taken to deleting all static-sized fuel tanks (except for a couple oddly-shaped ones such as the Toroidal...) from my install, meaning I am limited to much *SMALLER* fuel-tanks for the same tech-level using Procedural Parts. Considering this both ruins the game balance, and is already extremely unrealistic (stock rockets are only 40-50% the scale of real life: for instance the DeltaIV rocket, which the Rockomax-64 tank is clearly modeled after the main tank of, is a full 5 meters in diameter...) I would very much like to see these limits relaxed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe file controlling the tank-sizes is in the ProceduralParts folder, under \u0022Parts\u0022 and \u0022ZOtherMods\u0022, and is called \u0022RFTank\u0022. The volume, length, and diameter limits simply need to be relaxed a bit to at least allow fuel tanks as tall and wide as in stock for a given tech-level (so, the diameter-limits need to be increased to match the widest stock tank available at that time at the very least, and both the volume and length-limits need to be raised for *most all* tech-levels: such that tanks with the same volume as the largest stock tanks at that tech-level can be built...

Any of my crafts that were designed using the old PP, before the most recent update, are unable to undock from anything. I narrowed it down a part at a time until I had a craft with a capsule, two clampotrons, and one procedural tank. Unable to undock. I removed the procedural tank and it was able to undock normally.
