Honestly I never once complete the tech tree since it was put in the game.

I loved the \u0022Field Resarch\u0022 contracts but with this mod installed they dont work anymore. It dosnt recognice that im right next to the R\u0026D. I can live without this pack, but i thought it was a nice addition to your mod.\n\nI checked and that contract pack works. What is exactly the problem you are having?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-11T15:24:17Z\u0022 title=\u002206/11/2015 03:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by klefenz**"},{"CreatedByName":"maculator","CreatedById":122127,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T15:43:53Z","Content":"Ok thanks good to know. But The curious thing is: i didnt even make it above 17000meters i started, and a few kilometers later i oversteered and ripped my ship apart, then when i recovered the remains it made \u0022bing\u0022 and i got the mission completed.\n\nSo its the same for the 50k \u0022Heavier lifting\u0022- contract\n\n**Here is what exactly i have done if you want to reproduce it:**\n\n*-Build a vessel capable of reaching orbit* \n\n*-Orbit*\n\n*-Go back to the spacecenter*\n\n*-Enter VAB*\n\n*-Build a SSTO-Rocket that weights above 50 Tons when empty*\n\n*-Put on launchpad*\n\n*-Launch*\n\n(I didnt pay attention but either its enough to put it on launchpad or you have to fly a bit, but when i noticed, the contract was completed, i was above 7km)\n\nMy guess:\n\n*It occured to me that sometimes when im in the VAB and check the contract conditions to build a suiting rocket, the contractapp stil thinks im in the \u0022situation\u0022 when i left my last flight.*\n\n*(For example: landed on minimus clicked return to ksc button and then when im in the VAB again building the next rocket, and i have a look at my contracts, all the ones taking place on minimus got their \u0022situation\u0022 ticked green.)*\n\n***--\u003E \u0022Alomst completed contract with first flight\u0022 \u002B \u0022New 50T Vessel\u0022 \u002B \u0022Game not updating the situation correctly\u0022 = Contract done***\n\nSorry english is not my foreign language, but i hope you understand what i mean ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\n**Hopefully the last edit for today:**\n\n**Contract**: \u0022*Launch the kerbal Spacestation*\u0022\n\nProblem: The Last part of it\n\n \u0022Collect science\u0022\n\n*Cant seem to get it work done everything the contract wanted, as stated in the correct order.*\n\n*So i came back to the station after 7Days, refreshed the materilalsbay and tryed to send it again, idnt work.*\n\n*Now im curious; do i have to land that thing again? becaus it says \u0022destionation Kerbin\u0022?

(also must add i turned off the \u0022entrance purchase in R\u0026D\u0022)\n\nI also have *Mission Controller 2,* *Contractpack: Kerbin Spacestation* and *Contractpack: Anomaly Surveyor* installed. Those helped me along when i wasted too much money on contraptions wich didnt work out quite as i thought.\n\nThe Heavy Lifting Missions are all pretty hard, but i can confirm it is possible to do them!\n\nWhen im done with the last few contracts, ill be able to give you a real and full resume.\n\nthanks for the mod."}]}
