To me, imho, the detection of and location of any resource should be controlled by factors such as proximity to resource (rough idea from high orbit, better local from lower orbit, closer idea from atmospheric search and then precise from ground work. And of course, still have the ability to miss it or to have it previously escaped and nothing there. Like real life.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"drtedastro","CreatedById":70911,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-12T20:31:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am currently using the 3.3.4 \u0027unofficial\u0027 version from SpacePort on ksp 0.21.1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI opt\u0027d for this method for a couple of reasons. One being that this version uses far less ram and thus I can keep most of my kerzillion mod\u0027s in-game. As I run this mod, at x10, I keep building the .csv file. After every so often, I will pause the game and pull the .csv file out to a separate directory, and then un-pause the mission. this allows me to keep the .csv file down to a size that will not explode. Previously I had let the mission(s) run so long that the .csv would hit the 2Gbyte wall and crash. I then concatenate the separately named .csv files (kerbin_elevation_part01.csv, ...... part05.csv, for example) into a large (really large) file and pass that file through a small routine I wrote that reads all data, removes duplicated data and then creates a new raw .csv file to be run through the original ISA_MapGen.exe ....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethis method allows me to control the precision of the map that I want, while keeping maximum mods inGame. I can also take this data file into other processing software to do analysis on it as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hunter12396","CreatedById":75919,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-13T19:42:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kimberly\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kimberly\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENo need to get all hysterical.
