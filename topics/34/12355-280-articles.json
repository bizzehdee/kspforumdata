My experience is,when MJ didn\u0027t work was because mod conflict!The main culprit was RPM(my experiance,RPM shoud work now(not shure i don\u0027t use it))! You can always try MJ with toolbar plugin.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Velsuvis","CreatedById":73659,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-04T02:00:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGreetings, one and all \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter reading as far back as I could to see if anyone else has encountered the same issue as I have... and after failing to find anyone, I feel it is time I finally post.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince v 2.2.1.250\u002B, I believe is when the issue started to occur.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIssue: a certain early stage separates almost immediately when I have \u0027Auto Stage\u0027 selected.

Again, I have used MechJeb on the same launch vehicles (and giving some modifications to the design, the use of the Structural Pylons have not changed). And yet another again... MechJeb did properly stage a few dev versions prior to this issue... believe before or around 2.2.1.250\u002B era. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am willing to send the .craft files to any who would care to look, and help me resolve this issue.

My crew ship nearly came in contact with the carrier stage (the docking target is under the fairing shroud) trying to reach the \u0022starting point\u0022. The DAP needs some way to see if the projected \u0022starting point\u0022 is in front of the target or behind it, and make a correction to always be in front, before making any move.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, is there a way to \u0022tweak\u0022 the approach angle to the target? Seems to me DAP is always trying to come in at an excessively steep vector. I don\u0027t see \u0022real\u0022 spacecraft (like Soyuz or Progress) approaching the ISS this way -- they\u0027re always straight-in to the target. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe LGAP is acting ugly when trying to pinpoint the VAB or the PAD for a landing on Kerbin. It begins the high-orbit burn OK, but the \u0022projected landing target\u0022 positions itself on the map view far to the west of the desired location and freezes. When the initial burn finishes, the LGAP rotates the ship fully 180 (pro-grade) and burns the orbit back up instead of fine-tuning. The projected target never moves in all of this, which probably explains the burn to pro-grade -- LGAP sees the projected target is too far west, and is trying to move it east. It doesn\u0027t move, so LGAP keeps trying to compensate until all of the fuel is burned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EADDENDUM: If I take the LGAP off and \u0022fix\u0022 the entry path manually, the \u0022projected target\u0022 moves to follow the terminus.
