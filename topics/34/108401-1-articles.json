(Most of the below changes are inspired by the desire for low part count, part bloat is one of my pet peeves.)\n\nAdd a Proximity sensor mode. (From thread in the suggestions forum)\n\nCombine all the \u0022trigger\u0022 parts into one part that you then select a mode on. (The timer, altimeter, empty fuel tank, radio, proximity)\n\nCombine the Fuel Dump and Fuel Controller into one part with a mode select.\n\nRemove the fuel breakers entirely, my Action Everywhere mod offers the same functionality without requiring adding an extra part to the vessel and I don\u0027t want to maintain two mods that do the same thing.\n\nNote that these would **not** be ship breaking, I would leave the current parts them in the game and just hide them, then at some point far in the future actually remove them.

We not only have the problem of everyone getting backed up when firespitter wasn\u0027t updated for a week (talk about first world problems...) where if we had more contributors who could have pushed out an update, that would have been a bit smoother, but you also have the distribution problem noted here where incompatible versions are getting pushed around. \n\nMM is pretty close to a community common dll at this point. Devs are removing it from their distributions because it\u0027s so common, and if you are using tools like CKAN it\u0027s easy to ensure that the single installation of MM is up to date - something you can\u0027t do with multiple installs. I\u0027ve got kspapiextensions, firespitter, MM, AdaptiveDockingNode, BDAnimationModules, InterstellarFuelSwitch, KSP-AVC (which has a somewhat different approach to this problem), ModuleRCSFX, and RasterPropMonitor. Now, USI has his own tools that I don\u0027t think are used by anyone other than USI, which is just fine as is, but all of those others I listed are used by multiple mods on my system. Keeping them all in check is a nuisance. \n\nIt seems to me the community (including the devs) would be better served if many of those were merged into a handful of common dlls but in a single package, maintained by multiple people (sarbian could still \u0027own\u0027 MM, but if he had to step away for a while, any of the other guys could easily step in and push a maintenance release out), and pushed up out of the individual mods and into a single install. You\u0027d keep MM as a single dll that handles all aspects of patching mods, you\u0027d keep RPM as handling all aspects of IVA, you\u0027d have one that handled all animations, one for all fuel and resource handling, etc. \n\nMy $0.02, easily offered since I\u0027m not (yet) part of that dev community having to deal with it first hand."},{"CreatedByName":"TheCardinal","CreatedById":22874,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T17:57:47Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E ..... part bloat is one of my pet peeves ......\n\u003E D.\n\nOkay, you asked for it!\n\nDon\u0027t just combine the different parts into one but remove the need for multiple instances of that (combined) part. In other words make a list possible with all kinds of conditions and actions which are all checked repeatedly and executed once the condition is true.\n\nExample:\n\nFuel Stage 4 = 0 Actiongroup 1 \n\nAltitude \u003E 10 KM Actiongroup 5\n\n..\n\n..\n\nAltitude \u003E 60 KM Actiongroup 3\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-09T17:59:57Z\u0022 title=\u002205/09/2015 05:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TheCardinal**"},{"CreatedByName":"Diazo","CreatedById":81549,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T18:33:05Z","Content":"Heh, there\u0027s my desire to reduce part count, and then there\u0027s going overboard.\n\nNo matter what I do I can\u0027t get it down to only a single part on the vessel. There has to be a Smart Part on a detached section to delay activate and KSP itself limits me to one staging icon per part. So if you want delay activating on multiple stages, you need a part for each stage as well.\n\nSince I can\u0027t get it down to one part on the vessel, one action per part is the next logical step.

Thanks for picking this up!\n\nRegarding the Fuel Sensor: I tried using this mod once to help control the Capacitors and EC use with NFTechs by Nertea. Using the Fuel Sensors (really resource sensors), I was able to control power drain well when I engaged my engines. However, I wasn\u0027t able to control charging my caps because the fuel sensors only read one way. Any chance of letting the fuel sensors fire off when a resource passes some mark while INCREASING? I think this would be even more useful now with ISRU implemented in the stock game. (e.g. auto-stopping drills and/or converters when tanks are topped off.) Oh, and add an auto-reset option to the fuel sensors as well if you\u0027re gonna implement bi-directional triggering.\n\nAnd one small pet nitpick: during my use of this mod in 0.90, the AG selection with AGExt installed was set in clusters of \u002225\u0022... And I say \u002225\u0022 because the first group was actually I think 24 and the last (10th) 26 because the first group went from 1 - 24 simply so the later groups could start on even multiples of 25... (If there was a Group 0, I wouldn\u0027t say anything...) Any chance you could shift that group selection grouping to actually be 25 AGs per cluster? It would match up with the columns in your AGExt mod.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-10T09:34:53Z\u0022 title=\u002205/10/2015 09:34  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by StahnAileron**"},{"CreatedByName":"Diazo","CreatedById":81549,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T14:02:34Z","Content":"@dtobi: Hey!

(It also adds some actions to other parts as well.) There is no GUI windows or anything else that it adds to clutter things up, it simply adds a few new actions to the available actions list when assigning actions to action groups. \n\nAlso, removing the fuel breakers is a long range plan I wanted player opinion on, it is not something that is happening soon.\n\n@StahnAileron: Bi-direction triggering makes sense, I\u0027ll add it to the list. \n\nOn the odd action group selection with AGExt installed, that happens on my end as well and is kind of odd.
