My search-fu is weak this morning though, so please bear with me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have just built a station that will be bound for solar orbit. Plan is for one scientist to be aboard, and then have him return via a Mk 1 Command Capsule. The station, although unmanned, has a OKTO probe core hiding in it. The return capsule has a Stayputnik (so that I can use the flight control computer to setup my return course). I use KCT and I was running a simulated launch to test out my build. Everything went fine... made it into orbit, etc, then ran into some problems unrelated to RT 2. Went back into the editor, fixed the problems, and then restarted the sim already in orbit at 100km (I just wanted to check my return capsule. My intrepid scientist boarded the capsule and then undocked and prepared to go home: and here is where the RT 2 weirdness began.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI brought the flight computer up and attempted to orient my vessel. No go. Checked and realized I had locked off the power on the core and my capsule (I keep the return capsule cold and dark to make sure I always start the return flight with full power and supplies, regardless of whether my solar panels are providing power). Restored power and tried again. No go. Checked the map and saw I had a connection to KSC (which shouldn\u0027t matter; I should still be able to use the flight computer in local control mode as long as I have a core with SPU on board, or so I understand). Nothing I did made a difference--clicking orientation buttons on the flight control computer put a notation in the queue, but didn\u0027t have an actual effect, and setting a maneuver node and hitting EXEC did nothing at all. And yes, I was manually able to control both thrust and rotation, so it was not a matter of an engine or reaction wheel issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt seems to me that having more than one core has confused RT, but this is not the first multi-core vessel I\u0027ve launched, and it *is* the first time I\u0027ve experienced this issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELogs and craft file here: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://1drv.ms/1KnqcMV\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://1drv.ms/1KnqcMV\u003C/a\u003E Craft should be stock plus surface lights, KIS, Real Chute, and Universal Storage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERasterPropMonitor-Core v0.20.0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUniversalStorage 1.1.0.4\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ExScience 4.4\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esurfacelights 1.0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModuleRCSFX v4.1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPilotAssistant 1.10.0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUSI-EXP 0.4.1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP-AVC 1.1.5.0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScienceAlert 1.8.7\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirespitterCore v7.1.3\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbalAlarmClock v3.3.2.1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECommunityResourcePack 0.4.2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProceduralFairings v3.14\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChatterer 0.9.5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETacFuelBalancer v2.5.1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETACLS v0.11.1.20\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDockingPortAlignmentIndicator 6.2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETriggerAu-Flags 2.7.1.0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToolbar 1.7.9\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternateResourcePanel 2.7.1.0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETACLS-Config-Stock v0.11.1.20\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERealChute 1.3.2.3\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShipManifest 4.3.0.2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbalEngineerRedux 1.0.16.6\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinalFrontier 0.8.2-1285\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlanetShine 0.2.3.1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAviationLights 3.7\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbalConstructionTime 1.1.7\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStationScience 1.5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlanetShine-Config-Default 0.2.3.1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDistantObject-default v1.5.5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDistantObject v1.5.5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUSITools 0.4.1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPreciseNode 1.1.3\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDavonSupplyMod 014\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESAVE 1.0.1-672\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETransferWindowPlanner v1.3.0.1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbalNRAP 1.5.0.4\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWaypointManager 2.3.2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEditorExtensions 2.8\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKAS 0.5.2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStageRecovery 1.5.6\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModuleManager 2.6.5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAGExt 1.32d\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemoteTech 1.6.5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFusebox 1.31\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERasterPropMonitor v0.20.0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKIS 1.1.5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGCMonitor 1.2.4.0-21\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActiveTextureManagement-x86-Basic 5-0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConnectedLivingSpace 1.1.3.0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProtractor v2.5.1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDangIt 0.6.1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESCANsat v12.1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrajectories v1.3.0a\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModularFlightIntegrator 1.0.repackaged0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERCSBuildAid 0.7.1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESmartStage v2.6.1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDeadlyReentry v7.1.0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd speaking of help, no one has any ideas?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gryphon","CreatedById":58513,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-13T18:35:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022eightiesboi\u0022 data-cite=\u0022eightiesboi\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnd speaking of help, no one has any ideas?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot really, though I do have a couple questions: what are you using to do the simulated launch?

I\u0027m trying to set up a four satellite array, and whenever I try to get MechJeb to do my transfer to keosynchronous orbit, I plan and tell it to execute. It points at the node automatically (so some MechJeb modules are working) but does not autowarp for the node, and if I warp myself it just misses the node without firing the engines. The right-click menu on the AR202 MechJeb part also says ModuleSPU: No Connection. For the record, this is a manned craft (i.e. there is local connection). I tried editing the save file to make the module inactive to no avail. This is not an issue I\u0027ve had in previous manned missions, and even now I can do the maneuver manually, but MechJeb won\u0027t do it. The engine is out of electric charge (there\u0027s plenty in the ship though) if that makes any difference. I need MechJeb to make my orbits as accurate as possible. Any ideas on what\u0027s causing it and how to fix it or work around it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother interesting detail I just noticed is that if I try a maneuver over KSC, so that I actually do have a line of sight connection, it shows the connection from me to KSC in map view, but still says \u0022Local Control\u0022 in the top left corner.
