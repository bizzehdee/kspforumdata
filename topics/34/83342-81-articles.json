So far I had one problem and one suggestion. The problem is that when using the ModularFuelTanks mod, the Fill Tanks button can fill tanks beyond their capacity. For example, if you have a Mk1 Liquid Fuel Tank (normally 400 LF), and you change it to 100 LF using ModularFuelTanks, the Fill Tanks button will fill it to 400/100 rather than 100/100.

Recovering through the KCT menu is supposed to be a pain with a lot of manual steps, because you\u0027re trading off the automatic, bug free method of recovering \u002B rebuilding for the faster manual recover and manual refurbish. Using normal recovery and then building a duplicate vessel from inventory parts is still very, very fast and has the benefit that you get fresh parts and nearly zero chance of bugs. By recovering to storage you\u0027re literally just moving the vessel into a hangar and when you relaunch you get\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ethe exact same craft\u003C/em\u003E. Refuelling and replacing parts is up to the player then. Also, I can\u0027t know a priori how full you want the tanks: for example, if you recover an SSTO you might want to only partially fill the oxidizer. Basically, I don\u0027t want to refill tanks automatically and I\u0027m not sure it would really even help that much since you\u0027ll still need to tweak things manually.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI will try to take a look into the issue with ModularFuelTanks, but Modular/Procedural anything is often rather\u00A0difficult to work with (example: I despise tweakscale because it basically destroyed KCT\u0027s\u00A0inventory system\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E).

Anyway, I imagined that the option, if enabled, would simply do the same thing as the Fill Tanks button. Regarding the SSTO example, it wouldn\u0027t be any worse than the Fill Tanks button and filling the tanks is still better than not doing so. After a flight it\u0027s certain to need more fuel, but it\u0027s not certain to need reduced oxidizer, so you\u0027d have a good chance of getting it right, and if not the refueling work the user needs to do has still been reduced. Furthermore, with a mod like ModularFuelTanks you can reduce the maximum (oxidizer) capacities of the tanks rather than leaving them partially empty. Then, refilling all the tanks would be sure to restore it to flight-ready condition.

That has some weird side effects sometimes. The biggest issue was when trying to recover things with broken symmetry (ie, a missing wing on a plane) as it would totally break the save file.
