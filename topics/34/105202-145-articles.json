Just the right balance for me.\n\nA couple thoughts:\n\n\\* The change to CTT.cfg on Nov 27, 2016 (759e6c5) appears to be a reversion of SirCharizard17\u0027s changes, removing the CTT changes for the new modules. Was this intentional? I\u0027ve been simply copying in the b737783 version after every update for now, since that feels like the \u0022right\u0022 version.\n\n\\* The hab system still feels somewhat exploitable to me. For example, if a ship is docked to a plush Kerbin station for refueling before heading out, the Kerbals\u0027 Home timer can quickly be set very high, after which it\u0027s simply a matter of EVAing every now and then (either specifically to exploit, or just for routine EVA tasks) to reset the Home timer. The only solution I can think of would be to track per Kerbal per vessel, and then set the Hab timer to min(KerbalHabTimeRemaining, VesselHab) if the Kerbal had recently been in that vessel (either it\u0027s the last vessel visited, or it had been visited within x time).
