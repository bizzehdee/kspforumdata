I\u0027m glad you asked. Put simply, it burns fuel to produce ElectricCharge, similar to what was used in the Apollo program. What fuel? Well, that depends on what mode you have it in. As for the \u0022On Demand\u0022 part, the idea is to only burn fuel when you really need to, and otherwise not do anything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo clarify, this is actually a two-part mod. On the surface there are the included parts you can play around with right now, and are usable in stock KSP with no other dependencies. They come in both radial and stackable form, and each features three sizes that I hope will cover almost all your needs for stock KSP. I\u0027ve tried my best to balance these, but as there is no concept of a \u0022fuel cell\u0022 in stock, it\u0027s a bit of a guess. I\u0027ll happily take any comments or criticism on these, from aesthetics to balance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnderneath, however, lies a powerful plugin that I\u0027ve tried to make as flexible as possible to allow support for use with other mods and other users\u0027 creations.

If it says \u0022No Demand\u0022, see the next question. The other states are fairly self-explanatory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EQ:\u003C/strong\u003E Why does it the \u0022Status\u0022 say \u0022No Demand\u0022 when my ElectricCharge is less than 100% full?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EA:\u003C/strong\u003E The fuel cells are meant to only provide power when it is needed, i.e. \u0022on demand.\u0022 As vessels often have several means of generating power, such as solar panels, RTGs, or engines with alternators, it is best to let the ElectricCharge (EC) stored in batteries (or any other part of the vessel) \u0022float\u0022 up and down with supply and demand. Only when there is still demand for power, without additional supply to compensate, will the fuel cell burn precious fuel to produce the required EC. The \u0022Threshold\u0022 tweakable can be used to decide at what point the fuel cell should generate power, in percent of total vessel EC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EQ:\u003C/strong\u003E Should I ever raise the \u0022Threshold\u0022 setting?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EA:\u003C/strong\u003E In most cases, no, and this is why the default value is the minimum. It\u0027s best to leave this setting as low as possible to make the best use of a vessel\u0027s limited resources. There are, however, a couple cases where it may be beneficial to raise this value, permanently or temporarily.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first case is when you have several fuel cells on a single vessel, operating in different modes (if they are in the same mode you want identical threshold settings). You may want one fuel type used over another, e.g. (with the included parts) LiquidFuel \u002B Oxidizer to be preferred over MonoPropellant. The simplest way to do this is just to raise the threshold of the fuel cell burning the preferred fuel by one increment above the other. Then, only if the power demands rise above what the higher threshold fuel cell can provide, and sink below what the secondary fuel cell\u0027s threshold is, will it start burning the more precious or desirable fuel to make up for the difference.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second case is if you are separating a single vessel into multiple vessels, via a decoupler, separator, or docking port, and one of the parts will be limited in its ability to produce ElectricCharge. For example, imagine a battery-powered Lunar Excursion Module (LEM) separating from a Command/Service Module (CSM) that holds the fuel cell(s) but only a fraction of the total EC. You would want the LEM to be fully charged before separating, so you can get the maximum charge out of its batteries for landing on the Mun. Here you would want to temporarily set the threshold to 100%, just before you plan to separate the LEM. As soon as things are fully charged, set the threshold back down and separate the LEM, and continue your Mun landing with full power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EQ:\u003C/strong\u003E I\u0027ve set the \u0022Threshold\u0022 to 100%, and despite having enough power from other sources, it keeps burning fuel! Why?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EA:\u003C/strong\u003E I\u0027ll avoid a full technical description of why this happens, but suffice it to say it\u0027s due to a limitation within the Unity engine. For this reason I strongly recommend never leaving any fuel cell \u0022Threshold\u0022 at 100% for anything more than a brief instant, or you may be wasting fuel. It\u0027s also theoretically possible, though less likely, for this to occur at even lower percentages, in cases where you have large power draws (e.g. several ion thrusters), large alternative sources of power (e.g. big solar panels in full sun near Kerbol), and very little maximum ElectricCharge for a craft (no batteries).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only case where setting the \u0022Threshold\u0022 tweakable to 100% will not waste fuel is when there are no alternative sources of power (remember, some engines generate power) for this stage or any later stage containing the fuel cell, and there will be no docking with the vessel ever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELicense:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that there are actually two separate licenses in use here.

As this is by design I do not believe it will change. This presents an issue for modders who want to share identical content (agencies, flags) between multiple mods they are the author of--each file can only be owned by one mod. The obvious solution here is to make a mod with the shared content (in my case, just the flags/agency), and have both other mods depend on that shared mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem then becomes hosting of this mod. I asked SirCmpwn (developer/administrator of KerbalStuff) on IRC if it was okay to have such a mod on KerbalStuff, as I know in the past he has deleted mods consisting of just flags. His opinion on the matter was that such a dependency should not be hosted on KerbalStuff, and that CKAN should instead support files being owned by multiple mods.
