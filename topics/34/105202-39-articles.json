Aboard were the 3 legends Jeb, Bob and bill. Of course I did not pack any supplies, it\u0027s just the Mun and back.\n\nI was relying on the 15-day \u0022grace period\u0022 without need for food, but also playing it safe as I\u0027m still getting accustomed to the USI-LS mod so I sent the orange ones. This was my first Mun mission in this save game, and also with the mod activated (so a bit of experimentation).\n\nThe pod arrived at the Mun in 4 days, and stayed there until day 5. On day 6, the mod reports me \u0022crew lost\u0022 in red. I can play with the kerbals normally as intended per design, but the question is... what happened here?? Wasn\u0027t it supposed to last full 15 mission days without supplies?\n\nYes, I have the most recent version.\n\nA bit more information: I had to perform an emergency landing in full darkness. I had to wait for 6 hours for the sun to rise and continue the mission. I decided to warp, and during this time, the batteries depleted. Turned off all systems (and the warp) and waited for 3 more minutes until the first sun rays hit the panels and recharged the pod. Only 3 minutes without power. After this, I did not allow the energy to fully deplete again. Could this event be related to the starving of the crew, even if it was just day 4?\n\nOr has it anything to do with the SOI and being too far from Kerbin?"},{"CreatedByName":"Johould","CreatedById":152248,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-27T01:25:34Z","Content":"I think I have a similar situation, except it\u0027s a non-orange Kerbal occupying the vehicle that reports \u0022crew lost\u0022, and now that the power is on he is perfectly happy to go EVA and otherwise work.\n\nRoverDude, when you say you only need to pack supplies for trips out of the Kerbin SOI, do you just mean 15 days is enough for a round trip to minimus but supplies are still needed for bases and long missions?"},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-27T01:45:37Z","Content":"By default your orange-suits are immune to the negative effects of running out of supplies, and yep 15 days is pretty close to getting you back/forth from Minmus."},{"CreatedByName":"Supermarine","CreatedById":152323,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-27T04:26:24Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E By default your orange-suits are immune to the negative effects of running out of supplies, and yep 15 days is pretty close to getting you back/forth from Minmus.\n\nYeah, but a crew lost on day 4?
