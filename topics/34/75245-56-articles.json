That could potentially be detrimental in some situations. I don\u0027t think it will be too confusing if you allow us to use the Flight Computer even when there is no connection to send commands. When the timer runs down, if the craft still has no connection then the command fails, and an error message can pop up in the green notification text center top of the screen saying that communications are not established. RT doesn\u0027t have to predict whether the command will succeed, it just has to operate as normal and either has a connection when the command reaches the ship or doesn\u0027t. As far as predicting when to send the command to arrive when a probe is in contact, that\u0027s easy enough for the end-user to handle.

If I toggle the dish at Kerbin to point at the satellite directly instead of Mun it will enable the control link. If I toggle it back to \u0022Mun\u0022 it goes back to unlinked.
