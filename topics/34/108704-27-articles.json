How do you handle that case if a single vehicle does say have two MPLs for no sensible reason?"},{"CreatedByName":"DStaal","CreatedById":155685,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-10T14:08:49Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 9 hours ago, vossiewulf said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Since I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve posted here, first let me say thanks for all your work, these and other mod work are all key mods in my games and make the play experience much better.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E That said, is Science Relay working for 1.71? I just tried to upload a whole series of high-data seismic and sample data to my science space station, but I just checked and none of it arrived. When the mission science director heard that, he collapsed and had to be rushed to the ER- this is a four lander, twelve biome sci-a-palooza and he\u0027s spent the last ten years planning it.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Looking to know whether it\u0027s just broken for me, or just not working for 1.71 yet. Also, this science station has a series of science modules, but as far as I know the only one that would want data is the Wild Blue Mobile Processing Lab, there\u0027s a WB M.O.L.E, and Station Science Zoology Bay and Research Lab, none have data listed in their context menu. How do you handle that case if a single vehicle does say have two MPLs for no sensible reason?\n\u003E \n\nScience Relay is working fine for me (1.7.2).  Note that it doesn\u0027t transfer the science to the lab - it transfers it to the \\*last\\* storage science storage container added to the vessel, as far as I can tell.  Check all possible command pods/etc. on the space station - I often find the science in some out of the way probe core or something.  (Especially on a station, where it\u0027s usually on something that\u0027s docked in.)"}]}
