We can repurpose another stock prop for this mission.\n\u003E I like this button type.\n\nThe problem with the stock props is two-fold: first, a lot of those switches don\u0027t have colliders in their meshes, which means that you can\u0027t click on them. That\u0027s why we use those light-up buttons for things like SAS - they\u0027re about the only thing that has a collider that a player can click, and a way to animate it to provide feedback. I like the first switch, too - I\u0027d see it as a \u0022pull out / push in\u0022 plunger switch, but we\u0027d need a modeler to create one that has a collider and an animation before it can be used.\n\nThe problem with most of the labeled instruments is that the label is built into the texture, so someone would have to take the original texture, edit that one little part, and export it as a new texture. That can add up pretty quick if it\u0027s being used extensively. The beauty of the ASET props is that they\u0027re designed to take advantage of RPM features, which is why you can have over a dozen push buttons that need only a single texture sheet for labels."},{"CreatedByName":"Andy81le","CreatedById":95393,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T19:42:53Z","Content":"I am trying to implement getting science readings through RPM.

RPM seems to be hardcoded to use only the orignal image layer on it\u0027s screens and doesn\u0027t use mipmaps.\n\u003E \n\u003E **@MOARdV** I see you fixed this issue:\n\u003E \n\u003E There\u0027s another similar RPM issue. Tourists can go EVA using props, a feature which breaks the purpose of USI Life Support mod.\n\n(Sorry for a messy reply - I am traveling the next couple of days, and I am fumbling with a tablet instead of my normal computer)\n\nI wanted to try out the DDS files before I committed them to make sure they looked okay and they had mipmaps generated. They do and they did, so I\u0027ll get those up end of this week when I am back home.\n\nI don\u0027t know what\u0027s special about tourists that allows them to go EVA. I guess I need to do some research when I get back home.\n\nAs for screens - don\u0027t bother trying to DDS-ify the fonts and stuff - the way RPM works is it draws to a render texture which is used as a replacement for a texture on the prop (which is why the props have a small emissive texture or something like that). I tried setting the flags on the rentex to generate and use mipmaps, and it looked like it worked for DX, but OGL mode didn\u0027t - the screens were all blank. I may have to jump through extra hoops for the OGL path (assuming I can identify which renderer is in use), unless someone knows the secret Unity handshake to get rentex mipmap generation to work in the OGL case."},{"CreatedByName":"alexustas","CreatedById":78632,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T14:41:44Z","Content":"I have one more very small request.\n\ngot a need in variable containing the difference between the current height and the height of the top edge of the atmosphere:\n\n *... = ORBITBODYATMOSPHERETOP -ALTITUDE*"}]}
