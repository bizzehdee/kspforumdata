And I think the idea of the Engine as an Air-Augmented Rocket is really what KSP needs, especially for Atmo-without-Oxygen Planets. For that Reason I don\u0027t like the Idea of splitting it into modular Parts, since the research i made on the technology suggests that the Air should stream in in a straight line to work properly, and I think having it one Part is easier because you don\u0027t need to implement a new ressource, just basing it on the density as it is now. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr if you want to do a modular engine too: Don\u0027t make it an Air-augmented rocket but something like the Rapier AND keep the current Air-Augmented Rocket as a single big part. I really like the way it looks and it\u0027s size. And for Mk2 usefullness: maybe make a smaller scaled down version of it too, but keeping intake and engine in one part still.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso i would like to suggest some further refinement of the Engine behaviour: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I understand the efficiency of such a device relies on how many Air-mass is going through the Engine at a given time. So instead of a peak efficiency at 7km and a reliancy on ship mass, it should really go the \u0027most intake mass\u0027 way.
