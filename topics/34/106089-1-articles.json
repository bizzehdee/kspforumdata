(Jan 22, 2022)","CreatedByName":"Nertea","CreatedById":83952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T20:06:57Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"Nertea","CreatedById":83952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T20:06:57Z","Content":"| **KSP 1.12.x** | \u003Cbr\u003E**Cryogenic Engines [2.0.6] Last Updated January 22, 2022**\u003Cbr\u003E |\n| --- | --- |\n\n![iOlGMTk.png](https://i.imgur.com/iOlGMTk.png)\n\nThis modest part pack is designed to provide some new rocket engines that run either Liquid Hydrogen and Oxidizer or Liquid Methane and Oxidizer.\n\n**Liquid Hydrogen Engines**\n\nThere are nine models provided, two in each of the 1.25, 1.875, 2.5 and 3.75m sizes and one in the 0.625,. These engines have better fuel efficiency than the KSP stock engines, up to 460s of Isp, but beware! They\u0027re more expensive and produce less thrust per unit weight. In addition, liquid hydrogen is less dense than liquid fuel, **so for the same Delta-V, you will need more tank volume.**\n\n**Liquid Methane Engines**\n\nThere are ten  models provided, two in each of the 0.625, 1.25, 1.875, 2.5 and 3.75m sizes. These engines sit between the Liquid Hydrogen and Liquid Fuel options in terms of efficiency, and don\u0027t have as much of a tank volume penalty. \n\nTo store your new fuels, I\u0027ve provided ModuleManager/B9PartSwitch configs that allow you to change the contents of stock tanks between \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E/O, LH2/O, LCH4/O, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, O,  LH2 and LCH4. These should work with most mod tanks, but no promises. However, Liquid Hydrogen is very temperamental and without the proper storage **it will** **slowly evaporate (\u0022boil off\u0022)**. You can activate cooling on all added tanks for a modest cost in Electric Charge, but this is inefficient. Therefore, I provide special cryogenic tanks bundled with the mod which have insulation to reduce the cost of cooling the tanks. Liquid Methane will also boil off, but more slowly than Liquid Hydrogen. \n\nThis mod is designed to synergize well with [Kerbal Atomics](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/130503-130-kerbal-atomics-fancy-nuclear-engines-june-16/), and with the various [Near Future Technologies](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/155465-122-near-future-technologies-new-year-new-thread/) mods I make.
