I get the heli to hover on the spot with that mod and use Landing Aid to stop the heli from drifting around too much. What I would like to accomplish is having the heli hover about 5-10m from the ground with the KAS winch dangling from it so that I can use a kerbal on the ground to attach the winch to some cargo I\u0027d like to transport. So now once AVVaAC and Landing Aid are both configured and I have my heli hovering brilliantly in one spot, I either switch to a kerbal on the ground or EVA one of the crew to attend to the connecting of the winch to the cargo. The moment I switch to the kerbal (which is about 5-10m from the heli) It seems as though Landing Aid stops functioning and the heli slowly wobbles out of control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s true that you could never switch vessels while throttled up, but it seems as though now you can (think its a change from 0.24 or 0.25)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI need to confirm if your Automate vertical velocity and altitude control mod remains functional when switching away from the craft. will do some testing and let you know.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be amazing if these mods were configured per vessel and not only for the active vessel, that way i could potentially have a hovering vehicle overhead while i attend to other tasks on the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Diazo","CreatedById":81549,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-06T20:00:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst, my vertical velocity mod will also stop updating when you switch away from the vessel as it is programmed the same way in that it only controls the active vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, if you can now switch away as you are describing, that means an update is warranted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll have to think on this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ED.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ultraviolet150","CreatedById":60268,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-06T20:18:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Diazo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Diazo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFirst, my vertical velocity mod will also stop updating when you switch away from the vessel as it is programmed the same way in that it only controls the active vessel.\u003Cp\u003EHowever, if you can now switch away as you are describing, that means an update is warranted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll have to think on this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ED.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeeeesssssss! *air punch*\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"politas","CreatedById":119649,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-07T14:47:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECKAN seems to have two entries for this mod, now - \u0022Landing Aid\u0022 and \u0022Horizontal Landing Aid\u0022.
