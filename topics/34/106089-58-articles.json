Fuel switch is working in Stock (well, ReStock), Fuel Tanks Plus, Home Grown Rockets, and Near Future Launch Vehicle tanks, with the exception of some specialized multi-mission, monoprop, or electric thruster tanks, as expected.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, Saul Retav said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I have an issue where boil off is happening despite plenty of EC, probably only in timewarp. I\u0027ve noticed two different ships now where cooling is enabled and they have plenty of EC and solar panels, but after timewarping several days, lots of fuel boil off happens.\n\u003E \n\nI\u0027m not seeing it.  I tried a craft powered by RTGs, to take orbital darkness times out of the equation, and didn\u0027t see any boil off, at any warp level.  I know sometimes depletion calculations for various attributes may not always scale properly during  time warp, so I usually do a quick Alt-F12 cheat to orbit and revert, to verify my darkness time calculations vs power draw and EC on-hand.\n\nIf you haven\u0027t already, download the latest version of Cryo Engines, \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ethen delete\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E all previous versions of that folder \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eand all\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E associated dependencies in GameData (ex., CryoTanks, Deployable Engines, Dyanamic Battery Storage, etc..), then re-install them all fresh.  Nertea\u0027s usually pretty good about updating a dependency in a pack when making updates to that dependency.  An older version of a dependency may be tripping things up.  If you\u0027re using craft from a previous, older KSP version save game, try it out with a brand new vessel."},{"CreatedByName":"AtomicRocketBooster","CreatedById":2680,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-29T16:50:24Z","Content":"Hello all - what mods are you all using for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E for this?
