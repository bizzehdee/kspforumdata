EVE does the clouds and atmospheric effects, Texture Replacer handles the new skybox, Custom Asteroids add asteroids to Jool, Kittopia adds rings to Jool, and DOE is recommended but not required. So it\u0027s possible for example to use only the new skybox \u0026amp; sun flare and not the clouds, rings or asteroids in case you are low on RAM. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, yeah.
