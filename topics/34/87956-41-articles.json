The K cockpit I see credible for a conventional Transport or a booster launched orbiter lander lifting body, where the design is intended to lose speed, like the Space shuttles. I do know that aircraft designers use cylinders for a reason, a pressurized cylinder is easier to reinforce and therefore lighter than any other shape, as well it is less prone to metal fatigue from constant expansion and contraction, so there is some sense to the curved shapes. As for the behavior of the collision meshes, ideally what you say should be true, however these are custom parts that have been known to have odd behavior specific to collisions, so who can say? It would be a worthy experiment and I certainly hope that whoever tries makes a video of the attempt.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StahnAileron","CreatedById":139783,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-12T05:51:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust realized something.
