Your rocket will load in laying down but symmetry is done differently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing to note in the VAB is symmetry of IR parts is done differently with 2 and 3 or more. If you set it to 2 and add the VTOL rotatron (which needs a major de-uglying and otherwise total rework plus additional sizes) to the side of a rocket, they\u0027ll rotate opposite so that whatever is attached will turn to the same side of the rocket. Great if you want to build a vertically launched vehicle which will rotate horizontally and hover. But if you set symmetry to 3 or more, they\u0027ll all turn the same direction.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bit Fiddler","CreatedById":103108,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-17T09:40:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk look at this screen shot\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/75023494/SS_03-17-2014_18-37-52.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/75023494/SS_03-17-2014_18-37-52.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhat I would like is the body of the ship to remain \u0022inline\u0022 while the 2 antennas move back and forth.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
