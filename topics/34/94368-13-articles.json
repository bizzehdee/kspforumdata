As atomicfury pointed out, because Jool has such a big gravity well, you are likely to go very fast near Jool, so beware the heat... You might want multiple aerobrakes (I think it\u0027s reduces the maximum heat, right?), one to be captured in Jool SoI, another to adjust your orbit?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m planning to refactor Trajectories code to cleanly separate aerodynamic models (stock and FAR) as well as the cache system, and use the occasion to allow a different cache for each planet at the same time (currently only one cache is available for the current SOI). Until then, it is indeed a limitation of Trajectories that you can only predict atmosphere entry in your current SOI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sterbehilfe\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sterbehilfe\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo if i understand the limits correctly, this only predicts the right landing spot if FAR doesn\u0027t make your craft fly? I tried landing a reusable Booster (2 orange tanks and then some, fairly long) and the prediction was wildly wrong because my \u0022balanced brick with fins\u0022 started flying in the atmosphere, i even \u0022bounced off\u0022 around 25km and started ascending for a little while\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith FAR, it should predict any situation (the only thing that is not predicted yet is wings with the stock aerodynamic model, but with FAR they are predicted as they should). However you must define your descent profile beforehand (for example you can use the prograde or retrograde preset), and stick to that orientation the whole time. But if the trajectory enters atmosphere, then goes out, then inside again, it should be predicted fine. The more time you spend in atmosphere, the less precise the final landing spot prediction is, because a very small change in orientation will accumulate during the whole trip. But you also get more chances to adjust during your flight (especially if you go back in space, you can make small correction burns).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Thorbane\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Thorbane\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWould it be possible to have a saved list of targets?
