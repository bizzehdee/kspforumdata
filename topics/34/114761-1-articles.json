Stock system gets boring after some time, and RSS is too hard for most of the people. So I made it 4 times bigger, it\u0060s still playable with stock parts, looks nice without heavy textures and gives a nice challenge. But in stock we only have 7 planets.. so I\u0060ve added KerbolPlus mod to it ! I\u0060ve also modified RVE configs so the clouds are pretty nice.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

View full album](//imgur.com/a/XZT5N)\n\nFeatures :\n\n- Stock planets and their orbits are 4x bigger.\n\n- 21 new planets and moons, from KerbolPlus pack. \n\n- Second Eve-like planet, looks like Venus/Saturn, extremly dense atmosphere, high gravity (3g).\n\n- Another gas giant with rings !\n\n- Clouds, atmosphere and glow effects.\n\n- New skybox\n\n**DOWNLOAD** \n\n[https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/970/Kerbol%204X](https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/970/Kerbol%204X) \n\n**Installation :** \n\n1.Start with clean, mod-free game\n\n2.Download and install Kerbol Plus v.2.3.5\n\n3.Extract mod, and overwrite everything when asked.\n\n4.Enjoy !\n\nIt will break your saves, so backup them !\n\n**Optional stuff :** \n\n- Clouds-free config \n\nIt removes the clouds, but atmosphere haze/glow is still working. It makes the sky nice and blue instead of ugly, white horizon.\n\nReduces memory impact as it is only 20MB.\n\nIt is also recomended for OpenGL users, as cloud shadows do not work with it and there are many annoying visual glitches.\n\nTo install it you need to delete RVE and Environmental Visual Enhancements folders, and copy the ones form zip.\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/uy78grewkeo69fu/4X%20atmo.zip?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/uy78grewkeo69fu/4X%20atmo.zip?dl=0)\n\n- KSC Switcher - Not nessescary anymore, but still works. Sometimes when you load the game, the sky is black and there are some strange visual glitches. All you have to do is to change the launch site in tracking center. That fixes everything. Then you can switch it back.\n\n-Smaller Kerbol Plus orbits - If you want them do be closer to the sun, just do not copy KerbolPlus folder from this mod. Leave original KerbolPlus files.\n\n**Known issues :**\n\n- Clouds not working with OpenGL, not my fault, can\u0060t fix it.\n\n**Compatibility :** \n\nIt is compatible with 1.0.2 and 1.0.4.\n\nIt is compatible with all mods that do not interfere with planets or textures. Do not install aditional EVE configs or planet textures for replacer, as it will cause bugs. \n\nResource mods should be fine.\n\n**License :**\n\nIt is distributed under CC-BY-NC-SA licence.\n\nIt contains mods :\n\n- KerbolPlus\n\n- Kopernicus \n\n- Texture Replacer\n\n- Environmental Visual Enhancements with Pingopete\u0060s RVE textures\n\nBig thanks to guys who made this mods !\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-13T12:34:30Z\u0022 title=\u002207/13/2015 12:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Angorek**"},{"CreatedByName":"Gryffen1971","CreatedById":136811,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T14:59:30Z","Content":"Downloading Mod.
