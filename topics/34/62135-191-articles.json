Compatibility with these mods was never intended. Users have reported that the KSO works alright with them but you may experience over-powered flight controls, parts breaking off during re-entry, or heavy-non responsive flight characteristics. Configurations are an ongoing process. Version 2.04 provides improved MechJeb and FAR support but it is still rudimentary.

Early on, on some of the videos Nazari tested the effects. We discovered a bug with it so it was a feature that was cut midway through the S25 development. However, there may be some left over Cool Rockets configs or files. If you see some videos or screenshots of Cool Rockets effects, that person may be using an older config, they may be a tester, or they may have \u0022wired it back up\u0022. In other words, if you know what you\u0027re doing, the transforms and systems are there for you to install Cool Rockets and get it to work. However we cannot support or help with that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Painting and texture help is not part of this mod.
