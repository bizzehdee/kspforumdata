[September 9, 2020]","CreatedByName":"DMagic","CreatedById":57416,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-16T14:27:31Z","PageNum":49,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"DMagic","CreatedById":57416,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-15T05:58:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou might have noticed some performance problems in the latest release, particularly with low resolution and/or greyscale terrain maps. I should be a little embarrassed and mad about missing such a dumb thing, but in the process of figuring out why performance was so bad I stumbled on a huge performance boost across the board. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt turns out that one of SCANsat\u0027s older bits of code (the instance getter property for the scenario module, to be specific) was using a terrifically inefficient method. And since that property is called hundreds to thousands of times per frame by the map generator it was having a huge impact. Simply using a saner approach to accessing the scenario module instance yields significant improvements to map rendering speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe following are rendering time differences for a 1000 * 500 pixel big map:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFull terrain map (terrain data pulled from KSP): 20s to 13.5s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETerrain map regen (terrain data from cache): 13s to 6.5s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStock style biome map: 34s to 5.5s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESCANsat style biome map: 31s to 5.5s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESlope map: 20s to 5.5s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETimes for the zoom map improve, too: a terrain map at the standard zoom map size goes from 5s to 3s (little/no drop in frame rate)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you may notice, 5 - 6 seconds is about the time that it takes for the red line to move up the map at 60 FPS. Almost as important as rendering time, is that there is little to no impact on frame rate while redrawing the map.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo be clear, reading the terrain data directly from KSP is still slow and still has a significant frame rate impact; there isn\u0027t much to be done about this aside from distributing SCANsat with some kind of pre-computed height maps, which I am not at all a fan of doing. But once the terrain data is read it will remain cached until you change the planet being displayed or change the map size. After that the maps generate with little delay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you\u0027ve probably noticed I\u0027m not a big fan of incremental SCANsat releases, I\u0027ve only uploaded 7 or 8 primary release versions of SCANsat in the past year or so. But I think this warrants a quick release, I\u0027ll see about getting it out tomorrow.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Goddess Bhavani","CreatedById":14001,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-15T14:02:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe slow map drawing is one of the main complaints I get from demonstrating modded KSP to \u0027live\u0027 human beings.

To get accurate results you need the narrow-band scanner for ore (and whatever mod resource scanner is required for other resources).

There is almost no difference in rendering time whether the resource overlay is on or off. Compare that with previous versions where the resource overlay would have a huge impact on map rendering time (the changes made in 14.1 would have little effect on this slow down).\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally I wouldn\u0027t mind the performance impact^^ I hardly noticed it in older versions of Scansat. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing that I might change at some point is for the big map resource overlay quality to use the same quality settings as the planetary overlay. Right now it uses the default quality levels, those can be changed for the planetary overlays (I usually set the interpolation at 4 and the map height to 512, it\u0027s fast enough and I think much more useful), but those settings don\u0027t affect the big map overlays.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat would be great \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, thaaaaank you for this glorious mod \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nilof","CreatedById":119624,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T17:04:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESuggestion(pretty please with sugar on top):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould you add at least one conformal map projection(mercator, stereographic polar, ect)?
