The exact processes will probably be abstracted to a converter/extractor/heater with a collector of some sort. Alternatively, you simply punch a drill into an asteroid and get water (assume the drill heats it up, runs it through a filter, and pumps it into a tank). Aside from dedicated converters (Sabatier, reverse water-gas shift, etc...) the collector will most likely abstract the interim process because having a \u0022holding resource\u0022 is stupid, IMO. Honestly, we\u0027d need \u0022holding resources\u0022 for all the asteroid types, Martian ice, Martian regolith, etc... and that just gets out of hand fast. And if we\u0027re going to abstract down to \u0022regolith\u0022 then we might as well deal away with the holding resource to begin with. Besides, the more interesting part of ISRU is converting the water into other products.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T03:37:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESome notes on RF v10.0 (forthcoming).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERealFuels is about to get a lot real-er.
