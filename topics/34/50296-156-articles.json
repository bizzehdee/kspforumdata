Meaning if the ambient is about 300K and you\u0027re going 310 m/s it will be 310K, and if you\u0027re going 298 m/s it will be 300K. Rather than taking into account any kind of friction effects, or shock compression. The ambient temperature itself seems to be reasonable, it drops off nicely with altitude and varies at sea level with latitude.\u003Cp\u003EAlso, is the pressure not exposed directly as a value? I can\u0027t be sure but isn\u0027t there a science part that gives this value? And also, by setting the aerodynamicheatproductionfactor to 0, you should be able to get the \u0022raw\u0022 ambient temperature, and use that as basis for calculations instead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShock compression temperature in Kelvin = your velocity in meters per second, yes.

If you slam into a mass of air at 11 km/s, the result is largely going to be the same regardless of whether it\u0027s cold air or hot air: You\u0027re compressing the air and that heats it up. It\u0027s that compression that causes the heating and at 11,000 meters per second a few tens or even hundreds of degrees air temperature won\u0027t make a difference.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Snafu225\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Snafu225\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAdditional: Okay I forgot that DR comes with it\u0027s own heatshield but there\u0027s the next problem.
