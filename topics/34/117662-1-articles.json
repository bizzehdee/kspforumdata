Construct your own engine clusters!\n\nIn addition to their mount capabilities, all engines are surface attachable to facilitate cluster construction. There are four surface attachable adapters with built-in interstage fairings: 1.25m Ultra-Light Interstage Cluster Adapter (for landers), 2.5m Ultra-Light Interstage Cluster Adapter (for landers), 2.5m Cluster Plate, and 3.75m Cluster Plate. Along with these, there is also a large 3.75m mounted Expanded Cluster Tank with a large base for attaching clusters and carries fuel but cannot be stacked, and three node-based adapters cloned from the stock 2.5m-1.25m multi-adapters.\n\nIncluded in the download are optional high, medium, and low resolution textures. Medium resolution textures are installed by default. \n\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:22px;\u0022\u003EEngine Gallery\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\n\n| \u003Cbr\u003E![knBEpy1.png](http://i.imgur.com/knBEpy1.png)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E \u003Cbr\u003E | VC-L1 Tethys |\n| --- | :---: |\n| ![WaP4XqA.png](http://i.imgur.com/WaP4XqA.png) | VC-1 Umbriel |\n| ![BuqgzNN.png](http://i.imgur.com/BuqgzNN.png) | VC-5 Rhea |\n| ![c9oK6jP.png](http://i.imgur.com/c9oK6jP.png) | VC-8 Triton |\n| ![WrqbIa8.png](http://i.imgur.com/WrqbIa8.png) | VC-10 Titan |\n\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:22px;\u0022\u003EStock Adapters\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\n\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/tWtpp/embed?background=ffffff\u0026text=1a1a1a\u0026link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n* * *\n\nWhat\u0027s New\n\n0.53.1\n\n- Toadicus Tools dependency removed - Functionality available in stock editor (Thanks Toadicus!)\n- Heat emissive animations fixed\n\n* * *\n\n**Q: What do I do with this pack?**\n\nA: As you might guess, make engine clusters. Attach a cluster plate to the bottom of your fuel tank (or don\u0027t, if you like weird looking floating engines), then attach engines. The standard and lightweight adapters can all be included in stacks.\n\n**Q: Do these replace stock engines?**\n\nA: No. There will situations where a single stock engine suits your rocket better. These are only intended to help remove some of the limitations of stock propulsion. They are also not intended to be \u0022stockalike\u0022, though they have fairly similar statistics to their stock counterparts. \n\n**Q: This is too easy!**\n\nA: Don\u0027t use it! ![:sticktongue:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif)\n\n* * *\n\nKnown Issues: Currently None.\n\n[Kerbal Joint Reinforcement](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55657) is **HIGHLY RECOMMENDED**\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-26T02:01:59Z\u0022 title=\u002202/26/2016 02:01  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 26, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Randazzo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T03:50:41Z","Content":"First.
