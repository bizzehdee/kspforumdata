The first is gravity losses, and the second is drag losses. Go too slowly, and you\u0027re losing more energy than necessary to gravity by staying low so long. Go too fast, and as was mentioned, you waste energy trying to push through drag. DRE doesn\u0027t actually directly effect these considerations, other than really punishing you for going way, way too fast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you install something like Flight Engineer Redux or MechJeb, you\u0027ll be able to see a readout of your gravity and drag losses. The key is to push the rocket only fast enough that your drag losses aren\u0027t greater than your gravity losses, balancing the two more-or-less evenly. MechJeb will do that automagically if you use the ascent computer.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
