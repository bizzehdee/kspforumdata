They have had their thrust cut in half, but since the complete Angara vehicle weighs significantly less than half of the real one, the Angara rockets (at least the 5P version) will have a ridiculous TWR at launch. I\u0027ll try to experiment some more, with payload capacities and such.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Allright, I have a few recommendations regarding the Angara pack. These are made assuming that Asparagus will not be used. The problems, as I see them, that are with the Angara rockets right now, is that they have a much too high takeoff TWR and a too low payload capacity. This can be fixed by increasing the amount of fuel in the Angara URM tanks, and decreasing the power of the engines to about 75 % of the current calue. I believe that this can make it more enjoyable and realistic to use the Angara pack.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-11T17:27:57Z\u0022 title=\u002204/11/2014 05:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 11, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by wasmic\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
