In orbit, I detached the payload, staged the parachutes, and did my deorbot burn. At this point, I switched over to the tracking station and waited to get the Stage Recovery notification informing me that my craft had been recovered successfully, or at least that it had been destroyed. From the tracking station, I watched as the rocket slammed into Kerbin and disappeared without a destruction notification from Stage Recovery. Could this be because I was watching the craft from the tracking station? Alternatively, could it be because the object was the main craft and not a stafe dropped from it?

So I\u0027m forced to release my enhancement on my own as \u0022StageRecovery RGU\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have added a new part called Recovery Guidance Unit (RGU) and a new resource called RecoveryValue. When StageRecovery RGU attempts to recover a vessel it now looks for RGU and if there is non-zero Recovery Value entered, it automatically succeeds in recovery and uses the provided value rather than calculating it as usual. The RecoveryValue is supposed to be truthfully entered by the player upon trialing the vessel manually a few times and it is assumed the player is confident that the recovery can be repeated with similar results.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCheck out my video to see it in action:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qg3CZFbehJY?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStageRecovery RGU\u00A0can be downloaded here:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/PaletzTheWise/StageRecoveryRGU/releases\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/PaletzTheWise/StageRecoveryRGU/releases\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy fork currently includes the\u00A0fix Magico has provided for\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/magico13/StageRecovery/issues/47\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/magico13/StageRecovery/issues/47\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0, so if anybody sees anything weird happening with vessels\u00A0on Kerbin, please tell me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223396614\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002278226\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221528613742\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002297860\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Capt.

I have been experimenting with a recoverable lifter series. I was testing a lifter designed for 5t to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E made from 1.875 m parts with an OKTO2 probe core. Both \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E Build Aid and Stage Recovery said the parachutes on board would be sufficient for a safe landing. In orbit, I detached the payload, staged the parachutes, and did my deorbot burn. At this point, I switched over to the tracking station and waited to get the Stage Recovery notification informing me that my craft had been recovered successfully, or at least that it had been destroyed. From the tracking station, I watched as the rocket slammed into Kerbin and disappeared without a destruction notification from Stage Recovery. Could this be because I was watching the craft from the tracking station? Alternatively, could it be because the object was the main craft and not a stafe dropped from it? I am hoping that this will work for me so I don\u2019t have to follow my lifters down to the ground in order to recover them.
