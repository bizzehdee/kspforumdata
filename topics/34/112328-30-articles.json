This mod has an optional background processing mod for electricity consumption on unfocused vessels, and TAC has the background resources mod for doing what I believe is the same thing.. So my question is if I should only have one of these installed because currently I have both?\n\nAlso I\u0027ve noticed that all of my probed that I\u0027ve sent up (with 4 OX-STAT solar panels, orbiting Gael (GPP)) seem to have an issue where they all end up with 0 EC upon timewarping, it\u0027s like it doesn\u0027t seem to recognize that there are solar panels on them when the vessels are unfocused. That\u0027s what prompted the question of if the two background processing mods were conflicting or not.\n\n**EDIT:** Actually another question .. Is BackgroundProcessing compatible with the Kopernicus Solar Panel Module?\n\n**EDIT:** Alright so I did some testing and it does appear that with just background processing and Kopernicus installed (no additional planet mods or anything, just Kopernicus and it\u0027s dependencies) that background processing isn\u0027t compatible with Kopernicus. That\u0027s unfortunate as in my main install I use GPP / GEP .. Which means I need the Kopernicus Solar Panel module to get solar power from the star Grannus in GEP. At the same time I need Deep Freeze to even attempt getting Kerbals out to Grannus in the first place, else they\u0027ll just run out of life support and die.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-03-17T04:55:55Z\u0022 title=\u002203/17/2019 04:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 17, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by CoriW**"},{"CreatedByName":"JPLRepo","CreatedById":114736,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-03-17T05:33:49Z","Content":"Updated to V0.25 fixes the pink/black cryopod glass.\n\nAlso made some improvements in performance and garbage generation in the freezer modules.\n\nPlease make sure you also udpate Advanced Transparent Pods to V0.1.19 if you use that mod with DeepFreeze."},{"CreatedByName":"Gameguru","CreatedById":83605,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-04-15T06:36:30Z","Content":"Hey there. I was doing some tests with the mod to figure out how it worked. One thing I noticed, was that if you recover a vessel that has frozen kerbals in it, those kerbals are not added back to your crew list at the end of the mission. I was using the planetary base module to freeze them. DeepFreeze seems to still recognize the existence of the kerbals though, upon launching a new vessel and checking the deepfreeze tab, it showed the missing kerbals, albeit with no vessel assigned to them making them floating around in whatever void they have fallen into. This WAS in version 0.24 though, so it might be fixed in 0.25, but I didn\u0027t see anything about that in the known issues or change-log so I don\u0027t know.
