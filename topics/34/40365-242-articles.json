If you want to add new science that\u0027s fine but gimping existing science is not cool. the stock seismic sensor generates a lot of early game science from each of the biomes on kerbin, mun, and minmus.

I don\u0027t mind the idea of adding the impactor functionality or adding additional science but please leave the default mechanics alone!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are 36 biomes that the seismic seismic sensor could record science from on kerbin, mun, and minmus alone. You could, on average, take three readings from each biome before the diminishing returns made it no longer worth it. As I recall kerbin was around 20, mun 60, and minmus 80.

You keep all the mechanics of how you divy out the science secret and vastly complicate the mechanics and then leave people to waste tons of time trying to figure out how to best set things up.
