It will model the transonic and supersonic regimes far better (better even than old FAR), and in the current stock model you basically can\u0027t stall. Essentially, stock gives a very cartoonified version of stability, lift and drag, where FAR gives you as close to the real deal as Ferram can give us.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Verdana;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#232323;\u0022\u003EGreat, that what i was hoping!\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022FG_Regulus\u0022 data-cite=\u0022FG_Regulus\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Verdana;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#232323;\u0022\u003ENo offense, but it would have taken less time to just look at the posts directly above yours to find the answer than asking it.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll right, when I asked the question, I knew the risk I was taking no reading older posts \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"4plains","CreatedById":69284,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T17:24:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Wanderfound\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Wanderfound\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAs a very crude rule of thumb:\u003Cp\u003E0.25: very light, very fragile.
