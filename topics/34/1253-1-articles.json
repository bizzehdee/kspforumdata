I think we did one single full launch, and it ended up in a tree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen we got to playing with just the C-types, and strapped cardboard fins and toothpick struts to them. And of course, little tin foil men, which were named \u0027Kerbals\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you for making that reskin.

We take these out about three or four times a year, when the weather is good and the fields are clear of crops. My personal collection doesn\u0027t have anything quite this big, but I\u0027m getting close. A lot of us (myself included) got started with Estes rockets, and many of us still bring our Estes rocket collections to the launch to fire off without fear of losing anything in a tree. The time between the firings of the big ones is filled with lots of little plastic parachutes. For me, it felt wrong to have a rocketry game without this part.\n"}]}
