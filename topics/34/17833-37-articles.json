Can you either provide the craft file (you can PM me a link if you don\u0027t want it public) or answer the following questions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich is the root part of the vessel (the part that lets you move the whole thing in the VAB)?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich part does the decoupler remain attached to when you trigger it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt looks to me as if the decoupler is simply removing the test payload from the rocket, and KER is assuming that since no engines or fuel are removed then it is ok to fire that stage. This is an area that is very tricky to simulate without user input. Really the user needs to be able to specify how long the first stage should burn for and then fire the decoupler and go on to simulate both resulting vessels (assuming they both have workable engines and a way of controlling them). I have a plan for how this could be implemented in the simulation code (it would require some substantial reorganisation of the code) but working out how to present the controls and information to the user in a nice way is quite awkward especially for someone with my level of experience with doing UI things in KSP/Unity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would basically become the bones of a mission planner. The idea is to allow the user to specify that any particular stage should only burn for a certain time (or possibly a percentage of the available fuel because setting an accurate time would require backtracking in the simulation which would be inefficient). E.g. for a simple vessel consisting of a pod with fuel and an engine on top of a \u0022lifter\u0022 that also has a pod this might initially look like:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStage 0: 3000 kg, 1600 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStage 1: 50000 kg, 5000 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe user could set the burn of stage 1 to give it enough deltaV to reach LKO and the display would change to show something like:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStage 0: 3000 kg, 1600 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStage 1b: 8000 kg, 1000 m/s (values for the remaining burn of the first stage after separation)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStage 1 (90%): 50000 kg, 4600 m/s (values for the initial part of the burn of the first stage)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, it starts to get more difficult to lay out the data for more complex designs where the vessel may have to split into more than 2 independent pieces. It should also be possible to allow docking ports to be undocked at particular points (e.g. to create a \u0022dummy\u0022 stage that decouples a port) and re-docked again. It would also be nice to be able to specify that detached sub-vessels be re-docked either back where they were or to a different port or even a different sub-vessel. It should even be possible to create \u0022dummy\u0022 stages that activate or deactivate engines out of the normal staging sequence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I said, working out a decent UI for this will be tricky and it will also require various other, quite complicated bits of code in the simulation. It will need to be able to accurately simulate what happens when a vessel splits into two getting the part trees of the two vessels correct. Rather than simply being discarded, all the decoupled parts need to be put into a new vessel tree using the correct part as the new root. It would also need to correctly handle some odd cases, e.g. if you build a rocket with the root part being the first decoupler to fire then the current simulation code stops generating stats for all the later stages, or if you put a decoupler on \u0022upside down\u0022 so the side that remains attached is connected to the parent part (and hence, ultimately, the root of the vessel). None of this is impossible by any means but it would require quite a lot of careful thought and it isn\u0027t really worth me starting to do that until I can come up with some ideas for the UI so, it is unlikely to happen in the near future...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-07T10:44:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Padishar\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Padishar\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESim time limit\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Build Engineer adds this in the VAB/SPH and the Flight Engineer adds it during flight.

For simple craft on decent CPUs this results in it running far more often than necessary and on very complex craft, especially on slow CPUs, it could update very slowly, e.g. if one run took 500 ms then it wouldn\u0027t do another run for 5 seconds (this is especially annoying during development when the output of lots of log messages makes the simulation run very much slower, my 370 odd part ARM tug launcher can take over 5 seconds with maximum debug trace meaning it wouldn\u0027t run again for nearly a minute) . The newer simulation code uses a different strategy, it times the simulation and then subtracts that time from 100 ms and waits for that long (if the simulation took more than 100 ms it doesn\u0027t wait at all) so it basically tries to maintain a rate of 10 updates per second. The tweakable slider simply lets you adjust that 100 ms anywhere from 0 ms to 1000 ms in 10 ms steps (except that the KSP sliders snap near the ends so it goes: 0 ms, 50 ms, 60 ms, 70 ms etc. and the same at the high end, e.g. if you are within 5 times the step of the end then it snaps to the end).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-07T11:05:17Z\u0022 title=\u002205/07/2014 11:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 7, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Padishar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Drew Kerman","CreatedById":103177,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-08T02:23:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Padishar\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Padishar\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich is the root part of the vessel (the part that lets you move the whole thing in the VAB)?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich part does the decoupler remain attached to when you trigger it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt looks to me as if the decoupler is simply removing the test payload from the rocket, and KER is assuming that since no engines or fuel are removed then it is ok to fire that stage.

The method used to determine which stage each part is decoupled in has a serious flaw causing the staging to not simulate correctly if the root part of the rocket gets decoupled. Basically, the simulation does what I described in \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/18230-0-23-5-Kerbal-Engineer-Redux-v0-6-2-4?p=1142430\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1142430\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E#902\u003C/a\u003E. Even though the engine is initially active, the flaw causes KER to think the payload is what is being decoupled and, since it doesn\u0027t have any active engines or fuel, it does this immediately. The engine and fuel tank are still attached to the root of the vessel (and the decoupler is as well but this doesn\u0027t cause an issue) so the deltaV shows up in S0 (and is higher than it should be because the test weight has gone).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think I can fix this in the simulation code without needing the full vessel splitting algorithm I described above but I am currently in the middle of fixing it to correctly take into account which engines are currently active when in flight, so it gives more sensible numbers when you manually activate and/or deactivate engines, so it may take a little while before I get on to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would make more sense if you rearranged the vessel so the test weight was the root part (I assume this is possible with the test weights) as this would allow you to detach the transfer stage and make it a subassembly so it can easily be attached to the real payload and would also allow KER to simulate it correctly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese two craft files are simplified, stock only versions of yours.
