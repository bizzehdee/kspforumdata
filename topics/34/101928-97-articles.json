I still had the same issue, but in playing around I found I got get it to work sometimes:  If while holding down H to try and do a surface attach, a left click would normally do nothing, but if I hit R a few times to cycle through all the node options and then immediately started clicking the left button, one of the clicks would often take and the object would be attached.  When removing, the same thing would happen.  In that case, R was toggling RCS rather than anything for the object I was trying to grab.  I tried to figure out the pattern:  At first it seemed to vary whether the first, second, or third click would actually perform the action, but what I finally figured out is that if, while holding G, or H, I pressed another key and then paused briefly (maybe for a second or so), I could consistently make it work on the first click.

A rotated the part to attach, R would shift orientation (when attaching) or toggle RCS (when grabbing), and J would toggle my kerbal\u0027s helmet.

Do you have a spare external keyboard to try? Also, could you please check the logs for warning messages? There is a hack in KIS to prevent false drops on slow machines.

Btw, you connect your modules via port CC-R2 which is only available in KAS so, when you said \u0022with just KIS installed\u0022 I think you\u0027ve actually meant \u0022KIS and KAS\u0022?\n\nAlso, please try it the following way:\n\n1. Disconnect **all** links between the modules.\n2. Detach and then attach both concrete bases. It\u0027s important to reset attachment position since they have changed in 0.5.6.\n3. Reconnect the components, and try reloading."},{"CreatedByName":"swjr-swis","CreatedById":152460,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-10T11:21:49Z","Content":"Good folks of KIS, I do not yet have logs or anything useful other than the after-the-fact incident report, but just a heads up in case anyone else has noticed such a thing:\n\nAt some point last night while editing a big craft, in a very modded 1.1.2 install including KIS, I opened the KIS inventory of a part and noticed the mass readout \u0027filling up\u0027 while editing in the VAB. I was doing nothing with the craft or the inventory at the time, I simply had the window open.\n\nI\u0027ve not been able to reproduce it yet and just assumed some weird random error and continued editing.\n\nToday doing the forums thing, I read in the kOS thread a report of mysteriously growing mass of parts while editing in the VAB:\n\n \u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/61827-11-kos-scriptable-autopilot-system-v0200-2016419/\u0026do=embed\u0026embedComment=2572674\u0026embedDo=findComment\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nThey seem to suspect Realism Overhaul being the source, but I don\u0027t use RO at all, never have.
