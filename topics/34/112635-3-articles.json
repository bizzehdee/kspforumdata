You have been warned.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E So here\u0027s how Firespitters prop spinning basically works.\n\u003E \n\u003E First, you have two meshes on the part, one is the propeller stopped and the other is a representation of the prop rapidly spinning. The way the theory works is, you start the first mesh spinning. Once it reaches a certain point, you switch to the second mesh. The first mesh spins up to a high speed, say 250 revolutions. The second one, which is intended to be a blurry representation of the spinning prop, you spin at much lower speeds, say 30. The whole purpose of this is to have a nice, detailed model of the prop when it\u0027s stopped but also have a much less detailed, slower spinning representation of the prop at high speeds. The benefit is, you switch to a prop with a lot fewer polygons and a slower rotation in order to improve performance. Well, as with everything in KSP, it doesn\u0027t work in water.\n\u003E \n\u003E In order to make a realistic representation, the second mesh, the one that represents the prop at high speed, needs to be somewhat transparent. If you look at a real propeller spinning, you see through the area where it is spinning and see the background.\n\u003E \n\u003E It would appear that water in KSP is also semi-transparent, which makes sense. The problem is, as I am discovering, when you take one transparent object and bury it within another transparent object, one of them vanishes. Here\u0027s an image showing the results.\n\u003E \n\u003E ![Props.jpg](http://www.datainterlock.com/Kerbal/Shipyard/Props.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E So, you see the problem. Representing the prop spinning at high speed and making it transparent is, from my testing, not going to be possible. That leaves me with two choices.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1. Don\u0027t switch to the transparent mesh and just keep the high polygon prop spinning at high speed. This will eat up a lot more processing power but the prop does remain visible under water.\n\u003E 2. Make a non-transparent mesh. Attempt, and mind you I say attempt, to make a non-transparent representation of the prop spinning at high speed. This, will not be easy and probably look very unrealistic.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E So, there\u0027s the issues with props and water.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Think you could see about adapting for BB (though Ferram doesn\u0027t seem to want to help)? I like BB better over stock as I find stock to be rather bouncy, plus BB is less fatal to things.\n\u003E Edit: Also, suggestion, maybe a flat spot in the back of the Helipad stern so that things can be angle snapped straight? I was trying to get it smack in the center by using angle snap, but it seems like theres a bulge in the middle there which keeps making it go at odd angles.\n\nWhile stock water isn\u0027t exactly ideal, at least my boats don\u0027t become submarines. After reading Ferram\u0027s reply to me bringing up the issue I\u0027ve been basically told that it\u0027s my fault (That or he tells me to try the dev build but doesn\u0027t bother to point out where to find it). Therefore, even though Ferram makes a popular atmospheric mod, IMHO he should have kept his paws in the atmosphere. Simply because he can\u0027t safely crash land a plane on water is no excuse for changing the physics of the entire universe (as we know it) and claiming it an improvement... and using the popularity of FAR to convince people it\u0027s how things should be.\n\nFor now, I\u0027ll be testing some of Firespitter\u0027s buoyancy routines and see if that improves the flotation in Better Buoyancy. But, I\u0027m not going to go out of my way to support it. If it works, good, if it doesn\u0027t, choose between having ships and BB. My intent will be to use FS to improve STOCK flotation.\n\nAs for the helo stern, once I get props sorted out I\u0027ll need to rework that part anyway and add engines as requested. I can\u0027t promise a completely flat stern as aesthetics will still need it to angle inward. But I can probably give you a horizontally flat area to mount things.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I managed to land a almost intact plane!\n\u003E First the carrier was launched a couple 100 meters in to the air, \u0027cause quicksaves.\n\u003E \n\u003E Then my purpose built plane landed on the remains!\n\nYour posts have got me to thinking. Specifically about landing aircraft on ships. Since KSP is mostly a sandbox game about aviation and rocketry, it only seems prudent that a maritime pack support both of these. What I am bouncing around in the brain is a series of \u0027add-on\u0027 packs that add a collection of new parts.\n\nI shall explain. Early in my KSP experience I fell in love with the B9 pack. It was great. At some point, B9 became hugely popular and it\u0027s dev\u0027s just kept adding more and more parts to the pack. IMHO, B9 is now to the point that it\u0027s so bloated with things I\u0027d never use (like the HX parts) that I uninstalled it many months ago.\n\nI\u0027ve come to the conclusion that the ultimate solution would be a basic part pack, much like what Maritime is now. You get everything you need to have ships. Then, create add-on\u0027s, which also remain independent, like a carrier pack.\n\nIn this idea, you\u0027d have a Maritime Pack folder under GameData with the basic parts. If you added on the Carrier Pack, for example, it would duplicate some parts in the Maritime Pack folder, but not all, and add it\u0027s own CarrierPack folder. That way, each could remain independent, yet, if the user chose to install both, they wouldn\u0027t end up with duplicate parts.\n\nBy doing this, if you, the end user decided they wanted carriers but not yachts, you wouldn\u0027t have to install the entire collection of parts. But, if you did want yachts, you could install both. This is what I think B9 should have done a long time ago. Let me choose what to install and not just dump hundreds of parts on me.\n\nThat\u0027s the theory. So, reverting back to this being an aviation and rocketry game, I think carriers and... floating landing pads (ala SpaceX\u0027s barge) should be pretty high on the priority list.\n\nSince I have conveniently created a connection node on top of the basic hull, the current theory is to first, create a wide-body ship design and second, to create snap-on carrier decks that essentially bolt to the top of wide body deck. You\u0027d end up with something much like the old carriers, which did just that... bolted a flight deck to a normal ship hull.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-17T16:47:46Z\u0022 title=\u002206/17/2015 04:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fengist**"},{"CreatedByName":"Fengist","CreatedById":78435,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T17:25:41Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E MEIN GOTT!
