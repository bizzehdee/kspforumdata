I\u0027ve noticed that if I load an SFS file containing a SCENARIO the game can\u0027t find a use for (mod no longer installed), the log says it is ignored and the node is not removed or otherwise edited. If I load an SFS file containing FF entries and FF isn\u0027t installed, the entries are deleted.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHmmm... I will check this. As far as I remember I have played with a scenario node and it wasn\u0027t working for me. But part of this problem could be a flaw in FF: It loads again every time KSP changes the scene. At the time I started the development of FF (which is quick\u0026amp;dirty in some parts), integrating plugins in KSP was rather buggy and not working as I expected it to work. S.A.V.E is working different and I have learned a lot how to get plugins working since the first days of FF. But I was a bit lazy to change FF yet. FF is working for most and I have never experienced a loss of ribbons myself. Any major change in the code may break things I don\u0027t expect.
