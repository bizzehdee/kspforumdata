I thought that I read somewhere that this limitation had been fixed, however after installing Remotetech 2 last night, I tried sending a probe to Duna and using a smaller dish on the probe (50,000km I think) that is connected to KSC via the most powerful dishes on 2 Comm Stations in geosynchronous orbit around Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI lost signal just past Minmus, meaning comms dropped out at the 50,000km point, which leaves me wondering if I still have to attach ginormous dishes to probes in order for them to be able to communicate to the KSC during interplanetary travel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance. =) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, is there a wiki or guide of some sort to explain the specifics of the mod?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*edit: missed this in the first post \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E**edit #2 Any plans on altering this system? Real probes transmit signals using a tiny fraction of the power used by the ground stations that they\u0027re communicating with, for obvious reasons. I would like to be able to make non-huge probes, but this doesn\u0027t appear to be in the cards atm. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t want to sound demanding or unappreciative though.

For any connection style (omni-omni, omni-dish, or dish-dish) between two nodes a and b, let node a be the one with the shorter max range. Then the maximum connection distance between a and b is range_a \u002B sqrt(range_a * range_\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E. If an omni is involved, the distance is clamped to 100x the weaker link; if both are dishes, then the distance is clamped to 1000x the weaker link. This tries to simulate max gain, transmit power, etc., while still being game-y and simple.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis means, for example, that with a 500km omni and a 50,000km Mission Control, you get a maximum range of 5,500km, enough for medium earth orbit. For stock KSP, that means with the largest dish at home you only need a small dish to go to Duna.
