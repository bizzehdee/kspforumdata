Even on launch they claim to be already depleted, so can never be run. Have had a look at the config files, but don\u0027t fully understand how Kerbalism experiments with solid samples are supposed to be set up. Although it\u0027s probably already a mistake that these are sample return experiments, since the part they\u0027re assigned to (part of the equivalent to one of the Soviet Venera probes) is one that historically wasn\u0027t used for or capable of return to Earth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is what\u0027s added to the part:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode prettyprint lang-html prettyprinted\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan class=\u0022pln\u0022\u003E@PART[4mv_science_container_s0_1]:NEEDS[FeatureScience,TantaresSP]:FIRST // Amethyst Size 0 Science Container\n{\n\t@techRequired = engineering101\n\t@crashTolerance = 8\n\t%gTolerance = 15\n    MODULE\n\t{\n\t\tname = Configure\n\t\ttitle = Living Creature Experiments\n\t}\n}\n\n@PART[4mv_science_container_s0_1]:NEEDS[TantaresSP,FeatureScience]:AFTER[zzzKerbalismDefault]\n{\n\tMODULE\n\t{\n\t\tname = HardDrive\n\t\texperiment_id = kiwi_insectStorage\n\t\tdataCapacity = 0\n\t\tsampleCapacity = 1\n\t}\n}\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwhich already i think i can see a mistake - because the Configure Experiments module gives you a choice between kiwi_insectStorage, kiwi_animalStorage, kiwi_insectRadiation, and kiwi_animalRadiation, but only adds storage for kiwi_insectStorage.

They have a different result for each biome from low orbit, but the experiment takes almost 4h to run, and each part only contains one sample. So unless I\u0027m missing something, this works really poorly with the way Kerbalism\u0027s systems are set up and makes it really time consuming and finicky. It takes four hours to run per biome, but in low orbit, you\u0027ll only spend a few minutes or even just seconds over each biome at a time - and you can only have one version of the part running at a time, and each has only one sample processing one biome at a time - so the so the experiment has to stop and start constantly in a really inefficient way. Either you need to constantly manually stop and start and shuffle around storage, or it takes much longer than it should need to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"goober_one","CreatedById":211168,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-05-06T23:24:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know this is discontinued and all, but there\u0027s a bug that might (MIGHT) be able to be fixed by configs from you guys.

For example, the Andromeda capsule comes at start as well as a lot of other parts that I\u0027d rather not have so early. BDB is clearly not supported and I know that, but does anyone have a config to fix the main problem and maybe add some compatibility with BDB? Fairly certain that Tantares is supported but maybe the config just... isn\u0027t.
