Without additional lab equipment the lab can only do basic lab tasks.\n\n![SfmmBm2.png](http://i.imgur.com/SfmmBm2.png)\n\n**Lab Equipment**\n\nTo run ultrasound experiments you need a ultrasound unit (USU) in your MPL-600.\n\n![jFBiL9v.png](http://i.imgur.com/jFBiL9v.png)\n\n**Ultrasound Experiments**\n\nThe experiments are based on real life ISS experiments. The Experiments need to test several Kerbals to complete.\n\n- **Advanced Diagnostic Ultrasound in Microgravity (ADUM)** Kerbals needed: 4 [Real Life Experiment](http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/133.html)\n- **Sonographic Astronaut Vertebral Examination (SpiU)** Kerbals needed: 6 [Real Life Experiment](http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/944.html)\n\n**Lab Equipment Container**\n\nLab Equipment Container are used to transport lab equipment to a lab in space. Add the container in the VAB/SPH and choose the equipment you want to transport with the container. As soon the craft with the container is docked to the station with a corresponding you can install the lab equipment in the lab.\n\n![sb0xypp.png](http://i.imgur.com/sb0xypp.png)\n\n**Experiment Storage Containers**\n\nYou need experiment containers to bring the experiments to your lab and return them to Kerbin. Add a experiment container to the craft in the VAB/SPH and choose from the experiments that are available. Once the craft is docked to the station in orbit install the experiment in the lab and run it. As soon as the experiment is done move it to an empty experiment container and finalize it to get a science report. Then return the container to Kerbin to get the science points. You can move experiments from one experiment container to an other on the same craft. There are several experiment containers.\n\n- **ESC-1** holds 1 experiment (1m part)\n- **ESC-2** holds 2 experiments (2m part)\n- **ESC-4** holds 4 experiments (2m part)\n- **ESC US WEDGE** wedge for Universal Storage, holds 1 experiments\n- **ESC-3C** Command capsule with SAS ans mono propellant for unmanned resupply ships, holds 3 experiments\n\n![CsF3IHL.png](http://i.imgur.com/CsF3IHL.png)\n\n**Other science mods from Nehemiah Engineering**\n\nNehemiah Engineering offers science for all tech levels.\n\n- [Kemini Research Program (KRP)](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/112337)\n- [Kerbal Environmental Effects Study (KEES)](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/112336)\n- [Orbital Material Science (OMS)](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/81578)\n- [All-In-One Download: Nehemiah Engineering Research Program](https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/629/Nehemiah%20Engineering%20Research%20Program)\n\n![3s1Doyj.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/3s1Doyj.jpg)\n\n**Contributors**\n\n- micha: CLS configurations and bug fixes.\n- Hayoo: KSP Space Agency Logo\n- The Yellow Dart: Nehemiah Engineering and Kerbal Life Science flag\n\n**Testing-Team**\n\n- micha\n- Sangrias\n- volkkeslate\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-13T16:58:40Z\u0022 title=\u002203/13/2015 04:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by N3h3mia**"},{"CreatedByName":"Sampa","CreatedById":130079,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-04T16:49:01Z","Content":"This looks cool, I might run a Career or science mode video series in the future and this will be one of the mods featured! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"biohazard15","CreatedById":91655,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-04T17:35:04Z","Content":"Any plans on making \u0022all-in-one\u0022 NehemiahInc pack?

Keep in mind that you need to launch the lab, lab equipment and the experiment into orbit.
