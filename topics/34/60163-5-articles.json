This is where I\u0027m putting all of the science results that get input with the new biomes. The format is pretty simple. The file is divided up by experiment, with the lead being a line:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eid = \u003Cem\u003EExperimentID\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is then followed by a number of lines for specific biomes. These use the same format as the ScienceDefs file, which is \u003Cem\u003EBody Name\u003C/em\u003E, \u003Cem\u003ESrfLanded\u003C/em\u003E or \u003Cem\u003ESrfSplashed\u003C/em\u003E, and then the \u003Cem\u003EBiome Name\u003C/em\u003E. The next id line or end of the file automatically terminates each experiment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second change is to the attribute files. The first line of each attribute file is now checked to see if the exact search feature is used or not. If the line is 0, exact search is not used. All of my biomes are currently set to 0. You can set your own value, which is read as a float. This enables exact search and sets the threshold to the provided value. None of squad\u0027s biomes use a value, so I can\u0027t recommend a good one.
