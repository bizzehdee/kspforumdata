Another nice SSTO I like to make involves 2 Mk2 adapters, one intake, one RAPIER and some fins at the back for control. The Mk2 shapes are perfect for getting some advantage of the lifting body effect as that drone can easily make LKO but I assume it wouldn\u0027t even fly at all in stock. Also, Manley made a video today about Shuttle aerodynamics that touches on this subject a little - with FAR/NEAR, the whole underside of one acts as a nice flat surface for air to push against and keep you up but in stock, you need to add in just more wing segments.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tempsgk","CreatedById":134343,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-25T20:12:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s true, in stock you generally need to add more wing segments.
