Basically, the stock resource system is very simple and each frame it gets some command to add X or subtract Y from the resource totals, if component Z requests more power than is in the bar it gets nothing, even if the next frame is about to totally refill the bar. My resource manager, on the other hand, organises all power consumption and power draw requests, does some decision making to choose which parts get power first (e.g. engines) and how much they get, how much power can be supplied sustainably without depleting the bar, etc etc. Every request is made individually but the actual change to the resource bar is made only once per frame, by the resource manager itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are only two ways I can think of to actually get these problems and make a part, the first is just to put the player in the driving seat and provide a component where, something like the warp drive speed selector, you can toggle up and down how much power you want to convert. The second is something like the Microwave solar power transmitter, which detects solar panel output and bases the power to transmit off that. This second option has the downside that if someone mods a component to produce electric charge, unless it used the stock solar panel or RTG part modules, that power wouldn\u0027t get up-converted.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SeventhArchitect","CreatedById":80982,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-18T17:52:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk!

Basically, the stock resource system is very simple and each frame it gets some command to add X or subtract Y from the resource totals, if component Z requests more power than is in the bar it gets nothing, even if the next frame is about to totally refill the bar. My resource manager, on the other hand, organises all power consumption and power draw requests, does some decision making to choose which parts get power first (e.g. engines) and how much they get, how much power can be supplied sustainably without depleting the bar, etc etc. Every request is made individually but the actual change to the resource bar is made only once per frame, by the resource manager itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are only two ways I can think of to actually get these problems and make a part, the first is just to put the player in the driving seat and provide a component where, something like the warp drive speed selector, you can toggle up and down how much power you want to convert. The second is something like the Microwave solar power transmitter, which detects solar panel output and bases the power to transmit off that. This second option has the downside that if someone mods a component to produce electric charge, unless it used the stock solar panel or RTG part modules, that power wouldn\u0027t get up-converted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdd a conversion slider/toggleable conversion rate?
