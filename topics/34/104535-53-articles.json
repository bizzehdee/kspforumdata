I use my Canadarm a lot with my shuttles and I find it very time consuming and sometimes confusing when I try many different tasks. At the moment I have 2 payloads in the shuttle bay that need to be placed into 2 different locations. So I need to set up 5 arm positions to complete my mission ( has 9 moving parts).\n\nExample:\n\n- So I can move my Canadarm to my payload grapple fixture as a action group. (red)\n- Then move the payload and arm to the desired station docking port as action group. (blue)\n- Then returning the arm back to the cargo bay (original position) for the return flight as action group. (green)\n\nSometimes I have 10 or more joints to adjust for one pre-planned synchronized movement. Using the Previous and Next preset doesn\u0027t work well if you have multiple complex movements. Sometimes I have a lower negative value for the first action group then a higher negative value for the second. But to get to the lower negative I have to use a separate *move to previous preset* (for that joint) in action groups to get there (x2) and then a *move to next preset* in action groups to get to the next one. I would like to have the capability to have at least 10 or more positions per joint with colors.\n\nVisually it would help organize and then all you would have to click on is *move to red* when setting up your action groups."},{"CreatedByName":"Ziw","CreatedById":135292,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-29T16:23:01Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 2 minutes ago, hellblazer said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Sometimes I have 10 or more joints to adjust for one pre-planned synchronized movement.

This looks like some issue with colliders.\n\nIt is probably bad interaction of various mods, rather than IR itself. Try to replicate similar station with only stock and IR parts. If it works fine, try similar with tweakscaled parts.  \n\nAlso, need to be careful with tweakscale, \u0022root\u0022 part of craft must not be altered by tweakscale. It is hard to tell what part becomes \u0022root\u0022 with docking/undocking in space, it is not easy to explain.\n\nIf everything works, try with parts from other mod, until you find combination that breaks things, like on picture.
