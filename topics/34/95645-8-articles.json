That and I sometimes randomly get scene crashes when flying over new terrain (I had one quicksave that was bugged on my flight to the desert temple where the game would crash every time I flew close to the temple, finally fixed it by turning all the detail settings down to minimum and landing to get the game to update the persistence file, the crash report kept complaining about not having enough memory to create a new vertex, squad really needs to fix their memory leaks). Anyways, I got the science I need so I can focus on space now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thought: the very early rocket flights with the starting probe core are a lot more annoying than they should be because of the lack of SAS, in real life the V1\u0027s and V2\u0027s had a simple stability system that would at least keep it pointed in the right direction. I don\u0027t agree with Squad\u0027s decision to remove it from the beginning probe core, it doesn\u0027t really make sense from a gameplay standpoint, especially given that most players are using a keyboard so I always edit a basic stability assist back in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI understand about not wanting to mess with the biome science, I might still try throw together a quick config for myself to tweak the science experiments and link it here for anyone who is interested.
