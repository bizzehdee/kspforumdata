The Traveler class is nearing completion! as of now, I have designed the Command Pod, SAS Module, Engines, and Fuselage (Fuel tank). I will release the parts non-textured for handling feedback, and until I finish up with the extra modules (Boosters\u002BAttachment Fairings\u002BDesign Compliant ASAS, RCS, RCS Fuel and Parachute modules) the ship will have to do with the regular stock parts.

I am currently working on the Traveler I class interplanetary space ship. For our standards it is quite massive, but until we get a launch option where there isn\\\u0027t a tower, take off will be a bit difficult.
