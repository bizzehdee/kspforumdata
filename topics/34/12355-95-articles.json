My Rover/Lander has 4 of these modded engines. All 4 are able to produce a thrust 500 pounds higher than one Mainsail (this was to get out of Eve\u0027s atmosphere).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe landing on Eve was good. Parachutes helped slow it down to like 3.4m/s, which the touchdown burn wasn\u0027t needed. But on Kerbin, when it slowed down to 110m/s, I popped the chutes, then about 5 seconds later, the chutes rip off. That has never, ever happened to me. Again, the breaking burn wasn\u0027t being used. It depended on the game physics to slow it down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I said,, I didn\u0027t see this (the chutes ripping) happen on Eve; only on Kerbin.

See, the optimal ascent trajectory (in terms of delta v expended) is a \u003Cem\u003Ezero-lift\u003C/em\u003E turn, which means your angle of attack is always zero. Put another way, your rocket\u0027s nose is pointed straight at the prograde marker on the navball at all times, throughout the ascent.\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re burning such that your rocket is at terminal velocity during the early part of your ascent, you\u0027re going to end up burning way too hard. Sure, you\u0027ll save some delta v that would otherwise be lost to gravity drag, but you\u0027ll pay for it in delta v spent pushing your rocket in a direction other than along your ascent path.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the best strategy for FAR, in my opinion, is to use MechJeb\u0027s acceleration limiter and experiment with ascent trajectories. The kinds of rockets I build tend, as a rule, to get very close to a zero-lift profile when I limit MechJeb to 18 meters per second, start turning at 500 meters, finish turning at 40 kilometers, and set the curve parameter to 60%. I got there empirically, by trying different strategies with the same rocket and dialing it in to the point where varying any parameter significantly cost me delta v. I could optimize things further, but I\u0027m happy with where I ended up, so I\u0027m sticking with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExcellent advice.
