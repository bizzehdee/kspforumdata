When using unpressurized (anything non-hypergolic) fuels, you need to ignite your upper stages shortly after burnout of the first stage or use ullage motors or RCS to ullage the fuel to the bottom of the stage. Using the SM type tanks with NTO/Hydrazine engines will allow you to follow whatever ascent path you wish, including large drifts between MECO and SEI (Main Engine Cutoff and Second Engine Ignition). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUltimately, your best shot at playing RO with Engine Ignitor is to learn to design rockets that will fly along a proper gravity turn which will allow you to ignite your second stage shortly after MECO (within 5 seconds). Upper stages with starting TWRs of 0.7-1 are easiest, but it is possible in RO to use upper stages with starting TWRs of less than .2 (Atlas-Centaur comes to mind). Burning above or below prograde to control time to apogee is the trick here - below for high TWR upper stages and above for low TWR stages.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor examples of rockets which use ullage systems, observe the Saturn V, Falcon 9, and Centaur. The SV used small solid rocket engines strapped to the side of the third stage for ullage as they would only be used for one reignition before the stage was spent. Procedural SRBs or sepatrons with the trust limited for longer burns will work for this in RO. Remember to experiment - a longer, lower thrust SRB burn is usually better. For rockets like the Centaur, a hydrolox upper stage employed on several rockets, a pressurized reaction control system is used to provide a small forward acceleration to ullage the fuels. In RO, RCS quads around the fore and aft of your upper stage will work on lighter stages and can usually be augmented by verniers or linear RCS ports spread on the base of the stage around the main engine if you need more acceleration (hold that H key!). In either case pull up the info window on the engine to be started and watch the ignition stability, waiting for it to indicate that the fuel is stable. Until this happens, leave your throttle at 0 or you will just waste ignitions. Once it does, immediately throttle up and the engines should ignite. Make sure you\u0027re ready and know exactly how you\u0027re going to burn, because once you shut them down you\u0027re done unless you have more ignitions and/or ullage fuel or are quick enough to get in on the auto-ignition before the engine cools down. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-15T07:16:07Z\u0022 title=\u002211/15/2014 07:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 15, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by SRFirefox\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-15T09:58:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESRFirefox: that\u0027s actually a Real Fuels question, and the answer is yes.

SRFirefox is right about how to ullage your stage: you need to either take advantage of the existing acceleration of the lower stage by igniting and decoupling your upper stage while the lower one is still running (\u0022hot staging\u0022 -- this is why Russian LVs have mesh interstages, because that\u0027s what they do), or you must provide some acceleration via solid or liquid (RCS) ullage motors. Note that it should only take a few seconds RCS burn to start the settling; it may take a little while for the propellants to settle, but they should keep doing so after you release H...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESRFirefox (again \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E ): While your post is very helpful, I do have to correct a bit of what you\u0027re saying. In particular, an engine being pressure-fed has nothing to do with whether it runs off hypergolics or not. While it\u0027s true that most pressure-fed engines have used hypergolic propellants, that\u0027s not true of all pressure-fed engines, and it\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Ecertainly\u003C/em\u003E the case that there are many prominent pump-fed (rather than pressure-fed) engines that run off hypergolic propellants; heck, the LR-87 itself is an example! (As is the LR-91, and all the engine Glushko designed for Proton, UR-700, etc.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, as I implied above, pressure-fed engines still need to have settled propellants. (Apollo did a 2-second RCS burn to settle propellants before engaging SPS, for example.) The issue is that only RCS tanks are small enough to have a membrane between the pressurant and the propellant (and thus avoid the necessity of ullaging); for the large tanks pressure-fed engines use, you will still have to settle propellants first since the pressurant will mix freely with the propellant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and a minor point: verniers are small liquid engines used for attitude \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Econtrol during main engine burns (when there\u0027s only one main engine, say, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eso you need \u0026gt;=1 vernier for roll control) and for fine velocity \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eadjustment after MECO. Even if they don\u0027t run off the same fuel \u003Cem\u003Etanks\u003C/em\u003E as the main engine, it will likely be the same set of propellants.

These are: solid rockets and RCS thrusters. Regular engines, such as the ones fueled with kerosene or liquid hydrogen, have problem starting in weightlessness. If you start them right after the previous stage finished burning, you should have no problems. If you however drift in space for a while before starting them, the fuel will become unstable, and you will need something to give you some \u0022push\u0022 so that the fuel flows properly towards the engine again before you can have a successful ignition. The same is true of pressure-fed engines (which require the \u0022service module\u0022 procedural tank setting to work), but these require much less of a \u0022push\u0022, making them easier to ignite in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are two usual methods: small solid rocket boosters staged to fire right before engine ignition, called \u0022ullage boosters\u0022, about the size of \u0022separatrons\u0022, or RCS. RCS often turns out to have too weak thrust in relation to the engine we want to fire, so I wouldn\u0027t rely on that too much. In desperate situations you can try using RCS to spin your rocket fast (turn off SAS to avoid wasting RCS fuel), although that is risky for obvious reasons. This creates centripetal force, a sort of artificial gravity, which, if you let it spin for a while, should stabilize your fuel.

From how I understand the physics behind ullage, the more you stay at zero G, the more the fuel mixes with the ullage gas. But for some reason, sometimes the fuel seems to stabilize itself while in orbit. It seems that the orientation of the vessel relative to the planet has an effect on fuel stability. Why? Shouldn\u0027t G forces be zero at any part of the orbit (regardless if circular or eccentric)? I\u0027m guessing that the mod uses orbital speed variation (not G), and that it\u0027s also affected by the fact that vessels \u0022rotate\u0022 while in orbit. Half of the orbit I end up with fuels destabilizing, the other half it stabilizes itself. If i keep retrograde and just use physics acceleration, as I descend to Pe it stabilizes, then towards AP it destabilizes. Kind\u0027of breaks up the point of natural diffusion, doesn\u0027t it?
