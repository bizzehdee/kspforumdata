In order to drop anything you need to choose the right height above the ground, this height is calculated via the current attach node position.

As a result if you place a docking port on the ground \u0022face \u0022 up you\u0027ll see it flying away on bodies with low gravity, on Kerbin they will just jump up a bit due to the strong gravity that compensates collision enhancer pull out force.

It\u0027s simple, isn\u0027t it? ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022) Problems start when you start implementing real code. And this is when you realize the reality is more complex: Unity don\u0027t give much control over colliders, some locations may have multiple surface colliders, KSP doesn\u0027t use Unity gravity model, and many other surprising things. Long story short, it\u0027s not as easy as it appears to be.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 53 minutes ago, Ruedii said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027ll try to get this put on as a feature request soon, with a more detailed outline of proper behavior.\n\u003E \n\nIf by proper behavior you mean a *design* of the feature then OK.
