Using the module, it\u0027s no either or, you can have both side by side without creating duplicate parts. (Look at the oblung fuel tank or bomber cockpits for examples.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason I don\u0027t already make duplicates for each part (aside from the work it takes), is that for memory reasons, I can\u0027t put two or three textures on every part in the pack, since they will all be loaded, and crash the game for people with several mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo why don\u0027t I just make one set of actually good textures you say? Because I like mine. I like simple flat colours and red stuff, and so do at least a few other people.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe solution of course is that I could do an addon pack that would replace or add textures for people who want them, just like there are low res packs for other stuff. If anyone wants to supply some alternate textures for such a thing I will happily bundle them up or allow you to do so yourself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn some cases the parts in question are just very old, and could do with an overhaul (mesh and tex) while maintaining the same style as the other parts. The helicopter rotors for instance are due for some work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a related note, to save you from part spam and memory issues, I\u0027m thinking of bundling up new parts in separate packs. For instance, I want to create some Lancaster and maybe more Spitfire or bi-plane stuff. I would release each as a complete set instead of adding it to the existing packs. What do you guys think? Is that more of a hassle, or would it actually save you from manually trimming stuff out?

Both have their merits. Personally, I prefer full packages: I put them all in, then play for some hours/days, then figure out which parts are never used because they don\u0027t appeal to me at all, are redundant due to other mods or whatever reason, and only then trim them out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving multiple packages is OK for thematic really different things, but if there\u0027s too many tiny packages, it simply is annoying for players that want the full package and have to download\u0026amp;extract them all.
