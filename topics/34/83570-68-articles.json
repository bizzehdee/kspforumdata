It looks like B9 updated considerably since last I was here, and a lot of new modders have their own parts packs out which fill in the gaps I was going for previously. It\u0027ll take me a while to sort through it all to see what\u0027s missing and what is currently \u0022needed\u0022 to fill in the gaps. I don\u0027t currently see any robust VTOL rotor stuff yet, and futuristic naval parts still haven\u0027t been done, but it looks like there\u0027s tons of cockpit, adapter, cargo, fuel tank, weaponry, and wing mods that have been released since I took a break.
