For the fuel ratios, do you just want that for the actual first two stages (e.g. for launches), or would that apply to \u0022current\u0022 and \u0022next\u0022 stages always? If the former, do you have a concept for how I might know that you are launching right now, and not flying or suborbital for some other reason? I could pin it to time or try to detect \u0022new flights\u0022, but both of those methods are relatively unreliable (for example, if you left the ship on the pad, did some time warping, and came back to it, a time-based detection might not work). It\u0027s possible I could only run those in a session that started with PRELAUNCH... not sure if that would ever fail or not.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPe/Ap altitude, yes - exactly what the orbital stats window shows. Fuel ratio is trickier than I actually thought. For now, forget about that until I figure out exactly how I want to do that. For example the first launch I \u0022tracked\u0022 with telemetry updates I displayed the fuel as what remained in the current stage, and the second launch I tracked (so far just two) I displayed the current level of \u003Cem\u003Etotal\u003C/em\u003E fuel for that resource.

Distance traveled equivalency would be to what you get from a mid like Persistent Trails that tracks your crafts actual distance along its route of travel.

So, the idea is that you pick \u0022I want to see 3 digits before decimal place,\u0022 and if you\u0027re moving 300 mm/s the units will be in mm/s, 3 m/s will be in m/s. One of the reasons for this is that it\u0027s how the function I inherited that converts numbers into smaller numbers with SI prefixes works. Another is because it lets me put an easy cap on how long numbers get (literal horizontal length when drawn), which is important because at this point I don\u0027t have a way of making windows wider to accommodate long numbers. For example, if we use an absolute magnitude fix and you pick \u0022meters\u0022 on the semi-major axis, when you\u0027re out at the edge of the system and that number is 11 digits long, we run out of space and the number wraps to the next line.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt also gets messy if you pick a big unit like \u0022megameters/second\u0022 and then do something really slow, like drive a rover. Should I just show 0.00? Display it in scientific notation? Saying that you\u0027re going \u00223.78e-6 Mm/s\u0022 is pretty silly looking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn general I still like the idea of picking how many actual digits you want to see on the screen. I\u0027m not stuck on it, but it has some practical and aesthetic benefits. It lets you say \u0022I always want to see 8 significant figures for this number, no matter what it is.\u0022 If semi-major axis is something that you want to see in pretty high precision all the time, you set that and forget it. It doesn\u0027t matter if you\u0027re in a low orbit around Minmus or a high orbit around Kerbol, you still see 8 significant figures. It gives a consistent presentation and the user doesn\u0027t have to tweak the settings every time the situation changes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know sometimes the current system does weird things for no apparent reason.
