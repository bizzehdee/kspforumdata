I HIGHLY recommend that mod. I\u0027d much rather see the rank system in that mod since he has a lot of the work already done for that. Obviously though, that is just a suggestion, please don\u0027t be offended by my input. However I have thought for a while that a strategic partnership between you two would be pretty badass as far as immersion gameplay goes. Anyway, cheers.
