With that in mind, it\u0027s probably best to go with a simple, low-poly design. Here I have the small 2M tank colored, with 3 sizes in the series (small, medium, large). Larger tanks are more fuel dense (smaller tank volume/fuel carried), adding to the puzzle of staging vs. performance--you want to use large tanks because they hold more for their size, but they\u0027re also more cumbersome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe radial-attach sphere cyrotanks are fantastic! Hold more fuel than the cylinders, but are of course bigger and heavier--or not; alternatively, they could be smaller and lighter, for rovers, landers and such. Since their CoM is further from the center of the craft, it can make balancing trickier. Risk/reward. Also, they\u0027re sweet looking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI played with the cryosphere idea with a 3-size series of tanks where they stack in quads. Looks neat, but it\u0027s not a very practical Kethane tank.
