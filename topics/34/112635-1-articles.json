I posed a question in the mod forums and no reply yet. The external battery is/was a temporary fix. Right now, the problem with the Dinghy is it\u0027s so small that it\u0027s buoyancy and balance sucks. Just bolting on a couple of KAS ports to hoist it up the davit makes it go wonky. The best way I\u0027ve found is to have all the tools and some KAS ports in your pilots inventory and only bolt them on when you\u0027re ready to hoist and remove them when you launch. You can put a command chair on it. There is one spot in the y axis with symmetry on where it\u0027ll be upright. Otherwise just turn symmetry off. Putting the fuel in it was no problem. I may make them both external as you suggested once I make it sea worthy.\n\nAs for fuel, I considered that, but with it\u0027s buoyancy problems, I wanted to get it working right before I worried about people using it to haul snacks and such around.\n\nThanks for the comments.

One of his tricks is to reduce the drag on water parts. Hooligan Labs did a similar trick to make their subs.\n\nWell, here\u0027s a secret for you... and I make no promises, but I found a way to turn these boats into submarines, with stock physics.

About 2 or 3 weeks ago, I did just that. I made a side-wheeler (stern wheeler was a bit much for testing) and... it barely moved even with the rotor speeds cranked up to the point the paddles flew off.
