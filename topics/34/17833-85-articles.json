I\u0027ve tested this three times in the same manner: 1st- rocket to achieve orbit around kerbal, running about 90/80 on the orbit. Then I\u0027ve tried to hit the mun using the in game system. Generally, with the rocket I built, it says about 30-40 seconds burn. KER says it will take 18-20 seconds(and yes, reading from the right heading, not the 1/2 time). Then I go to burn at half time and end up having to burn the whole 30-40 seconds(basically the stock calculations are correct). \u003Cp\u003EIs anyone else having this problem with KER? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rocket I\u0027m using is pretty much stock parts with a science jr. in the center and a three fold symmetric mk1 command pod/5 tanks and LV-T45 engines around it.
