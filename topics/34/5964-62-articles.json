Glad to see that Your going strong with all the modding!. My big question is how far do you think you will be going with animations? Lander legs and solar panels? or could you make much larger, more complicated animations for some of your sets? Things like parts that would fit inside the regular vertical rocket but could be deployed into a much larger horizontal model (I\\\u0027m thinking things like wings for space-plane type rockets) or could unfold to give access to other points that you cant build on directly (Thinking about things like building space stations, so you could send a rocket up with the parts stored in a tall vertical assembly, that will unfold after you eject the shell around it to be much much wider, something which wouldn\\\u0027t be possible before because of the huge drag on those parts) Do you think it would even be possible to have a moving part with docking points attached to them? so that you would be able to do things like \u0027dock\u0027 with a rocket that\\\u0027s sole purpose is to launch fuel into orbit and then \u0027dock\u0027 it to another ship that\\\u0027s going to blast out into space with its brand new fuel using one arm?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry for the absolute wall of text, I just find Silesko\\\u0027s modding work so fascinating I want to ask more and more and learn what he can do with all this! :] Hopefully when we get docking in 1.6 well get to try some amazing things with it! :]\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-24T20:37:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENova, are you planning to update the BACE plugin?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Disreputable_Dog","CreatedById":13543,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-24T23:27:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGah, these mods are too good xD I build a rocket, thinking ill just make it into a stable orbit, and end up orbiting minmus with half of my fuel left \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E I forgot how much fun this game is! thank you, Nova!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GabrielG.A.B.Fonseca","CreatedById":13436,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-25T01:14:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENova, I\\\u0027ve downloaded the pack, and everything is perfect, except the node piece.
