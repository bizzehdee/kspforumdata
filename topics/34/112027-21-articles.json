Points of interest are marked in yellow. The whole idea is to balance between two points:\n\n1. sane quantity of radiators per reactor\n2. core heat transfer to radiator area ratio.\n\nGrey fields are stock/current/calculated values do not change them.\n\nReactor inefficiency levels in the table are not current, but close.\n\nArea is calculated in pixels on the screenshot, so it has only relative meaning confined in the table.\n\nThe area plays main role in derivative value \u0027Core transfer/area\u0027. It greatly varies in stock radiators with average value at 0.08. If this value goes up, it means that radiator gets more saturated with heat from the core.\n\nGiven that HC radiators are supposed to be hi-temp active refrigerating, their \u0027new\u0027 core transfer vaues in the table are approximated around average stock 0.08 multiplied by two. Fixed radiators (except flush ones) got a small bump on top of that.\n\nI did not refine any of this yet, just averaged around that value.\n\nAlso I think that XR-300 is too small for its role, XR-1500 is too large.\n\nI know, table is not very pretty, so any questions are welcomed.\n\nP.S. by sane quantity of radiators per reactor I imagine Excalibur being cooled by 2 or 3 VS-3750s and everything else proportional to that.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-25T19:37:37Z\u0022 title=\u002204/25/2016 07:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 25, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Psycho\\_zs**"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-27T14:41:22Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 25.4.2016 at 9:31 PM, Psycho\\_zs said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I know, table is not very pretty, so any questions are welcomed.\n\u003E \n\nOkay, had some time to look at this today. First thing I notice is that I keep struggling to look up which radiator is which in the table - I have to keep going back to the picture, count through the radiators, then count through the table. An extra row with the names would greatly help this spreadsheet.\n\nSecond, the \u0022Core Ex.\u0022 value - what\u0027s that supposed to represent? Do you mean core transfer there? The math seems to suggest it, but I\u0027m not sure why you renamed it?\n\nWhat do you mean with the bit about reducing surface radiator area by 2? ...2 what, square meters?\n\nFor the reactors, what does \u0022waste heat coefficient\u0022 mean? It looks like you\u0027re multiplying it with Ec output to... get the heat output? But that\u0027s not how much heat the reactors output at all. Those are off by like five times. Why not just directly take the reactor heat output for the purpose of the math? It\u0027s displayed in the VAB...\n\n...wait. Don\u0027t tell me Nertea tweaked something in the plugin in response to that bug report I made a week or two back, and now all reactors suddenly produce five times as much heat? I tested the configs I made in my own game before making the pull request, but I didn\u0027t actually test the latest download. ![:confused:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif \u0022:confused:\u0022) Anyway, the Excalibur should generate 2000 kW waste heat, not 9600, and need exactly 2 stock large thermal control systems, not ten of them. If that\u0027s borked up ingame, it would be one heck of a hilarious miscommunication.\n\nAnyway, all criticism aside, I like that you\u0027ve approached this systematically. I\u0027m not entirely sure that core transfer per area is a useful measurement, though, because they are in no way related. You might think that it makes sense to build a radiator with a heat pump that is roughly sized in relation to the amount of area it has, but the thing is... they already are. The core transfer rate has nothing to do with how quickly a radiator pulls heat into itself. All that is governed by the normal heat system. The core heat system is completely separate, and just outlines an additional capability that the radiator performs on top of its usual \u0022actively cooling the entire ship\u0022 duties. Core heat is specifically set up so that the heat removed from the core doesn\u0027t even really end up in the radiator; it\u0027s just handwaved away in order to ensure that things don\u0027t explode at high timewarp. You could basically give the tiniest radiator in the entire lineup the core transfer of the largest one, and fully load it, and it would barely grow lukewarm.\n\nSo I personally see the core transfer value entirely separate from the radiator\u0027s normal thermal properties. I understand that that is a matter of opinion, and perhaps you disagree. But in practical application in the game, the core transfer rate is literally just a value that says \u0022inform a part that implements ModuleCoreHeat that this amount of heat-which-is-not-actually-real-heat is magically taken care of, so it can simulate its function properly\u0022. As such, basing the core transfer rate on its area is something you *could* do, if you really wanted to, but which doesn\u0027t end up having any actual game mechanics foundation. Like, there is no practical minimum size a radiator must have in order to be able to deal with x core transfer - technically it is there somewhere, but it\u0027s an absurdly low value.\n\n...if that made any sense ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif \u0022:P\u0022)  Unfortunately I only have view access to the spreadsheet, so I cannot play with the numbers; but once I get home later today it\u0027ll be easy for me to set up something similar.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-27T18:38:18Z\u0022 title=\u002204/27/2016 06:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 27, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind**"},{"CreatedByName":"Psycho_zs","CreatedById":137644,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-27T20:28:50Z","Content":"You can download it and play with it.\n\nI\u0027ve added a line with names.\n\nDisregard my previous comment about waste heat coefficient.

For instance, just taking stock KSP and Near Future into account (along with the USI-\u003ENFE compatibility config), we get [a table somewhat like this](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/44754370/radiatoruse.png). Coloring in by some slightly fuzzy rules about what radiators match what core heat sources (no more than 6 of a kind, straight multiples or fractions also match up to a point, minor over- or under-cooling allowed), you can get a rough idea of where radiators perform perfectly (green) or adequately (yellow) or poorly (uncolored).\n\nBased on this informatiom, you can make informed decisions about which radiators appear to have few real use-cases, and which use-cases have few solutions available. This helps when trying to come up with numbers to propose as changes. For example, you\u0027ll see here that a core transfer of 36, which you proposed based on your math for one of the smallest Heat Control radiators, would be a poor choice because there is almost no use case for which it matches. Only one square would be colored in for it, namely the 100 kW case, and that merely yellow. On the other hand, for another radiator you suggested 2000, which would score at least one green box and several yellows here, and therefore would be a acceptable value to implement.\n\nSince you usually want to be able to attach radiators in 2x or 4x symmetry, it makes sense to try and identify numbers which are halves or quarters of poorly supported use-cases, and find radiators that look suitable for that amount of core transfer. For example, a radiator at 350 core transfer would look very useful in the table above.\n\nAnd, obviously, if you know any core heat sources from other mods, you can take them into consideration as well.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-28T14:55:12Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2016 02:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind**"}]}
