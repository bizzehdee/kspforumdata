This part does nothing otherwise. In my testing I built a mun city with survey stakes and had MKS installed. An MKS colony control center provided the construction pad. It will work with any other launchpad too. I provided parts which let you use the original 3 step system from EPL with MKS installed as well. \n\nLaser Drill: Can mine Ore\n\nLaser Smelter: Convert Ore to Metal\n\nCnc Mill: Convert Metal to rocket parts\n\nConstruction Drone: Increases the productivity of the ship by 30. The construction drone is not a launchpad or survey station.\n\nI did not provide a launchpad as EPL and MKS provide those. You can build on any launchpad. For bases I recommend using a survey station (Colony Control Centers have those) and survey stakes. I posted a sample layout for how to survey the build spot for a biodome.\n\nI did not specifically test orbital construction with the drone but I don\u0027t expect any issues."},{"CreatedByName":"micr0wave","CreatedById":136352,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-01T17:25:14Z","Content":"i built this ([pics](http://imgur.com/a/0eiV8)), but how do i get it populated ?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-01T17:53:54Z\u0022 title=\u002204/01/2015 05:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by micr0wave**\n  \ntypo"},{"CreatedByName":"delder92663","CreatedById":138576,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-01T19:02:01Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I never saw that in my tests.
