Previously the pitch/yaw torque applied by RCS was calculated by multiplying the (scalar) maximum thrust of the RCS thruster by the (scalar) distance to the COM, and the roll torque was treated as being zero. While this was only half the issue - the second half had to do with addressing the RCS modules - I now improved this by calculating torques using the distance to the roll axis for roll torque, and the distance along the roll axis for pitch/yaw torque.

Also, the state of the RCS toggle and the fuel availability are now taken into account, and individual disabled thrusters are counted as well.

The problem is that the base game (and mechjeb) use the term \u0022surface speed\u0022 to mean a 3D speed in a way that in no way is an actual surface speed. It\u0027s the speed in a reference frame that subtracts the rotation of the planet below you from your orbital speed, but is still a speed in 3D space, not a speed along the surface. In other words, it counts your vertical motion into the speed too, which isn\u0027t *really* a surface speed. It\u0027s just a poor choice of words in the main game that mechjeb inherited and kept using.

I admit that it\u0027s messy and confusing. Partly that\u0027s because the underlying implementation of things in KSP itself is a bit messy and it was hard to abstract all the mess away without introducing cases where the abstraction breaks, so I had to expose *some* of the messiness to kerboscript.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
