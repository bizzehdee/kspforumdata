So I figure it\u0027s pretty realistic. Remember, the definition of space is based on the altitude where you\u0027d have to be going at orbital velocity to generate enough lift to fly.

Well games evolve, mods evolve. MM has evolved, allowing us to do things we couldn\u0027t do before, or hadn\u0027t thought of. TAC has evolved allowing us to do more things with it. Ideas change, and new ideas form, causing us to have to go back and make those changes everywhere else for consistency. Bugs haven\u0027t been much of a thing, but they happen, and honestly there is SO much, that I can\u0027t test everything as thorough as I want, that\u0027s why I rely on the community to point things out. First and foremost, for the most part until Felger has started to chip in (THANKS AGAIN!!) This is basically a one man show. Nathan started things. I asked if he wanted help with FASA back in the day and he welcomed me aboard, he in the mean time has left most RO work to me, while he concentrates on all the plugins he has and so on. Then you add that both NK and myself have real jobs, real wifes, real lifes, and on top of that mine will be more complicated in about a week with the arrival of my wifes and I first child. So yeah, free time, I can only do so much. I\u0027m trying to \u0027standardize\u0027 things more than what they ever have been, so that takes time. A lot of the things that worked with 0.24* work in 0.25, but I haven\u0027t tested them at all, and so therefore I\u0027m not going to officially support them either. Thankfully, because 0.24* was the first time I really started to work on things, updating those that were good for 0.24* won\u0027t take much at all for 0.25.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#2. I had gotten behind on FASA with all the updates Friz was doing, it hadn\u0027t seen the love in a very long time, never got to it with 0.24* before 0.25 came out. There is no specific order, because, well, I do what I feel like. I don\u0027t take orders. I felt like doing FASA, so I did. It\u0027s basically done, minus bugs/consistency issues, which eventually will get straightened out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy thoughts, Realism Overhaul is one of the most comprehensive mods out there. Right now, good supported configs touch over 600 parts. There are nearly 1000 more parts that configs have been written and just need touch ups before I declare \u0027official support\u0027. There are thousands of more parts that will eventually see support added. We do what we can to ensure that we make things real, and I\u0027m only one person. Thankfully Felger has pitched in recently, and that help is very much appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RedAV8R","CreatedById":94171,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-31T03:08:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E@closer:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYep, every time KSP starts it has to load textures, models, sounds, etc from your HD to RAM. We are talking 2GB\u002B worth of stuff, it takes time, and this happens for every program you ever run. Even Windows itself. Now compare that 2GB to the whole of RO MM configs, which clocks in something like 1.5MB. Changing text files is easy, that is NOT what is taking time. To understand RSS and it\u0027s loading time, you have to go back to the way KSP works. It loads it\u0027s \u0027world\u0027, then RSS changes that world and applies new textures to that world. That\u0027s just the way KSP works. It\u0027s nobodies fault, there simply isn\u0027t another way to do it. If there was a way to load the RSS world first and not have to load the default stuff, then that\u0027d be great, but it\u0027d still take time. Especially depending on what size textures you are using with RSS. The big pack is over a 1GB by itself. So yeah, every time KSP loads, it loads it\u0027s own 2GB, then has to load another 1GB on top of that. Bottom line. It\u0027s not MM and/or RO patches that is taking time, mostly it\u0027s texture loading.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for your re-entry issue, \u0027glowing\u0027 is *maybe* a DRE issue, but could just be a stock issue. Don\u0027t know, not RO problem, that\u0027s for sure. Honestly, everything you see altitude wise, is the way it\u0027s supposed to be (for now) IF you have things installed correctly. So, if you want more help how about a log, just like the OP tells you to do in the first place. Why on earth do you have 2-3 heatshields on top of the included heatshield that\u0027s part of the Mk1 pod??
