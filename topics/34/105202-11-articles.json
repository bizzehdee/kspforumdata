I got a problem, my Krebal\u0027s do not get any negative effects and go in strike when they time out of snacks. I have a question, what are all the other mod requirements for this mod to work? Yesterday I was trying for a while to get it to work with no success at all, then I happened to read in this topic that someone else had issues and were told to install Module Manager. Well, having a simple few very non-intrusive mods I did not have that.. so yeah. I think this information of required Module Manager should be added to the first page to save some other people time..\n\nAnyway, I got MM 2.6.3, now the Kerbals happily eat up supplies and the pop-up now shows the time of supplies in all my ships, etc. But I run out of snacks the timer stops at all zeros and stays yellow, only once did it go a more red color and count into the negative, but I could always command the ship and Kerbals with no issue.\n\nConsiderations I made:\n\n- Last version and also new version of the mod (0.1.2), tried yesterday and today.\n\n- Always a white suit Kerbal, of course. No oranges.\n\n- Fresh game save in KSP 1.0.2.\n\n- Tried in both Sandbox mode and Career, didn\u0027t know if it mattered.\n\n- Tried in both the landing pad and in orbit, didn\u0027t know if it mattered.\n\n- Tried with starting some snacks on board or none at all.\n\n- Tried with big white pod and small grey pod (default 1 and 3 seat rocket capsules).\n\n- Definitely passing 15 days past empty, I would time accelerate into 100 days mission.\n\n- Tried passing the timer running out both with time accelerate on and off, didn\u0027t know if it would effect the script.\n\n- Removed all my other mods, which is like 5 that I can\u0027t imagine modifying any part of this mod (They got nothing to do with modifying resources, Kerbals, stock parts, etc).\n\nI did not try:\n\n- Turning the \u0022causes death\u0022 setting to true, it didn\u0027t seem like that would be the stasis effect from the name of it.\n\nAny ideas what I\u0027ve done wrong?

Works well.\n\nFor anyone else wanting to know the ins and outs of using greenhouses from an engineering point of view. I have done some calculations that I thought I would share.\n\n**What does a greenhouse do?**\n\nIt turns 50% of mulch back into supplies for a small EC cost.\n\nThis has the effect of doubling the time it takes for a Kerbal to get through his supplies.\n\n**How many greenhouses do I need to take?**\n\nEach greenhouse can process the Mulch from just over one Kerbal. \n\nSo the first rule of thumb is take a greenhouse for every Kerbal.\n\n**When is it more efficient to take greenhouses over just more supplies?**\n\nShort answer here is any trip that will last seven years or more.\n\nLong answer is a greenhouse weighs 1.6t. \n\n1.6t of supplies is 1600 supplies, which is enough for 3y208d.\n\nSo if you take an extra 1600 supplies you get 6y416d. \n\nIf you took a greenhouse instead of the extra supplies you also get 6y416d (about seven years).\n\nSo this is the break even point. Any trips longer than this will be more mass efficient using greenhouses. Any shorter trips will be more mass efficient just taking extra supplies.\n\nThe above calculation is for one Kerbal and one greenhouse. But because a Kerbal requires his own greenhouse, and his own supplies, the break even point is the same.\n\n**So break it down by planet to make it easier for me:**\n\nShort answer: Take greenhouses to Jool (and moons) and Eeloo.\n\nAll other closer planets are more mass efficient taking extra supplies.\n\nLong answer:\n\nJool typically takes seven years in travel time alone, there and back. Add in extra time visiting moons and waiting maybe up to a year worse case for a good return angle and greenhouses definitely pay off.\n\nThis assumes standard Hohmann transfers.\n\nDres full return trip you are looking at 3 and a half to 4 years. Greenhouses don\u0027t pay off here.\n\nIf anyone spots an error please let me know.\n\nFinally, this is a guide for the mass and efficiency conscious. Greenhouses look cool, so please take them anywhere you want if you feel like it ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif), at least your Kerbals wont get space scurvy.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-06T19:49:23Z\u0022 title=\u002205/06/2015 07:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Remi**"},{"CreatedByName":"slick50","CreatedById":52922,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T20:33:24Z","Content":"Not working on my 1.0.2 install."},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T20:34:21Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Not working on my 1.0.2 install.\n\nModule manager installed?"},{"CreatedByName":"slick50","CreatedById":52922,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T20:39:09Z","Content":"ModuleManager.2.6.2.dll installed \n\nIm having same issues as Nicole."},{"CreatedByName":"plague006","CreatedById":142570,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T20:40:34Z","Content":"Just coming back to KSP from a long time away.
