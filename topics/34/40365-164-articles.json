It runs but the generator, elsewhere on the ship doesn\u0027t detect it and won\u0027t start. I tried fuel lines, they didn\u0027t seem to do anything...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I put a fission reactor with its own gen, that runs fine, but the generator I want to start on my ship is still giving me the \u0022no reactor found\u0022 message... Even when I start the fusion reactor with the acquired megajoules from the fission set, the ship gen still doesn\u0027t see the fusion reactor as a valid \u0022reactor\u0022, and won\u0027t start, even if it is right next to it. How does one do this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext, If I want to attach say 8 fusion reactors to a 2.5m generator, if I attach them using the \u0022fake docking port\u0022 part (which has fuel crossfeed enabled) to the SIDE of the generator, they don\u0027t pass their MW/th energy to it. Attach on the top, works fine for the FIRST layer, but if I put another lot on top of them (without the fake d-port), they aren\u0027t seen by the generator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs that the fake d-port acting weirdly, or is there some sort of rule, \u0022how far the reactors can be from the generator\u0022?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo save me hours of testing, I thought I\u0027d just ask!
