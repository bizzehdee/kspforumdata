A lot of mods have been converting from TGA to PNG because Unity seems to handle them better. B9 converted to PNG and according to their change logs they dropped 1.25GB of active RAM and didn\u0027t lose much, if any, quality (presumably that\u0027s without active texture management). I was just wondering if the same could be beneficial for Kerbin-Side. I know it\u0027s not traditional parts so I wasn\u0027t sure if it would react the same but 1.25GB is a lot so I thought it would be worth it to ask.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve experimented with using PNGs before and saw no real benefit to memory footprint myself. I use the highest compression on the TGAs on KerbinSide but I admit that sometimes I forget to resize some of the textures down that wouldn\u0027t lose much quality if they were. Just a sloppy release procedure my end I hope to improve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave a look in KerbinSide\u0027s folder and order the files by size, largest at the top. Any TGAs near the top, pop them open in an image editor. If it\u0027s a very basic texture with little detail, you won\u0027t cause issues resizing it down. 128x128 will normally be small enough. If the texture is a detailed one, I\u0027d recommend leaving it alone regardless of the size - reducing it may well compromise the quality.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spacepetscompany","CreatedById":119734,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-10T19:23:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022UAL002\u0022 data-cite=\u0022UAL002\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYes.
