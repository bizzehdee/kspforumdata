Just like we can add LeadBallast or Electricity to tanks?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem I am experiencing is that while we have some generic Avionics modules, they are set sizes (1m, 2m, 3m) but most early(-ish) American rockets (and probably others but I\u0027m mostly familiar with American ones) are odd sized (Atlas, Titan, most Centaur = 3.05m, Centaur T = 4.3m, Delta II = 2.4m) so using the generic modules don\u0027t work so well. It\u0027s fine when there\u0027s a prebuilt fuel tank with an avionics package included, but from what I can tell there is only the generic Centaur fuel tank (representing Centaur A, B, C, D \u0026amp; D1). The longer Centaurs used with the Atlas III and V, the wider Centaur T used on the Titan IV, and the various DCSS tanks can currently only be recreated using procedural tanks and then trying to fit an improperly sized generic avionics module somewhere inside a fairing. But if there was some way to include avionics as if it where ElectricCharge, that would give a lot more freedom to create some of these stages without the need for dozens of new parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"balu0","CreatedById":74978,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-24T21:40:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey guys, anyone know a fix for the low thrust on the IO-550 propeller engine ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt gives off way too low power.
