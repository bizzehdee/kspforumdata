See, I tend to RP my big builds, putting a story behind them even if its in my own head. It makes it more fun for me... Instead of just build, blast, dock, repeat, theres a sense that, in my own head at least, Im completing a mission against difficult odds. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do this with KSP a lot, but with this mod, for some reason, it just seems to be more fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I was going over the stages for my KSS with the RP stuff I\u0027d made up along the way and I thought, wouldnt this be a better \u0027story\u0027 mode than the campaign mode that Squad has built and is apparently planning to expand with contracts? Like, instead of picking and choosing generic missions like get a satellite into orbit, we have a long term project type campaign with each level being a stage along the way. In my case, with the KSO, it would be level one: test fly and land the KSO without loss of vehicle or crew, level two, deliver a payload to orbit with the KSO etc etc, but rather than a simple, do this, get reward, unlock bigger rockets, move on type deal, there could be complexities of a story with twists and setbacks that happen during or even between missions - these could be abstract, such as an engine malfunctions mid flight forcing you to adjust your flight profile or even abort to save your crew or even based on real world events, such as the Apollo 1 fire, which could lead, in game to the masses of kerbin cry out for safer rockets and until they get them, you can only do unmanned stuff or you could have to compete with an invisible enemy (or rival) to get a job done cheaper, like the bidding war that was run to see who would service the ISS after the shuttle retired.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, what Im driving at would be similar to standard career mode as it is now, you start out small and limited, and you build on it - but rather than it all being the story you create, there would be an actual in game story to drive it along. There could even be added plot elements like government pressure to get things done in a certain way or in a certain time or under a certain budget (or all three) or your program is shut down, programs being scrapped mid way through so you have to scramble to repurpose your designs or lose funding. There could be industrial espionage between competing space programs where you have spies trying to steal competitors designs for better parts and engines while they try to do the same to you, you could have deadlines put in jeopardy by contractors failing to deliver that mega efficient engine in time for the much hyped mission to duna that youve committed publicly to, forcing you to come up with a way to work around the problem with a restricted set of parts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was watching helldivers stream while he was developing the Super 25 and he mentioned a similar thought to this, he was referring to you, the player, being NASA (or the kerbal equivalent) competing against either private companies or a rival nation ala the space race and how this would drive the enjoyment by giving you a goal to strive for. I know that Squad say the basis of KSP is to be unbound and to do whatever you want, which is a good thing and, of course, just as they do in the likes of Tropico, the sandbox would always be there for you to do your own thing and just go nuts with whatever you want, but the career mode, in my opinion, should not just be limited to restricting parts till you unlock better ones - in many ways the current career mode plays like a tutorial, helping you to learn the game as you go rather than being overwhelmed by the complexity at the start - which is fine, but I want more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone agree?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Robotengineer","CreatedById":104525,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-24T21:13:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo almost like adding a bit of strategy game to KSP, or more of a role-play style?
