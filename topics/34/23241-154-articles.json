The moment of inertia of a pendulum is (pendulum mass) times (pendulum length)\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2, and since we\u0027re only looking at rotation along one axis, we can use the pendulum as an approximation for the B9 gear - this may even be the way KSP calculates it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you now look at the weigth of the stock gear (0.5 tons) and the B9 gear (~0.1 tons), we notice that the stock gears mass is much lower, and if Bac9 didn\u0027t set the \u0027pendulum length\u0027 to a value high enough, the moment of inertia of the B9 wheels will come out to be extremely low, resulting in minimal torque causing maximal angular acceleration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis also explains why struts won\u0027t stabilize the B9 gear as much as desired: the force applied to the Gear by struts is (probably - as I suspect) calculated using the current strut strain - which is zero at the time the Gear is still behaving normal, but as soon as the gear starts wobbling, it deflects by up to 45 degrees within a single frame - and as the struts dont do anything until then, the wobbling has already begun and the struts only add more chaotic torque.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGiven that this theory of wobblyness is correct, the solution to the gear wobbling problem would be to increase the moment of inertia of the B9 Gears to one similar or higher than the stock gears.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the \u0027SidewaysStiffness\u0027 is somehow connected to the moment of inertia, the fix has already been found.
