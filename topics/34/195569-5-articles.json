relative to the sun, while the later is rotation relative to the stars.\u00A0 In stock KSP the solar day is 6 hours, while Kerbin\u0027s sidereal period is 5h:59m:09.4s.\u00A0 The clock uses the solar day, but the sidereal period is what you see when looking at the information panel in the Tracking Station.\u00A0 If you use a 1.25x multiplier, the solar day is going to be 7.5 hours.\u00A0 But if
