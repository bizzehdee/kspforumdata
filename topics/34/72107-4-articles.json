And sorry for the somewhat harsh words. I\u0027d like to explain that a bit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt takes quite some time to create and test a mod. I might not be the fastest modder but this thing has eaten almost three weeks of my spare time. I generally try to create something of OK quality so I test quite a lot. I do that because first of all, I enjoy the parts myself and want to share that. However I also want the mod to be successful. I like it to get feedback, to see pictures with my parts , etc... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I really want to avoid is the stigma of bad quality because it will prevent the mod from being successful and my work will be wasted. I wouldn\u0027t download another mod when people say it crashes the game. And I would probably remember. These things stick. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo people really need to be careful when making unjustified statements about mod quality because it kills the only thing a modder gets for his work: The joy of seeing other people using it. And that in turn kills motivation and in effect will reduce the willingness of people to spend evening after evening to create a mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat you did is to tell people this mod causes crashes and you did so without any sign off doubt. That\u0027s why I reacted that way. I hope you understand my position. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you for checking again and thank you for clarifying that this mod is not the source of your crash. If you now could also put that information to your other thread that still says asteroid cities crashes the game, I\u0027d be all happy. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETobias\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"4nxs","CreatedById":80680,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-16T14:13:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETesting my new asteroid scout, based on the Rosetta Philae Lander!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/hAosC\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

While doing so I was under the impression that the ModuleGrappleNode:nodeType parameter follows the sizing of the docking ports (I might be totally wrong there!); if that\u0027s the case, then the small grabber would probably be a size0 and the large one size2.

I have a support vessel for capturing D/E class asteroids, and it has 15 functional \u0022pods\u0022 which I attach to the asteroid (12 \u0022gyros\u0022 for rotation, 2 power/lighting towers to provide power to the SAS modules, and 1 general purpose large docking port). It went through several iterations, because I have experienced terrible lag with that craft, maybe 3 fps in the VAB as seen in the first image. First I thought it was due to the number of parts (~200 in the first version), so I created a welded part for the gyros and optimized some other areas, but still no luck. Eventually I found out it is just the ** stock grabbers - removed them, and I am back to 20\u002B fps.

So maybe a redesign of the generator block in the power/lighting towers is in order (the cone with the 8 embedded RTGs); but I do want to keep it close to the grabber for the weight balance, as some of my earlier attempts at asteroid control/utility pods ended up oscillating a lot, even when I tried to strut them to the asteroid using KAS struts. Or I could keep using stock grabbers for those, hmm... but the lag of even two of those is actually noticeable.
