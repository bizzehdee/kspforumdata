They\u0027re great for orders of magnitude, but aren\u0027t super good for interpolating values. But yeah, it kind of ended up doing the opposite of what I wanted. If I do re-work it, I will probably use a larger portion of the gauge for the last 100 or 500 so that the needle slows down instead of speeding up at the end. After all, you don\u0027t usually care if your 2,534 meters or 2,562 meters, just around 2,500 is good enough. But 34 and 62 could be a big difference.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd for those looking for airspeed and such, here\u0027s a preview of what I\u0027m working on.
