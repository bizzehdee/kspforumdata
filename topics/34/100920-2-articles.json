I\u0027m thinking these just play together by virtue of what they do.\n\nHow do they interact (in particular the difference between a physical return and a transmission)? Or, am I misunderstanding completely and I shouldn\u0027t use both mods at the same time?\n\nhere\u0027s what I think happens...\n\nNMSG simply makes an experiment always worth the full value of the experiment, instead of the fraction it may have had before. This mod, then, turns around and just changes parameters for biome associations and such, and tweaks the coefficients for returned vs transmitted? My read then is that you might still need to repeat, depending on those transmission/return scalers, in that a transmission may leave a segment of science that may only be satisfied by a return, BUT you wouldn\u0027t gain anything from additional transmissions and a single return should fill the gap?\n\nNow, what I *don\u0027t* get. Why on earth would numeric instruments like the thermometer/barometer/gravimetric/seismic not have an xmitDataScalar of 1? I can understand the atmospheric analysis as that might involve keeping a physical sample (and in that case I would have actually scaled it more like the mystery goo or materials bay) , but these other things are just data. I really feel you should have gone all the way on those.\n\nIt\u0027s easy to fix to be the way that I want, but should you ever update I\u0027ll have to remember to go back in and tweak it all again ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-10T04:28:55Z\u0022 title=\u002208/10/2015 04:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by draeath**"},{"CreatedByName":"zekew11","CreatedById":59689,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T05:54:20Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E When you say this, what exactly do you mean by complements?

Or, am I misunderstanding completely and I shouldn\u0027t use both mods at the same time?\n\nThere is no overlap between the mods (your \u0022what I think happens\u0022 was basically correct). No More Science Grinding modifies re-runable experiments on the experiment definition level so that they only need to be run once to reach their full value. For example, if you launch and recover a mystery goo from low orbit over biome y, performing another mystery goo study in the same situation will yield no further gains: all science possible was awarded on the first go. Science Revised modifies the rate at which the experiment will transmit at the per-part level. The reason the mods \u0022compliment\u0022 each other is that both seek to \u0022fix\u0022 parts of the stock science system that many found unintuitive or unfriendly for gameplay.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Now, what I *don\u0027t* get. Why on earth would numeric instruments like the thermometer/barometer/gravimetric/seismic not have an xmitDataScalar of 1? I can understand the atmospheric analysis as that might involve keeping a physical sample (and in that case I would have actually scaled it more like the mystery goo or materials bay) , but these other things are just data. I really feel you should have gone all the way on those.\n\nThis is a rationalized gameplay decision. I have a minmaxer playstyle, so for me, it\u0027s good gameplay to have to have the opportunity to take risks (data return on a mission where the craft [hopefully] returns) for a slightly improve science reward. I figured that for non-minmaxers, the trivial amount of science lost would be inconsequential. However, the rationalization, which I think is a sound one, is that the results can be verified and calibrated if the instrument itself is returned to kerbin for analysis.\n\nI\u0027m considering adding a feature in the next patch that removes the ability to \u0022take data\u0022 from these numeric sensors. This would better suit the rationalization, but would still allow the experiment to be re-run indefinitely for repeated data transmission. If I include this option, I\u0027ll also include a patch, disabled by default, that sets the data scalers to 1 and re-enables data removal as an alternative to my system."},{"CreatedByName":"LitaAlto","CreatedById":110917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-17T19:36:26Z","Content":"I really love this mod, and I\u0027m using it in my current Science game, ***MOAR SCIENCE, HI!*** It really solves a few of the science headaches I\u0027ve experienced previously.\n\nBut I noticed that it doesn\u0027t seem to buff the Planetary Lab from [Kerbal Planetary Base Systems](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/127413).
