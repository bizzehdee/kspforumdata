With stock aerodynamics, rockets have can have 0 lift if they don\u0027t have any control surfaces, but can still launch due to having TWR \u0026gt; 1. Planes can have TWR less than 1 (I have a glider that can easily maintain level flight with a TWR of .3) because they also get lift due to aerodynamic properties of the wings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only mod I know of that calculates the lift to weight ratio is Ferram Aerospace Research. It\u0027s abbreviated as L/W and only shown in flight if you click \u0022Flight Data.\u0022 It will also graph lift to weight (L/W) as a function of angle of attack or forward velocity in the SPH.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-26T00:34:14Z\u0022 title=\u002206/26/2014 12:34  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 26, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Master Tao\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eninja\u0026#039;d, and more info\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheReaper","CreatedById":75943,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-26T08:47:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jrandom\u0022 data-cite=\u0022jrandom\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt\u0027s called \u0022Thrust to Weight\u0022 and is abbreviated as TWR.
