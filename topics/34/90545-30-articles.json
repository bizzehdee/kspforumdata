For instance, the M9 engine (5m) is meant to be like the Falcon-9\u0027s cluster of Merlin engines, but the M9 is 5m wide, whereas the Falcon-9 is actually only around 3.66. Making a \u0022BFR\u0022 at 7.5m in diameter instead will be undersized, since SpaceX plans to make the BFR closer to 10m in diameter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, just some amusing thoughts. It\u0027s worth remembering that SpaceY isn\u0027t meant to at all be an analog for SpaceX, but rather a stock-balanced expansion of the base game, with some SpaceX inspired parodies. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I\u0027m not sure what to do with the color scheme yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYay for this!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NecroBones","CreatedById":105424,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-12T20:23:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGlad you guys are liking it! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW, slighty altered screenshot here.
