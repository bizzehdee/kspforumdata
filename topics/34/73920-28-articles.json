I know some people will like having to train their engineers, but for me, that feels counter to the stock feel of the game. So, like with many mods, there can be a \u0022stockalike\u0022 version using the stock level. (I personally like to think that by the flight, the engineers gained engineering training, even if it is just how to operate in zero gee.) I am aware of how using flights to level engineers may seem problematic, so here is where the augmented mode comes in. This would use the mod\u0027s leveling system in some way--or yet more options--like what @cantab said above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever you chose to implement it, I feel that there should be a stockalike mode.
