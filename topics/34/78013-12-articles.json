Command pod orientation would never forced to be blunt end first, so you can reenter at any orientation you like. The only reason that orientation is forced is by drag not being applied at the CoM, and in stock, that\u0027s accomplished by parachutes (even not deployed) having higher drag than capsules. You\u0027d never have to worry about where you attached wings, because after all, with the center of pressure forced to be at the center of mass perpetually, there\u0027s no way to build an unstable plane! Of course, there\u0027s also no way to build a stable plane either, so you\u0027ll be sideslipping and pitching out of control with no way to right things, but hey, aerodynamic forces applied to CoM means only neutral stability, not actual static stability!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and funny thing about applying all the aerodynamic forces to the center of mass: without distributed forces, there is no aerodynamic damping. Now, that basically means that there is absolutely no chance that this aerodynamic system could ever stop a plane from tumbling! Of course, you could instead argue that wings remain magical special things that apply forces at their own location (for no apparent reason to the player) solely because that results in the outcome you want, but then you\u0027re setting up inconsistent physics to get a desired outcome. Inconsistent physics is bad game design and is confusing for players. Yes, this applies to stock aerodynamics (the bad game design comment), and I submit all of the players confused by why their spaceplanes-on-top-of-booster-rockets are unstable as proof that it confuses people; they have not considered that aerodynamic forces might be applied somewhere that would make the vehicle unstable because they were taught otherwise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETL;DR: Your system makes everything worse.
