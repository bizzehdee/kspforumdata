Now with an example 6 booster and 1 center column design using mainsails, as you shed boosters, your Thrust-to-Weight ratio drops. Each mainsail adds a fairly significant amount to your TWR, so as you\u0027re going up, you\u0027re loosing TWR and only gaining a slight amount as you get higher.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, ideally, you want to have as much thrust on the center column as you can manage (Without causing the rocket to pancake, that is) and keep your TWR roughly the same throughout the ascent. Its particularly important at the last stage of your final ascent into orbit when all you have is the super-tall center column and its a problem that many people don\u0027t even realize they have. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re trying to point towards the horizon to gain lateral speed, so you\u0027re no longer using most of your thrust to resist gravity. If your TWR drops too much, then the top of the rocket will want to point back towards the ground subtly, of course your engine and controls fight it, but it causes extra stresses on your tall, wobbly center column. These extra stresses can potentially cause your rocket to fail, resulting in those frustrating \u0027Tank X collided into Tank Y\u0027 structural failures, which can sometimes keep happening even after you add more struts!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah, really the only time you\u0027d want to jettison the radial engines is when you\u0027re actually in a stable orbit, which by that time, you\u0027re lifters job is pretty much done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIncidentally Chris, I -had- been thinking of adding such a bottom attachment node to some of the adapters for a similar reason. So that people could use them for a mid-stage like the Saturn 5, for example. The only problem with that is: I don\u0027t know what the height is of the engines you\u0027re using. The LV-Ns are nearly twice the length of a typical chemical motor, and the LV-909s are, of course, even smaller still. It didn\u0027t seem to make much sense to me to release a bunch of duplicate parts where only a bottom node has a different placement.
