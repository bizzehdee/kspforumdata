I find that with the more ungainly stuff you need to be very careful on your gravity turn; don\u0027t even think about approaching 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 pitch until you\u0027re well out of the lower atmosphere or the top-heavy drag will mess you up, and pitch over very gradually when you do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can make up some of the loss of the delayed gravity turn by making the circularisation burn a smooth part of the launch. Once you\u0027re up into the almost-zero drag stratosphere, even unruly rockets can be set to 0\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 pitch without much problem. Just hold the \u0022time to apoapsis\u0022 at about 10 seconds until you\u0027ve got your periapsis above 70k.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-18T12:58:03Z\u0022 title=\u002208/18/2014 12:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 18, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Wanderfound\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tetryds","CreatedById":50204,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-18T12:45:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Wanderfound\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Wanderfound\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Enot-quite-vertical rudders should probably be set for yaw and roll.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, that is true, you can set more commands for several controls, like using elevons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I heavily discourage you to set rudders to yaw and roll if you are going faster than Mach 0.8 (sometimes even at 0.5 it can be catastrophic, literally).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe best thing is not touch yaw, leave a bit of control there for the SAS, but you don\u0027t really need it when piloting on your own.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I mean is put the rudders for aerodynamic purposes, but don\u0027t really use them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DaMichel","CreatedById":93697,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-18T12:53:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is nothing stopping you from building a \u0022wide body\u0022 launcher.
