Sometimes Squad changes something so it\u0027s best to update. As for KSPAPIExtensions, it\u0027s an extension of the KSP TweakUI that allows selections and a different implementation of sliders. The problem occurs when a dll such as infernal robotics uses a dll such as KSPAPIExtensions, it can only see what is in that current directory. Having KSPAPIExtensions elsewhere isn\u0027t going to help because the dll won\u0027t be able to see it.
