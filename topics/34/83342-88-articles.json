Essentially you buy time up-front and then\u00A0submit your jobs which uses up x amount of time (if you submit 1000 [single threaded]\u00A0jobs and they take 24 hours to run, you use up 24000 core hours of time). I know of people who ran a simulation using up millions of core hours of time only to find out afterward that they messed up their initial conditions and simulated absolutely nothing of interest (I believe they were simulating something travelling through a carbon nanotube, but the thing fell out of the end of the tube right away and just floated around outside of it). So in some sense I like the idea of \u0022I pay for this much time and if I mess up it\u0027s my fault\u0022 because that\u0027s closer to how it actually works. You often can check after some time to make sure things are making sense and cancel them early if they aren\u0027t, which is partly accounted for by letting you revert to launch as many times as you want.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt doesn\u0027t really matter that much though, cause I don\u0027t control how KRASH\u0027s simulations work \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo remove the \u0022simulate\u0022 button just go into the KCT settings and disable simulations.
