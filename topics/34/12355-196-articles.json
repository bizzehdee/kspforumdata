If I know how much DV I can put at each passage, I can compute the orbital period of each next orbit, so that time is rather easily computed. My method only holds in case the planets are on low eccentric orbits and I don\u0027t even dare to make a transfer with an inclined orbit that way. But, if I want to get to Eeloo with a low-thrust engine, I may really depend on a tool like MJ to find a better solution.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-09T19:52:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022diomedea\u0022 data-cite=\u0022diomedea\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Esarbian in a good mood\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll have to speak with my manager for that \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_lipssealed.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sealed:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am quite sure there is an \u0022easy\u0022 solution to this.

I have noticed that it happens 95% of the time when I am using a probe-core for control, as opposed to a command pod (which then has a failure rate of about 50%). I have tested this on all the major planetary bodies, as well as Minmus and the Mun. If I select a specific landing location, or if I hit \u0022land somewhere\u0022, MJ will correctly perform the burn to exit it\u0027s orbital path, and will then correctly angle towards retrograde (\u002B/- some if corrections are needed). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, after this step (ship is currently on a sub-orbital course towards the surface) MJ will stop throttling the ship completely. The Landing Autopilot will read \u0022final decent xxxxxkm\u0022. The Autopilot will then allow the ship to crash full-on into the surface and explode, without slowing down or correctly positioning for landing after the final decent stage. The Roll/Pitch/Yaw controls still show use as normal, however there is no thrust control again. If I cancel the auto-pilot, intentionally incorrectly orient the ship, then re-engage the autopilot -- it will correct orientation, but will still not thrust what-so-ever. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeen at this for a long time, so yes, I have fuel, the required Delta-V, electrical power, etc etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt first I assumed it was a conflicting mod, as MJ has almost always been very good to me; but then I removed all mods but MJ and started a new game to test it out, and got the same results.
