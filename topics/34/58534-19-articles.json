For (relatively) adequate and varied nutrition he estimates 54 cubic meters per kerbal for a manually harvested greenhouse, and a theoretical minimum of 9 cubic meters per kerbal for a highly space-efficient, fully-automated one. Both estimates include all of the necessary equipment and lighting. Since almost half of that 54 m^3 figure is wasted on space for crew to move about harvesting the plants (18 m^3 between plant rows, and from that NASA document it seems a further several cubic meters is reserved for space to move hands within the growth area), with full automation it should be about 30 m^3 per kerbal. With some improvements in space-efficiency (a realistic assumption since space-efficiency of such systems is improving and the NASA document he uses is 10 years old) that should be at least somewhat reduceable. To be safe let\u0027s assume only limited improvements (far less than his proposed maximum) and say it would be 25 m^3 per kerbal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince this estimate already includes the equipment, we can \u0022move\u0022 the bioreactor to one of the spherical ends of the PA550 module. That leaves us with the entirety of the cylindrical part to play with. It has about 78 cubic meters of volume, so assuming 3 cubic meters for walls, we are left with 75 cubic meters for the greenhouse proper, in other words enough for three kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESo the updated estimate is: PA550 is sufficient to \u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eadequately and \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003Ealmost indefinitely support THREE kerbals, not four. But this is now a scientifically plausible estimate backed by NASA data, not just a \u0022let\u0027s try to make realistic assumptions\u0022 one as previously.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe also provided a weight estimate: 4.5 tonnes per kerbal, and a power consumption estimate: 90 EC/s/kerbal, both apparently regardless of volume used. So I would say a PA550-based greenhouse should weigh about 18 tonnes (assuming 4 tonnes for a bioreactor* and 0.5 tonnes for a small reserve) and require about 300 EC/s (assuming 30 EC for automated planting and harvesting).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*This bioreactor is the only make-believe part of the whole system, as to my (admittedly limited) knowledge no existing bioreactor is capable of recovering nutrients to the degree required to make the whole system closed-loop. However, on Earth a 1 cubic meter, 1-tonne bioreactor could be enough to treat wastewater output of an entire house, whereas in order to make the whole thing more plausible I propose a 4-cubic meter, 4-tonne one for the life support system, assuming that if such an advanced system was ever created, it would have to be more complex and therefore bulkier.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"namAehT","CreatedById":99787,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-12T03:17:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Hattivat\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Hattivat\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E-insert interesting things-\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Hattivat\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Hattivat\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E-insert more interesting things-\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would actually be a really nice idea for a TAC life support crossover where you could generate food/water/oxygen back from the wastes based off of your crafts greenhouse modules.

If you change the module for the spinning animation to FSanimateGeneric (instead of ModuleAnimateGeneric) you\u0027ll be able to enter and exit the habitat once it\u0027s inflated, regardless of whether you set it spinning or not.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TampaPowers","CreatedById":66443,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-10T10:47:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt be cool to have that fixed in a way since it also prevents internal crew transfer from happening.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rhoark","CreatedById":57151,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-19T20:43:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAre there any pics of the deflated forms?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, what this needs is an inflatable 1 kerbal pod that stows to a KAS backpack.
