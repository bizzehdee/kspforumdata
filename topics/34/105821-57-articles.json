If they\u0027re in awkward or difficult locations, you should take it up with whoever made the HOYO Command pod, assuming that pod isn\u0027t recycling one of the stock example IVAs that ships with RPM.\n\nRPM includes just the one example camera part.  Last I checked, the Hullcam VDS external camera parts have configs that are compatible with RPM, so that provides you some additional options.  I\u0027ve seen a couple of other parts with RPM configs here-and-there in mods, as well."},{"CreatedByName":"Lunar Sea","CreatedById":164137,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-19T19:44:54Z","Content":"Thanks that\u0027s very helpful.
