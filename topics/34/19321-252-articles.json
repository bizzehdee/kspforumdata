It feels like I installed two mods: FAR and \u0022realism changes for certain parts\u0022. I understand new features get added, but the earlier changes to jet engines and the wing strength/mass features seem to be from another mod entirely. Im not trying to say these changes are good/bad, or even about their implementation.

I\u0027d rather people just use AJE, but most won\u0027t, and enough people complained that I nerfed jets to more realistic thrusts.
