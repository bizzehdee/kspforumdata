Disabling this options will do nothing to make the actual unlocks editable via Module Manager - it will enable Module Manager to edit all other aspects of the tree ***but*** the actual unlocks, if only because the Unlocks node is laid out in a way that Module Manager can\u0027t alter by way of the nature of its principle of operation.\n\nIf we started specifying the unlocks the classical way (i.e. on a per-part basis), then we wouldn\u0027t even need to disable this feature in order to enable \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E patches for the unlocks, as those are actually independent of the TechTree config node\u0027s final form, even if this form was the result of Yonge Tech Tree doing its magic. It would however be necessary to disable it if users should be able to alter the *structure* of the tree via \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E, that is tech node names, costs, positions and connections.\n\nThough it would probably be sensible to disable this feature anyway - per-part \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E patches in all likelihood end up being incompatible with any tech tree other than the one they were intended for.\n\n ------\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 20.10.2016 at 4:46 PM, Probus said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I would love a tool like that!
