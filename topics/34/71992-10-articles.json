If it\u0027s affecting the centrifuge, that\u0027s probably one of the test parts where I\u0027ve used a \u0027not texture\u0027 marked as a texture, or just re-named a 1x1 .tga to .png (which oddly seemed to fix the .tga loader bugs). The stock part loader doesn\u0027t care if it\u0027s a text file marked as .png or a 1024x1024 texture for SXT\u0027s purposes. While a 1x1 texture gets scaled up to 64x64 apparently, using a text file \u003Cem\u003Eseems\u003C/em\u003E like it might be saving a bit of memory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@_Rade,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, I\u0027ve had that a few times.
