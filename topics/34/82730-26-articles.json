As in furthest from the center. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor fuel consumption you can use TAC fuel balancer or personally I just use 2x fuel lines. Each fuel system has one fuel line going to the \u0027central\u0027 (whatever the center one feeding your primary engine is) and one fuel line going BACK From it. If you have fuel lines and only going one way that causes those fuel sources to be used first. If you have fuel lines going TO and FROM your radial fuel supplies then all your fuel gets drained at the same rate. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat provided me balance for VTOL and regular flight, with and without cargo. Also build the ship without the cargo in it, then add your payload. If the payload is uneven I put the cargo in weighted aft and put a small fuel tank with the correct weight of fuel attached to a docking port on the ships nose, then turn off resource passing through the docking port so the tank doesn\u0027t get emptied. After I deploy the payload I turn resource transfer on and move the fuel from the tank into my central fuel tank (so I haven\u0027t just wasted the weight) and undock the tank. I\u0027ve wasted at most 100 funds or so on just the empty tank that way and kept ship balance.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mischief","CreatedById":105311,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-31T19:24:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RoverDude\u0022 data-cite=\u0022RoverDude\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOther mods \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETeaser stuff for the thread in general:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ALvTwGl.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/ALvTwGl.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe need this TODAY.
