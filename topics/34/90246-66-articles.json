This saves addon authors time and effort when their users use CKAN to get updates. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eforced which means the user overrides the version safety for this app (and its dependencies). Do this when your favorite addon isnt current but you want to install it anyway. This is akin to a manual install.

Also no better off with CKAN last week because it would not work without the new metadata. Glad you agree it used to break then. Well hopefully not now. When 1.0.5 hits the new version checking ideas in the development notes should kick it. Using the suggested \u0022fuzzy\u0022-version check. Also Murdabenne has gone a bit further that just fixing metadata. His suggestion for forced updates can bypass the need for chasing metadata on a temporary basis. On the other hand as you and others have stated it might make things worst. The jury is still out on this one. Either way is a tough choice.
