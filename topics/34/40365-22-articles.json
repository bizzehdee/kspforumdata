I can very easily make Antimatter now, just, how can it be USED? Cause the most I\u0027ve got is using the antimatter to power an antimatter reactor (I think it\u0027s a reactor), and that could be used to power something else. Only, it creates thermal power, and no actual fuel goes through, so I can\u0027t use a thermal rocket, but it can be used to power a regular electric generator, which can then be used to power a plasma thruster, but I tried that. It only gives out 2.1 KN when I try.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SeventhArchitect\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SeventhArchitect\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027ve tried antimatter to thermal, to thrust, but it\u0027s still so much less efficient, and so much less thrust than regular liquidfuel engines.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.1kN is the kind of thrust you get from a nuclear reactor \u002B electric generator and a plasma engine, not an antimatter reactor and electric generator.

The easiest mistake to make with a thermal rocket is not attaching it directly to the reactor, at which point, it won\u0027t work. Such a rocket could, for example, just look like the rocket above but with a thermal rocket in place of the plasma thrust - the result would be 2975kN of thrust and specific impulse of 2741s with LiquidFuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fractal_UK","CreatedById":61595,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-09T11:23:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EShowing off the DT Vista Inertial Fusion Engine!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith a cool new engine comes cool new mechanics and this engine is particularly cool in how it functions. As stated in the descriptions on the previous page, we are using Lasers to inertially compress pellets of fusion fuel released just at the tip of an engine - this triggers a fusion reaction that propels the vessel through space. In order to do this, we need electricity and lots of it to power the high power lasers. Fortunately, because we are targetting a pellet of fusion fuel with our lasers, our spaceship can get *far* more propulsive energy than we\u0027d simply get by using the laser for direct heating of propellant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fusion pellets are ejected at around 30Hz, meaning that this functions, for game purposes as an engine that simply provides continuous acceleration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThrottling this engine could, in reality, be done in one of two ways. The first is that the pellet repetition rate is changed, meaning that you give up smooth acceleration to accelerate more slowly, due to game constraints, this won\u0027t be implemented. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second and the one that will feature in this mod is to vary the amount of Hydrogen propellant ejected around the pellet. This means that the electrical power consumption of the engine is completely fixed (at almost exactly 1.5GW, meaning you need an upgraded 3.75m nuclear reactor \u002B an upgraded 3.75m generator or better to run it) and changing the throttle changes the specific impulse of the rocket. High throttle means that you want maximum thrust and least specific impulse while on low throttle you get little thrust but massive specific impulse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI demonstrate this feature here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere, at max thrust we get 680kN of thrust and Isp of 15500s. It therefore provides more thrust than all the nuclear rockets but less than any of the antimatter rockets. Its specific impulse at max throttle however, is only surpassed by the upgraded 3.75m antimatter rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8LCr64z.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00228LCr64z.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt half throttle, our thrust has indeed halved to 340kN as you would expect but look at the specific impulse, it has doubled to over 30,000s! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jaosrhf.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022jaosrhf.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we want to settle for some stock NERVA thrust levels, we can get truly ludicrous Isp of 193,748s!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/u8VhRFh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022u8VhRFh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven on this tiny throttle though, we look at the power draw on the electric generator, we are still drawing the maximum 1.5GW.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/DuQjykq.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022DuQjykq.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Donziboy2","CreatedById":74984,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-09T14:21:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENICE Fractal_UK!!!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you guys are having problems then your not doing it right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis has only one engine and it can lift itself easily and still have tons of fuel left, it also has Kethane Drills so it can land and refuel.
