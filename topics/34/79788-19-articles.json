Supply contracts! They would come in two types, orbital and surface.\u003Cp\u003EOrbital supply contracts would work like they do IRL, requiring you to deliver a payload supplies to an existing Space Station. Surface supply contracts would be similar, except instead of docking, you\u0027d just need to land within a certain radius of a Base (or a marker that your mod places).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPayload wise I\u0027m only thinking about stock items such as crew, fuel, monoprop, etc. While it\u0027d be nice for the payload to support resources implemented by other mods such as TACLS, I\u0027d imagine you\u0027d want to leave that up to the other mod\u0027s authors via a plugin system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDepending on how in depth you wanted to make it, you could also specify what Kerbals should be brought back home to make crew rotation contracts. As for supplies, something as basic as \u0022dock/land with at least \u0027X\u0027 resource remaining\u0022 I think would work as a completion parameter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI scanned a few pages back and didn\u0027t see anyone mention an idea like this, but I didn\u0027t read \u003Cem\u003Eall\u003C/em\u003E 45 pages so hopefully I\u0027m just not re-hashing an idea you\u0027ve already seen!\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem with supplies within Kerbin is one of immersion.

However, the same mechanic could be applied as touristic flights: instead of delivering cargo, some rich kerbal is paying the Kerbal Space Program for a suborbital or orbital ride. The immersion catch is that I\u0027m not sure if a mod can require that a specific kerbal is aboard a ship and that someone else (or a probe) must command the vessel.

Small rover with a small fuel tank, a single 48-7s and a parachute on top of four S1 SRBs. The rockets can pull it to a 170 km Ap and, if the inclination change started with the rockets still firing, it\u0027s possible to aim the landing in the general area of the anomalies. The rockets might be recovered with a probe and enough chutes (or the stage recovery mod). And even if they aren\u0027t, it might still be within budget, if slightly. As usual, mixing it with parts contracts (if any) can help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rover must have a command pod that\u0027s perpendicular to the ground, otherwise the nav point will not show up in the nav ball, as the nav ball will only show up the sky.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i62.tinypic.com/16gehro.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002216gehro.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, there is a problem in Kerbin - water. Which is specially true when the anomalies spawn in a hill next to the sea. So I\u0027ve ended up landing the rover at some 150 km from the nav points. Some people seem to enjoy long voyages in a rover. I don\u0027t, so after some 15 minutes, a lot of reloads and only advancing some 10-20 km, I\u0027ve used hyperedit to cheat and drop my lander nearby. But I\u0027m now packing for the night - the last time before I\u0027ve reloaded, my rover went downhill towards the sea because it had run out of power before I realized and braked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe this missions are better completed, if budget permits, by some sort of rover/vtol aircraft combo. Hilly, uneven terrain by the sea is a risky place to target from orbit, but safer areas for landing might cause the lander to land too far to go on wheels. So maybe it works best if the four SRBs throw something with rover wheels that can fly as well, so you can land in a safer place and approach the nav points at faster speeds than 20 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dingbat1967","CreatedById":75953,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-15T05:13:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan someone explain to me with pics how the waypoint system works for rovers?
