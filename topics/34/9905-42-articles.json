I\u0027m using a logitech extreme 3D joystick and it works in kerbal just fine but as soon as I activate the lazor system (specifically the red lazors) The joystick doesn\u0027t seen to effect control anymore. Is there just a setting I\u0027m missing or is there just no joystick support for this mod or something else?
