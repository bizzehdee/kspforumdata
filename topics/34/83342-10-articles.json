IRL when they need to simulate a new craft I imagine they have to do more than hit a big red \u0027simulate\u0027 button. Engineers have to design the craft in a computer program and create the simulated mission parameters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat would you guys think about making simulations take some time upfront as well as a bit of funds cost for an engineer to design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESay you hit \u0027simulate\u0027 for a vessel, pick a short duration and Kerbin SOI as the area. A simulation is added to the design queue. A simple one may take a few hours and cost some small amount of funds up front. In the background a simulation data is written with 2 components, one being \u0022Kerbin SOI\u0022 and one being specific to the craft you designed. You run the simulation and decide to make some changes to your craft, so you click simulate again after making those changes. You again choose a short duration and Kerbin SOI. Since you already have the Kerbin SOI piece designed, the new simulation takes less time to develop based only on your updated vessel design. If you then went back to the first vessel design and did another simulation, it would take no additional time because you already have it designed. It would just cost funds to run.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully that makes some sense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit1: Another idea, can make it even more interesting by requiring some science data from the SOI you plan to simulate before you can make the simulation. Send out a probe for a munar flyby to unlock a mun SOI simulation for example. Maybe require a certain amount of science data before it unlocks\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit2: If you guys like these ideas I\u0027ll expand on them and see if I can work out something presentable as a real suggestion.

This is by no means a confirmation of what I\u0027m going to do and things are definitely subject to change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) In order to simulate in orbit/landed/maybe even in atmosphere you must \u003Cstrong\u003Efirst\u003C/strong\u003E transmit/recover science from the appropriate place (or better, so landed could count for all three).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) After getting science from a location, you can purchase a Simulation Package for a heap of funds and/or science which then lets you perform simulations at that location. For example, you visit Duna with an orbiting probe and can purchase the Duna Simulation Package which lets you select Duna as a simulation body. This may or may not require time to unlock. Prices will be subject to planetary mass/atmosphere constraints, but independent of distance. Moons will have their own packages that require the parent package, but will cost less than the parent package.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) After a package is unlocked you can choose it in the editor. You can do orbital simulations if you have any science from the planet. You can do landed sims if you have landed science. If you enter the atmosphere without atmospheric/landed science the sim is terminated/restarts. Same for landed (on touchdown, sim ends). These simulations will cost a fraction of the current costs/the package cost and you\u0027ll have better control of time limits (able to set any number of hours/days you want). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t decided if it\u0027s worth the effort to make subsequent simulations cheaper, but if I do it will likely be like the system I described in a previous post, since that\u0027s actually pretty easy to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t like the idea of individual simulations taking time to prep (unlocking packages, maybe) since that would suck from a gameplay perspective. Simulations are supposed to let you test a craft without having to waste a bunch of time building it, and quick test-alter-test-repeat sessions would be substantially more tedious. They will certainly take zero time (and even if they didn\u0027t, it\u0027d be like 30 minutes).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for purchasing hardware for additional max lengths of simulation time, I kind of like that idea. Maybe I\u0027ll just add a new window that lets you upgrade your simulation hardware: installing new planetary packages, upgrading your \u0022processing power\u0022 or something similar to allow you to simulate larger vessels, and your \u0022memory\u0022 to allow longer simulations (gotta store the data somewhere. Maybe instead of memory it\u0027s just \u0022storage\u0022 since you\u0027d actually store that data on a hard drive). You could also purchase upgrades like \u0022Low Power Components\u0022 to reduce simulation costs by X%. I could make it like strategies where you trade one thing for another (ie 10% more processing power for 5% more money each time, with a commitment value that changes the amounts), or I could make it so there are just general upgrades that only provide benefits for an initial cost (spend 100k funds to reduce costs 5%, costing more each upgrade). I personally like the second one but I\u0027m interested in what you all think.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah, that\u0027s my current idea in my head.

What about breaking it into two categories, hardware and software?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHardware costs cash and, like ordering something off newegg, it takes a bit of time to ship and then you \u0022install\u0022 it. Simulation time on this hardware can be sold for a small amount of cash at first and you can gradually upgrade it to include more processing power/storage. Maybe for simplicity sake just leave it at a simple \u0022upgrade\u0022 option without delving into upgrading CPUs, GPUs, RAM, disc space, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen there\u0027s software packages. These would be your base sim suites. You\u0027d have a Kerbin suite, a Mun suite, a Jool suite, etc. Each of these cost science and take a bit of time to develop but once it\u0027s complete you own that sim package. Simulations would be priced based on the size of the vessel you\u0027re simming and the package you\u0027re using. Simming a massive vessel in the Jool package would be quite expensive, but simming a tiny one in the mun package would be cheap. Additionally packages would have certain hardware limits, ie. you need at least 3 \u0022upgrades\u0022 to your hardware to use the Jool package, or 2 \u0022upgrades\u0022 to sim a vessel that costs over X build points.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition, adding new sim suites would increase the value of the sim time you\u0027re selling. Perhaps you could tie this into the contract system so that a contract may appear for some other company wanting to purchase sim time for the Jool system. You\u0027d need to provide them with X number of hours of uninterrupted sim time within Y days in return for 10x the cash you\u0027d normally get from selling time. Failing to do so costs you reputation and a little bit of cash (a cancellation fee). Perhaps with each completed contract you have a random chance of receiving science based on its complexity (not sure if the contract system supports random rewards)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps make it so that the only way you can make money selling sim time is with the contract system? Other than that it\u0027s assumed you\u0027re selling the excess processing power you have to a random bidder and basically receiving back what it costs to run the server (ie, no money change if you\u0027re sitting idle). The cost for sims is justified based on the fact that you can\u0027t sell that processing power while you\u0027re using it so you have to actually pay to upkeep the server. That also justifies the larger cost for simming in more advanced packages. If you have a massive server farm and are only simming on the Mun you can still sell most of your power, but if you\u0027re simming for Jool you need it all for yourself so you can\u0027t sell any.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nori","CreatedById":41334,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-16T21:43:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022hatterson\u0022 data-cite=\u0022hatterson\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhat about allowing simulations to land on planets without atmosphere simply by purchasing the relevant planet/moon package, but for planets *with* an atmosphere you need to have science from within it.\u003Cp\u003ETo logic being that if a planet doesn\u0027t have atmosphere there\u0027s nothing stopping you from simming a landing short of knowing the terrain which is presumably accomplished by the probe/kerbal that returned the science, whereas if it does have an atmosphere you don\u0027t really know what it\u0027ll do to your craft or what it\u0027s made of before you\u0027ve experience it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom a gameplay perspective it fits, even with mods like RT2 with signal delay, because it\u0027s still fairly easy to land an unmanned probe on a body with an atmosphere so you\u0027re not adding significant difficulty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat way you can still sim your very first minimus lander without having to put a probe down, but if you want to land on Laythe you need to at least send a probe down to get atmospheric readings of what you\u0027ll be dealing with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like this idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMagico - Are you shooting for a simple comparability release soonish, or are you going for a more feature release including the changes you\u0027ve talked about?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Noventta","CreatedById":125172,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-16T21:45:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022hatterson\u0022 data-cite=\u0022hatterson\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhat about allowing simulations to land on planets without atmosphere simply by purchasing the relevant planet/moon package, but for planets *with* an atmosphere you need to have science from within it.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI agree on that.

Damn you, freaking casuals!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, seriously, biggest fan of your mod here. I play my KSP with nearly 80 mods and I would call yours the most essential one because it is the very basis to make the career mode playable. I have set up a quite challenging difficulty with hardmode (no revert \u002B your simulation feature = best thing ever) and more individual sciencegain-nerf through scienceparams.cfg as also probably every known mod which adds further challenges like FAR, DRE, RemoteTech, Mission Controller Extended, TAC-LS, DangIt, actually no MechJeb but kOS and VOID and a ....load of Partaddons. The only thing I didn\u0027t yet figure out is how to make the part about funds more interesting. I had my first satellites now at Mun and Minmus and I am still at 1,25m rockets techtreewise, but I already earn money on a level that I stopped caring about it at all and also stopped using Parachutes for your StageRecovery because it doesn\u0027t matter at all. So In my opinion it would be nice if there will be a way to force higher fundspending. I read here that simulation at other planets are absurdly costful, I didn\u0027t made it to that point yet, but in my opinion it would be nice if the simulations at kerbinlaunch are higher (actually a magnitude higher). Either way, keep up the good work!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh by the way, just out of curiosity: Do you know if that incompatibility with the Tarsier Mod is something that went wrong on your side and can be fixed by you at some time or is it something the Tarsierguy has to patch to make both mods compatible?
