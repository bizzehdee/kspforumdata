If your thermal rocket is connected to a thermal receiver rather than a reactor the ISP is about 866. ISPs will be lower in atmosphere (sorry I haven\u0027t done the maths yet on how much so). Finally, the fuel type may change the ISP as well. Liquid fuel is the baseline ISP*1.0, all other fuels that I have seen are lower for example LFO = ISP*0.6.\u003Cp\u003EThe thrust a thermal rocket is capable of is determined by....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E1) Thrust = Power * (0.5* ISP * 9.81) \u003C/strong\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Power is in MW and is the total \u003Cstrong\u003Ethermal\u003C/strong\u003E power coming from the reactor or thermal receiver.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The 9.81 comes from the gravity at sea level on Kerbin/Earth - does not change as far as I can tell.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The 0.5 comes does not change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E2) Multiply the answer by 1000 to get it in kN like most thrust ratings in KSP.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E3) Finally multiply the answer by the fuel being used. Liquid fuel is again baseline at Thrust*1.0. LFO as an example is Thrust*3.7.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn Excel equation if it\u0027s any use...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E=((THERMALPOWER/(0.5*ISP*9.81))*1000)*FUELMULTIPLIER\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou got thermal power and thrust mixed up.
