It kind of makes sense, especially since TACLS and other mods serve as a bridge between the SoKerbal and Realism crowds, and that Real Fuels/Realism Overhaul can benefit from other resources besides fuel. Plus, we managed to get all the other modders who use CRP to agree to 1unit == 1 liter.\u003Cp\u003ERegolith is a pretty good framework but it\u0027ll be sidelined by the new stock resource system that Roverdude is writing (as Roverdude has said himself that he\u0027ll be moving over to the stock implementation). As far as Karbonite/Kethane are concerned, they are entirely unrealistic and I\u0027m pretty sure no one who maintains Real Fuels is considering integrating them, although there is a config out there somewhere for Karbonite (by Raptor831, I think?).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFuel ISRU is pretty simple (you can get ice products for fuel from @750kg of equipment, apparently) but the fuels you can get from in situ resources are fairly limited. For instance, complex hydrocarbons like Syntin/RP-1 aren\u0027t going to be made in a spaceship on some random planet; you\u0027re pretty much limited to methane/carbon/oxygen/argon products. Good luck with Extraplanetary Launchpads, too. As much fun as that mod is, the infrastructure required to build rockets isn\u0027t going to be had on an extraplanetary site for some time, definitely not on the scale of KSP. If we get a RealISRU mod at some point, it\u0027ll probably be specific ice and atmosphere products, like collecting methane from Mars\u0027 atmosphere to get you home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EE: Just to clarify, this is more of a general \u0022manifesto post\u0022 than implying that you wanted Karbonite/Kethane integration.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-24T00:36:34Z\u0022 title=\u002204/24/2015 12:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by regex\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"255","CreatedById":60654,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T22:20:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhere\u0027s real fuels wiki?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0027s the \u0022utilization\u0022 parameter?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T22:58:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EReal Fuels don\u0027t really have a wiki; most RF information is in the top three posts in this thread, or in the Realism Overhaul wiki.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUtilization controls how much of a given part is used by tankage.
