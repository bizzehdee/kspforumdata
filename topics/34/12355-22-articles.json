But, based on my knowledge thus far:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMolniya, Tundra, and _eostationary orbits all are designed to provide coverage over specific surface locations. They all operate on the premise that the sidereal orbital period is a specific fraction of the sidereal rotation period; i.e. your orbit moves at a specific rate compared to the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETundra and _eostationary orbits have a SOP (Sidereal Orbital Period) equal to the SRP (Sidereal rotation period).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMolniya orbits have a SOP exactly 1/2 the SRP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that your Sidereal orbital period is equal to:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2pi * (a^3/GM)^0.5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere a is the semi-major axis of your orbit (half the distance from periapsis to apoapsis, including going through the body you\u0027re orbiting)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd GM is the standard gravitational parameter\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, the altitude of the _eostationary orbit is based on the SOP (how long it takes to go all the way around the orbit from the point of view of other stars) - since it\u0027s a circular equatorial orbit, the semi-major axis is equal to the distance from the center of the planet to your spaceship, all the time. With this, you can calculate the orbital period, and if your orbital period is 6 hours, you\u0027re at the right distance. If you\u0027re at the right distance in a circular orbit, you must therefore be at the right speed to keep falling and missing the planet by the same amount all the time (i.e. orbiting).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Darkstorm406","CreatedById":33131,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-09T20:12:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sal_vager\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sal_vager\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDid you unzip a new copy of KSP and MechJeb or did you move the folder?\u003Cp\u003EIt should \u0022just work\u0022 as long as the most up to date MuMechLib.dll is in the plugins folder and the parts are in the parts folder, MechJeb will create a mumechlib folder within PluginData, but only if it is allowed to write to the directory, which Windows or Anti-virus will prevent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake sure KSP is whitelisted in your A-V, and make sure you are not running KSP from Program Files, Desktop, Downloads, or similar places, if you have done so you will find there are files in ~\\application data\\ksp\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAmazing!
