So I built a ship which includes all the specified parts (docking port, crew of 2, Mobile Processing Lab) and put it in orbit. The contract then says that I have no \u0022station part\u0022. I see in the cfg file that it actually says for the parameter, \u0022vesselType = Station\u0022. Yet in looking at the Squad part file for the MPL (largeCrewedLab.cfg), it says \u0022vesselType = Ship\u0022. So it\u0027s not possible to complete using the MPL. Are there any actual stock parts by Squad that are of vesselType = Station?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAh, whoops, I forgot to change that.

It\u0027s not clear as to what is required. For example I am stuck with a \u0022Manned Power Landing on Kerbin\u0022. Apparently a MK1 pod with a pilot, a TLV-200 fuel tank and a LV-T45 engine do not meet the criteria of no aero and parachute parts and 1 kerbal crew reaching 500m. Plus you still get a parachute with the very first note which is probably not intended (part given is RealChute Cone Chute)\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: it seems like if you launch any kind of vessel after taking this contract then it is impossible to complete it as it will look for that other vessel instead. Might be same problem with the space station parts. If you launch anything after taking the contract it might be looking at a different vessel. I aborted the contract after I had my satellites I wanted in place and it worked with the same configuration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYep, but I m not sure how to do it differently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI already removed the landing requirement from nearly all other contracts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SmashBrown\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SmashBrown\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFor anyone wanting to hide the empty nodes in the CTT, someone has written a config for it.\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100385-1-04-Community-Tech-Tree-2-1-last-updated-06-05-15?p=2102279\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post2102279\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100385-1-04-Community-Tech-Tree-2-1-last-updated-06-05-15?p=2102279\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post2102279\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAh, will have to try it sometime, but I prefer to see the full tree, eg for inspiration to install other mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Targa\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Targa\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHere\u0027s the real issue (for me) that I see with this tech tree mod. While the technology is laid out in a very well thought out manner, if you\u0027re using MKS, the majority of the parts are available very late, or at the end of the tech tree. Maybe this is RoverDude\u0027s categorization as well as this modified tree, but the issue that I have with this is that it makes the entire point of colonization moot. \u003Cp\u003EWhat I was looking forward to was the ability to colonize other planets/moons, set up resource extraction sites, as well as science-collecting sites, to further my expansion in the solar system. However, since the required technology to do all this is at the end of the tech tree, this means that by the time I can do all this, there will be no point in doing it, since I will be finished with the tech tree and have no further need of science. At that point it just becomes sandbox play. This goes back to the original difficulty curve in collecting science in this game, where you could finish the tech tree before ever leaving Kerbin\u0027s SOI. For many players (myself included), this results in a loss of motivation for further exploration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpon reflection, I think that in order to play the game the way I envision it, I\u0027m going to have to come up with my own tech tree that allows base-building and mining earlier in the tech tree, while moving a number of the science-gathering instruments to later in the tech tree. This will encourage base-building on the Mun/Minmus to create a refueling station, and a slow colonization/expansion into the rest of the solar system. Unless someone knows of a mod that already does this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did not change any node placement for MKS/OKS (or anything else regarding MKS/OKS so far).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut with Karbonite the first resoucre extraction is available at scienceTech for 300 science, parts from KerbalPlanetaryBaseSystem and space station parts are available for 300 science as well. Thus before fuel lines and most of the nuclear techs (KSPIextended, NFpropulsion).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI recommend using more mods to fill out the later nodes of the tech tree as well as a bigger solar system (OuterPlanets).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn any case, in reality we sent a probe to Pluto while we did not yet manage to do more than a low orbit space station around our home planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Landwalker\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Landwalker\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhile I\u0027m not familiar with \u0022Bog-standard Community Tech Tree\u0022, have you tried just using that?
