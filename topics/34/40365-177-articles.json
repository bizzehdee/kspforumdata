Using a single reactor (thorium fueled) and generator (both 3.75), and assuming 58.7% efficiency on the generator, one can power ~2.47 DTs. But what about 2 generators per reactor? No difference, of course, due to how the mod works. Thermal power is just simply shared between the two reactors, thus halving the output of each. Extra weight with no extra benefit. But instead of just simply sharing the thermal power why not prioritize it? What I mean is why not send all the thermal power to generator 1, then shunt the wasted heat to generator 2? Continuing to assume 58.7% efficiency the first generator produces 6.046 GWe with 4.254 GWt wasted heat. Normally that would be sent to the radiators and lost forever. What if, instead, that left over thermal power is shunted to the second generator? The second generator would produce 2.497 GWe, and 1.757 GWt would be lost instead. And instead of using 58.7% of the thermal power we would be using ~82.9% of the reactors thermal power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe output rate of each generator is reduced, of course. This is the tradeoff. Generators are lighter than reactors, so it is preferable to run two generators per reactor with the above outputs. I would rather produce 4.272 GWe per generator using only 1 reactor instead of producing 6.046 GWe per generator with only 1 generator per reactor. So is it possible to incorporate this into the mod? As I said above I am emulating it by cheating the generator config (raising efficiency until I get 4.272 GWe per generator on a one reactor, 2 generator setup).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"forsaken1111","CreatedById":2703,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-12T14:58:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022simmy2109\u0022 data-cite=\u0022simmy2109\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYeah I agree that the detailed \u0027accuracy\u0027 does not matter. For most applications, the base passive radiation will be insignificant compared to the total radiation needed. Personally, I think that the base passive radiation should be high enough for a small satellite with a couple of standard extending panels to radiate sufficiently to not need radiators. Once you move on to bigger things, the passive radiation will be insignificant to your needs anyways. On the other hand, perhaps you like it the way it is, where radiators are needed pretty much from the beginning.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis mod is based on realistic or theoretically possible technology unfortunately, and even small satellites need some help cooling down in the harsh light of the sun.

This mod makes any pod with a build-in decoupler not work. The symptoms are varying: It can be everything from the pod auto-decoupling at physics initialization to everything other than the pod disappearing upon load. The pods that I have exprienced this with are the Odin pod from NovaPunch and the Dragon pod by CBBP. The only thing in common between these are that they have a build-in decoupler, and that they only stopped working when I installed this mod.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInteresting that you point this out... I was having similar strange issues with the NP Odin pod. I haven\u0027t bothered to test it much to determine a cause.
