It would seem that the problem has nothing to do with the actual ship and everything to do with the relay I\u0027m using. As the connection is only needed to transfer experiments I only created a couple of rovers with dishes and parked them off the runway close to the KSC. (Dropping the connection due to Kerbin rotating is fine.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rovers are close enough to the KSC not to need antennas (less than 3km) but they are also parked close to each other.

Only difference is how much memory is used before the game eventually crash or I get bored of waiting. 32 bit usually crashes at 3.5GB to 3.7GB memory usage so close to the magical 2^32 limit. Using 64 bit I have had it a lot higher but then I simply kill the process as it has frozen completely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have reproduced the problem in a stripped version of KSP.

Won\u0027t the interference cause problems if the vector of the communication points at the sun, even if the sun is behind the target? This would mean that you\u0027re more likely to want geosync satellites, as you can position two of them so that they\u0027re always visible from KSC, so if the sun is behind one of them, you can relay through the other. Using lower altitude constellations would mean accepting a communications blackout whenever there\u0027s only one satellite visible from KSC and the sun is right behind it, which would probably happen quite often.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I understand it, the most accurate way to represent this would be to reduce the range of any communications that would be coming from a vector with a retrograde that points at or near the sun, with the effect becoming less pronounced as the retrograde vector moves away from the sun, simulating the fact that the transmitting antenna\u0027s signal is getting lost in the background noise. If it\u0027s closer, it could still overpower the background noise. Which isn\u0027t to say that we need that accurate of a model for this to be an interesting mechanic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: On second thought, this might not cause problems with lower altitude constellations, since those are usually based on omnidirectional antennas, which are already dealing with the solar interference.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-30T23:21:02Z\u0022 title=\u002207/30/2014 11:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 30, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Eric S\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
