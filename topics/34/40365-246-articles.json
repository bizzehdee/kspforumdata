The major problem with this is that generally you\u0027re transmitting data from the active vessel back to the R\u0026amp;D centre, while these impactors needn\u0027t even be within physics range of an active science instrument.\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s theoretically possible that I could make it so that reports are generated and then picked up by the detectors later, and you then you send that data back. That might be a nice avenue for expansion but, that would leave you in the position of having to click back to your detectors after each impact event, record the data and send it back to Kerbin - this might make it prove to be just an irritating feature rather than a worthwhile intregration step.

Especially when getting late technology is supposed to actually pose some kind of a challenge.\u003Cp\u003EThe impactor science might be a little low at the moment and need to be tweaked upward somewhat, I\u0027m already coming to that conclusion. That said, you seem to be assuming where you once got X science, you now get zero, which is not even close to true.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s hardly unprecendented, the stock instruments don\u0027t tell you what return you\u0027re going to get either. Ultimately, the answer is: it depends.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy would you assume there are lots of restrictions on how long probes can run or the number of impacts? Why would you think you would have to have remote tech, a different mod? That honestly makes no sense and suggests that you haven\u0027t even run one single impact experiment (which you could do in 30 seconds on the launch pad). I\u0027m quite happy to take feedback/criticism but it\u0027d be kind of nice to think it was actually based on some actual experience of the new system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe amount of science you get depends on the number of detectors you have and their position (more detectors will give you a bit more science beyond what one will give you) and the amount of science will diminish with each impact but will never reach zero. This is hardly an unprecended mechanic and it\u0027s not particularly complicated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUltimately, one of the biggest complaints made about the stock science system is that it doesn\u0027t involve any actual experimentation - you go somewhere, you click a few times, you fly back. The accelerometer is a good choice for alteration because the most effective way to produce seismic activity on a geologically dead world is to produce it yourself, so you know the magnitude of the impact that caused it and can actually produce meaningful data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith this system, you can land detectors on each body, you can use multiple detectors if you like (best positioned on opposite sides of the body) and then send off special impactor missions or use discarded stages to produce science as you travel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you really want the stock functionality back as well, you can just delete\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E!MODULE[ModuleScienceExperiment]\u003Cbr\u003E{\u003Cbr\u003E}\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ein GameData/WarpPlugin/Science.cfg.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust crash a ship into the ground, it doesn\u0027t need anything special on it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks, I missed a changed as I was switching everything over to the new resource draw method.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApparently a last minute change designed to make a small tweak to the arcjet thruster caused this bug, I think I have a fix now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would like to echo the concerns of this poster. I am not a fan of changing the stock science system either. I just got home and haven\u0027t tried it yet, but the new Impactor instrument (if you\u0027re not going to create a new science instrument; which would be the best solution) should have the stock behavior included. So using it without an impactor experiment gives the stock Accelerometer results.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I really do not like how both the new Accelerometer and the Science Lab just \u0022Magically\u0022 update the science center, either. Keep in mind that for some players, it\u0027s not just about how many science points we get; it\u0027s _how_ we get them. If we want to limit ourselves to using RemoteTech, we would like your mod to honor that. Try to keep within the standard science system as much as possible. There\u0027s no reason that both the Science Lab and the Accelerometer could be made to work this way, and we would greatly appreciate it if it did. Consider that you added the Engine Overheating/Intercoolers to the game because \u0022realistically\u0022 you need to cool down air intakes at hypersonic velocities. Well, RemoteTech is also trying to be \u0022realistic\u0022 and we would like your parts to play nice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe think with the Intercoolers also is a knock against your mod, in my opinion. While I do like the realism it adds, it also damages my enjoyment of the game because you didn\u0027t take into account non-stock intakes. Many of us use the B9 pack and I for one like the look of the Surface-Mounted hypersonic intakes. There should be a way to use those without the problem of overheating. After all, they are supposedly _designed_ for use at hypersonic velocities (it even says so in the description). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes someone know if there is a hack to perhaps add the Intercooler function to those parts somewhere in the config file?

There is a big difference between a hypersonic intake and an essentially orbital velocity intake. On Earth, there is a big difference between Mach 5 and orbital velocity, on Kerbin, there isn\u0027t. Having no precooling requirement up to velocities where they would be required in the real world already makes things massively easier than they should be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only way to remove the need for precooling in atmosphere is to have the combustion take place at supersonic velocity so you don\u0027t get all the friction heating from slowing down the airflow to subsonic velocities inside your intake. That would require a totally different engine design, no matter whether your intake is suited to hypersonic airflow or not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, this approach actually has meaningful tradeoffs. You can either have the convenience of radial intakes and have an easy time sticking them on your craft anywhere you like, or you design around having integrated precooled intake stacks. The first approach results in you having to pack a little more rocket fuel and the second results in an engineering problem. Neither are particularly challenging but at least it adds a bit more depth to SSTO aircraft design rather than simply flying up to orbital velocity inside the atmosphere and spending a piddly few m/s of delta-v to circularise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdding the precoolers to radial intakes would mean it would have absolutely no impact on difficulty and might as well be removed entirely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022JeffreyCor\u0022 data-cite=\u0022JeffreyCor\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThey go provode compatible power supplies as the electric generator produces electric charge before producing megajoules.
