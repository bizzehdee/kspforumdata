Have you found a way to do that? If so, then please tell me, because no matter how many scanners I put on a ship, it still only scans 1 hex wide.\u003Cp\u003ETime warp only changes the ratio of gametime to realtime. It does not change the amount of gametime required to complete any given task. If you still only scan 1 hex wide no matter how many scanners you cram onto your probe, then it will still take no less than 7 game days to scan any world, because the governing factor is the speed of the probe over the ground, NOT the time warp factor.
