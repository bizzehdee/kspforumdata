Since you are close to the sun, your solar panels generate a lot more heat than they do near Kerbin. I believe they generate half as much waste heat as power, so if you are getting 500 kW out of the solar panels you need enough radiators to dissipate at least 250 kw. You can click on the transmitter to determine how much electricity you are generating in total, which should help you determine how many radiators you need.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo Fractal: Since you already hook into solar panels to cause them to generate waste heat, how hard would it be to convert them to producing Megajoules? I know in a lot of cases they would be mostly useless, but one good use case I thought of would be building a microwave-transmitting solar satellite with a plasma engine. You could launch it from Kerbin by receiving power from LKO nuclear satellites, and then swap to solar power when you get near the sun in order to circularize. Since you changed it so megajoule-producing parts fill up electric charge before anything else, there\u0027s no longer any downside to swapping, as far as I can tell.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-07T03:46:41Z\u0022 title=\u002201/07/2014 03:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 7, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by RadHazard\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lrauka","CreatedById":100216,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-07T03:58:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello.. created an account, just to ask this.

I know in a lot of cases they would be mostly useless, but one good use case I thought of would be building a microwave-transmitting solar satellite with a plasma engine. You could launch it from Kerbin by receiving power from LKO nuclear satellites, and then swap to solar power when you get near the sun in order to circularize. Since you changed it so megajoule-producing parts fill up electric charge before anything else, there\u0027s no longer any downside to swapping, as far as I can tell.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPretty easy, I\u0027d just have to write a custom solar panel module, the main difficulty would be controlling the animations but all I\u0027d need to do would be copy the radiator code and rotate it by 90 degrees so the panels face the sun rather than their edges facing the sun.
