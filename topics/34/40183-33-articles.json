Once KSP (not MCE) detects the vessel is not in PreLaunch conditions (this is a KSP condition not MCE) it goes to flight. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts a complicated process to make MCE behave at this part of the Game. We don\u0027t want MCE charging you because your on the launchpad. The Traditional way to get out of launchpad is to hit SpaceBar and activate your first stage, which is what MCE is looking for. But a lot of the conditions also look to see if your vessel is in PreFlight. (for recycling with MCE) once the vessel is out of PreFlight the vessel can be Recycled by MCE. Its a problem but not much I can do about it without changing the whole way MCE detects if vessel is in flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlugins can never be perfect. They rely on KSP conditions. But its such a small problem that I personally never run into that its really not worth putting much effort into it to make a work around. And a work around is what is needed to fix it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will do more testing though to see if I can see something different. Something I did not test is to see if this might have something to do with research. If this does not happen in Sandbox mode, then I have something wrong somewhere maybe.

So wiggling the vessel takes it out of preflight mode. I suspect going into EVA also takes it out of PreFlight Mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is no check to see if vessel is on the launchpad. So this is going to continue to be a problem, that might have to be chalked up to (don\u0027t do it). \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E And the preflight mode is to much of a What If situation to make it be the check for MCE to charge you. (thats why the spacebar works so well... its a solid way to make sure thats what the player intended) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPretty sure all the fixes I could do to fix this problem are going to cause Many worse problems then what I\u0027m trying to fix. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did at one point have a plan to change this whole system. The plan was to actually buy the vessels outside of the Launch Pad. So say you made vessel a... it was a good solid vessel (been tested many times) so you want to purchase 3 of them for use. So you buy 3 of them. MCE saves the info and knows you have 3 of these vessels. When you launch a vessel you own already (and is not in flight) MCE allows you to launch the vessel and subtracts it from your current ship count for that vessel. etc. It was pretty complicated and would be a MAJOR MAJOR overhaul of how MCE works. So much so that its a little mind boggling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I don\u0027t think I have enough time between now and when KSP comes up with its contract system and own Currency to make it worth the effort.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing I could of done is Used the FlagSystem I currently have for vessels launched when Plugin Disabled and use it for ships launched when Vessels are launched with space bar instead.. Only vessels flagged can ever do missions or get Recycling back. (this system makes more sense and would be the easiest, since I already wrote most of it into the code) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat last one might become a reality at some point If I have the time.

The stock missions as they are called are the Original Authors Mission Pack that came with Original Mission Controller back in .09. I have never done anything to these missions. The Random missions are made for .21 and above of KSP. The very first Random mission is meant for your very first launch in a Career game. It does not pay much, but it is desiegned to stop the Huge ship spam from KSP .22 that everyone would do to get 3000 Research points.

Then the responses from the people that know telling them no its not, you have to build your ships different. Well that same moto comes into play with Mission Controller Ext. You have to build your ships different in MCE to make budgets and make mission payouts. And I think this is the hardest hurdle people have to overcome. The difference between building what you want, without cost restrictions is a major Game Changer to Most that Try MCE.. Which is why I get a lot of the This mod sucks you can\u0027t make money.

Maybe do a few MCE missions, and pay for that Trip To Eeloo. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut its a space program we have to work at getting to that point.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"malkuth","CreatedById":57414,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-03T17:01:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022klobo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022klobo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThank you MedievalNerd,\u003Cp\u003ENow I have an other problem. Even when using small rockets (2 stages) the wobbling on the launch pad is detected by the Mission controller and it gives me an warning message \u0022Launch: requires stationary position\u0022 and so even when I launch my rocket the controller doesn\u0027t count it as a completed launch goal. I tried with stability enhancere and even with the \u0022welding\u0022 mod. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there some parameter that I\u0027m missing? Can I Change the sensitivity of the mission controller to the launch steady position?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have to be honest with you, I have no idea what this is or what it means. Mission Controller does not have a message like that and will not stop you from launching no matter how wobbly your rockets are (Mods can\u0027t stop you from launching Even MCE). If you have to many mods installed you might actually be having that RAM issue, and might have to use the Textrue Reduction mod to fix this issue. I\u0027m pretty sure that KSP itself won\u0027t allow you to launch if your rocket is wobbling around on the launchpad.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
