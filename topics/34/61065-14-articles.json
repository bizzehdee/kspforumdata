It\u0027s not just because FF may have bugs, also KSP does sometimes very strange things. Just zip your savegame folder. This way you will backup all ribbons, too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegarding the lost custom ribbons: As I have explained already: this is some kind of strange behaviour in KSP. It seems that the game time in the space center isn\u0027t paused but reverted back to the last ingame time, when KSP switches to the launchpad or a space-ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis doesn\u0027t play well with my method to revert ribbons by timestamps. Currently I set the award time to the game time (Highlogic.Currentgame.Universaltime) and for this worked quite well. Obviously it won\u0027t work for everyone and I still do not understand what causes this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust a few questions: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Are the custom ribbons working/saved if awarded in a mission?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Have you launched/flown a mission after awarding a custom ribbon in space center?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Who was affected by the all-ribbons-lost-effect and what have you done directly before this has happened? (if this is an issue I will add some kind of backup functionality)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf all fails we have to add log outputs and I will have to analyze this.

I did not see this behavior in previous versions, only once I upgraded to 3.0. If you aren\u0027t getting this, my guess is its a mod conflict, but it would have to be a common mod for so many of us to get it, but one that you aren\u0027t using. I upgraded from .2.7, but when I was using .2.7 I never had this happen, If that was when you added the permadeath feature, I\u0027d say maybe its a bug there, since you just copied code from one other mod?
