I\u0026#39;ll have to postpone the new version for at least 2 weeks. The Falcon 9 is completely finished now (though a manual is still missing), but the other rockets really drive me crazy. Especially Atlas V with its various payload fairings. I took one model, and just rescaled it to fit the required height for that special version of the fairing, but now, since the colliders must be convex, I have to make custom colliders now for each of the fairings. Ugh. I wonder if it\u0026#39;s not actaully easier to completely remake those fairings, or, when I am at it, remake the whole rocket. I\u0026#39;m getting crazy when I see this ugly models, when I compare them to models of my Falcon 9 now, or something. Also, Unity doesn\u0026#39;t want me to export certain parts (payload fairings *cough* *cough*), which does not make me happier to be honest. \u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd Delta II could also need a remake...and it also has 5 payload fairings....oh man, fun times. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI am a bit disappointed from Squad that they already changed the colliders now, people said that with unity 5 upgrade, colliders must be convex, but it wasn\u0026#39;t even in experimentals yet, so I didn\u0026#39;t worry about those colliders (and other modders didn\u0026#39;t worry about those too as you see now) but now, bam, 1.0.5 arrived and brings that change with it. And no one said that this would be changed. Now we sit here, with many parts to fix, while the stuff we originally worked on has to wait now.
