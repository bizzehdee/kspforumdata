I\u0027m finding that it is impossible to reload any guns. (it is possible to reload the missile pods) I\u0027m getting almost frustrated. I cannot do it... I\u0027ll go through step by step what I\u0027m doing. 1. Fire the gun and use a bunch of ammo. 2. Get out of the vehicle (in this case it\u0027s a pod with a Metal support beam attached with the gun and an ammo box right beside it) and right click on the gun and press the \u0022reload from nearby\u0022 button. 3. Get back into vehicle to find that the ammo has not changed at all. 4. get back out and press the \u0022transfer ammo button\u0022 5. Alt click the ammo box and press the \u0022transfer ammo\u0022 button. nothing works. I even tried alt clicking the ammo box inside the pod and then \u0022transfering\u0022 the ammo the way you transfer fuel. Nothing. It just simply refuses to reload. I don\u0027t understand! Is it just broken because of the new version? Before I had multiple different mods on but I removed all of them except for module manager and this mod and I still cannot reload the guns. I don\u0027t know how to reload anyways.. I thought it would be straightforward haha. If there is some unusual way of reloading the ammo can someone tell me? Like I said, no mods installed. Just skillful. I\u0027m trying every button I see to no avail. What is going wrong? ( just got this mod by the way and absolutely love it good job \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E)\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome guns are internally loadable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Auto-Air turret:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight click the turret, click transfer ammo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ealt\u002Bright click the ammo box and transfer the ammo like you would fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome cannot be reloaded from inside the vehicle, like a wing mounted cannon/pod. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1)eva kerbal, right click the gun and transfer ammo\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) get back in and transfer like fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) eva and right click transfer ammo on the gun again.
