Back online as of this morning. Just to give an idea of what is going on right now, I\u0027m going over the stock detection of situations (FlyingHigh/low,etc.) vs the method I\u0027ve borrowed from Ethernet. Either we need to get the RSS CelestialParams tweaked, or I have to make some updates to the method. Either way I\u0027ll get to the bottom of this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce this is fully resolved, I\u0027ll get back to making probes, and reviewing their tech tree line.

These are used mostly for stages that require fuels be stored and reignited. Though hard with this mod at first, because the early engines dont support h2/o2, it is often best to have a fairly long burning first stage of LF/O2 followed by stages of H2/O2. H2/O2 for 2nd stage\u002B gives high performance for its mass and thus improves the dV of the rocket overall. Only issues with H2/O2 are its size (high volume requirement), the generally lower TWR (less an issue with a large LF first stage), and boil off. Final stage and lander options are generally best cases for MMH, Aerozine, and sometimes Monoprop. These give nice long burns for relatively small volumes and don\u0027t boil off. ModFuels supports RLA Stock alike engines with burn monoprop, which sometimes make it attractive. Even without, small probes, service modules, and small non-atmospheric landers that require RCS anyway can often do with RCS modules only (no engines!).

It seems that the stock situation detection has a flaw of some sorts. If you are able to reach orbit velocity above a certain altitude (which is below the actual threshold of InSpaceLow) the goo experiment is able to report InSpaceLow condition. The way the custom experiment checks the situation is solely based on the threshold, so seems that the method Ethernet did is actually more accurate in that specific scenario. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E Kudos to Ethernet!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo without touching the values of Kerbin, it\u0027s got a 18,000 meter cutoff for Flying Low, then Flying high is up until 103,500 meters.

This node represents early aircraft engines and handles the Lancaster engines parts. There would be no jet engines here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENode Two (The Jet Age) would contain the stock basic jet engine (technically a turbojet. See Note *1) and/or basic turbojets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENode Three (Turbofans) would contain more advanced engines that take turbojets and combine them with the advantages of prop engines. Also, firespitter needs to develop Turboprops. (*2) Node three would also contain helicopter engines. (Turboshaft)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENode Four (Ramjets/J-57s) This node represents the tier of engines the SR-71 blackbird uses. A Turbo-ramjet hybrid engine. (*1) Turbo-ramjet and ramjet components as well as supersonic inlets would be here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENode Five (SCRAMJETS/SABREs) This final node of engines would contain SCRAMJET engines custom added (*3). Scramjets would require a merging branch node from both hypersonic flight (see next node group) and somewhere in the mid to late-stage liquid rocket engines group. SABRE engines from B9 Aerospace would also go here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAerodynamics:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENode 1 (Basic flight) This node contains basic straight edge wings such as firespitter\u0027s... firespitter wings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENode 2 (Aerodynamics) This node covers wing design ranges from late prop aircraft to early jets. Where math started getting applied to aircraft design, but before man achieved supersonic flight. Wing sweeping is introduced here, but not the delta or other deep sweep wings of the next node.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENode 3 (Trans-sonic) Learning to break the sound barrier came with painful lessons about what air does above mach .9. This node would contain wings that reflect these lessons. Deeper Swept wings and Delta\u0027s show up here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENode 4 (Or node 3 revised) (Supersonic) The distinction between this one and above is likely not going to be in the parts available so much as lessons learned. Lessons learned flying above mach 1 and into mach 2 and 3 resulted in advancements to supersonic design overall, as well as improvements in flight at higher altitudes. Perhaps merging stock High Altitude Flight into this section will mark the distinction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENode 5 (Hypersonic Flight) At mach 5, air behaves more like a plasma fluid than... well, air. This node would contain the parts distinct to discovering that. Since a lot of how hypersonic designs will behave is modeled by computer, this node would require a merging point with mid-tier electronics. If you integrate Procedural wings, they belong here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESide Node (Figure out where to place): Composite wings. Light modern aircraft and drones use composite materials in their wings to make them lighter and more flexible while still being strong. TT Pizzaria adds a variety of light wings ideal for drone aircraft that appear to be of this design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESide Node 2: Rotor Craft. A possibility instead of lumping helicopter parts in with turbofans. They are a bit of their own side-branch in development requiring their own concepts and approach to flying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*1: Turbojet: Basic jet turbine engine. All power and thrust is developed in the turbomachinery. Poor performance and inefficient and low speed. Good power and speed at high subsonic through to mach 1.2 or so without afterburner, up to ~mach 2 with afterburner.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETurbofan: Turbojet engine with a large fan on the front that pushes air through a ducted bypass around the outside of the core. Moves a lot of air at a lower speed producing a LOT of power. Very efficient engine at subsonic, quickly loses power after hitting mach 1. High and low bypass (size of ducting) variants determine actual characteristics. Examples: High Bypass, 747\u0027s engines. Low Bypass, Modern combat aircraft engines like the F-22\u0027s F-119 afterburning turbofans.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERamjet: Jet engine that does not contain the internal turbomachinery and is considered not to have moving parts. Uses ramming effect of the aircraft plowing through the air as the intake that forces air into the engine, thus the name. Does not work at a stop or low speeds. Minimum mach 2.5 operational capability, upper limit around mach 5 - 7. Tweak for balance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETURBO-RAMJET: Hybrid engine. Operates as a turbojet until around mach 2.5 and then bypass doors in the engine open up forcing the air to move around the engine. SR-71 Blackbird\u0027s J-57 engines are a working example. Engine regime is more or less from full stop up to mach 3.5. Based on anecdotal evidence, may be able to push mach 4 before the leading compressor fan in the turbomachinery runs the risk of softening and flying apart. (Overheat above M3.5) In game, the stock turbojets operate in roughly this regime, but that needs to be fixed.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*2: Turboprops are propeller aircraft who\u0027s propellers aren\u0027t driven by piston engines. They are in the same vein as a turbofan engine in that their core component is the turbine. However, Turboprops completely forego the jet-thrust configuration and power propellers. They are more efficient than a turbojet, but cheaper than a full turbofan.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*3: TT Aerospace and Pizzaria has RAMJET engines that cover mid to high-velocity supersonic flight up to mach 5-6. However, RAMJETs are not the end of the line in air breathing engines. RAMJETs lose their power around mach 5-7 due to the fact that deflagration (regular burning) just doesn\u0027t burn the fuel fast enough before the flame itself is pushed out of the exhaust nozzle of the engine. And using shock cone inlets and other methods to slow the air down at this point start to produce too much drag for too little gain. (In short the engine literally blows itself out like a candle.) The SC in SCRAMJET stands for Supersonic Combustion [Ramjet]. Effectively, fuel is \u0027detonated\u0027 rather than \u0027burned\u0027 so that the heated exhaust gas expands fast enough to be effective in the engine. The configuration of the engine is otherwise just like a ramjet, though the mathematics of the geometry are refined for higher velocities. The SCRAMJET is proven up to speed of mach 9-10, though theories suggest that with the right fuels and materials, velocities up to mach 22 are possible. The limitation of the SCRAMJET at top speed is how much heat burning the fuel can add to the air. At a SCRAMJET\u0027s theoretical limit, the air is just as hot at the diffuser (just after intake) due to compression as it is when the fuel is burned into it. No heat added means no further expansion of the air, means no additional thrust. The engine maxes at full speed by its net thrust running to zero. (It reaches top speed and just stays there until fuel is run out.) The TESTED and verified top speed of a scramjet would make escaping stock-sized kerbin into medium orbit easy once you get to the mach 3.5 power development threshold. The theoretical limit would be good for real solar system configuration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that\u0027s my suggestion for the aircraft tree. Now a couple of comments about other things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the cost values for different sections still need tweaking. Your custom instrumentation gives very large injections of science when you complete each one, but the leaps going up the tree are extremely steep in price for stock experimentation. I suggest tweaking and integration with Kerbal Dust Experiment and L-Tech Science parts mods in mind. I also suggest reviewing how much science can be earned per \u0027range sphere\u0027 around kerbin based on these to work out about what \u0027tiers\u0027 take you what distances.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, I think a tier for wheels, perhaps integrating modular multiwheels and other wheel mods into the mix would also be good for the tree. Give the player the chance to run around on the ground a little early on and for lack of a better term \u0027drive\u0027 some of their experiments out to places. There are a lot of biomes on kerbin. And they can ALL be reached by land if you\u0027re patient enough. (Thanks to Kerbin\u0027s continents having a double land bridge.) At the very least, give them the chance to explore the local biomes and let the local biomes at least play a useful part in the early game. From what I learned playing Nazari\u0027s (OR however that name\u0027s spelled), Traditional Tech Tree, getting around kerbin early on can be a pretty decent goal. (Before you go to space, explore your own world dangit!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs it stands, with your science tiers jumping in value rapidly, the meager science of the kerbin surface biomes pretty much makes them useless very quickly. Perhaps integrating the flight tree with some experiments, making them integral to helping advance the flight tech branches would be a way to go there.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-03T10:36:08Z\u0022 title=\u002212/03/2013 10:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 3, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by AdmiralTigerclaw\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Autochton","CreatedById":70134,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-03T10:44:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022AdmiralTigerclaw\u0022 data-cite=\u0022AdmiralTigerclaw\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E[...]TT Aerospace and Pizzaria[...]\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI assume you mean Taverio\u0027s Aerospace \u0026amp; Pizza Delivery (aka.

I\u0027m not going to go about this and say you\u0027re wrong, but I am going to stress a warning about following the \u0027I want\u0027 bug. Remember, KSP is all about what the player who\u0027s actually playing wants to do. You chase these historical missions too far down the rabbit hole and you\u0027re going to run into the problem of locking others into what YOU want. Part of the way the stock experiments work is that you don\u0027t get locked into \u0027one probe does this, another does that\u0027... You take a probe core you need and you stick the experiments on it to fit what you plan to do with it for that mission. However, I do like the Data Recorder setup you\u0027ve done. Experiments aren\u0027t simply fired off in an instant, but require some operating time to execute. If this function could be broken down into individual stock and add-on experiments, you\u0027d actually bring a whole new aspect to gameplay. For example, if KDEX (Kerbal Dust Experiment) got recoded to use your system, it could take several minutes to an hour to \u0027collect dust samples\u0027 from space (Assuming a fix for timewarp can make that hour go by quickly), and then, AFTER this run time, you can \u0027analyze collected samples\u0027 for science points. This alters the entire gameplay mechanic for science and makes the player actually have to take time-on-target into consideration when working a mission, rather than just \u0027passing by\u0027. A gravity experiment for another example, would require a decent amount of ToT. In fact, many of the stock experiments would result in more immersive gameplay because they actually do require some significant ToT.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven without the tech tree, you have modding GOLD right there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow this is something I see a lot discussed, about having a \u0027plane phase\u0027 prior to the rocket phase.

After a certain point, flying to the biomes and trying to land gets tedious. However, I\u0027m also loath to play the game, and have this big 1200 km diameter sphere you start on turn into nothing more than a glorified landing zone. Kerbin has such a nice diverse environment, and lots of interesting terrain to explore. Even at a 1/10 scale to real life, the place is HUGE. (You don\u0027t appreciate how huge until you\u0027ve had a sub-sonic aircraft do a half-globe flight to deliver a command truck.) It\u0027s likely the minecrafter in me talking, but when I look around KSC, I see the landscape in the distance and want to check it out. But I digress... Core point is, so much work went into Kerbin alone that just launching into space and forgetting about it aside from being a huge landing pad just seems wasteful. There\u0027s got to be some things to do utilizing the local biomes that\u0027s fun and refreshing to gameplay. Make Kerbin USEFUL to the player, and FUN to explore. I\u0027m not asking for the tech tree to come up with a solution to that. But I think that at least giving the player a runaround planet-side should factor in to game play. A little goal oriented jaunt that makes the planet and its biomes useful. A little \u0027from the ground up\u0027 experience. And with the way the research system works. If you don\u0027t force it early, you can literally IGNORE it entirely because it\u0027s just \u0027throw science points at it\u0027.

I find it unrealistic that for a species going to space for the first time gets 10 science from each experiment, and 1 or 0 for each subsequent time. I think like 40 for each stock experiment, obviously a tweakable number, three times undiminished for at least kerbin space, and other planets, get rid of all stock kerbin experiments like temp, barometer and surface samples, crew reports and evas. If possible these experiments should be done by 3 different ships, to show checking of the results and not just using the same equipment and doing the same thing with potentially faulty instruments. This will help boost the available science at first, with about what, like 360 science from all the first stock things done three times, barely over your custom experiments done once, that is at least 3 launches still keeping the challenge. This way getting to the mun, would be even more attractive, with 400 to 500 more science on top of your custom experiments, only enough to get one node.\u003Cp\u003EAny thoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Forgot to mention, after the third time or whatever, it would, like your current custom experiments give no science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m a bit confused. I set the base/cap science to the same value. So you should be getting 100% of the possible science from the experiment. Are you saying you are able to do the custom experiments more than once?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot sure if you saw my recent post, but probes are getting a massive overhaul with the addition of several historical probes with \u0022simulated\u0022 models. I use the terms simulated lightly. With the addition of project bumper, explorer and sputnik 1,2,3 it\u0027ll already be a huge relief for early tech levels. The experiments include in MS18 are pretty much more proof\u0027s of concepts than final model.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the number times you can perform an experiment it\u0027s based on the base/cap science values. IE, 5 base 10 cap, you can do the experiment twice. I\u0027m still swimming in the deep, but once I come up for air I can explain how the custom experiment plugin works and you could design your own experiments and we could share them to have some sort of crowd sourcing things going on. with experiment packs? Just a thought.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for limiting them being done by the same ship, you could set the experiment to non repeatable, meaning that once the instrument has been used to make an experiment it\u0027s \u0027used\u0027 and cannot be done again during that flight. But then someone could slap more than one unit of that experiment, so still not possible to fully limit it technically. Maybe make a plugin for that? IE, have a current/previous vesselId variable and if they match then the experiment can\u0027t be triggered? No idea how someone would go about getting that done though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-04T06:47:26Z\u0022 title=\u002212/04/2013 06:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 4, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by MedievalNerd\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
