Get all stations at the target body.\n2. *Randomly* pick *one*\n3. If that one is not orbiting, offer the contract\n\nSo what\u0027s likely happening is that there is one vessel marked as station that is not orbiting that is throwing your check off when it gets selected.\n\nWhat you want is to drop the DATA node entirely, and use this requirement:\n\n       REQUIREMENT\n        {\n            name = NoStation\n            type = Expression\n    \n            expression = AllVessels().Where(v =\u003E v.VesselType() == Station \u0026\u0026 v.CelestialBody() == @/targetBody1 \u0026\u0026 v.IsOrbiting()).Count() == 0\n        }\n\nOr, a little bit more complex, but if you instead do it all in DATA nodes and use it for you selection criteria for the body:\n\n        DATA\n        {\n            type = List\n            stations = AllVessels().Where(v =\u003E v.VesselType() == Station \u0026\u0026 v.IsOrbiting())\n        }\n    \n        DATA\n        {\n            type = CelestialBody\n            requiredValue = true\n            uniqueValue = true\n            targetBody1 = OrbitedBodies().Where(body =\u003E @/stations.Where(v =\u003E v.CelestialBody() == body).Count() == 0).Random()\n        }\n\nThe second is a little bit better, because it\u0027ll always generate a contract if it can (versus the first will generate a contract, but then not offer it when the requirement fails).  So in the first case if the player has orbited 10 bodies, and has stations around 9 of them, then that logic will only generate a contract for the correct body 10% of the time.  The second one will generate a contract for the remaining body 100% of the time."},{"CreatedByName":"severedsolo","CreatedById":80345,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-03T16:35:04Z","Content":"Hmm, I can\u0027t find another Station in the save but it\u0027s entirely possible that there was a station on the ground when it was loaded into the pre-loader.\n\nThis does seem to be the most logical explanation, as I haven\u0027t come across this on my save, and I only ever set my vessels to station when they are in position.\n\nI\u0027ll put the fix that [@nightingale](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/119307-nightingale/) gave me above into the next release.\n\nJust a thought: [@CompB](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/99260-compb/) - how long (in-game time) passed between these contracts generating roughly?\n\nWait... we can nest Where() commands?

You may have to start being careful of performance concerns though (in that example if you have 100 vessels and 10 celestial bodies, it\u0027ll have to look at 1000 combinations).

The old method was getting a bit cumbersome, and USS was closer to what I wanted, so I merged them.
