Do not ask me for help or support, post all questions to the ROSolar github.**\n\n~~Many people have been asking me to release the solar panels from my various parts packs as their own standalone pack. Here it is! This pack contains most of the solar panels from my US and Soviet parts packs. The panels permanently attached to their respective crafts have been separated and modified to work as standalone parts. The solar panels that were already separate parts are NOT included.~~\n\n~~I kept the original directory structures intact so if you already have my other parts packs this will merge into those folders and use the already existing assets preventing unnecessary raising of RAM usage.~~\n\n~~**If you enjoy this mod consider downloading my other mods from which these panels are derived.**~~\n\n![Lj22iab.png](http://i.imgur.com/Lj22iab.png)\n\n~~**INSTALLATION:**~~\n\n~~Remove old version first. Unzip into your KSP main folder.~~\n\n~~**NOTES:**~~\n\n~~-This pack contains the majority of the solar panels used on my US and Soviet packs. Some have been slightly modified for use as a separate part rather than part of the original craft.~~\n\n~~DOWNLOAD~~ **Download removed because mod longer exists as a standalone piece.**\n\n~~These mods are also available on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E~~\n\n**Credits:**\n\nSome US panels: NASA JPL\n\nBahasp and rnmodules source: [https://github.com/raidernick/BDAnimationModules](https://github.com/raidernick/BDAnimationModules)\n\nReflection Plugin Source: [https://github.com/raidernick/Reflection-Plugin-Continued](https://github.com/raidernick/Reflection-Plugin-Continued)\n\n**LICENSE:**\n\n[![88x31.png](http://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-nd/3.0/88x31.png)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/us/)\n\n[https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/us/](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/us/)\n\n**This license does not cover mod packs.

I thought about it but both of the panels on skylab have a specific way that they attach to the station that makes it very difficult to adapt to work on any spacecraft. I would likely need to redo the panels entirely to fix this and I didn\u0027t think it was worth the time or effort to do.\n\nMy pack uses the kosmos panels for those stations. I had no intentions of making my own. Solar panels are extremely time consuming to make(for me anyway) and I often spend equal to or greater amount of time working on them than I do the spacecraft itself. Since those panels are perfectly functional I don\u0027t see a reason to make my own.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Thanks RaiderNick, I hope that this mod will expand just as fast as the probe packs. Also, I have to ask if you will do a pack for the antennae, and some solar panels that look like that of the Sirius Satellites.\n\u003E Thanks!\n\nI don\u0027t plan to make any solar panels specifically for this pack. This is just a place to dump the panels from any spacecraft I make into their own individual parts. If at any point I make that particular satellite I will include the panels from it here.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-08T02:32:22Z\u0022 title=\u002204/08/2015 02:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by raidernick**"},{"CreatedByName":"TMBakeNaut","CreatedById":121578,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-08T11:24:36Z","Content":"Bravo!!"},{"CreatedByName":"Martian","CreatedById":111895,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-08T21:21:44Z","Content":"Love the panels, but unlocking them in stock career mode is much too easy- I can get them all just by opening up General Rocketry.

This is an issue on your end. My game is capped at 60 fps and no matter how man panels I add it stays at 60. The only time you may get some lag is when the panels are opening for the first time as this happens when a lot of colliders move. Once they are open there shouldn\u0027t be any lag.
