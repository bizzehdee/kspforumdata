No surface attach from the PDGF to the core or what you are grabbing. Now using KIS to attach a PDGF you really don\u0027t have a choice. But using nodes will remove the floating PDGF when grabbed by an arm (at least it worked the half dozen times I tried it in 1.0.2)"},{"CreatedByName":"spudbean","CreatedById":66541,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T03:31:12Z","Content":"I have just released a version of RKE Kanadarm that is compatible with KSP 1.0.x.

How about the idea of a hybrid LEE PDGF (docking port) The idea is use a KAS magnet to first grab the port (only works for LEE and PDGF. Retain the magnetic attraction but without the actual docking) This way you can grab from two directions at the same time without reloading the scene. Once you pull your cargo away from its previous docking port then manually engage the magnet to now be a docking port. This gives time to transfer from one docking port to the next in a more realistic fashion than floating them together. I\u0027ve messed around with turning the LEE into a KAS magnet it can be done but then it no longer accepts the PDGF. So its one or the other at the moment.

One joint should be used for \u0022Elbow\u0022 movement, and the other for the wrist. As far as how it should be oriented, on the joints themselves, structural ends should be paired with structural ends. \n\nSo, for a finished assembly of an Elbow/Wrist joint, you\u0027d have the copper plates carrying the regular structural arms (IE, they\u0027d be where you want that part of the arm to rotate), and the structural ends of the joints joined together (or split by another structural part, depending on how you want to build your arm). This will ensure that they operate correctly without the model going bonkers. The model will still go bonkers in the VAB (though you can still use VAB movement to determine how the joint will move) but in flight it shouldn\u0027t.\n\nI\u0027m going to go ahead and upload a subassembly of the arm once my KSP is back up (it crashed before I could save it). Presuming your install isn\u0027t bonkers and there isn\u0027t some phantom nonsense messing things up, the sub should give you guys a good idea on how to assemble the arm.

Can someone please post an easy instructional guide for this?\n\nWhat specifically are you looking for help with? IR setup for the arm after it is assembled? Or just attaching the parts together? I\u0027m assuming you are having issues assembling an arm correct?\n\nSo to build an arm you need to pay attention to the \u0022anchor node\u0022 of each of the moving components of the arm. IR Rework has more visual queues to help you visualize how the parts go together but RKE has a more realistic appearance. But all that aside.\n\nStart in the VAB for easier reference. Build an arm from the base to the hand, end whatever you want to call it.\n\nEvery part needs to be pointing the proper direction or it will not function properly. So to start grab a standard rotor, and as soon as the part is spawned you will see two nodes on the part. One on the bottom of the rotor and the other on the side of the rotor.\n\nThe node facing down is your \u0022anchor node\u0022 Use this node to attach the rotor.\n\nNow you can attach a \u0022Reverse Rotor\u0022 to the rotor already placed. This time the rotor will spawn in a different orientation. Again the node facing down is the anchor node. But the two nodes will be \u0022reversed\u0022 Orient the revers rotor to align the anchor node to attach to the standard rotor previously placed.\n\nAfter that it is as simple as attaching structural tubes in either direction, orientation is not important with those.\n\nand repeating the same steps with all IR components.\n\nThe movement will not work properly in the VAB you will need to launch to have everything function normally. If you are still lost feel free to ask here or on one of the IR threads for more advanced setups.\n\nAlso I have a preassembled arm on my forum thread linked bellow if you need more of a visual reference.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-03T18:15:17Z\u0022 title=\u002208/03/2015 06:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by V8jester**"},{"CreatedByName":"mghslowell","CreatedById":151592,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-26T12:57:45Z","Content":"I am having a problem, I am using 1.04 KSP and bobcats Space shuttle, with Canadarm2, I downloaded the Community ISS and currently building it in orbit, which is phenomenal, in detail.
