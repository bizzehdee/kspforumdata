This means it does not work properly when multiple parts have the same name.\n\nBoth this mod and ModuleManager (on version 2.6.5 as of this writing) attempt to edit the tech tree of the current game. This mod\u0027s changes should have priority.\n\nIf you would like to disable the option to select a tech tree and the conflict with ModuleManager change the \u0022allowTreeSelection\u0022 field in PluginData/YongeTech\\_TechTreesExpansion/config.xml from \u00271\u0027 to \u00270\u0027. This will keep support for the TechTree ConfigNode additions and custom icon support, but remove the option to select a tech tree.\n\n**Tech Trees**\n\n[YongeTech: Great Big Sky](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/126487-1-0-3-YongeTech-Great-Big-Sky-Tech-Tree-%28v1-0%29?p=2037311#post2037311) \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Wide and shallow tech tree. Feel free to use as an example on how to setup a tech tree with this mod.\n\n**Using a Tech Tree**\n\nWhen starting a new Science or Career game a window will appear asking you to select a tech tree to use. Pick a tree from the drop-down list and below it will show the description and some stats for that tree.\n\nTotal Cost and Total Nodes are the total cost to researcher all nodes on the tree and the total number of nodes in the tree. These numbers exclude hidden nodes. The tiers for the nodes are those nodes that can be researched at that tier of the Research and Development facility.\n\n**Creating a Tech Tree**\n\nCreate a new TechTree ConfigNode and place in your mod. This mod will locate and add any TechTree ConfigNodes to the list automatically.\n\nThe TechTree should be setup like normal with some additions shown in the code below:\n\n    TechTree{  title = Sample TechTree  description = An incomplete TechTree showing the basic setup  unlockAllStartParts = True  RDNode  {    ...    Unlocks    {      part = solidBooster_sm      part = probeStackAdapter      part = standardNoseCone      part = sensorThermometer      part = basicFin    }  }  ...}\n\nTechTree ConfigNode:\n\n*title*: The name of the tree. Displayed in the tech tree selection window when starting a new game. (approximately a 45 character limit)\n\n*description* - Single paragraph description of the tree for the player. Displayed in the tech tree selection window when starting a new game. (approximately a 400 character limit)\n\n*unlockAllStartParts*: (optional) If set to True the mod will unlock all parts attached to the starting node(s), that is all RDNodes with an entryCost of 0. This is only relevant if *No Entry Purchase Required on Research* is disabled in difficulty settings.\n\nUnlocks ConfigNode:\n\n*part*: name of a part to unlock with the parent RDNode.\n\nCustom Icon Textures\n\nThe mod will create icons for use in a tech tree from any png or tga files it finds in folders named \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CRDSimpleIcons\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2. The icons will have the same name as the image file, without the extension.\n\n .../RDSimpleIcons/customIcon\\_tech.png will become \u0022icon = customIcon\\_tech\u0022\n\n**Tech Tree Converter**\n\nThe [YongeTech Tech Tree Converter](https://github.com/yongedevil/YTK_TechTrees/releases/tag/v1.0-converter) helps convert existing tech trees by filling in the Unlocks nodes for all techs. It will add all parts that:\n\n- Have a TechRequired of that node.\n- Are not listed in another tech node\u0027s Unlock section.\n\nIt writes the filled out TechTree to a txt file in the mod\u0027s directory. It performs this conversion for all TechTrees installed, and it also dose not name the output files in any meaningful way. It is necessary to inspect the output files to locate the correct tree and then add the title and description fields to it.\n\n**Licence**\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\n\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \u0022Software\u0022), to deal\n\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\n\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\n\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\n\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\n\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \u0022AS IS\u0022, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\n\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\n\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

This was causing a problem with the unlocks for additional features in MechJeb.\n\nI don\u0027t have much else planned for this mod now, but I have a short list of features that should be possible. I can look at adding the following if there is demand for them:\n\nOption to link a texture to the tech tree for the selection window. This would give the player a visual cue to remember each tree. This could be a small logo, or a link to open a larger image such as a preview of the tech tree.\n\nOption to move all parts that are, by default, unlocked by one tech to another. This would allow creating tech trees without worrying about mod parts getting lost in the missing techs.\n\nTech tree debug tools. This would be an option to enable debug messages for a tech tree and could check for some problems such as:\n\n- Missing default tech nodes, which can cause parts added to those node by mods to not show up unless the parts are specifically reassigned.\n- Parts whose TechRequired doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t exist in the tree. Basically the above problem but only checks installed parts.\n- Unknown part values in the Unlocks. These can be legitimate if you add support for mod parts not currently installed, but they could also be typos.\n- Duplicate part values in the Unlocks.\n\nAnd I am sorry I wasn\u0027t able to get the mod out sooner. I put this aside due to the ModuleManager conflict for about a month (28 days according to commit logs) because it seamed it might be a dead end. Normally I don\u0027t have a problem with being incompatible with another mod that does the same thing (both this mod and ModuleManager edit the TechTree for saved games), but ModuleManager dose too many other very useful things to ask people to uninstall for this mod. In the end though, the workaround was one of those simple solutions that make you feel like an idiot for not seeing sooner. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Wolf Baginski","CreatedById":138549,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-21T16:46:03Z","Content":"One small UI tweak would be good.
