Specifically, my solid rocket booster (first level) produces a different amount of thrust and TWR before I launch then after I revert to fly it a second time. For a roughly 2-meter tapered cone SRB, the delta-V goes from ~1,900 m/s and 1.6\u002B TWR to 1,500 m/s and 1.16 TWR, with no change to the craft itself. Although I have no experience with tweakable parts and SETI before, I find this behavior very odd.\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWorse, I\u0027m running with KCT and the performance differs from where I design a rocket, simulate it (first time is OP, second time functions differently).

And its not just a misreported KER value, as the craft itself on the first launch accelerates like a bat out of hell, and once I revert and fly it a second time, performs much differently (slower, less thrust). This is making it quite difficult to properly design a craft, since with DR and FAR I keep losing critical parts (parachutes) to overheating on my small rockets.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EOk, I think this may have had something to do with interactions between tweakscale and PP.

This variable isn\u0027t changed by DR and causes the srb to produce stock heat with reduced part max temp so your srbs blow up. You can open that .cfg and change that number to a lower number I feel they should never explode from there own thrust as long as it\u0027s reasonable. So I cut the number in half.
