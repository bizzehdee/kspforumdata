But what was fun for me to figure out isn\u0027t too fun for everyone else it seems. But I didn\u0027t know that until I released the tech tree and started to get input about it.

Let me preface it by saying that this surely varies a \u003Cstrong\u003Elot\u003C/strong\u003E with play style and used mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d split the equipment needed for gathering science easily into two levels: Early on I\u0027d consider decouplers (radial and coaxial), batteries and at least the tiny solar panels, an antenna, and landing legs as essential. This allows return missions to/from the moons (which provide plenty of science with their biomes). Technically the solar panels are not essential, but allow you to not carry about 20 batteries (just to be sure, of course \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E ).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second level would be for interplanetary missions, requiring the lab module, docking and solid solar panel technology. While rover-tech would possibly be helpful, it\u0027s far from essential. Ironically probe cores would probably be needed to stop vessels without pod from getting turned into \u0027junk\u0027 by the game engine. The very concept of interplanetary travel (due to the heavier craft) also requires at least one or two more powerful engines for the initial launch, one intermediate engine (average thrust and isp) for orbital injection and one somewhat efficient engine for the interplanetary burns (incl. return). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven with mods like KAS, Kethane and the like this list wouldn\u0027t look that different. To use Kethane at all you need one of each of the base elements (scanner, tank, converter and possibly docking) but it doesn\u0027t help that much with gathering science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is quite different when RemoteTech is used though, as you basically need antenna and probe cores early on to create a simple communication network (unless you want to have manned communication satellites). Otherwise even going to the Mun becomes quite tedious or fiddly even if all you want to transmit are the 100% crew reports...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGathering 500 science is a simple return-trip to the Mun or Minmus I\u0027d say, thanks to biomes this can be performed quite a few times before we run out of stuff to return. With vessel design/construction, testing and performing the mission at least the first time will still be a couple of hours (maybe 2-3), depending on the level of equipment available. While interplanetary missions tend to give more of course, they also take much longer to plan (incl. vessel design) and execute. Such a mission might bring double the science but at least for me it takes more than twice the (real) time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for what equipment is essential, that\u0027s more or less answered above already but at the lowest level I\u0027d say obviously separators, batteries and (the tiny) solar panels, some landing legs and possibly antennae (esp. with remote tech, then also probe cores).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope this helps and my answer is the type of response you are looking for. Keep up the good work, I\u0027m still eager to try this with just the TreeLoader, so please do keep us up to date with how that\u0027s going \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ackander","CreatedById":90879,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-20T09:36:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have just on a few minutes before I crash, I will do more answering tomorrow. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the input Creat, it is what I am looking for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as TreeEdit/Loader go, there was an issue with just having TreeLoader and not TreeEdit. I only have guesses to explain what was going wrong, but using ModuleManager, I made it so just having TreeLoader and the tree.cfg from my download will work. There still might be issues if you have any other MM cfgs that change required tech and use :Final. I can only suggest not using those with the Vertical Tree. VetTech is the mod I have in mind as far as possible interference goes. I am sure there might be others out there too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully I can find a science cost configuration that I am happy with. I have finished rearranging nodes and connects, all that is left to do is input costs, and redraw the poster. I will make sure to release the next version before I do the poster.. my perfectionism hates it when I finish anything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese nodes I plan to be \u0027basic\u0027 tech nodes, so they will not be to hard to get. They are all 4 steps or less from the start node, and I think they cost between 150 and 200 science in all, still not final. But, still no parachutes in this batch of nodes . No parts were moved around, so you should be able to tell from below what you can get with a couple hundred science for sure. stock parachutes are 6 steps from start, so they should either cost 100 or slightly more science in all to get to.. still working on this. There are a lot of variables to work through, not least of all how the Vertical TechTree compares to the stock tree. Over all, the transition from having a pod and truss to a real space program should be more smoothe, and not require you to look under every loose rock for every bit of science around the KSC or build weird podrovers. But then again, this just means it\u0027s liable to be too easy now.

I know for a fact that I missed many good mods when getting parts to sort into the TechTree. If I get a bunch of parts sorted, I will go ahead and put out another update. I do not plan on making changes to nodes and prices any time soon, especially if I make something that will output ModuleManager changes for everyone to use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemember to leave feedback if you think I need to make changes. Or at least let me know if I did something right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI absolutely cannot garanetee funness though, just a vertical technologies tree.. It is hard to figure out a good costs for a lot of nodes since some nodes have only one or two parts in them from one or two mods. If nobody uses that mod, then that node is empty and hopefully is not a parent node. There are three parent nodes that will be empty if playing with just stock parts, one is composites, which leads to a couple cones, and survivability which has mod parachutes in at first and for some reason I cannot remember the third. I think it is in spaceframes 2nd from the top. But, I tried to put parts together from the same mod, even if they do not have the same \u0022value\u0022 of the other parts in the node, I figured it was more important to have as few holes as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome other changes I made.. I moved unmanned to right after basic electrics and precision engineering to right after science, which includes a mechjeb in electronics. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomething I just thought of.. I do not know what effect loading my ModuleManager config file will have on games using the stock tree. I\u0027m guessing it will mess it up. I need to test this and see if there is a way to avoid this without move the file every time youload KSP. If anyone has any ideas, let me know. If you have any mod support requests, send them my way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAddio, miei amici,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, let me know what you think\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: I forgot and remembered about 3 times to say that I will be updating the TechTree if there is an abundance of new parts with mods updating to KSP0.23. Shouldn\u0027t take too long. I know I should have updated before releasing, but I wasn\u0027t thinking straight, like right now.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-25T07:41:14Z\u0022 title=\u002212/25/2013 07:41  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 25, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Ackander\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Erozz","CreatedById":98527,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-25T13:47:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ackander\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Ackander\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E Or at least let me know if I did something right.\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis will be awesome ! ! ....
