Because by default its taking power from the KTEC generator, but by shutting off the KTEC generator, it is using power only from the direct conversion generator and the differential thrust still happens with either generator. Two times, I have loaded back to the quicksave point (image depicts some 30 sec to 1 min since a quicksave point) and, having changed nothing, the thrust doesn\u0027t bug out like that. Both times i was watching the thrust in the right click pop up though.
