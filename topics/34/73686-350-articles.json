Most of the engines, for example, are simple shapes with a divergent nozzle attached to it and some greeble thrown in. Tantares engines have to go away from this in order to actually look like rocket engines!! But that doesn\u0027t mean Tantares has to abandon the aesthetics and artistic nuances of stock parts - abandoning that would be realism (or ugliness). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIMO Tantares walks the line of stock-a-like very very well, and fleshing out existing parts doesn\u0027t change that. In fact, it avoids part bloat by stemming the constant out pour of more parts to fill roles that could be filled with existing parts after a little refinement. Squad may (hopefully:D) do an art pass in the future to bring them up to speed with Unity 5 and the level of talent that mod authors have. What \u003Cstrong\u003Epassinglurker\u003C/strong\u003E said, this may/may not effect how mod authors actually start modding, because their more beginner work may be crappy compared to the newer stock standards after the art pass.
