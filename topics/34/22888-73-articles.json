The Soyuz is a launch system for approx. 7t to LEO which includes a frequently used transportation vehicle for a crew of 3. A shuttle launch cost was about 450 million dollars (2011) and a Soyuz launch is about 150 million (2011) so for a 14 times bigger launch capacity the STS is a heavy if not a super heavy launch system whereas the Soyuz is maybe a middle. The two are not the same category and weren\u0027t designed for the same variety of missions. The shuttle has never been used with full capacity (for eg. it could achieve a polar orbit and return safely).
