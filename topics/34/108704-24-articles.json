I have a request please that is similar to Science Relay.\n\nWould you be please willing to craft a modlet that converts non transmissble science to transmitable using the MPL?\n\nThe idea is that material bays and goo require eye and finger proding analysis.  Not just looking at them through a camera or something. So like Kerbalism\u0027s idea of reducing transmission on these experiments to 0 - the MPL can be used to convert an experiment with 0 transmission to 100 transmission when crewed hy scientists.  Kerbalism does do something similar but complicates the Stockalike feel that this would bring.  Then you could transmit back to kerbin for the full amount.\n\nIf this is how Science Relay works then my apologies.  I started using it this morning for about 30 mins.  Also I know this or something similiar was in the original implementation for the MPL but that functionality was removed in 1.0 of favour of unlimited science.\n\nPeace.\n\n(And thanks for Kerbnet Controller and EVA Transfer!
