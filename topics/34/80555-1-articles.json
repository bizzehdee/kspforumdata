So, if you install the mod and load a savegame that was created without the mod, the current available contracts will still have science rewards. To fix that, just refuse a contract (or do something that changes the contract list) so that the mod will updated the contracts and remove the science rewards.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-16T01:01:46Z\u0022 title=\u002212/16/2014 01:01  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 16, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by acerola\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CabbageFoot","CreatedById":131874,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-14T23:50:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDoes this also zero out all science from the Administration building that lets you funnel 90ish% reputation and 20ish% funds into science?

The above mentioned mod give you the ability to set contract-only rewards to different percentages(like 0% science), because I believe that we should commit ourselves, to landing a kerbal on the Mun(and returning him safely) before the week is out (or before the tech tree is unlocked with contracts) and return him safely...maybe return him the week after on another craft.\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
