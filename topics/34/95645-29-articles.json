That doesn\u0027t make any sense at all.\u003Cp\u003EThe unmanned tech node sounds like an appropriate place for the drill, you have to purchase the R\u0026amp;D upgrade to unlock that node so you\u0027ll already have access to surface samples. It probably will need some balancing, although I\u0027m not sure about making it not collectible, the mars rovers only have one drill and storage bays for multiple samples, I would be more inclined to increase the sample size so that you can only realistically fit one surface sample per science container. If that increases the transmission cost, that would actually better balance it since it takes time and energy to process a sample.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as integration, that depends on whether you want this to be a core part of SETI. If you want this to be a core mod, I would say to go ahead and integrate it, and I would be happy to help maintain the mod as basically a stand-alone version of the SETI science tweaks, the same way you separated the progression contracts out as a separate mod. This would actually be my preferred option, as those tweaks are really intended primarily for this mod anyways, although I would like to keep a standalone version as an option.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother possible tweak I noticed that might help reduce the science overload later in the game is to remove biomes from the gravimeter when high in space since at those altitudes it makes more sense that you would be doing a much more general scan and reserve the biome specific stuff for lower orbits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: New version of the science tweaks is up, I adjusted the barometer mask so biomes should be respected while flying low now.

Thank you very much!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI m not very familiar with the biome filters. But since the gravimeter is very late now (electronics) compared to the accelerometer (survivability), biome dependence might give an incentive to revisit the biomes from orbit as well and alter the flight path.

The fix I use that works well for me (and has also worked for other users) is to force the game to use opengl instead of directx. Opengl is much more efficient with the memory than the default dx9 is and with a full maxmods install it will save over a GB of memory so the game should be much more stable, and you\u0027ll have enough overhead to install some visual mods as well if you want.

That would solve the issue on airless bodies since there\u0027s no flying situation available, only low in space. It would also balance the science rewards in atmospheres back closer to stock where the barometer was only biome dependent when landed, so I would basically be switching the situations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor anyone who is interested in how the situation and biome maps work, there\u0027s a thread \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/53025-Science-and-mods!\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E that talks about it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: I just did a quick update to the mod, if you want to make the change yourself just change the biomemask value to 4 for the barometer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI ve incorporated the changes into the dev build, thank you very much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Eagle21221\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Eagle21221\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EGreat mod and i really enjoy playing it, but the memory leak is unbearable.

It could work well for very small launchers (i.e. the real world use) or for probes which have solar panels to offset the energy requirements and don\u0027t mind the low TWR.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
