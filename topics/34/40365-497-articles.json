Beam-core propulsion would be a secondary \u0022fuel\u0022 mode, where the reactor contains much less regular matter to ensure the charged particles can escape. Alternately, you could instead adjust the magnetic nozzles to work with ThermalPower\u002Bpropellant so long as the source temperature is high enough to ensure the propellant becomes a plasma. The VASIMR electric propulsion system has a magnetic nozzle that handles plasma up to 1,000,000 K - the plasma is generated in a different way, but that shouldn\u0027t really matter as long as it\u0027s plasma, yes? That would give you antimatter-thermal (plasma core) rockets with magnetic nozzles. That might work better game-wise than beam-core antimatter rockets; a realistically represented beam-core rocket would have absurdly high ISP (~10,000,000 s) and pathetic thrust at the power levels we have available. The numbers from Project Rho have 10 MN-thrust ... at an utterly insane power level of \u003Cem\u003E500 TW\u003C/em\u003E! The 405 GW antimatter rocket would have \u0026lt;10 kN of thrust at that ratio. Increasing ISP decreases how much thrust you get for a given power level.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight - that\u0027s why I like the idea of a 1,250kN 200,000s plasma engine: the power checks out to be easily within the capability of the 405 GW antimatter reactor, and it fulfills the niche of the endgame high-thrust high-Isp antimatter rocket. We really don\u0027t need another high-Isp low-thrust propulsion system; those are headaches to use (KSPI magnetic nozzles, plasma engines, and every ion engine mod ever, I\u0027m looking at you) and we already have a whole bunch of them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can theoretically just stuff more propellant through a plasma-core rocket to increase your thrust and lower your Isp anyway, so the physics check out. There\u0027s no need for a rocket with 800,000s Isp anyway with the Kerbol-sized solar system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 10-meganewton figure given on Project Rho for the beam-core engine is the maximum theoretical that you could get from an engine made of matter. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA rocket with an Isp of 10,000,000 seconds (exhaust velocity of 98,000,000 m/s) and a thrust power of 405 gigawatts would have a thrust of just over 4 kilonewtons, but I think you could get away with just injecting more antimatter and getting higher thrusts that way up to a point, but the real issue is not vaporizing your engine when \u0026gt;40% of the input power is turning into heat. The wasteheat generated by my torch drive is almost certainly several orders of magnitude too little, but I pulled some hand-waving that it\u0027s not thermalizing the gamma rays and most of the energy is lost that way. I\u0027m not at all sure that\u0027s plausible. I wanted ships that use that drive to have to carry the next size bigger radiators than normal, but anyone who\u0027s tried to get the maximum possible power out of an antimatter reactor knows that 405 gigawatts is a lot of radiator, and my engine probably should put out close to that in waste heat.

The kinetic energy is ~374 MeV/pion, compared to a rest mass of ~209 MeV/pion, so those particles are moving at a substantial fraction of lightspeed.

The other problem is since a significant fraction of your propellant mass is being converted into energy, you have to use the relativistic rocket equation instead of the standard rocket equation (you wind up getting worse performance, since a substantial fraction of your propellant mass effectively vanishes without doing anything). Also, ~38% of the initial propellant rest mass is converted into energy of the neutral pions, which rapidly decay into high-energy gamma rays. This means that nearly as much energy is converted into deadly radiation spraying in all directions as is coming out of the exhaust jet as useful thrust. Not only will you need shielding to prevent this from killing your crew, you will need heat radiators to keep it from simply vaporizing the shielding.

So no big deal there. So 4 EC/sec. That\u0027s a heck of a lot more than the 45/min that the standard RTG produces. Two questions: Does the EC/sec decrease as the resource does?
