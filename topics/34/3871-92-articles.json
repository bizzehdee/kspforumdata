There might be more parts, but the small escape tower is the only one I\u0027ve noticed so far. When you initially attach it, all is well, but if you mess around with staging at all or unattach/reattach the engine, you\u0027ll get NaN for mass and 0 Dv until you remove the small escape tower. If that\u0027s not the NP part you\u0027re using, experiment to find out what is.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
