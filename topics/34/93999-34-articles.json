PFOblate and PFOffset being two of them. However, there IS a PQSMod_VertexHeightOblate which will work if you add it through kittopiatech.

I\u0027v mentioned this to CaptRobau but without it saving it doesn\u0027t seem useful. \u003Cp\u003EAlso I believe the reason why the asteroids are easier to create is the heightmap is much more gradient in general and the planet has a much smaller radius which creates a larger difference in height giving the irregular shapes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot wanting to derail this thread too far, what about adding the PQSMod_VertexHeightOblate into the .cfg files in Kittopia instead of the ingame gui?

It will indeed save the PQS and load it as well. The problem comes when you try to export scaledmesh.
