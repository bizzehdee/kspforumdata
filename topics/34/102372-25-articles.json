Which parts those are will depend on the mods you have installed. You can find which parts in your copy have the module by searching for \u0022name = ModuleLight\u0022 (without the quote marks) inside your ModuleManager.ConfigCache file.\n\nSpoiler\n\n// This is a snippet from my ModuleManager.ConfigCache file showing one of the found parts with extra (irrelevant) lines removed for clarity\n    \n    UrlConfig\n    {parentUrl = Bluedog_DB/Parts/Apollo/bluedog_Apollo_Block2_DockingLight.cfgPART{\tname = bluedog_Apollo_Block2_DockingLight[SNIP]title = Apollo EVA Floodlight // \u003C== the title of the part as shown in the editor and PAW[SNIP]MODULE\t{\t\tname = ModuleLight  // \u003C== This is what the contract is looking for\t\tlightName = EVAlight\t\tuseAnimationDim = true\t\tlightBrightenSpeed = 2.5\t\tlightDimSpeed = 2.5\t\tresourceAmount = 0.04\t\tanimationName = bluedog_Apollo_DockingSpotlight_LightAnim\t\tuseResources = true\t}[SNIP]\n    }\n    }\n\nIt will generally be spotlights or headlights that are meant to shine light onto other parts.
