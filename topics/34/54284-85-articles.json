However while trying to get a clean log of this problem, I stumbled on another problem, I built something, than when I wanted to move the stake I accidentaly droped it and it exploded, I placed another stake and at that point the UI gliched and log started to spam errors. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is the ksp.log and output_log: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/16518340/destroyedStake.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Elogs\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: managed to reproduce the problem with finalize build and sinking into the ground: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/16518340/unableToFinalize.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Elogs\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT2: with some more investigation, I found I can reliably reproduce the first problem (and avoid it). Whenever I enter VAB and than go back to vessel the error will show up, but if I go to the vessel directly after starting KSP it will work ok. So if I want to play normally I have to restart KSP each time I use VAB. So my gues is it is not EL fault, but something else, I will investigate more (try to remove some other mods).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-11T17:57:21Z\u0022 title=\u002201/11/2015 05:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Tsuki\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
