Why would you need another 5m upper stage rocket? Do your payloads never slim out to under 5m? If you were desperate for more 5m engines just use Tweakscale on other engines. I think the selection is fine, I\u0027d welcome more of course, as I would more tanks and/or paint schemes (current and new), but the mod doesn\u0027t NEED anything. It\u0027s pretty much perfect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: To those who believe the Griffon is overpowered, you do realise it\u0027s based on the Rocketdyne F-1 cluster that launched the Saturn V, right? One of the largest rockets ever created? With 60s technology? If your launch vehicle doesn\u0027t require it\u0027s full power it does have a thrust limiter, or just swap it out entirely.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-06T21:47:17Z\u0022 title=\u002208/06/2014 09:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 6, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Lei07\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EMinor rant\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
