This is a modpack which includes stockalike rockets, which are (a little) based on real world rockets, but with the KSP-Touch on them.\n\n* * *\n\nOn the beginning, I was working on only one stockalike rocket, but making it was quite funny, so I packed that into this project. As the name says, the goal of this project is to add (more or less) stockalike rockets, which are partly based on real world rockets.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
