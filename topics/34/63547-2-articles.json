They mean that at 0m/s the engine produces half the thrust compared to the thrust produced at 1000m/s *but* if you watch the fuel flow rate when transitioning between these velocities on a test flight in KSP, you will see that that although the thrust changes by a factor of 2, the fuel flow rate doesn\u0027t change at all. That means, using a real world definition of specific impulse, the specific impulse has also changed by a factor of 2 but the game does not report this to the player. The game will tell you the engine is achieving the same specific impulse in both circumstances, even though they differ by a factor of 2 by definition.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpecific impulse is thrust/mass flow rate so if you double the thrust without changing the mass flow rate, specific impulse should double.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn other words, at 0m/s the specific impulse is only half what the game is claiming (or only 8x greater instead of 16x greater once you take its poor handling of intake air in isp calculations into account).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-25T01:55:36Z\u0022 title=\u002202/25/2014 01:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 25, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Fractal_UK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"camlost","CreatedById":57590,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-25T02:03:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EReally?
