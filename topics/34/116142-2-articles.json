If so, and I was really desperate to get it working 100%, couldn\u0027t I just run a MM patch that changes problem engines to all one type?

I think you\u0027d probably have to do some integration with the StockBugFix mod. (I\u0027m pretty sure authority and response rate are unlocked by that mod rather than being a stock feature.)\n\nI mainly work with space- and airplane designs. Since 1.0.x added stock \u0022flaps\u0022, it been relatively useful to use control surfaces as such (mainly on re-entry and landing for me.) But I also use an autopilot system (PilotAssistant). It sometimes get jittery (high velocity and all), so I find myself adjusting control authority on the (literal) fly to compensate. It\u0027d be nice to have action group control instead. (Especially for a recent design I made that has an extra set of multi-use control surfaces. I change their purpose as the flight demands: fixed flaps, extra pitch, extra roll, airbrake.)"},{"CreatedByName":"Deimos Rast","CreatedById":157420,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-23T21:52:24Z","Content":"[@Diazo](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/81549-diazo/) I know you said you\u0027re done till 1.1, but could you maybe take another peak at integration with GPOSpeedFuelPump sometime down the line? No real rush, but it doesn\u0027t quite work 100% it would seem.\n\n- Adjusting Pump Level Increments works\n- Toggling Balances Doesn\u0027t Work\n- Toggling Pumping Doesn\u0027t Work\n\nTo be clear, I\u0027m talking about the [@hab136](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/75997-hab136/) [version](https://github.com/henrybauer/GPOSpeedPump/releases). He\u0027s not technically the official maintainer, just to be clear, just a helpful individual who fixed it up. I realize that may complicate things, and if I wasn\u0027t clear about that in the beginning, I apologize (I mentioned it briefly, but wasn\u0027t clear).\n\nAnd....the forum ate the rest of my post. Basically, I asked about the file \u0022GPOSpeedFuelPump.actions\u0022 and if adjusting values in there would change things in game for the better (my guess is no).\n\n(Also, how does your \u0022part.cfg\u0022 work?

I can look into StockBugFix and see if I can add it through that to stock, it looks like that feature is already present if FAR is installed but I couldn\u0027t find it in stock so it got left out.\n\n[@Deimos Rast](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/157420-deimos-rast/) As far as I can tell, the current version is working with GPO Pump, the issue I think you are running into is that the right-click part menu does not refresh until you reopen it so you have to right-click the part again after activating the action group to get the new status of the part.\n\nHaving said that, [version 1.1b here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6-5UOjSWq7bZG1MOXlUZ3Bsbnc/view?usp=sharing) adds code to force the refresh of the right-click part window so it should now update automatically to display the new status of the part. (If this resolved your issue, I\u0027ll push it to release. Just want to make sure it actually fixes your issue first.)\n\nI don\u0027t use a versioning file in my mods, I print a line to the log when my mod starts inside the game to keep track of which version is running. I started modding before versioning files existed and have seen several types come and go and so I don\u0027t bother trying to keep up with what is currently being used.\n\nThe part.cfg file is a ModuleManager patch that tells KSP which parts should have the partModules from this mod, those modules are actually found in the ModuleModActions.dll file and their source code can be browsed on my GitHub.\n\nThe .action files are how I keep track of the different mods, and their actions, that I am controlling via action groups. In general these files shouldn\u0027t be touched as that will break the mod, the exception being the \u0022name = \u0022 line, this is what shows in-game on the action button and is the default for what the action name changes to (as seen in the GUI). You could change this line if you wish, just keep in mind it has to fit on the button on-screen.\n\nFor actions that have a data entry line, the \u0022data =\u0022 line is the default that will appear when you select that action. You could edit this, but you have to be careful as it has to be a number that KSP can understand and it will be that default on a go-forward basis.\n\nHope that clears things up,\n\nD.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-24T01:43:42Z\u0022 title=\u002203/24/2016 01:43  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 24, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Diazo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Svm420","CreatedById":136047,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-24T16:55:07Z","Content":"Hey [@Diazo](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/81549-diazo/) I am trying to set up 2 action groups to set the thrust limiter on 2 engines.
