It featured realistic SRB dynamics (longer=more thrust, but same duration no matter the length.) In addition, the last two seconds of the SRB were very low thrust, and when combined with the separation charges in the nose cones, would create a gorgeous realistic separation. Not to mention custom action groups, for instance the abort action, which simulated blowing out the SRB nozzle in an emergency to greatly reduce the SRB thrust.
