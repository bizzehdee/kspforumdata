Ferram mentioned that it\u0027s outside the scope of FAR, but maybe you could do something like that.\u003Cp\u003EThe animated wing module has a lot of potential, a lot of stuff could be done using it, but unfortunately, it simply doesn\u0027t work with FAR. You can already detect the presence of FAR, so would that be possible to support it\u0027s flight model Firespitter-side?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe short answer is no.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELong answer:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFAR and the FS lift code takes two very different approaches to setting up wings. Ferram is not a part creator, he aims to improve pre-existing parts with code only. This means treating the part as simply a nice visual blob, and defining everything by cfg values and creating a sort of imaginary wing that will perform how a real wing would behave if it was in that location. The model itself is irrelevant. In terms of the average point of lift on a wing (or Center of Lift), he takes a similar approach to stock lift code, saying that it\u0027s in some fixed location. In stock that is the part\u0027s center of mass (its Vector3.zero), and for FAR, it is at the CoM plus some cfg based position.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy code demands that it is running on a part created with prior intent to use the FSliftSurface, and that it contains defined Transforms (3d location objects) that tell it where the Center of Lift is. Additionally, you can have more than one CoL in a single part. There\u0027s the main CoL for the large wing structure, but there can also be other, less powerful lift attributors in ailerons, flaps etc. The trick with these are, they can move.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is important. The aileron section of the model moving and rotating alters the Angle of Attack of that lift transform, thereby creating force in a new directio, but the main wing lift remains the same. It also allows for stuff like folding wings, which PolecatEZ is playing around with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFAR does not support moving lift transforms, or multiple lifts in one part. You could not create a single part space shuttle with FAR, you could do that with FS lift (but it\u0027s incredibly difficult).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOK, so they are different, big whoop. Can I just scrap my lift code and put Ferram\u0027s better lift code into my stuff and make it support multiples and movement?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could - if I had been a bloody aerodynamics genius like Ferram. I am not. He spent years creating that code, and it is beyond what I have the knowledge and time to do. I assume that every part of his lift assumes his single point static setup. To even find out if that\u0027s true or not would require a large amount of research. These reasons are probably also why Ferram said it was out of scope. I assume he knows it requires a large rewrite.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, what can be done to alleviate the issues?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) I can try to find out why FAR reacts badly to FS lift, and reportedly goes super speed etc. This would still mean those wings would not have all the other aerodynamic properties that all other FAR wings would have on the same vessel. Like proper stalling, supersonic code etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) I can feed good info to values that FAR can read, and act upon, and update it\u0027s math from. This would mean a lot of works for Ferram.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) I can admit that my code is better than stock (and solves some very important issues), but will never be better than Ferram\u0027s, and detect when you use FAR, and shut my code down, allowing FAR to take full control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have gone for option 3. You gain all the benefits from FAR if you choose to use it, but you lose benefits that have to do with independent lift sections inside a part. There is still room to do option 1 in addition to that, if the cfg explicitly states \u0022screwFAR = True\u0022, but it requires massive amounts of testing. So then there\u0027s the question. Given a limited amount of time and inspiration, do I create new stuff, or fix something that in 90% of cases is not broken. OK, so that 10% is really cool, and at any point I may start working on anything that is \u0022really cool\u0022, but for now, no, I\u0027d rather get back to making the next stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Madrias","CreatedById":89995,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-24T07:09:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs anyone else having the problem where the props don\u0027t spin (except the PROpeller) with the new prerelease?

Luckily I just fixed it, but unfortunately that version of the plugin was also up on curseforge for a day or two. Get the working version by downloading the full release from curse now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like the features curseforge has for adding pictures and videos to the mod desciption, but the file upload and download has some issues. A user requested that I add a download for just the plugin, so I did, but then, even though it was marked Beta, it became the default download, which would be confusing for people looking for the parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I figured, what the hell, let\u0027s just throw a version up without PROpeller, but \u003Cem\u003Ewith\u003C/em\u003E the wheel alignment. So then there were non spinning propellers all around. And now, because I updated the main mod file, I can\u0027t update the plugin-only download without also uploading the main mod \u003Cem\u003Eagain\u003C/em\u003E to keep it as the default download file. I like curseforge in general, but it still needs some tinkering, and I hope their code isn\u0027t too tied up into their setups for other games that they can\u0027t easily alter the options for the kerbal version of.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will remove the plugin-only download from curse for the time being, because it will too easily be out of date.
