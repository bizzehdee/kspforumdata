It\u0027s happening in both the 64-bit and 32-bit versions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m running jsimmons\u0027 10x stock Kerbol system. There are some clipping issues with the ground. When I\u0027m dealing with kerbals walking around, or rovers, or parachute landers, it\u0027s fine - except everything (landing legs, landing gears, craft, kerbals) are about waist-deep into the ground. I\u0027ve seen this on the Mun, as well. That in itself isn\u0027t really a problem; however, landing a plane on that ground is. If I try to land an aircraft on that ground, it simply falls through like the ground isn\u0027t there, and then shortly blows up. I can still land on the runway, so it\u0027s just a question of playing the game right... But in the long run, this is a problem (I mean, how can I land on Laythe, Duna, or Eve like this?), and I\u0027m wondering what might be causing it. Is it because I don\u0027t have a high-res texture pack? I did actually install a higher-res texture of Kerbin, to make it look better, but it\u0027s not an official one, since I don\u0027t think there is one yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, yeah. I\u0027ve found that if I land on a runway, and then slowly drive a plane off onto the ground, it seems to be working fine. I also tried an experiment with a particularly easy-to-fly glider, with a takeoff velocity of ~45m/sec. I \u0022touched down\u0022 at just over 30m/sec, the bug still persisted: the plane fell through the ground and blew up. The ground also works for a little while if I\u0027m taking off and the plane runs out of runway length. As is, the game is playable, but I\u0027m wondering how to fix the issue. Maybe I should try the real solar system instead of the stock one, and see if that changes things.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-22T10:28:55Z\u0022 title=\u002208/22/2014 10:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 22, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by DracovaXIV\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
