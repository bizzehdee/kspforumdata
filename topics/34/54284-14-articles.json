Perhaps (similar to the KSPI Method by Fractal UK) there could be a background level of all materials that mining could get anywhere, but VERY slowly, taking days or weeks to get anything useful, but the hotspots shown on the Kethane styled map are the significant deposits. That way you CAN, if you really want, have a single base mine everything you need to make ships, but it is very inefficient.

Kethane is a good mod, works well, and has a nice interface. But it doesn\u0027t do everything that other modders want in resource mapping and distribution. Majiir is gradually adjusting and upgrading it, but if another modder wanted to do things differently he\u0027d have to wait for Majiir to (hopefully) make the adjustment he wanted. For example, right now Kethane can either give even distribution of material all over a planetary body or give the patches the standard mod gives, each patch being one deposit. If you wanted to have mining possible if you just moved one hex away from a \u0027mined out\u0027 hex it wouldn\u0027t work, unless laboriously mapping each planet with one hex deposits. This would do away with the random distribution. I understand Majiir is planning on making deposits work differently, hex to hex basis, but that will take time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimilarly, compare the two different methods of scanning between KSPI and Kethane. Both valid, each having different advantages and disadvantages. Standardizing on one would mean anything based on the other wouldn\u0027t work. For example Kethane is no longer utilizing the 2D pop up maps. If a modder wanted to do that he couldn\u0027t use the standard Kethane code without serious rework.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like the idea of standardizing resource definitions (hydrogen is hydrogen for different mods etc) and hope that can be done at least.
