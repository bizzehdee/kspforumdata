For the manned version, as Tygoo already made a stock-alike Dragon V2, you could maybe make a Dragonrider capsule.\n\nI know, there already is a mod that ads one, but that mod is sadly one of those un-maintained zombie-mods.

And then place files in the correct folders.\n\nLoving the mod, looks very good.\n\nI had a weird bug/issue when using the shrouded panels, when under aerodynamic stress the focus of the camera would drift away from the centre of the craft. Couldn\u0027t not grab the log.\n\nIf they keep acting up I suppose you could make the shrouds into separate parts and connect them with nodes at the sides of the truck that you could decouple. However you would need to change the heat shield decouple function of the trunk to the shield. \n\nBut the non shrouded ones work fine, the only thing I would say I am missing is a nose cone.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-23T18:34:25Z\u0022 title=\u002205/23/2015 06:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by 4nxs**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mekan1k","CreatedById":48750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T18:28:04Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E It\u0027s a Dragon party got 2 more dragon mods but one throws errors and well not sure where, I put the other [https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/72893034/UFO/screenshot10.png](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/72893034/UFO/screenshot10.png)\n\nWhich dragon is the middle on?
