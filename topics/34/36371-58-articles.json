Before the updates (the game, then the mods) I was able to use procedural fairing easily it always automatically adjusted for the height of this stack and then I would strap it with struts and away I would go. Well today after spending a whole day working on the mods, and setting up modulemanager files for a bunch of stuff, I had previously fixed in the original files, which was before I knew about module manager and exactly what it did, I finally got to sit down and play with the game, on my fresh and new campaign mode, that I hope will not have to be restarted yet again when the next update hits. ANYWAYS... I use three monitors so I had to shrink this down a bit to be able to be seen, but the faring guides are ending at the top of the second satellite. I can manually make the faring wider at the bottom and it will eventually go up over the top of the stack but then the rocket literally looks like a mushroom. Before I had used the inter stage faring adapter between each of the sats, but I thought that that would put a struts at that location and act as a decoupler but I think I was mistaken, so I have removed those in hopes of fixing the problem but to no avail. Does anyone know what the cause of it would be? I saw that the update notes said that it wasn\u0027t tracking to the parent parts I don\u0027t know if that is the problem, I doubt it because others would be complaining. So I have either done something wrong or there is a mod that is messing with PF but I don\u0027t know which one it would be, I know a lot of people use it with a ton of other mods so..... please help, and thanks for the help that is incomming!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Pdm4D2g.jpg?2\u0022 alt=\u0022Pdm4D2g.jpg?2\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-03T07:40:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ee-dog, good to see you!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hate to nag, but I wondered: what is the status of fully-procedural (i.e. like the interstage) payload fairing base rings?
