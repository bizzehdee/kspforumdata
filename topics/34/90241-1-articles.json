(Thanks, guys.) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh well. It\u0027s nothing that will stop me from continuing my line of work. I\u0027ve already built a photovoltic-propelled vehicle with enough energy to last for days, and none of them know how it works. But today, I did something else interesting...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have been studying my Ion engine after the... incident with the coffee machine. It has well been corrupted, but I wanted to salvage the hardware to make a new one. I\u0027ve kept the equipment necessary for ionization intact, and decided to play around with some math. After hours of calculation regarding the koulomb law (I know it\u0027s Coulomb, but as a kerbal, it\u0027s Koulomb), I thought to develop an insulated heating device with a small vent for letting heat out to get the Xenon atoms hot, and packed with energy. Inside this vent it a small thermocouple, which takes advantage of the heat levels by converting it to energy, so you wont need to worry about energy as much. That\u0027s not all this improvement has to offer. The biggest improvement to this engine was actually not intended. The natural tendencies of a field of high energy include expansion, even if by micrometers. This size difference, even if so small, is enough to cause any xenon currently being ionized to distribute more, thus causing a decrease in density. This decrease is enough to take off 6.1 kilograms of the overall weight. 6.1 Kilograms! That\u0027s .006 tons by the way. This allows for more Delta-V, thus allowing more windows of opportunity. Here\u0027s the best part: the whole thing was actually supposed to be heavier, but I didn\u0027t factor in the heat differences and how they can affect weight. Truly this is the most advanced Ion-drive yet. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClick here and it can be yours: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download/1ch6a277i3nbd24/advancedIonEngine.cfg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www./download/1ch6a277i3nbd24/advancedIonEngine.cfg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, implementing this is not like installing a mod, so put it in your folder named ionEngine.
