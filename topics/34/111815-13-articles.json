Are the numbers for supplies / second correct when using USI LS? It looked like all sizes of houses / agriculture modules consumed / produced the same 3 / 3.55 supplies per second (including the really huge ones). Let me know if you want to see any screenshots.  \n\nAlso, are the masses of the dome bases correct? The ones with grass seem to have lower mass than similarly sized empty ones.  \n\nSorry for all the detailed questions, I just want to built a very big city on Duna, and whatever initial domed base I start with will serve as a template for all the rest, so making a mistake will mean I need to undo everything.[/QUOTE]  \n\nAfter some testing, it looks like that ratios of stuff consumed / produced by the hydroponics modules is very much out of whack with USI LS ... Even an 8 person house will burn through tens of thousands of supplies in an hour, while the poor cultivator / composer module ends up creating something like 30 supplies per day, with inputs plentifully available. It also lists that it is under \u00220.05%\u0022 load for some reason.  \n\nAny idea how to make this work properly?

I\u0027d really hate to lose it as a resource for my regular kerbals. I think a really cool thing to do with it, would be to treat it as a science lab extension. Having a station or base with one of the structures incorporated, in conjunction with a science lab module, would provide low G natural settings where natural science could be performed by crew members. The side effect, is if Civ Pop is installed, it would also produce food, and consume whatever resources the CivPop biodome type structures consume, maybe at a rate that\u0027s a multiplier based on crewed capacity. Say, it takes a minimum of 1 crew to generate food, improve on science returns, but it only provides the max multiplier \u00F7 the crew capacity x the crew count on board the biodome/torus. It could also have a minimum crew to produce any results.  \n\nSo basically, I\u0027m proposing that using the mod on it\u0027s own would allow you to create a small boost to science if a lab module is attached, and you crew both the lab module, and the biodome/torus. If the structure is half full, you get half the science multiplier bonus. if full, you get the full science multiplier bonus.  \n\nIf CivPop is installed, it\u0027d require being manned by Crew, not civs, to operate, but would produce both the science bonuses, as well as function as a food resource for civilians, and consume the same resources civilian food production modules consume. At least that\u0027s what would appeal most to me. Creating hooks to TAC Life support and that snacks mod would also seem to be pretty cool. Seems a biodome ought to extend the viability of any long term mission by quite a bit.  \n\nI\u0027d ALSO LOVE if the torus could end up with an togglable spin animation, if that\u0027s a possible feature. the spin is the whole point of a torus.
