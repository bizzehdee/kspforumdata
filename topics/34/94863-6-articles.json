You have to put in the grunt work yourself first. Look at how much I pissed off a certain Justin Kerbice when I started modding KSP, because I made the investment he didn\u0027t, surpassed his efforts rapidly and shut him down when he tried to berate me for pursuing help when I had done the ground-work and then needed some very simple guidance (not hand-outs).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s through knuckling down and hard work that I gain respect from other excellent modders, like nightingale and magico13, who are frankly waaay better than me, because I know they know that I know that. If I can\u0027t be bothered to put in the initial investment of my own time, why should someone else give me their precious time?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-16T18:09:52Z\u0022 title=\u002205/16/2015 06:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by AlphaAsh\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EReadability\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlphaAsh","CreatedById":105348,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T12:41:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ev0.7.6\u003C/strong\u003E available from \u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/165/Kerbal%20Konstructs\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKerbalStuff\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EChangelog:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ENow supports \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/86677-1-0-2-StageRecovery-Recover-Funds-from-Dropped-Stages-v1-5-6-%285-15-15%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EStageRecovery\u003C/a\u003E.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThanks to magico13 for doing the hard work.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ECalculation of recovery distance for spent stages by StageRecovery will now be from the nearest open base (probably the base you launch from, then).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bignumbers","CreatedById":98889,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T08:04:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is amazing, I hope you figure out the bugs in making off Kerbin bases soon!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlphaAsh","CreatedById":105348,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T08:24:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bignumbers\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Bignumbers\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis is amazing, I hope you figure out the bugs in making off Kerbin bases soon!\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis particular feature request needs some serious discussion with the players.

I put in a bunch of effort getting the massive, and horribly ugly at the time, EPL parts set up, then followed by a bunch of other missions just to get the resource chain set up. It took me about a week to do this and once everything was in place I linked the whole thing together with KAS so I could supply my own rocket parts on site. At first everything went smooth, my resources were building up in preparation for my first rocket launch originating from minmus but then for some reason my launch pad vanished. I looked around for it thinking it may have slid somewhere but it was gone, so I went to retrieve a utility rover I would need to get a new one in place from another base. When I got close enough for the physics on each ship to come into play again the entire base began shaking, then Kraken\u0027d so hard it corrupted my save file. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, for me, the big appeal of something like this is that it achieves the same thing but in a far more light weight packaging. As far as I know, the buildings don\u0027t need any physics simulation so it\u0027s less of a strain on the system, so less chance of invoking the Kraken because your resource chain necessitates a dozen ships on site. If I were making this, I would make a cargo module of sorts that you ship a couple to the off planet site you want. Once you have enough within a certain radius they and the ships they are on get gobbled up to \u0022build\u0022 the base. As far as keeping immersion, if it is at all possible what I would do is make a custom building where the model looks to have elements of industry on it. Like perhaps a shaft that looks like it goes down to a mine, or a smelter and what looks like a metal working plant. I don\u0027t know how much work is involved in making new buildings, but if I could that\u0027s what I would do.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lord Aurelius","CreatedById":71687,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T17:13:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI tossed this idea out over in the Anomaly Surveyor thread and Nightingale suggested I mention it over here since it\u0027s more in the realm of Kerbal Konstructs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve seen a lot of threads asking for some kind of overarching main goal for career mode, and while Anomaly Surveyor is an amazing contract pack that provides that to some degree, it lacks replayability since it uses the Squad anomalies which are always in the same place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea is to have randomly placed anomalies (ideally generated when a new game is created rather than by contracts) so that you actually have to search for them instead of just being able to look them up somewhere or go on previous experience.

From my understanding, right now the models in Kerbal Konstructs are basically placed by hand, although from looking at the last few posts it looks like a system may be in the works (if it hasn\u0027t been implemented already) that would allow models to be placed automatically for building a base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there any interest in something like this?
