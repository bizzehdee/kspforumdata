It basically means that it will try to receive a signal from the target. If you have a self adjusting dish it\u0027ll automatically point in the direction of your target, if it is a static dish you have to point it in the right direction. When you set a target from an unloaded vehicle (for example, your relay network in orbit around Kerbin while you\u0027re messing around near Minmus) it\u0027ll automatically assume the unloaded dishes are pointed in the correct direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo to sum it up with an example: Lets say you\u0027re planning on orbiting Minmus. It is too far for omnidirectional antennas to have contact, so you have to activate the dishes. You target your craft with one of your relay satellites and you target that relay sat with the dish on your current craft. You then make sure the dish actually points in the direction of Kerbin (and thus the relay sat). If you do all the above you should make a link between the 2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo note that you can\u0027t actually do half of the things in the above example without already having contact, (kinda hard to tell the probe to open its dish when it is out of contact...) So it is pretty important that you set all this up properly. Also, if you are trying to contact something in another SoI you don\u0027t have to target the craft specifically. If you orbit minmus you can have your relay system target Minmus and your Minmus orbiter target Kerbin and it\u0027ll work just fine.

Then you have two options: give each satellite propulsion individually, or use only the main vehicle and give it extra fuel. \u003Cp\u003EIf you take the first approach, but your vehicle in an orbit with an orbital period that is a fraction of the orbit you want. Your apoapsis should be at geosynchronous altitude. For example, a geosynchronous orbit has an orbital period of 6 hours. If you get into an orbit of 2/3rds that (4 hours), you\u0027ll move 1/3rds of a geosynchronous orbit ahead every full orbit you make. Release one satellite at your apoapsis and have it burn prograde until its in a geosynchronous orbit. Wait for the transport vehicle to make a full orbit, then have it release another satellite, and have that satellite burn until it reaches geosynchronous orbit. It should be precisely 1/3rds of an orbit away from the previous satellite. Do the same thing for the last satellite. Use Kerbal Engineer to be able to see your orbital period; you can fine-tune it to a margin of error of about 0.4 seconds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second approach is similar to the first. But first you go to into an a geosynchronous altitude and release satellite number #1. Then your transport vehicle goes into the 2/3rds orbit, makes a full orbit, and burns to get back into a geosynchronous orbit, where it releases the second satellite. Repeat for the third satellite. This means you don\u0027t have to add any propulsion to the individual satellites, but you\u0027ll have to bring more fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you for your help, Kimberly.
