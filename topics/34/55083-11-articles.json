The default view is something that got in the way of my plans too, not to mention the small size of the available working area. The start node seems to be the only pre-unlocked node there is. Your best bet is to have other starting nodes not have parents, so they can be unlocked right away. I am not sure if it is TreeEdit or KSP that is in charge of drawing the links between nodes.. Either way, I must agree that the lack of control over them has been constantly frustrating for me. Your only hope for now is to learn their behaviors and try your best to work around it.
