While this has improved significantly since about KSP 0.20, they\u0027re still pretty much limp noodles without lots of struts, especially where the wheel modules connect to the normal parts. Maybe KSP 0.24\u0027s stronger joints will solve this problem by themselves. But the weakest joint in the whole assembly is between the vertical post and the bottom of the plane. Even if the individual pontoon parts stick together better, the whole assembly still needs beaucoup struts to the plane itself to keep the pontoon from skewing off and tripping the plane during takeoff. So maybe a bigger and/or stronger vertical post would help?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Pontoon Wheel Retraction Force\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen extending or retracting the pontoon wheels, the whole pontoon flexes, applying force to the rest of the plane. Without sufficient strutting, this can actually break the wings off the plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Pontoon Wheel Steering Symmetry Issue\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only way to get the wheels on opposite sides of the plane to steer the same direction (as in both left or both right) is when you 1st build the pontoon from scratch. If at some later point you accidentally disconnect and reconnect either the whole pontoon or just a section containing wheels, then steering symmetry gets broken. From this point on, the wheels on opposite sides will steer in opposite directions, so you get toe-in or toe-out, which acts as a brake and tends to twist the pontoons off the plane. The only way to cure this is to trash the existing pontoons and start them over from scratch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOtherwise, great mod \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blackheart612","CreatedById":42741,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-13T01:38:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m having trouble using texture switcher.
