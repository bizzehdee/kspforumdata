We\u0027ll never be completely rid of wobbly-rockets, since they intentionally leave some wobble in the game, but since there are no stock 5m parts, we\u0027re at the whim of how their scaling algorithm works. Struts, or KJR are always possible solutions, but my only alternative from the design side is to tell KSP that it\u0027s an even bigger diameter (say, size-5 (6.25m)), when it\u0027s not. I can certainly take another look at the gimbal range though. It\u0027s become pretty standard for the high-thrust engines to have small ranges, but I don\u0027t think it necessarily has to be that way, especially for an upper-stage cluster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like the adapter suggestions! It\u0027ll be really easy to do some scaling of the adapter plates I\u0027ve already made, to get these sizes together.

I haven\u0027t thought far enough ahead yet to say if 7.5m is something I want to add or not. It\u0027s certainly not out of the question. I would probably skip over 6.25 and go straight to 7.5, with a diameter increase of 50% over the previous, rather than 25%. Of course, the further away we get from stock, the harder it is to maintain a stock-alike balance. We\u0027d also have to think about what makes sense in terms of engine thrust in those scales. A possibility here might be to not have engine clusters at all, but rather adapters to use the other engines in the pack, or the NASA 3.75m stock engines, or something. A 4-way adapter at this scale might still allow for some hefty thrust with the existing engines.

Plus, not everyone takes the time to run the numbers, and they may experiment a bit before figuring out optimal designs.

Possibly launch-tower sized (obviously a much larger project - both coding and demanding on Ram if considered)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- fill-out adapter blanks? I had been waiting a while for the 5m-3.75m adapter (KW didn\u0027t provide) and also sometime need 5m-1.25m adapters. At the moment i need to go 5m-3.75m-1.25m in succession (KW have a 3.75m-1.25m)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this satiates any idea-hunger \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022BlackTalos\u0022 data-cite=\u0022BlackTalos\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOh and that\u0027s part of MRS is it not?\u003Cp\u003EReduce my SAS request to 5m (you\u0027ve covered 3.75m already), but the other 2 still apply =)\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, the SAS is already addressed. Yes, MRS has a 3.75m module, but SpaceY also has 5m and 3.75m radial ring-pairs similar to KW\u0027s design. Unless you want an inline one specifically for 5m. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have indeed thought about larger launch clamps. I\u0027m not sure if that\u0027s something I want to tackle yet (maybe). The stock clamps define a bunch of transforms in the \u0022LaunchClamp\u0022 module, so it\u0027s probably possible to emulate what they did, but it\u0027s also possible that they\u0027ve hardcoded some of the functionality. The config has a \u0022radial\u0022 attachment node (and I\u0027m not sure if those alter strength based on \u0022node size\u0022 like the stack nodes do), and a specified breaking strength, so I\u0027m not sure how well the strength can be altered. I\u0027ll have to experiment with it. But I agree, that would be cool. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0027re probably good on those adapter parts too, unless there\u0027s a specific arrangement that we haven\u0027t thought of yet. The next release will have the one-way 5m-\u0026gt;3.75m, 3.75m-\u0026gt;2.5m, and 2.5m-\u0026gt;1.25m sizes as flat adapters with optional fairings. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut yeah, the \u0022aeronautical\u0022 stuff I\u0027m thinking needs to be its own pack. We talked about that on the MRS thread too, and it was felt that a spaceplane pack would make sense to be separated, since not everyone who does planes cares about rockets, and vice versa.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NBZ","CreatedById":117892,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-08T20:25:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022BlackTalos\u0022 data-cite=\u0022BlackTalos\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI am guessing that the pack must focus on \u0022Vertical Rocketry\u0022?

I\u0027ve been waiting on getting this one part to work right, but due to a KSP bug, I think I\u0027m going to have to settle for a slightly simpler option.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI figured a 3.75m to 2.5 conical \u0022petal\u0022 payload bay would be useful. Similar to how the LM was stored in the Saturn V. The problem I\u0027m running into, is that when the doors are open, the upper part of the rocket is still technically attached, even though there\u0027s no visible support structure. So I was trying to add support struts that would discard (like the LVN\u0027s shroud panels, or my 0P-Fairings mod) when the upper node is disconnected. This is really simple, and I\u0027m using the \u0022ModuleJettison\u0022 capability for engine shrouds in all sorts of places without a problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell... apparently that doesn\u0027t work with an animated part. The support-struts eject as soon as you activate \u003Cem\u003EANY\u003C/em\u003E stage (such as starting your engines on the pad).

This means we just have to deal with invisible attachment between the ends of the rockets while the doors are open, if you haven\u0027t detached from above. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other caveat (like my 0P-Fairings mod), is that you need to use stack \u003Cem\u003Eseparators\u003C/em\u003E above the doors, to make sure engine shrouds don\u0027t stay stuck in place there either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately there are no perfect solutions for parts like this.
