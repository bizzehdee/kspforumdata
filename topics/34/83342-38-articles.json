I think the problem is, he focuses on the early game. I have to say, he makes it look a little dry. It\u0027s also not so much about KCT, as it is about him messing around over KSC. Yes, there is a whole lot of time warping at first, as you can\u0027t do much. I can\u0027t help but feel that KCT would have been perfect for Interstellar quest (especially as he made himself wait a week between launches!) - He actually mentions it indirectly in an early episode, then never uses it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou asked for a KCT story/testimonial so here it is:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst let me start by saying that I turn half the features off.... I always turn tech unlock off, and (until this current game) I turn off reconditioning/rollouts. Thats the great thing about KCT though, it\u0027s 100% customisable. You can waste as much, or as little time as you like. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt took me 200 days to reach Mun on my current save. I\u0027m now on day 344, and I\u0027ve got 22 flights in progress at this time, and another 5 being built. Every mission is an epic quest, a sense of accomplishment when it\u0027s completed, you\u0027ve (literally) invested days/weeks/years into each mission. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor me, it stops me being overwhelmed. I\u0027ve got all 13 available contracts on by board, each one of them is being flown/built SIMULTANEOUSLY. Who can honestly say they can work on every single contract 100% of the time in stock? KCT allows me to queue missions up, go and do something else and come back to it. It\u0027s like working a massive space program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy Story: I have a mission to deploy a space station in Minmus Orbit. The mission has 10 days left... I know it\u0027s going to take me 7 to get to Minmus, and I have never built this craft before (no parts in storage except for the launcher.) I build my craft, and KCT tells me it\u0027s going to take 2 days 4 hours to build the craft. I bump it to the top of the queue. Eventually we launch, and get to Minmus. I pull into the required orbit with 1 hour to spare! At that moment, I felt a little bit of what the guys at NASA must have felt the day they got Apollo 11 touched down on the Moon.

Sorry, but it doesn\u0027t make sense for me to keep maintaining both systems, and SR\u0027s code is better anyway. Plus, the changes in 1.0 will likely require revamping that code anyway and I\u0027d rather not do it twice (especially since KCT\u0027s version of the code is outdated). If you don\u0027t care about parachute based recovery, you won\u0027t have to use StageRecovery, so it\u0027s a soft dependency. And if you really like the flat rate system rather than SR\u0027s variable rate, SR also includes the flat rate model as an option.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) StageRecovery will get updated first, then KCT. SR has a larger userbase and simpler code, so it makes more sense to update it first. KCT will follow immediately afterward. SR should be updated within 2 days unless 1.0 forces a huge rewrite, KCT should be a few days after that, or quicker if 1.0 doesn\u0027t change too much for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anyone from Squad is reading this, I\u0027d love to get access to the Assembly-CSharp.dll and UnityEngine.dll for 1.0 early so I can sort most of this out over the weekend and before I go back to work, that way I can just make some final changes on Monday/Tuesday and get things out faster \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Svm420","CreatedById":136047,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-22T19:17:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDevs plz we\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#ffffff;\u0022\u003E(I) \u003C/span\u003Eneed this!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks magico for being an amazing dev!
