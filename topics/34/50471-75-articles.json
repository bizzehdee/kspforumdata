I... overbuilt.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m tempted to use it to launch an interplanetary mission to Mars using nothing but solids. The problem is that the current design needs to be rebuilt to reduce part count. I\u0027m going to look into welding together a bunch of the engines on the main core, since there are 19 RS68A 4x clusters down there; I think I can merge the center 7 into a single block (since it isn\u0027t needed for roll) and the remaining 12 can be put into 4 groups of 3. On the second stage I also want to merge each of the 3 trios of M-1s into a single engine to reduce part count further. Then I need to look at the boosters and see if I can use a single sep motor for each rather than the two that a currently use. I might look into merging the ground-lit solids together to try cutting it down to 12 solids lit at launch to 6, with corresponding reductions in the part count for decouples, nosecones and sep motors. I\u0027ll get rid of the tiny hydrolox fuel tanks that I keep in the nosecone of each of those for some minor fuel crossfeed so that I can scrap the fuel lines. Then I think I\u0027ll need to work out a much larger RCS block for the upper stage so that it has the ability to orient itself during a coast phase, since currently there are a stupid number of RCS blocks on it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m actually not planning any missions with that currently. It\u0027s just too unwieldy to fly due to the part count, since at launch I\u0027m running at 30% full speed.

Combining the 12 ground-lit solids into 6 solids reduced part count to 153 and increased clearance during separation, but caused issues on the pad during load and looked less awesome, so I\u0027m not going to do that unless it seems absolutely necessary.
