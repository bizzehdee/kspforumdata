If not, I think I have a google account and I would imagine that google docs supports spreadsheets. If you know of anything else I could use, let me know. I actually have a bunch of numbers written down (they\u0027re not entirely accurate as it depended on how close to the tanks depleting entirely I hit ESC to pause and interpreting the altimeter between heights, but they work as rough figures) and need to do a few more tests to get a better range of data. I used the KW rocketry parts as a basis (along with the stock ones) for setting the figures, and I attempted to make the engines somewhat purposeful so that people aren\u0027t just using the strongest one all the time - some are better in the thicker atmosphere, some are better in a vacuum, some are equally good throughout but weaker and would serve nicely as an intermediary stage for establishing LKO and stuff like that. I haven\u0027t really tested the lander engines, but if everything else works out then they should be fine. The NERVA engine and the NP Aerospike were kind of tricky and I just sort of guessed, but they seem okay for now, though the NERVA might be OP if it\u0027s used solely for injection stages. They seem to fall in line with the numbers I got from KW (tested them along with the stock ones using the same parameters as the NP engines), but even then the KW stuff feels a bit OP to me, but I\u0027m also pretty efficient with my burns and fuel usage so it\u0027s really hard to gauge and I don\u0027t want to underpower stuff. I also did the Silisko Edition engines and tanks since Nova said he wasn\u0027t going to work on that pack anymore either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI need to go through in a little bit and do the radial thrusters/boosters now. I\u0027ve done all the engines for the main tanks, and am considering redoing the SRBs. I redid all the tank masses and engine weights so they were in line with the stock parts, using some leeway for making them heavier/lighter based on better ISP values (I think I increased NERVA by like 2.5x or something) and gimbaling. I also changed some stuff where it looked like it was perhaps a typo (mostly with the 1.75m engines) in regards to gimbaling. I\u0027m also thinking of going through and changing the text to give the players a bit more of an idea about what each engine is meant for since ISP values aren\u0027t 100% straightforward for the average person. I went and looked up some info on wikipedia and asked on the subreddit and got a decent response before I really started messing with them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, sorry for the little ramble, but I figured I\u0027d be thorough since you had a hand in creating some of the parts in the pack. I can toss together a spreadsheet somehow maybe in a few hours. I want to take a break from testing for a bit, figure out how I\u0027m going to test them in vacuum, and do some work on the radial engines. Right now I\u0027ve only tested them by each engine lifting the same tank/pod up and recording altitude/velocity/time for depleting the fuel and then altitude/time at AP when firing straight up. For atmospheric testing I\u0027ll probably toss them onto something to get them to like 100km orbit with mechjeb and dump everything except for the control tank/pod and the engine. For the radial thrusters I\u0027ll probably put them in 4x symmetry and test them the same way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut yeah, give me a few hours (It\u0027s 5:18 EST now, maybe at like 10:00 EST?) to get some stuff together and I should have something for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I\u0027ve posted what I did so far over on the subreddit, so you can take a look if you want; it should be on the front page.

As an example, there are two SRBs with 600 thrust and 3 SRBs with thrusts of 350, 300, and 320. If I include the Silisko Edition SRBs, that makes for 3 SRBs with 600 thrust and adds another with 250.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that\u0027s just clutter and repetition with parts, as we already have stock boosters of 250 and 400 thrust, with more likely to come in the .17 update. I think the SRB you are referring to has a thrust of 80 and I was planning on keeping that (though editing the weight and time of burn to be more appropriate), but I could possibly rescale it to be slightly smaller, but I\u0027d have to think of re-texturing it at that point as I don\u0027t want people to be confused. I could just go with matte white, but that\u0027s kind of boring.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the time being, there are radial SRBs in the NP pack (which I\u0027ll also be tweaking) that burn at 50 thrust for 20 seconds you could easily .cfg edit to work for you. If there\u0027s a place for one of the larger SRBs to be like a 100 thrust for a long period, then I\u0027ll consider making the 80 thrust one something like 50, but I don\u0027t know if I feel it\u0027s necessary with the existence of the radial boosters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI gotta send Nova a PM and see if there\u0027s anyone else I need a nod of approval from to link the download on the forums.
