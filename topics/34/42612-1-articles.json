First, there\u0027s plenty of time to fiddle with the maneuver node at that point in the tutorial (I think it\u0027s about half an hour or so out.) You can also zoom in when dragging the node around the orbit to make even smaller adjustments. Second, it\u0027s rather easy to be too soon or to late on the braking maneuver, or not precisely hitting the target retrograde marker when braking - all that will increase the closest approach distance again.

First, there\u0027s plenty of time to fiddle with the maneuver node at that point in the tutorial (I think it\u0027s about half an hour or so out.) You can also zoom in when dragging the node around the orbit to make even smaller adjustments. Second, it\u0027s rather easy to be too soon or to late on the braking maneuver, or not precisely hitting the target retrograde marker when braking - all that will increase the closest approach distance again. So instead of 5 km, you\u0027ll end up with like 7 or 8 or even 10.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI executed my inclination burn a little sloppy so I couldn\u0027t get it below two with just using the prograde (and retrogade). These days I can get them within one or two most of the time but in my early days I often settled on anything below ten kilometre before burning towards the target because I just didn\u0027t really have the skill to get it any lower.

You say to burn towards the target marker to move towards the target, and to burn retrograde to brake, and to repeat steps 1-3 until you are close.
