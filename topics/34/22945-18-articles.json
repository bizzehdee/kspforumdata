I forget exactly who I was talking to, another programmer who wanted to join in. I bowed out when KMP was released. Being as KMP uses KLF as a codebase, the idea was let the bugs get hashed out with KMP, then take KMP\u0027s code, strip features down until you essentially get KLF, and there ya go, new KLF using KMP as a codebase. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELong story short, I can appreciate KLF in a new light. **** happened, and now i\u0027m operating off of an i5 laptop instead of a beast mode desktop, and I will be for some time. KMP will lag lower end computers to hell and back, KLF doesn\u0027t. Half of the time your not interacting with anyone else or their crap directly anyway in KMP. I admit, my enthusasium for KMP overshadowed how awesome KLF is, and that KLF just works, cleanly for the most part. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have the time, and I need to stay up to date with C# anyway. I would prefer someone else take lead, and i\u0027ll help out as much as possible, but if not, I can take over the project for the time being. Aside from getting it working in .23, there are a lot of little features here and there I would like to add that wouldn\u0027t be all that difficult. Even if you don\u0027t want to take over lead, I could really use another programmer on this. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe immediate problems(non code) we ran into a few months ago was forum permissions. As far as I know SodiumEyes has directly stated that he\u0027s done with the project, so I / someone else needs to get that in writing (or forum message) along with his permission to take over the project (atleast temporarily) and make edits to the main page and/or create a new thread; and that permission letter needs to get sent to a forum admin. Anyway, these things can be hashed out later. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etldr; i\u0027m capable and willing to take over the project, but could really use another programmer to take lead or if not just help out here and there, bounce ideas etc. Even if your not a programmer, I would prefer to not be a one man army on this project lol. I\u0027ll check back here often and see what\u0027s going on with it.
