However, Felbourn, you\u0027re using an average Isp rather than the vacuum Isp for the first stage. Vacuum Isp for Lox/Hydyne on the A7 engine is 265s. That takes you up to 4586 on the core. Next, the Baby Sergeants are indeed 235s in vacuum. I have 130kg for the 3x cluster, wet, otherwise the weights check. You can cross-check component masses with RO\u0027s FASA configs, which are correct.\u003Cp\u003EYou might be able to squeak by on ~9000 for a very low-perigee orbit, which you should just make. Also note that gravity losses will be quite low because you launch directly to apogee and then fire your solids at apogee, so time-to-orbit is a good few minutes shorter than many launches.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003EWe\u0027ll be 235 at ground.
