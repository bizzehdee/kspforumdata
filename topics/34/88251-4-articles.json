How you created the possibility for a universe full of star systems for exploration and exploitation while circumventing the memory problems of having more than one system loaded is really quite something. I really like the idea of simulating the formation of star systems as well, for example arriving in a system during heavy bombardment or maybe when some planetory chrashes are imminent! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the simulation taking time ... how about you let the travel to different star systems take time as well so that the calculation could run in the background in the meantime? I am thinking of having some kind of starmap that you randomize with a seed the first time you open it, that shows the star systems around but only the distance they are away. Now you can pick one and observe it for some time to get additional information like star type/age, likeliness to have planets of maybe even lets you spot some planets ... or you just chose a ship to go there. So when you activate the warp the ship vanishes from the system and appears as a dot on the star map, along with the time it will take to arrive in the target system. So during the travel/observation time your system creation could take place in the background and when the ship arrives you can use the star map to switch systems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis whole thing could be way out of scope, but travel taking time would add some sense of achivement that instantaneous arrival is lacking and maybe make other things possible, like the first part of the warp journey taking place in the system and only vanishing to the star map when reaching a certain distance from the system\u0027s star as well as arriving at the border of the target system; making the warp drive consume fuel, as well as diffrent versions of them with different speeds, etc. .... All would definitively add to make interstellar travel more difficult/rewarding.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"English Mobster","CreatedById":92865,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-08T22:13:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022_Augustus_\u0022 data-cite=\u0022_Augustus_\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt was PlanetShine, DistantObject, and Kerbol Positioning system that caused the problems.\u003Cp\u003EAlso:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou should at least have the mass and radius change, if not the color of the stars.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd you could just have a smaller star orbit the primary, no barycenter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd finally, clouds still apply to the new bodies and all ships/asteroids come to the new system..\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAh, okay.

I\u0027ll try to look for a way to implement something like it at a later date, but I\u0027m somewhat concerned that I won\u0027t have the tools available to do so.

I\u0027d generate galactic coordinates from each system\u0027s seed. I would need to make sure these coordinates are always unique, but that shouldn\u0027t be terribly difficult. I would populate the starmap with a few systems with randomly-generated seeds, but if you wanted to type in your own seed you could travel there and the star would appear on your starmap.

I have some catching up to do, looks like.\u003Cp\u003EHmm. I\u0027ll have to consider it. The idea behind having users type their own seed is to create Minecraft-esque \u0022infinite\u0022 systems. Someone can type anything they want into the RNG, and a system will be generated from that seed. When you limit the seeds to A, B, C, A1, A2, etc., you still have people exploring the same systems, even if the number of these systems grows exponentially.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt does add some additional exploration to the game, but nowhere near the level that can be achieved if a player can type their own seed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do have to say that I love the design. I\u0027ll try to look for a way to implement something like it at a later date, but I\u0027m somewhat concerned that I won\u0027t have the tools available to do so. I would basically have to create my own scene containing a list of all the systems, and I\u0027m not sure how much of that is doable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I were to have a starmap, I\u0027d like for some sort of hybrid approach to the two systems. I\u0027d generate galactic coordinates from each system\u0027s seed. I would need to make sure these coordinates are always unique, but that shouldn\u0027t be terribly difficult. I would populate the starmap with a few systems with randomly-generated seeds, but if you wanted to type in your own seed you could travel there and the star would appear on your starmap. Each person would get different randomly-generated seeds, but if they found a seed they really liked they would be able to share it with their friends and everyone would see the same system with the same coordinates.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would need to look into the exact implementation a little bit more before I can make any promises. However, if I were to implement something like a starmap, that\u0027s likely how I would do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, as far as progress is concerned:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m basically done crushing bugs. Adding all this saving and loading made everything an order of magnitude more complex, so it\u0027s likely that the next release would have a few more bugs I didn\u0027t catch. I think I\u0027ve gotten most of them, but there\u0027s a few I haven\u0027t been able to replicate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now, however, I\u0027m having issues entering the SOI of a body.
