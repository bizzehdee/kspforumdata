It\u0027s possible they may need to stick out the sides slightly, and/or require narrowing the bells a little, but it should be doable. When building a clustered engine, it\u0027s easier to pack them in closer together than you can with just the attachment nodes for existing standard-diameter engines.

I didn\u0027t realize how close together some of the numbers were until seeing your charts above, NBZ. I don\u0027t mind so much with the M5 vs KS-25x4, since the M5 is an upper-stage engine and isn\u0027t competing for precisely the same niche. But having the R1 identical to the KR-1x2 LFB? What I\u0027m tempted to do here is boost the R-series engines as a result, but maybe not all the way up to the average of around 2800. If we went to 2400 (still under the KR-2L, but above the stock 2.5m engines), for example, the R5 would be 12k, which is a reasonable number at this scale I think. And then that circles me back to wanting to boost the Moas as well, so as not to widen the gaps. And again, if we went with something a little less than the average, maybe 900 for the M1, we could put the M5 in the 4000-4500 ballpark, and the M9 in the 8000-ish range. (right now the M5 has a lower thrust than 5/9 of the M9, making up for it with better ISP). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis could let us try it out and see how these changes affect things, before (maybe) going higher (or not). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have the K1 bumped up to 425 already for the next update.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI added your idea for comparison.

Get down to 3m/s and it lands fine. Having multiple legs on one part absolutely restricts it to simple animation, without shock absorbers though. That is, you can\u0027t use the \u0022landing leg\u0022 module in a part that has more than one leg built in. They have to be individual. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m still looking into adding shock absorbers on individual legs though (like the extending feet in the images above).

The back end of the smaller nozzles are almost half submerged in the semi-sphere, and the larger ones less-so, but still have a wide intersection. There\u0027s always room for tweaking of course. I may let people play with it a little before making further changes on it. Same with the thrust numbers, of course. I wanted to start with low numbers and then bump it up if needed, so we\u0027ll just need some experimental feedback. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NBZ\u0022 data-cite=\u0022NBZ\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDid you check out the comments?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you still cannot make it work, try \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/private.php?do=newpm\u0026amp;u=74339\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Econtacting BahamutoD\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, I read through the whole thread.

That should be fuelTank1-2 as the part ID, not fuelTank2-2. The model loads but not the texture, so I\u0027m on the right track, but have an error somewhere still\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Fixed it, see second image. At the time that the model is loaded by KSP, there has to be a texture present, or else the entry doesn\u0027t exist for MM\u0027s \u0022model\u0022 block to replace the texture with. So either the texture has to exist in the same directory as the model, or else a dummy placeholder does (presumably a 1x1 image might be OK here). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut yeah, I think KSP still loads the models and textures from the stock parts too, so this would be additional memory usage.
