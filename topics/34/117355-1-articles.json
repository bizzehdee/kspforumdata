It adds 1 gas giant, 8 planets, and 3 moons. I have created biomes for each of body, and have taken some liberties with Barney, Slade, and Joker as the original stars they were orbiting I decided not to include as I didn\u0027t feel it necessary and I think they were more examples than anything else. I put Barney in a far orbit around the sun, with Slade and Joker as it\u0027s two moons. I\u0027m not certain I\u0027ll keep them there, but it will work for now. Some of you may notice there is no Moonar. I was going to include it as well but realized it was a rather poor quality planet and I think it was just a quick example thrown together by Krag so I decided not to include.\n\nI have done rather extensive testing on these planets and I think they are rather stable but may need some tweaking here or there. I have also tried to do my best to make them as accurate to the originals as I could get them. This has been many many hours of work involved with this project and I hope someone can enjoy the fruit of my labor.\n\nRequires Kopernicus found here [https://github.com/BryceSchroeder/Kopernicus/releases/tag/beta-02-4](https://github.com/BryceSchroeder/Kopernicus/releases/tag/beta-02-4)\n\n**Download**\n\n[http://spacedock.info/mod/238/Sentar%20Expansion](http://spacedock.info/mod/238/Sentar%20Expansion)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Also, it was much more spherical which is realistic; this much ablation would mean its orbit would be unstable and the body would be gone in a matter of centuries. It was jagged on the order of several metres, with a specific ground texture.\n\nBorisbee, if you can, use the original maps. I presume you used the stuff visible from the map view. It was the map view that was supposed to look like the actual view.\n\nBTW, the scatter is very nice, too bad it can\u0027t be set to be more depleted at the ablated zone.\n\n**error #2:** Ablate is not tidally locked to Kerbol.\n\nThis would not make it ablated, so the whole concept is lost.\n\nThis is a view from close to its most ablated region. Kerbol can not set on a world tidally locked to it. It will only wobble if the body\u0027s inclination is different from 0\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0.\n\n![954F6AF6F4C991588656C5C1F257B2AAF0A0011F](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/449584410174617613/954F6AF6F4C991588656C5C1F257B2AAF0A0011F/)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-05T03:05:24Z\u0022 title=\u002208/05/2015 03:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by lajoswinkler**"},{"CreatedByName":"Borisbee","CreatedById":91794,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T08:46:45Z","Content":"lajoswinkler thanks for the feedback. \n\nIn the above pictures when you say \u0022before\u0022 do you mean original planetfactory mod or a previous version of my mod? I will say that Ablate is very difficult to get correctly. Simply taking the original files and copying them in kopernicus doesn\u0027t work due to a number of issues so I had to try to work around them. The scaledspace I don\u0027t think is ever going to match up perfectly with the actual body due to how the flatten mod works. The flatten is applied after the prefab so Kopernicus isn\u0027t aware that the planet should be smoothed in scaledspace. I do want to try to get as best I can though because Ablate and Inaccessable are the two most interesting planets and a main reason why I decided to try to recreate the pack.\n\nAblate not being tidally locked is a simple screwup on my part and I\u0027ll get that fixed.\n\nAs far as the other planets not appearing, not sure what could be causing that. I did plan to upload a small change to move barney\u0027s orbit a bit inward so it\u0027s not overlapping with OPM so I\u0027ll take a look and double check everything.\n\nUnfortunately I just noticed this as I was heading off to bed so I\u0027ll have to take a look at it later when I wake up.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-05T08:49:24Z\u0022 title=\u002208/05/2015 08:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Borisbee**"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T13:35:05Z","Content":"No problem.
