Then your engines wouldn\u0027t have Isps of 400 or so (On an SRB in Vacuum); and you can still use stock (or KW, or NovaPunch etc) parts. It would be a universal fix for ALL parts with Module FuelTank, so you don\u0027t have to make special configs for every part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the engines, unless I\u0027m mistaken, are underpowered from real life, correct?
