Do you have a reference to that? My understanding is that the craft was oriented with its own internal gyro\u0027s and that the Capsule only had control over it while Docked. Anyhow, even if there was some relay between them it was at very short range (not more than a few miles). Gemini capules didn\u0027t exactly have massive battery array\u0027s or extensive solar power to drive any long term kind of communication relay, which is a lot different from what the Command capability in RT2 is intended to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think leaving it as is would probably be more realistic.
