Hopefully somebody can help out.\n\nI\\\u0027ve got them to produce electricity, But it only seems the actual panel I laid to wants to actually work. As in the others added by the symmetry feature don\\\u0027t register, They produce no power even though their deployed. And it dosent\\\u0027 seem to actually take into account how much sunlight its getting either, Its 100% efficient when deployed and 0% when undeployed, No inbetweens.\n\nI\\\u0027ve tried adding the line of code in the OP alone and not changing the module, This gives the above results, Changing the module to part makes them unanimated (As i was expecting it to) changing the module to SolarPanels\\_adv\\_PowerTech like the dynavolt panels, That gives two efficiency windows in the little right click menu yet still only one panel wants to work, And it dosen\\\u0027t seem to be producing the number I\\\u0027m telling it to at all. I\\\u0027ve got one small weak panel and one large powerful panel reporting the same efficency of something like .325. And the other window (The one you added i think) is telling me i\\\u0027m getting 2.8, the number I set it for, So I\\\u0027m not even sure what the hell is going on there.\n\nSomebody lend me a hand please, this is starting to drive me mad here haha. I feel I\\\u0027m so close to getting it all worked out.\n\nEdit : :\\\u0027( Now it seems their working in symmetry, Except this one that is half shadowed, which i can live with. I\\\u0027ll edit this again if i ever fully understand what is going on haha. Still, Help would be appreciated. I\\\u0027m very confused by the efficiency \u0026 current energy gain readouts atm. Are they two totally different things?\n\nEdit 2 : Okay so it seems that there is a fine point of angle as to where the panels will decide to work. The panel can be covered in sunlight, But as long as the base of the panel isn\\\u0027t in sunlight then it registers as 0 efficiency. As soon as i align a spacecraft to be in the perfect position as to give sunlight onto the base of the panels it snaps up to 100%. Is this just something with the kosmos panels or is this something new you added in? I feel like it\\\u0027s not recognizing the shape of the unfolded panel and instead seems to use the amount of sunlight on the undeployed model to determine its power output.\n\nIf it is something to do with the kosmos panels I can live with it, But it just seems weird to me that it wouldn\\\u0027t take into account the shape of the unfolded panel, I feel I\\\u0027m missing something on your plugins\\\u0027 end. Might be wrong though and this could all be a product of the Dynasat plugin. Also, Solar buddy 2000 Dosen\\\u0027t seem to do anything for me."}]}
