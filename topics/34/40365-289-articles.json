There is *NO SUCH THING* as \u0022base\u0022 heat dissipation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour radiators dissipate heat based entirely on their temperature (like a hot piece of metal giving off heat as it glows- which is basically what your unupgraded radiators are- glowing pieced of metal). As it happens, there is a \u0022background\u0022 temperature, which is the coldest they can get- but it\u0027s not a true \u0022base\u0022 heat giveoff in any sense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe hotter your radiators get, the more heat they dissipate. If they were at absolute zero (zero degrees Kelvin- the coldest any object can get), they would giveoff absolutely no heat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe radiators dissipate heat according to a real-life physics law, and actually, the unupgraded radiators perform BETTER than they should relative to the upgraded ones- the Emissivity Coefficient of graphene (upgraded) radiators should be *higher* than that of metal (unupgraded) radiators- but KSP-I gives them exactly the same emissivity instead...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, you only will notice the difference in heat radiation when you are using upgraded reactors. The reason you are noticing the large difference is because you are using extremely, extremely hot reactors with low-tech radiators that can\u0027t safely reach a fraction of the reactor temperature. Use better radiators and don\u0027t complain about it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe upgraded reactors are meant to be used with the upgraded radiators. It\u0027s perfectly understandable that you didn\u0027t know this when you posted, but *please* don\u0027t complain that it\u0027s \u0022unbalanced\u0022 and ask for the mod to be made less realistic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I\u0027ve already pointed out in my previous posts, there are more than enough realism issues with the upgraded radiators under-performing their actual real-life counterparts (graphene radiators\u0027 emissivity should be higher than their metal cousins), the ISRU system incorrectly making exothermic reactions such as the Sabatier Reaction *cost* large quantities of electricity when they should actually be self-sustaining and capable of *producing* small amounts of electricity, and basic-level fusion reactors outperforming what you might expect from first-generation fusion reactors (the upgraded fusion reactors do match expected performance for later-generation fusion reactors well, however). The last thing this mod needs is more inaccuracies, as awesome and fun to play as it is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S. For those of you not familiar with the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, any body that does not absorb 100% of the incident radiation hitting it is known as a GREY BODY rather than a BLACK BODY. Any normal metal is going to be a grey body, for instance- whereas graphene rather closely approaches an idealized black body. The equation for a GREY BODY is:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJ = E * S * T^4\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhere:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJ = the Emissive Power. Basically the total heat-giveoff per unit time. What we mean when we say how much heat is radiated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EE (Epsilon) = the EMISSIVITY CONSTANT. This is between 0 and 1 for any GREY BODY, but is 1 for a BLACK BODY.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ES (Sigma) = Stefan\u0027s Constant. This is a mathematical/physical constant that you guys really don\u0027t need to know for these purposes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ET = Absolute Temperature (in degrees Kelvin). Note that it is raised to the FOURTH POWER- so if you double temperature, you get 16 times the heat-giveoff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to understand this equation for yourself, Wikipedia does a decent job explaining it: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan%E2%80%93Boltzmann_law\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan%E2%80%93Boltzmann_law\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-03T03:58:49Z\u0022 title=\u002203/03/2014 03:58  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 3, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WaveFunctionP","CreatedById":104784,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-03T04:19:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m a junior physics major.

This is also avalible on the wiki. While it would be ideal for this to be directly visable in game for now it is what it is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would also counter your argument about the values negitively impact experience by instead arguing that it presents a design challenge and a very real choice on what to prioritize. Out of the box if you have base fission and generators you have radiators that work just fine. If you choose to upgrade generators first without upgrading generators/radiators you need to over engineer your heat dissipation system to compensate for useing T1 tech to cool T2 tech. Conversely you could go the other way and realize oh with upgraded radiators I can keep this reactor from overheating with a single radiator only to realize that the radiator gets so hot you tank your generator efficiency. KSPI is more catered to having to think and experiment to find the best solution vs the base game where you can just go command pod tank engine \u0022look maw I can fly.\u0022 If anything I\u0027d say the option to deploy T1 tech instead of T2 tech after the upgrade node has been purchased is a better option than just nerfing radiators to alow sloppy design. As it is now I tend to always go generators first and deploy a ship with a dozen or so small T1 reactors into orbit studding it on docking ports so I have a stockpile of them for small power use situations later before I get the fusion node.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kidneythump","CreatedById":62038,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-03T12:21:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been trying to build a fusion tokamak powered cargo SSTO for the past 2 days now and i gotta say it really really hard, so far I barely managed to get it into the upper atmosphere, my latest candidate (6 one so far) seem very promising with it\u0027s dual 2.5 reactors and jets.

There are basically two approaches: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) You try to get out of the atmosphere as fast as you can, burning at 70 or so degrees to get maximal possible Apoapsis using air-breathing mode, and then you try to circulate your orbit using fuel (about 2kmps of deltaV, depending on the parameters of your original sub-orbital hop).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2)You try to get as much horizontal velocity as you can in air-breathing mode, until you lift your Apoapsis above the atmosphere, and then you circularize using less fuel than in 1). This one is much more difficult to perform properly, because most of the time (at least in my case) I reach a sort of \u0022equilibrium\u0022 where my pitch prevents me from dropping altitude, but the engine doesn\u0027t give enough horizontal thrust, and if I pitch down I start accelerating (slowly) but also plummeting down rather fast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo it is reasonable to just switch over to LFO once you get in such situation, since it\u0027s very likely to produce more thrust than air-breathing.

More air through engine = more thrust, especially at high altitudes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso LFO gives way more thrust than just LiquidFuel. The thrust is lowering with altitude, so once you get high enough the difference between lfo/liquid becomes more apparent.

Obviously not with 100% efficiency, the rest becomes WasteFuel (or something like that, cannot remember the right name). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo get rid of the unprocessable nuclear waste, you can utilise various thing, eg. decouple-able tanks (fill them, drop them), dock with another ship and transfer the waste, or install TAC Fuel Balancer which lets you dump any kind of \u0022fuel resource\u0022 directly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003Ethe first two options require the waste to be pumpable around the ship, I haven\u0027t played with fission for a while so I\u0027m not sure if that\u0027s true\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WaveFunctionP","CreatedById":104784,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-04T01:55:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can start all of fusion reactors with any ec source with a large enough capacity. I usually add ec to the generators and/or transmitters in the VAB (they always start with 0, but you can tweak 1000 into them), add one 2.5 stackable battery, and/or put some large batteries on the docking clamps. The biggest issue is it must be large enough to click multiple times because many time it takes 2 or 3 clicks to start the reactor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe current ship I\u0027m working starts 5 3.5 fusion reactors with only a single 2.5 battery stack.
