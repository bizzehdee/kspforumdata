In the bottom right, it looked like Bill was on my command pod and I had the 2 emergencies as well.\u003Cbr\u003E\nOn recovery however, I noticed Bill was still on the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E station somehow. Confused, I swapped over to it and he was nowhere in terms of the little displays, but manifest said he\u0027s on the ship. I couldn\u0027t EVA him out. Transferring him to another seat DID make him show up and get replicated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I reloaded my quicksave from right after undocking, and tried to force Bill to eva using the seat transfer.\u00A0 Suddenly, one of the emergencies disappeared from the pod and so I reloaded again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI got it to \u0022work\u0022 by using roster management to unassign the 2 emergencies, then bill. I went back to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E.

So I unassigned him as well (the 2 emergencies became \u0022tourists\u0022 as expected from kerbal health with no deaths, Bill was 3 days off that state)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPossible causes:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEarlier, I forgot to add a docking port onto my station so I added a double port to the new module. I moved Bill into a 2.5 service module and closed the doors on him to avoid him drifting apart. Then, aligned, I undocked the second docking port from the new module, swapped to Bill, entered stock construction mode and slapped the port onto the appropriate node, swapped back to the new module and docked it in. Finally, I returned Bill to the station thru EVA.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis was before I installed the mod though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt appears that the issue persists and I found a way to reproduce it:\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n0. Use \u0022Realistic Transfers\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\n1. Have a station of multiple station-defined parts docked together (hitchiker, cupolas, research) with a similar module.\u003Cbr\u003E\n2.

Dock a \u0022ship\u0022 to it all\u003Cbr\u003E\n4.\u00A0 In the Transfer Window, use \u0022Vessel Mode\u0022 and try to transfer from \u0022Ship\u0022 to one of the station modes or vice versa.\u003Cbr\u003E\n5. Transfer 2-4 kerbals at once, both vessels have enough to support the numbers in a single habitat.\u003Cbr\u003E\n6. The kerbals appear against a black background on xfer, and IVA show pitch blackness as well.\u003Cbr\u003E\n7.
