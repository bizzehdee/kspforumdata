There was a WIP thread about making new rover bodies, but I haven\u0027t seen anything about that in quite a while. I made sure that my parts could fit on a RoveMate, but they usually have to put sideways or in some other slightly awkward way, that\u0027s why most of my examples use that bigger rover. But it might be interesting to come up with something in between.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll need to look into how exactly the asteroid science works, from the Q\u0026amp;A it sounds like they\u0027ll be another experimental situation that can be done around any planet. But the existing laser and drill are probably a bit big to actually be used on EVA. I\u0027ll try to fix the laser animation so that it works better on small landers, like the drill does, before the next update though. That should at least make the laser work better for asteroid science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Cpt.

Not only does it allow you to use the jetpacks handles, but it fixes the Kerbal, reducing the range of movement possible which should make designing something that stays in place easier. I like the idea about resource usage too, I\u0027ve been thinking of that for some of my other parts too. The laser especially should have a burst of electricity required for use.

Like all of my second draft textures it\u0027s a bit flat, but not too bad. I really don\u0027t like the interior section though, it\u0027s clunky and I don\u0027t think it meshes well with the rest of the model, or any of the other parts for that matter. The door mechanism isn\u0027t so great either, and I think it interferes with the probe that comes out of the side (that was added long after the rest of the model was complete). There are also some issues with different components of the part not aligning correctly during the animation, though that\u0027s not so easily noticeable in-game.

But science reports should still work properly, you just can\u0027t review them in the archives.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the meantime I\u0027ve been tweaking my magnetic field model to get it to show some semi-plausible results for Kerbin\u0027s magnetosphere. The model I\u0027m using is the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/WMM/DoDWMM.shtml\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EWorld Magnetic Model\u003C/a\u003E, which is used to simulate the Earth\u0027s magnetic field near the surface for calibrating compasses, and navigation. It isn\u0027t meant to give accurate readings of the magnetosphere (it treats the Earth like a dipole magnetic, basically a giant bar magnet), but I think it can still be useful. It provides a lot of non-random variation and it\u0027s relatively simple to tweak the input values so that I can produce a rough approximation of how the real magnetosphere behaves. Actual magnetosphere simulations exist, but they are more complicated and much more computationally expensive, and, most importantly, there doesn\u0027t seem to by any version that can be so easily adapted for my needs. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe WMM software has no noticeable effect on performance, but if there are issues it can be turned off in the .cfg file (or retract the magnetometer). I can also change the code so that it runs only a few times per second instead of once every frame as it\u0027s doing now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPrimarily I\u0027m using a stretched out, off-center torus to scale my altitude readings so that I can get a strong magnetic field stretched out far away on the night side of Kerbin and a very stubby field on the day side. Unfortunately this requires using a lot of empirically determined values, like the length of a Kerbin solar day, the point on Kerbin where the sun is directly overhead at the beginning of each solar day, and a lot of altitude variations. This means that it\u0027s not so easy to adapt this to other planets, I\u0027ll have to determine those values for each one. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI made the torus with a bunch of semi-educated modifications on the basic torus equation to produce a shape that looks like this. The front half has been removed to give you a better idea of how it looks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/elzk092.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022elzk092.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImagine Kerbin at the origin. The magnetic field readout roughly follows the shape of that torus around Kerbin (ie the field strength drops off quickly outside of that shape) and the input values for the magnetic field model that I\u0027m using are shifted so that the stubby end of the field always points toward the sun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course it would be nice to actually do something with all of these fancy simulations, but that will come later. For now I want to get the simulation running properly around Kerbin before even moving on to other planets.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kiwiak","CreatedById":82796,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-24T01:14:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIsnt kspi simulating magnetic fields too?

I suspect the basic form of the model I\u0027m using isn\u0027t terribly different, it just has a ton of empirically determined constants that give a lot of variability to the results; both versions should give you a magnetosphere that looks something like a flattened sphere, but the WMM values won\u0027t be so evenly distributed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as I can tell the Interstellar model doesn\u0027t go beyond the dipole model (except for lots of scaling for different planets).
