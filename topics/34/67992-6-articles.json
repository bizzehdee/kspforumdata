Works quite well, even with no SAS. The 3.75m default DRE heatshield masses a good amount, so my total mass for the capsule, shield, chutes, and docking port were almost 12 tons. But, she flew pretty much straight as an arrow the whole way.

FAR has calculated size/drag from the nodes, so given that you are 3.75 meters at the base, it would help to have the right node size.
