Shouldn\u0027t it be at the center? Oversight likely, since you usually have two wings and then it mostly doesn\u0027t matter, but I noticed this when making a space shuttle style \u0022board\u0022 at the back below the engines, by centering a wing section. The aggregate CoL was far right of the centerline...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t tried the new FAR yet, but with the new voxel approximation, does it take into account the CoL given in the part?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ferram4","CreatedById":21328,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T14:16:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat depends on how it works. If it already adds a PartModule to KerbalEVAs through a ModuleManager config, then it certainly can be done with a MM config.
