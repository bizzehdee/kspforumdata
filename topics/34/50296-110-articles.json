Yes it\u0027s true that the stock heating model leaves something to be desired there are a variety of issues beyond whether or not stock KSP or DRE are modeling heat properly. I don\u0027t believe the specific issues being discussed are due to DRE inflicting too much heat on SRFirefox\u0027s rockets. I think he\u0027s getting a reasonable amount of heat but receiving it to rocket parts that IRL are protected against aerodynamic heating. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs an example, look at the shuttle external tank\u0027s \u0027insulation\u0027. Sure, it protects the propellant contents against excessive heating when the shuttle was on the launch pad, but it also protected against aerodynamic heating where it had to withstand temperatures up to 2200F (just over 1000C). Without that protection, would the tank have been able survive a launch? I don\u0027t know, but we don\u0027t even really take things like that into account when talking about problems like this. It\u0027s not just a matter of whether or not DRE is putting out too much heat or too little, it\u0027s also a matter of how much those parts should really be able to withstand. And so far, discussions on that point have been limited to looking at melting or failure temperatures of of the materials and not taking into account the measures put into effect IRL to protect rocket components made out of those materials.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-06T18:21:09Z\u0022 title=\u002211/06/2014 06:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 6, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Starwaster\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jarin","CreatedById":71395,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-06T22:12:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHaving trouble coming in too fast on sub-orbital hops using NEAR.
