Perhaps you could add in new precoolers and jets that only work with each other and not with existing ones, to simulate ram or scram jets? Right now it\u0027s a bit more difficult (but certainly not impossible) to get SSTO planes to work with the new precoolers. If we have to use a three engines system, one jet for low speed, one jet for high speed high alt, and rockets to circularize orbits it would at least help a little.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course it could just be me.

For reference, at current prices, the amount of Tritium that you start off with in a 1.25m reactor is worth ~ $750 million so it\u0027s already pretty generous.
