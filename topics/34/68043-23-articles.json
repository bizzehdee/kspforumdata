The first part of the solid waste tank is just a basic tank, however there would be a second component to it for clearing it out. I could have a pump, or vent, that takes a good amount of power to cycle through as it empties (or maybe it has to be jettisoned and replace via KAS).

A sillier one would be to hae something that takes solid waste and turns it to food, but that might be a bit sick LOL.
