Maybe how far to reach the polar region?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimplest comm relay to deploy that gives 100% coverage of the globe?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy biggest concern is connection reliability and redundancy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t much like working on a long range probe if at the critical time in flight, the connection drops out because there\u0027s a hole in the network.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the biggest cause of holes is the rounding error from things going on the rails. Without time warp, a well placed constellation takes a long time to drift out of phase. Once Time Warp kicks in, the entire thing becomes a mess in the time it takes to send a ship to minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I try to set up a network that maximizes uptime while mitigating any down time ASAP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUptime tends to result from a combination of coverage and link redundancy. The more links I have between sats that have wide coverage area, the better the uptime.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this case, my primary goal is to keep the primary link to KSC up to about 99.99% (Mathematically, there WILL be a gap at some point in the game, meaning it is impossible to achieve perfect 100%)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn order to ensure I have coverage and connections, I consider that my satellites have a very wide field of view of kerbin, while also being close enough that I can get them to cross-communicate with each other unless they\u0027re ocluded by kerbin itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis way, even if they bunch-up in their orbits due to time warp, they still have LoS and range to talk to other satellites in the constellation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike this group:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://smg.photobucket.com/user/admiraltigerclaw/media/SpikeSatArray_zps9a50f8c1.jpg.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v430/admiraltigerclaw/SpikeSatArray_zps9a50f8c1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022SpikeSatArray_zps9a50f8c1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI forget what sat set that was, but even though the two up on the top side of the picture are bunched up, it\u0027s clear by the cat\u0027s cradle of connections that even if they get wonky, down time remains very low.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd in the image, the sats that are in lower standby orbits have higher frequencies, which allows them to swing around and clear gaps in coverage that could pop up due to drift. That\u0027s not intentional however, just a side-effect of popping a bunch into LKO first, then seeing how many I need to place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGoing for simplest is a good goal, but in my opinion, it\u0027s too easy to \u0027break\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
