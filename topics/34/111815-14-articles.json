I\u0027m not a programmer but it looks line most of the problems are GUI based.  I\u0027ll see what I can do.  \n\nI\u0027ve also got a couple of ideas about changing implementation, mostly to change the population from a resource to actual Kerbals...right now, I\u0027m thinking to keep it simple and make them \u0022tourists\u0022.  This (I hope) will make integration with life support and other easier.  \n\nIn any event, it\u0027ll take a while for me so wrap my head around working with KSP\u0027s API.  Right now, I\u0027ve only got a rudimentary IO box working. \n\nAlso, if anyone has any experience modifying traits, I\u0027d love to heat how is done (I want to add that feature at a later time, after basic functionality is restored)."},{"CreatedByName":"Deimos Rast","CreatedById":157420,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-20T05:04:23Z","Content":"PSA: New version is [here](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/140127-112ckan-civilian-populations-revived/).

I just want to tell you what your mod helped do for me. I did a series called the great kerbin trek. Like a kerbal star trek. with elp for orbital ship yards, the sleeper mod for long term space travel. While dropping jump point becaons for ftl, while using the intersteallar mod to get out that far. A extra solar system mod, 2 I think. Then buidling colony ships and seeding theses huge space conlnies a lot like gundam all throughout the system, and then building ships their, with ftl. I owned the galaxy with your mod and spread kerbin kind to every star in the galaxy. And bro if you ever have time I was trying to redo this and live stream it. So if you ever update this mod again let me know would ya. Peace and thank you for all the hours of fun I got out of this gem of a mod."}]}
