It would be an engine system and fuel tank that attaches to the back of the command pod. The fuel tank would be half the length of the normal tank and the engine could use the standard liquid engine model with a different skin (it would be nice if this was smaller, but that might be too much work). The engine would be very weak but the tank would have a lot of fuel. Just having the fuel tank and engine on the capsule would not provide enough thrust to lift it off the ground and only the engine or another fuel tank would be able to attach to the bottom of the fuel tank (so it\u0027s large tank size won\u0027t be exploited). Once you\u0027re in space this would make it easier to adjust the orbit, because it takes very little force to change the path of a stable orbit. It would also give players an easy way to de-orbit instead of just drifting if their rockets have run out of fuel. The names could have something like \u0027Nuclear...\u0027 or \u0027Orbital...\u0027 to explain the use. I\u0027ll probably try to tell Harvester about this too because I think it could really change the game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
