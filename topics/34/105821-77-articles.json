For an example, look at the directory in the ASET props mod ASET/ASET\\_Props/CUSTOMs.  All of those files exist to do what should be really simple things like adding a couple of values together, or returning a particular number if some conditions are met.  MAS scraps that by allowing the prop creator to simply use a mathematical expression like \u0022x \u002B y\u0022.  It also adds support for Lua scripting, so if the prop creator wants to do something fancier, he or she has the flexibility to do that.  MAS also eliminates having every component of every prop subscribing to the Unity FixedUpdate and/or Update cycle - instead, only one component subscribes.  On top of all of that, MAS uses a subscription model for updating props.  Each prop knows what data it cares about, and it asks the MAS Flight Computer to provide updates only when the data changes; in RPM, each prop would ask \u0022What\u0027s this value now?\u0022.\n\nTL; DR: The replacement is more powerful with better performance.  To get an idea of what alexustas has done with MAS so far, look at his [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/alexustas22/videos)."},{"CreatedByName":"Stone Blue","CreatedById":77721,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-06T15:51:13Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 6/4/2018 at 4:32 AM, Angstinator said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E So lemme get this straight, the big problem\u0027s been fixed but a replacement mod is being developed anyway.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E What else is wrong with RPM, then?\n\u003E \n\nJust to add to MOARdVs comment, he\u0027s been awesome in continuing to put time into bugfixes for RPM, and continuing it on life support, simply because almost ALL of the custom IVA mods out there, use RPM.  \n\nMAS is still not complete, and not many IVA developers have switched over to using it for new IVAs, much less converting the older, existing RPM IVAs over to MAS.  \n\nDeveloping custom IVAs is very time consuming, and I understand, can be aggravating and tedious. There seems to be a (relatively) small segment of KSP users that actually use IVAs, so the user niche is small, and for all the work that goes into an IVA, there doesnt seem to be much gratification or motivation for IVA developers to put the time into converting existing IVAs from RPM to MAS... or maybe even to make new ones...  \n\nAt least MOARdV has worked it so that RPM and MAS can BOTH be used in an IVA at the same time, so that should make it a lot easier for IVA makers to switch IVAs from RPM to MAS... Notice I said \u0022easIER\u0022... NOT \u0022easY\u0022.  \n\nSo, if you use custom IVAs, its especially important to MAKE SURE to thank and support all the IVA developers. Especially alexustas and MOARdV, as well as all the actual IVA makers.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-06-06T15:54:15Z\u0022 title=\u002206/06/2018 03:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJune 6, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Stone Blue**"},{"CreatedByName":"MOARdV","CreatedById":60950,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-11T20:51:48Z","Content":"**RasterPropMonitor v0.30.5** is now available.
