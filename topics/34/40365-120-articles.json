Had to reload once because a 70k meter periapsis coming in at over 10k m/s just bounced me out of the atmo. lol Reloaded and came in with a 49k meter periapsis and bled off enough speed so that with a 300 or so m/s burn, I was able to make a nice circular orbit at 1.5 million meters around Eve. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWas a lot of fun gathering the extra 20k science needed to unlock all the KSPI nodes. Forced me to visit all the planets and moons and land a few probes as well. Now to build an antimatter factory at Jool and design an FTL antimatter freighter!
