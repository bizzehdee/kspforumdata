I was looking through the ribbons and noticed they all look great, but when zoomed out or viewed at a certain size, they become jagged edgy, or look a bit cartoonish because of the pronounced scanlines. I\u0027ve made my fair share of ribbons in the past, and if you\u0027d like I could perhaps give them all a makeover in this style as an optional contribution to your mod.
