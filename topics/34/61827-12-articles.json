I think it\u0027s not, since you don\u0027t simply change the rotation in one step by telling the underlying engine to do so, but instead you use a multiude of commands on a higher level to achieve this rotation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI feel I already explicitly stated and explained that cheating in a single player game is pretty much impossible, so I think that discussion is one that does not need to be had. The insistence to talk about what is cheating or not will not help us, as it can only lead to unpleasant conversations between people who play with a different approach to the game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow. To me, \u003Cem\u003Elock steering\u003C/em\u003E is magic (not cheating) because it provides \u0027free\u0027 automated help with a task that is usually reserved for the player. When you manually launch and control a rocket, you will need to keep your eye on the navball to make corrections to steer to the correct heading. By providing a system that automates that and reduces workload, kOS - to me - is an external party that provides the necessary values to keep your rocket on track. If you write your own control logic, however, it can no longer be considered external. Writing my own control logic also coincides with the goal to learn as much as possible about what is needed to perform these kinds of operations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow please, I ask you all not to make more of this than it is.
