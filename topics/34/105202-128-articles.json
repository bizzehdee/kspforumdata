First of all, I am blown away by the scope and quality of your mods. I sent some pizza monies your way. I have time to donate too, so I will be looking for ways to help out, like with the GitHub wiki.\n\nOn the last page you mentioned that dedicated greenhouse and hab parts are coming. I have not set up any bases on my career save yet, so do you suggest I should hold off until you had implemented those new parts? Will they be a part of major release possibly months off, or something which is close to completion?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-23T19:22:26Z\u0022 title=\u002210/23/2016 07:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 23, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by RemoteRadical**"},{"CreatedByName":"Space Cowboy Bob","CreatedById":161283,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-23T21:45:36Z","Content":"Is \u0022Colony Supplies\u0022 something new?
