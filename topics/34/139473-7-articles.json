If I can do that then step 1 would be a contract to initially discover their dot location.\u003Cbr\u003E\nStep 2 - is scanning the sky in the vicinity of their location until they become discovered. Until I figure out how/if I can do step 1 this will be the starting point (as the mod behaves now) and you start by simply scanning (contract) to discover the new body. In step 2 it is still not discovered until the end of step 2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-31T20:16:15Z\u0022 title=\u002210/31/2016 08:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 31, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by JPLRepo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"garwel","CreatedById":141813,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-01T14:04:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn Observatory view, I don\u0027t see any options to research a newly discovered body.
