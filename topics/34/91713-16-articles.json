I would imagine, functionally, that the further the drag was from the center of mass, the more impact it would have. That\u0027s essentially how a lever works, if the effort is near the fulcrum it\u0027s not going to lift the load as well as if it were further from the fulcrum (it would require MORE effort). So following that logic, if the drag is closer to the center of mass (in front) it\u0027s not going to flip the plane as easily as if it were further from it. If it is behind the center of mass, it\u0027s not going to flip it at all.
