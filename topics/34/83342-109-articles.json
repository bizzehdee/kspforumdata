I know this is a long topic (109 pages so far), but if you read the first page and skimmed back just one or two pages you would find out two things: 1. The simulation system is no longer part of KCT, and 2. The inventory system is indeed broken.

Personally I just never use either of them, they were just things people wanted to have the option of doing and the default Preset has everything active by default so that people can experience any aspect of the mod without having to go into the settings screen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf your concern is for a publicly available challenge where you want everyone to use the same settings, or you\u0027re just interested in how unbelievably configurable KCT is, I highly recommend reading (or at least skimming) the three pages on the wiki discussing Presets, starting with \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/magico13/KCT/wiki/Presets:-An-Overview\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethe Overview page\u003C/a\u003E, then \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/magico13/KCT/wiki/Presets:-Internals\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethe internals page\u003C/a\u003E, and finally about \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/magico13/KCT/wiki/Preset-Formulas-and-Math-Parser-Documentation\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethe math parser and built in functions\u003C/a\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn general in the past I\u0027ve tried my hardest not to remove anything from KCT but instead to add community requested features as options.

Note that this is pretty similar to how actual simulations are performed, except that issues aren\u0027t always noticed right away\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI really like the sound of this, I too do not use KRASH.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snoman314","CreatedById":106370,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-21T21:08:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat does sound cool, but I\u0027ll put in my 2 cents worth and say I\u0027d much rather see the part inventory back\u00A0(which is missing) before we get a cool simulation system like you describe (when we do already have a functional option).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat said, I can understand if you\u0027re burnt out on one area, and want a change\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"linuxgurugamer","CreatedById":129964,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-21T21:21:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222961416\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002283342\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221487573952\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022166078\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022danielboro\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 2/20/2017 at 1:59 AM, danielboro said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni have a different opinion\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I\u0027m curious what you don\u0027t like about KRASH?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magico13","CreatedById":73338,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-21T21:33:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222963304\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002283342\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221487711288\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022106370\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Snoman314\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n26 minutes ago, Snoman314 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat does sound cool, but I\u0027ll put in my 2 cents worth and say I\u0027d much rather see the part inventory back\u00A0(which is missing) before we get a cool simulation system like you describe (when we do already have a functional option).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat said, I can understand if you\u0027re burnt out on one area, and want a change\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, at this point me working on anything to get back into it is a good sign. I put in a bit of work over the weekend on the part inventory but there\u0027s still a lot to go. I figured last night I\u0027d try to port over KCT\u0027s old simulation code to remind me of how KSP mods are structured and since it\u0027s already written it\u0027d be a quick way for me to finish something and get that good feeling when you finish something that can help keep you going on other, bigger, stuff.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe part inventory is frustrating me a bit since I can make it work without KCT much easier than I can with KCT. Especially because I\u0027m trying to make it so you don\u0027t have to use the part inventory, so no hard dependencies. The biggest issue is with how they remove parts from the inventory. A KCT ship does it when added to the build list, but without KCT it has to happen at rollout. At rollout I need to verify that KCT (or another mod) hasn\u0027t already processed it. The issue\u00A0is that KCT assigns an id to a ship when it gets added to the build list, and KSP assigns an id to a ship when it\u0027s added to the world, but 1) those ids aren\u0027t linked in any way, 2) I don\u0027t think I can\u00A0get KSP\u0027s id until the ship is loaded, and 3) it doesn\u0027t matter because I don\u0027t have the whole ship during the OnVesselRollout event anyway so I can\u0027t get either id easily.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I\u0027m having them talk through a module applied to the root part where I can put an id for the vessel. It\u0027s goofy and I haven\u0027t tested it yet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m also adding in the individual part tracker, but haven\u0027t made the general part tracker. Or a way to actually take parts out of the inventory (the parts are a lot more specific than before and you have to take fully fledged parts out, not just parts by the same name). Lot\u0027s of hurdles still. The core is there though and technically works, but it isn\u0027t tied into anything and while functional, is not \u0022playable\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222963323\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002283342\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221487712092\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022129964\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022linuxgurugamer\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n12 minutes ago, linuxgurugamer said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I\u0027m curious what you don\u0027t like about KRASH?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBtw, I just wanted to say that KRASH is still going to be the one recommended by KCT even if I port the old code over to a modlet. That\u0027s just something I\u0027m doing for fun. I\u0027ve been using KRASH on my playthrough and have liked it so far, though I haven\u0027t done anything crazy with it. Personally the funds counter going up continuously adds a bit of anxiety, though I can add a strict max if I\u0027m worried\u00A0about it. In some ways I still like the pay before method that KCT used to use, even though it would end up being more costly, but that might just be because I\u0027m still used to that.\u00A0I like the presentation a lot though, from what I\u0027ve used.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-02-21T21:39:11Z\u0022 title=\u002202/21/2017 09:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 21, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by magico13\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
