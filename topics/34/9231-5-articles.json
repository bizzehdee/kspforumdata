Keep on trucking with what you were doing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I wasn\\\u0027t referring to r4m0n\\\u0027s code before, I checked that first, and it was fine. The case of the missing thrustAxis is in the actual base class, LiquidEngine. It\\\u0027s the base game part classes that haven\\\u0027t been documented or source released, r4m0n\\\u0027s code is all there to be parsed like it should be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I may be imagining things, but I think the shifted origin trick also throws off the net CoM of the part. Not a huge issue as you made the shifted parts ultra light. The problem is this also gives them an enormous Thrust:Mass, which I ran into trying to adjust them to SE 2 ratings so I could use them semi-legit for the first 10km of reaching orbit. That\\\u0027s why I was trying to find another solution.
