I don\u0027t personally use EI, so I\u0027m not 100% sure of how it works during gameplay, but simply using hypergolic fuels will not give you unlimited restarts. HoneyFox has said before (somewhere...) that the \u0022ignitions\u0022 are an abstraction of how many restarts an engine is designed for. The Apollo SPS was designed for many restarts, but the RD-253 (Proton first-stage engine) is not. They both use hypergolics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of that said, you can adjust the EI settings in the XLS provided in the OP. There are instructions in the docs tab on how to force multiple restarts to show up in the configs.
