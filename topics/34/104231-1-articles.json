After a bit of community backlash, they announced they\u0027d keep the ROUND-8 and make a new large Xenon tank. This mod is now officially dead - it served its purpose and will quietly walk into the sunset.\n\nThe CEO of Probodobodyne Inc is furious! He\u0027s blaming poor sales of his pet project, the Oscar-B fuel tank, on consumer preference of the ROUND-8 fuel tank. As a result, he\u0027s converting all new ROUND-8 tanks to store Xenon to boost Oscar-B sales. We need you to hide some ROUND-8 tanks where the CEO won\u0027t find them!\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
