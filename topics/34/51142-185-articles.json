EVE still works and AVP needs the 3 files in clouds/particles converted to dds. Also converting the aurora textures to dds helps a bit. OpenGL or the 64bit hack are your friends. Just don\u0027t go running to the mod makers with bug reports if you decide to hack your win install to run in 64 bit mode. Use a 32bit install to check your mod related issues first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedit: Astronomers interstellar v2 works after converting a couple textures as mentioned above.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-08T15:06:47Z\u0022 title=\u002206/08/2015 03:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by V8jester\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jrandom","CreatedById":74522,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T15:03:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SergeantBlueforce\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SergeantBlueforce\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENo doubt the answer is somewhere in this thread, but how do people actually get this working now?
