It took a bit of a fight, being new to the Kerbal API, and the documentation is a little sparse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main problem, is receiving the Vessel data, and working out if the client already has this Vessel, if so update it. To me the easiest method seemed to be to destroy the old vessel, and just load the replacement protovessel. I was tracking the vessels by the guid inside the Vessel class. The problem with that is when you dock vessels together they generate new guids. Which led to explosions, as the seemingly new vessel would telefrag the old one. To get around this, my inter-dimensional part module stores a unique guid that gets preserved between loads and the vessels are identified using that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOccasionally I get a bug, that causes the protocrew members to fail to load, therefore the whole vessel fails to transfer. I have a feeling this might be due to some exceptions breaking the way the client exe talks to the Kerbal plugin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlready I can see this getting messy, the idea is that the core module of your space station/moon base has the network sync module. When a new vessel is attach, you press sync, and everyone gets the update. If you have multiple sync modules on separate vessels the following case can happen:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpace Station Synced, New module near the station, but not docked get\u0027s sync\u0027d. Now everyone sees a space station, and the new expansion module. The expansion module get\u0027s attached to the space station, and gets sync\u0027d to all the players. Now all the players (but the player docking the new module), would see a space station, with the new module, and another module in space. As they have got no message that the old module has been removed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther problems, is what if 2 people (player A and player \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E are docked with a space station at the same time, and player A hits sync? Does player B get their vessel destroyed as player A does not know about it? I think this could be circumvented by watching for all attaching and detaching and auto syncing then, but I don\u0027t know where to start on that being new to the api and all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and you can be the ultimate troll by telefraging people\u0027s launches, by syncing your rocket on the launch pad as they get ready to go. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-04-26T15:51:50Z\u0022 title=\u002204/26/2013 03:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EApril 26, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Caswal\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fyrem","CreatedById":57131,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-26T17:12:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECaswal, the problems you face are exactly why this \u0027interpretation\u0027 of Multiplayer has not been implemented by SodiumEyes. and also why the \u0022general public\u0022 has been told that \u0022multiplayer\u0022 will not work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI feel your pain, as many people have tried to figure out how to get this stage of multiplayer to work. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut truly, I wish you good luck in your efforts.
