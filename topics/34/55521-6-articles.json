My guess is that it has something to do with how little room in front of them the kerbals have and so the camera view is ending up inside the model somewhere. Only solutions I know of is figure out how to reposition that (possible? dunno.) or remodel the interior to push them back a bit, or forward (may require tweaking exterior model too then).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Orionkermin","CreatedById":91013,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-03T14:55:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@Captain Sierra\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s really strange the IVA cam has always worked for me.
