I realized this problem when I got stuck in orbit because the Apollo CSM engine wouldn\u0027t fire. From the EI modules you put in the engines, I assume you support EngineIgnitor. This was fixed by classifying the fuel tanks as Service Modules so the propellants are pressurized. This also makes it so you don\u0027t need Ullage burns on those engines.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"coldblade2000","CreatedById":104385,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-18T00:48:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDescent stage done:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E !RESOURCE[LiquidFuel]\u003Cp\u003E {\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E @name = Aerozine\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E @amount = 3775.9\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E @maxAmount = 3775.9\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E }\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E !RESOURCE[Oxidizer]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E {\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E @name = N2O4\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E @amount = 3740.4\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E @maxAmount = 3740.4\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E }\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E MODULE\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E {\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E name = ModuleFuelTanks\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E type = ServiceModule\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E volume = 7516.3\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E basemass = -1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E TANK\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E {\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E name = Aerozine\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E amount = 3775.9\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E maxAmount = 3775.9\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E }\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E TANK\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E {\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E name = N2O4\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E amount = 3740.4\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E maxAmount = 3740.4\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E }\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E }\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-18T01:02:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, all tanks should be ModuleFuelTanks, otherwise you don\u0027t get realistic functions (support for pressure fed engines, support for cryogenic boiloff, etc).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother couple issues I\u0027ve seen: the two Baby Sergeant clusters don\u0027t have ModuleEngineConfigs defined, and the antenna whips on the Explorer probe don\u0027t seem to extend.
