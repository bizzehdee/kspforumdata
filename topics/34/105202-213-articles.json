Each Kerbal needs 4 nom-o-matic 5000 type greenhouses to keep them supplied. (Well they actually only need 3.78 each but you need to round up the total so that supply exceeds demand, e.g. 3 Kerbals need 11.4 greenhouses - rounded up to 12).\n\nAlso note the small greenhouses don\u0027t benefit from having a specialist in the crew for improved conversion efficiency but some of the MKS agroponics parts do which can be taken into account when designing a larger vessel."},{"CreatedByName":"cukkoo","CreatedById":204373,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-12T03:09:30Z","Content":"I cant seem to understand the code on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS.version USILifeSupport.dll USILifeSupport.dll.mdb USILifeSupport.pdb.There some nonsense sign and other that all my text edit don\u0027t understand.I try use atom but it don\u0027t work  text edit didn\u0027t work either"},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-12T05:20:52Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 2 hours ago, cukkoo said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I cant seem to understand the code on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS.version USILifeSupport.dll USILifeSupport.dll.mdb USILifeSupport.pdb.There some nonsense sign and other that all my text edit don\u0027t understand.I try use atom but it don\u0027t work  text edit didn\u0027t work either\n\u003E \n\nNo offense, and please don\u0027t take this the wrong way, but you do know how to write .Net/C# correct?"},{"CreatedByName":"Michaelo90","CreatedById":98783,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-14T14:43:06Z","Content":"Are you working on a 1.9 version?"},{"CreatedByName":"Tonka Crash","CreatedById":189552,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-14T14:57:35Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 13 minutes ago, Michaelo90 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Are you working on a 1.9 version?\n\u003E \n\nThe current version works fine in 1.9"},{"CreatedByName":"bullettrain5","CreatedById":189326,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-14T18:07:25Z","Content":"Does this mod have any dependencies?"},{"CreatedByName":"overkill13","CreatedById":173506,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-14T23:23:20Z","Content":"Community Category Kit, Community Resource Pack and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E Tools are all included with the download."},{"CreatedByName":"cukkoo","CreatedById":204373,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-16T11:28:40Z","Content":"No but If i know i can\u0027t code due to all my text edit doesn\u0027t support those file and my mac converter seem to broke file"},{"CreatedByName":"Tonka Crash","CreatedById":189552,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-16T11:57:18Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 17 minutes ago, cukkoo said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E No but If i know i can\u0027t code due to all my text edit doesn\u0027t support those file and my mac converter seem to broke file\n\u003E \n\nIf you had even the most rudimentary understanding of programming you would know a those files are not text.

The .cs files are source code written in the [C# programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_%28programming_language%29).
