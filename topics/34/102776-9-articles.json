I thought it was a one off, but i haven\u0027t really had the time to do an actual playthrough to see if it was just a little screw up or incompatibility (so much work so little time:()\n\nI\u0027ll have to have a deeper look at the contract system, as it probably needs a little shake up to make up for the fact that all bodies have been re-aligned.

You will see that now the body is in a fixed spot over the surface. Now apply a particle effect from the parent planet to the Phantom body and make sure the jetstream is very tiny and the particles are tiny as well. Next, trough some texture trickery, find in the textures, the spot your Phantom body and thus the volcano is and modify it to get a real volcano terrain. \n\nIf this doesn\u0027t work try this: move the Phantom body under the surface and create a second one high up over the planet than apply a particle effect between the two. \n\nSo far I got this working on Kerbol Plus, but I still don\u0027t know what parameter to modify in order to make the Phantom bodies synchronise rotation with parent body. I know, It\u0027s pretty hard to understand. I will post pictures of how it should look later next week."},{"CreatedByName":"KillAshley","CreatedById":128696,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T07:47:02Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E no problem gime a sign when you update them and il start testing them again\n\nI\u0027ve uploaded my master copy of my Regolith configs as a hotfix, they are linked in the OP or you can get it [**here**](https://www.dropbox.com/s/2cktqidonf5gl9i/NH_RegolithHotfix.zip?dl=0)\n\nI haven\u0027t had time to properly test this set, so if they are off, please let me know.

The Huge white body as big as Minmus that floats above Keel on\u0027s surface has to be in a fixed spot too, so maybe you an find a way to specify a rotation period and revolution.
