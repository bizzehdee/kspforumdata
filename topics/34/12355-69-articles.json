I\u0027m new with KSP and I MechJeb it\u0027s been so far my first mod. I downloaded the last version available (I think it\u0027s 2.0.8 or sth like that, don\u0027t remember well) and I think I did everything well when installing it (it\u0027s just unzipping things in proper location, right?). My surprise came when I started the game, went to one of my in progress flights, and there was no MechJeb tab on the right side of the screen!! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E I tried to launch a new vessel, too, but it didn\u0027t appear there neither. Am I doing sth wrong?? Thanks!! ^^\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDid you add the MechJeb part to your spacecraft in the VAB?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
