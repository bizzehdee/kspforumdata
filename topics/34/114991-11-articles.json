It actually seems like it might be a bug, since if there isn\u0027t supposed to be ESP support, getting shutdown by ESP is probably not working as intended. Also something to consider is the thermal efficiency of the reactor, which might play a role. Lastly, most of Nertea\u0027s reactors aren\u0027t called \u0022WIP - Need Input\u0022 so maybe RO reworked it (although I have/recognize all the modules on it). In the future, you could try something like HyperEdit to just move the ElectricCharge resource to full (it\u0027s a great tool).\n\u003E \n\n[@Gordon Dry](%7B___base_url___%7D/index.php?/profile/163177-gordon-dry/) Well I am not really following what the issue is here. As [@Deimos Rast](%7B___base_url___%7D/index.php?/profile/157420-deimos-rast/) said it would appear RO or something is changing your NFE reactor.  \n\nI went through your log and couldn\u0027t find anything evil with regard to AmpYear. But I did see lots of Remote Tech log spamming.  \n\nAll I can really do is test the NFE reactors with AmpYear ESP processing again to make sure this is no bug. ESP does not support the NFE reactors, so it should not be changing them at all. So I will check that. But given I see nothing else in your log AmpYear related not much else I can do."},{"CreatedByName":"JPLRepo","CreatedById":114736,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-09T04:44:11Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 8 hours ago, panarchist said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Ah - thanks, I should have went back one more page.

Just LEAVE the \\GameData\\REPOSoftTech\\AmpYear\\Resources\\AmpYearResources.cfg file and remove everything else from the AmpYear folder. This will stop the crashing in the Tracking Station until you recover all vessels that were launched with AmpYear installed. The cause is a stock bug, but by leaving this file, it won\u0027t occur.

Anyway, one of the parts made AmpYear cranky as hell; the \u0022errors\u0022 occurred at the info level, not not a full blown exception I guess, but it\u0027s a non-stop log spam storm till I kill the part.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Looking over the config (it\u0027s a propeller engine), it uses some possibly outdated Firespitter modules, the deprecated velocity curve, and has a stray empty MODULE floating around, which is what I think is causing the real issue. I\u0027m not expecting compatibility, I\u0027m just mentioning it since it seems to expose a niche case scenario in AmpYear\u0027s error catching routine, or something (my interpretation), that might be of interest. Or not.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Cheers.  \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003Csnip\u003E\n\u003E \u003C/snip\u003E\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The dirty config (pruned):\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003Csnip\u003E\n\u003E \u003C/snip\u003E\n\u003E \n\nCould be the empty node, actually, without the curly brackets, surprised the part even loads.  \n\nBut the error appears to be with the ModuleEngines, yes that config looks very old. It\u0027s missing a number of fields.  \n\nIt\u0027s actually failing in AY.AYController.ProcessModuleEngines will a null reference (something isn\u0027t defined). I\u0027d say something isn\u0027t supplied in the config file... but it\u0027s seriously messed up with that empty node. Does it still occur without the empty node? I\u0027ll look at tightening up the error processing.
