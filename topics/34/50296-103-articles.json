The amount of heat is dependent on the temperature of the shockwave created as your craft hurtles through the atmosphere. The shockwave is created by air bunching up in front of you. (front being defined as towards your velocity vector). The temperature of the shockwave is about equal to your velocity in meters per second in Kelvins. (to convert to Celsius, subtract 273). The amount of heat that is actually picked up by your craft is dependent on the density of the air outside. It\u0027s entirely possible to think you\u0027ve made it because the shockwave temperature is rapidly dropping but then suddenly your hull starts heating up because the air has finally become dense enough that enough heat is getting through to push your temperature up and rapidly deplete your shield.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-21T11:25:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Starwaster\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Starwaster\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYeah ok now you\u0027re losing me here.

Any advise for early career probe returns?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re using RemoteTech, I would advise that you ensure your heatshield is oriented the proper way significantly before you hit mid-atmosphere: your antenna might break off in reentry. It also helps to have your chutes armed well ahead of time*. Otherwise, it\u0027s the same as ever: re-enter at a shallow angle, perform a lifting re-entry if you so wish, and double-check that your heat shield is facing the right way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*If using stock, just tweak your chutes at the VAB to only open at high pressure; if using RealChutes, you can set low deployment altitude. Otherwise, you risk either not having contact with the probe to deploy chutes manually, or you will have your chutes burn up because they decided that the middle of re-entry was a perfect time to deploy. I\u0027ve only ever done one RT re-entry: it was a suborbital flight with no available comm links past apoapsis. Fortunately, aerodynamics corrected the alignment of the probe from about 30 degrees off to face re-entry directly, and my parachutes deployed exactly as planned.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jrandom","CreatedById":74522,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-22T20:38:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve got a little custom .cfg files that increases the heat tolerances for spaceplane parts.
