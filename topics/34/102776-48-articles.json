How long does a kerbal survive on EVA? ^^\n\nCraft can survive at this point, but there is a big problem with science equipment - it need a lot of radiators. At the night side everything is OK, it\u0027s cool? but it\u0027s almost impossible to land between the rocks. Kerbal survive for 12-14 second, I don\u0027t know exactly, because I had fps 15-18 at that point.
