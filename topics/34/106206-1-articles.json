I code for a living which makes coding for a hobby a real chore.  I will not be working on these mods anymore beyond simple recompiling, which means they may not be updated for 1.1.  Sorry for that.  They\u0027re open-sourced with a quite permissible license so feel free to take over one or more of them if you\u0027re so inclined.  Let me know if you do so I can alter the OP here.**\n\n**regex\u0027s Useful Mod Emporium**\n\nBecause I\u0027m too lazy to do a bunch of release threads for tiny little mods.\n\n**Before we get started:**\n\n- Any requests for support will be completely ignored.\n- Bug reports that do not follow the [commonly accepted format](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92229) will be completely ignored.\n- If you use Windows x64 and are having issues you will be ignored.\n- If you are ignored for any reason I reserve the right to not explain why you have been ignored and continue to ignore you.\n- All of these mods should be considered to be in \u0022maintenance mode\u0022. That is, I am not taking feature requests for them and will probably not expand them, but I will fix bugs.\n- These mods are offered in the hopes that they will be useful and free of bugs but I have very little patience and free time for this sort of thing anymore; any modding will be done on my schedule and at my whim, and if you don\u0027t like that I literally don\u0027t care.\n\nOn to the mods.\n\n* * *\n\n**KSC Switcher** (1.0.4)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![uqZUw6X.png](http://i.imgur.com/uqZUw6X.png)\n\nScraped out of Real Solar System at NathanKell\u0027s request (RSS will be moving to Kopernicus), this mod allows you to move KSC around for launches from different locations, as desired. Enter the tracking station, click on the desired launch site, exit and watch as KSC get put in the right location. This does not create multiple KSCs, it moves KSC around. Designed mainly for use with Real Solar System, the included launch sites file contains real world locations and descriptions for those locations culled from Wikipedia (covered under the appropriate license).\n\nIn the tracking station there are two additional buttons underneath the exit button. The first (the \u0022launch tower\u0022) will bring up a list of launch sites. Hovering over a launch site will show its description, clicking a site will switch to it, and clicking the magnifier next to the site will spin the planet to view it. The second button (the \u0022eye\u0022) toggles site visibility in the tracking station. You can click on a launch site directly on the planet view to switch to it. Your current launch site will be remembered when you start the game and KSP should be loaded with that launch site active.\n\nI will not be making a launch sites file for stock Kerbin so don\u0027t bother asking, although it should be noted that a lot of Earth sites will actually work pretty well as-is. Poke around and check them out. Baikonur, Svobodny, Brownsville, and even Kourou are good choices. Kourou is probably the most practical to use. Oh yeah, you don\u0027t get the stock KSC location with this; consider yourself warned.\n\nIf you want to build your own launch sites [this link](https://github.com/NathanKell/RealSolarSystem/wiki/PQSCity-and-PQSMod_MapDecalTangent) provides a good reference on the options available to you.\n\n**License:** BSD 2-clause (relicensed from CC-BY-SA with permission from NathanKell).

Basically this mod takes any given generated Kerbal and rebuilds them. Stronger. Faster. etc... It\u0027ll even get rid of the stock four for you. The included name file creates Kerbals with Russian names what I copied off of Wikipedia and elsewhere; they\u0027re probably not at all correct and, unfortunately, not in Cyrillic. Now includes American names as well, and the ability to have multiple \u0022cultures\u0022 defined for renaming. Anyway, read the README.txt and check out the KerbalRenamer.cfg file if you want to configure it for yourself.\n\n**License:** BSD 2-clause\n\n**Download:** [KerbalRenamer-0.5.zip](https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/730/Kerbal%20Renamer/download/0.5)\n\n* * *\n\n**Thermal Helper** (1.0.5)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![qjUhBvi.png](http://i.imgur.com/qjUhBvi.png)\n\nGives you an Application Launcher button to enable/disable the debug menu thermal options to show the part shaders and enable right-click info.\n\n**License:** BSD 2-clause.\n\n**Download:** [ThermalHelper-0.2.zip](https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/728/Thermal%20Helper/download/0.2)\n\n* * *\n\n**Tank Lock** (1.0.5)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![M6kn1gv.png](http://i.imgur.com/M6kn1gv.png)\n\nAllows you to bind resource locking/unlocking to action groups on a per-tank basis.

If we would have different kinds of sets of names, then it would make sense.
