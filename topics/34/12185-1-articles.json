It is functional in 0.15.1\u002B, though my GUI is, frankly, broken. Fortunately you don\\\u0027t need it. If the module fails to start, just pause/unpause the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAmong the changes is the plugin does a sizable data dump once every ten real seconds, and reads information once every game second. It will shut down automatically if you exceed 10x warp. This allows for very complete maps rather quickly. I\\\u0027ll keep tinkering with the GUI. If any of you smart people see why it\\\u0027s misbehaving let me know.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the code itself, if I know what it does it\\\u0027s documented. There\\\u0027s a few things about the drawing the part itself I can\\\u0027t quite wrap my mind around, but then I\\\u0027ve never had any training, formal or otherwise, in graphical programming.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\\\u0027s not all that thoroughly tested, but I don\\\u0027t foresee any catastrophic bugs.

Perhaps the KSP.IO adds some inefficiencies, or perhaps my updating code itself is less efficient than previous versions. I seem to be having some framerate issues. Let me know if ya\\\u0027ll are having them as well, I may need to optimize the code, or reduce the maximum warp to 5x.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo use: Extract into KSP directory.
