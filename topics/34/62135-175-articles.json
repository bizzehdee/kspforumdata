The flaws have to do with specific aspects of Squad code which doesn\u0027t take quirks of the 64-bit Unity engine into account, which will, frankly, take some time and iteration. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m reminded of a quote from a signature \u0027\u0022It\u0027s in Alpha\u0022 isn\u0027t an excuse, it\u0027s an objective assessment.

If we can\u0027t pinpoint a specific problem because we\u0027re getting random crashes, we have to point the blame at Squad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWill it get fixed eventually? Hopefully.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre some of us upset that 64bit didn\u0027t work out of the box? You bet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo add: There is no plugin authoring in KSOS. In fact we don\u0027t even have a plugin author on our team, I\u0027d like one, but we just don\u0027t have one. Nazari doesn\u0027t do any programming at all. I do the artwork, textures, spit it out to FBX and all it is, is 3D mesh data and texture UVW coordinate data. That\u0027s it. There is no programming or anything embedded (such as Gamebryo/Nif file formats).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENazari then grabs that 3D mesh and assigns it to either Firespitter, KM_Gimbal (Space Shuttle Engines mod), Raster Prop Monitor, or SmokeScreen. That\u0027s it. He doesn\u0027t do any voodoo magic, or special hack code or anything. If one of those three plugins has a feature we use, great. Otherwise we don\u0027t have it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently the KSO\u0027s are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Flight controls and flight characteristics are driven by Firespitter.

I took it hostile as if I purposely made things be resource intensive. Check this out man, I use the minimum amount of geometry (usually boxes) and the minimum amount of texture space for like 80% of the stuff. We\u0027re at the bare minimum with phase 2 and higher.
