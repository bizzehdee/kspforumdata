Very good for those surface survey contracts in awkward locations.\n\nIt features two parts: the survey transponder itself (science), and a 0.625m inline storage (ie, cargo bay/service module) (utilities).\n\nThe transponder automatically sets itself as target 2.2 seconds after it has been staged (2s before deploying its arms, then 0.2s for the arms to fully deploy before it starts \u0022transmitting\u0022). The arms prevent the dropped package from rolling down moderate slopes. Once deployed, a status window will appear giving the status (situation, altitude, velocity) of all transponders within range.\n\nCurrently, the transponder is an otherwise standard probe core, but without any electrical storage of its own. This is to allow science experiments to be run.\n\nDownload: [Survey Transponder 0.6.0](http://taniwha.org/~bill/SurveyTransponder_v0.6.0.zip)\n\nSource: [github](https://github.com/taniwha/SurveyTransponder)\n\nLicense: GPL v3\n\nChanges:\n\n- [0.6.0](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/111834-st/\u0026do=findComment\u0026comment=3719915)\n- [0.5.4/0.5.3](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/111834-st/\u0026do=findComment\u0026comment=3505205), [0.5.2](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/111834-st/\u0026do=findComment\u0026comment=3164818), [0.5.1](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/111834-st/\u0026do=findComment\u0026comment=3056873), [0.5.0](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/111834-12-survey-transponder-050/\u0026do=findComment\u0026comment=2817804)\n- [0.4.0](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/111834-113-survey-transponder-040/\u0026do=findComment\u0026comment=2659428)\n- [0.3.0](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/111834-112-survey-transponder-030/\u0026do=findComment\u0026comment=2568311)\n- [0.2.3](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/111834-112-survey-transponder-023/\u0026do=findComment\u0026comment=2552728), [0.2.2](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/111834-112-survey-transponder-023/\u0026do=findComment\u0026comment=2279309), [0.2.1](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/111834-112-survey-transponder-023/\u0026do=findComment\u0026comment=2279045), [0.2.0](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/111834-112-survey-transponder-023/\u0026do=findComment\u0026comment=2277512)\n\nThe transponder with its arms deployed (inline storage just \u0022behind\u0022 it):\n\n[![st-transponder_deployed.jpg](http://taniwha.org/~bill/ksp/st-transponder_deployed.jpg)](http://taniwha.org/~bill/ksp/st-transponder_deployed.png)\n\nInside the inline storge, with undeployed transponder:\n\n[![st-inline_storage.jpg](http://taniwha.org/~bill/ksp/st-inline_storage.jpg)](http://taniwha.org/~bill/ksp/st-inline_storage.png)\n\nAll non-moving surfaces accept surface attachments, and there are two internal stack nodes (one on either end).\n\nVideo demonstrating the auto-target and status window (dev version).
