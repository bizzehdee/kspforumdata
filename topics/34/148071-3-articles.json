This should help people who have multiple decouplers on their ships.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI\u0027ve changed the way the construction missions are working: Scientists on the station are now reducing the construction time while you need a certain number of engineers to construct a vessel of a given size. A single engineer can now only construct a vessel in orbit with a dry mass of 10t. Additional engineers will double that size each. This should give the player a good reason to build bigger space stations than before. And it won\u0027t make deployment missions redundant too early in the game.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe staging order of newly created vessels is now preserved.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI\u0027ve fixed an issue with transporting multiple kerbals to a vessel, which had parts that could seat two or more crew-members (thanks again to Kielm for the bug-report).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe orbits of new vessels are now checked against all other vessels in the vicinity and possibly slightly adjusted to avoid collisions.

In the case of the former I guess the mod depends on the usual life-cycle of each vessel, which usually starts at \u0022landed at Kerbin\u0022 and only afterwards transitions to \u0022orbiting\u0022. I don\u0027t think it would be wise to change any values in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s scenario-data, maybe the guys and / or gals at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E can help out by also checking for vessles which simply \u0022appear\u0022 in orbit?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd in the case of\u00A0 \u0022ModularFuelTanks\u0022 I was also unable to find any satisfactory solution. A little bit of context:\u003Cbr\u003E\nI am using \u0022ShipConstruction.LoadShip\u0022 to load the saved crafts, which gives me a list of parts and modules I can use to construct the new vessel. In the this case a ModularFuelTanks-FuelTank will get constructed by the ShipConstruction-class with its default resources (eg LiquidFuel \u002B Oxidizer) and the FuelTank module will be missing its \u0022TANK\u0022 Config-Nodes. I don\u0027t know why the module does not correctly load all its sub-nodes, maybe I need to include ModularFuelTanks-DLL in my assembly? I did some experiments with manually copying the missing sub-nodes form the \u0022ShipTemplate\u0022 over into the incomplete module Config-Node. This however didn\u0027t fix the issue with the additional resources-nodes, which I would have to remove manually as well.

In addition to this fix, I\u0027ve also implemented a function which now allows us to transport tourists. But be warned, this might not work as easily as first imagined if you want to use KSTS to fulfill your tourism-contracts: Most contracts monitor the state-change of a vessel, so directly deploying to kerbin\u0027s orbit won\u0027t trigger the \u0022orbit kerbin\u0022 requirement of a contract. You would have to leave and then enter a proper orbit. Additionally a tourism contract is only completed when the tourist is recovered from a landed or splashed down flight, not when he is added back to the crew-roster, as it is done with KSTS. You would then have to launch a minimal (real) vessel with the tourists and recover it to finish the contract.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope you will enjoy the new function nonetheless.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cheostian","CreatedById":169906,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-01T22:43:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nposted this on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s LS forum.\u00A0 though you might want to have a look at a response \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222832779\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022105202\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221477976362\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022169906\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Cheostian\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n17 hours ago, Cheostian said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/105198-roverdude/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022105198\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/105198-roverdude/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@RoverDude\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0 Not sure if you have time to look into this issue.
