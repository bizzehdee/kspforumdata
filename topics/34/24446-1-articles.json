You then launch containers of RocketParts out to your SpaceDocks to fill them up. When that is done, you can build your ships at any SpaceDock, at the cost of RocketParts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDownload: \u003C/strong\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://mega.co.nz/#!KQdG3AAC!NqUq1wLdmqyWZaadze9TpS6eBetl-YGhqu5C695pznM\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EVersion 4.2 from MEGA.co.nz\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMirrors:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://filesmelt.com/dl/OrbitalConstruction_Redux_4.2_0_.21_.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EVersion 4.2 from FileSmelt\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/interfect/OrbitalConstruction/issues\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBUGS GO HERE\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E.

Build a ship that has the SpaceDock part, and a container that holds RocketParts (the \u0022Orbital Warehouse\u0022 parts are recommended). Put it into orbit, or land it somewhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Ship cargo containers of RocketParts to your space dock, until you have enough RocketParts there. RocketParts are just like any other resource; you can transfer them between ships while docked. To build a ship in orbit, you will need 125% of its mass in spare parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.1. Alternately, you can ship Kethane to your SpaceDock, and convert it into RocketParts with the \u0022KE-OC-3D-OMG 3D Printer\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Make a ship with one SpaceBuilt part on it, and launch it from the launchpad. (Using ships with \u0022Launch Stability Enhancers\u0022 on them is now supported!) Use the \u0022Orbital Construction\u0022 window to \u0022Scan for docks\u0022. Select the SpaceDock you launched earlier, and hit \u0022Build at selected dock\u0022. Your ship will be teleported into the same orbit as the selected dock, around a kilometer or so away, and the required amount of RocketParts will be deducted from the SpaceDock\u0027s supplies. If the dock was on the ground, be sure to click \u0022Land at dock\u0022 to have your ship gently lowered to the ground in the vicinity of the landed SpaceDock. While it\u0027s slowly descending, make sure to rotate it so that it lands upright.
