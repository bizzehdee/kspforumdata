Real life\u0027s been kind of nuts, was my baby\u0027s first Christmas and I\u0027m getting back into the swing of things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Yes, works with FAR. My for fun games always have FAR installed and I\u0027ve had no issues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) 0.23 works fine as long as you leave engines at 100% on the tweakables. If you limit engine thrust to less then 100% the calculations go wonky and you will not hold altitude. Fix already in for next version.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) The altitude above terrain has a bug where it can display \u0022-1\u0022 for altitude when too high (in orbit) or above deep ocean. Fix is known but not implemented yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Jet spooling: I am open to adding compensation for this, but I\u0027m not sure how to. The mod does not have any \u0022history\u0022, rather it computes the throttle setting in real time based on your current vertical speed (for velocity hold) or distance from desired altitude (for altitude hold). This then sets the rocket throttle instantly. I\u0027m not sure how to add jet engine spooling compensation to this equation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Toolbar: This is planned for next version and is the hold up.

You\u0027re not the only one struggling with real life stuff, that\u0027s for sure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do still have this installed and I find it very useful. Hovering around is lots of fun, Landings are more controlled, and it remains very handy for spaceplane stuff. Even the vertical velocity readout by itself is great, since I don\u0027t usually need more than that (provided by mechjeb or kerbal engineer) when flying an SSTO spaceplane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegarding jet engines: When counting the thrust available from a jet engine, you wouldn\u0027t necessarily have to check its history to determine spooling status. So long as you are able to determine the \u0022actual thrust\u0022 of a jet engine at any given moment, I would think that you could use the difference between that and your \u0022desired thrust\u0022 (what is currently used to set throttle) to come up with a different throttle value. Unfortunately, I am not up to solving the math myself just now, but maybe there are some smart people over in the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forums/30-Plugin-Development-Help-and-Support\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eplugin development subforum\u003C/a\u003E that could shed light on the necessary calculations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegarding Descend from orbit: It\u0027s true, I don\u0027t tend to use the hold altitude feature for descending from orbit, but it is fun to hover over bumpy terrain with (since it uses ground height and not sea-level height). I think the concept for a \u0022descend from orbit to height/land\u0022 button is a great idea (and it actually works pretty well!) but maybe it needs to be separated into it\u0027s own window that can be accessed optionally? This way it would not be complicating the simpler \u0022near-surface\u0022 functions (zero-velocity, increment/decrement, simple hold altitude, etc.). Since it does work, I wouldn\u0027t ditch it completely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn any case, thanks for sharing this and please don\u0027t feel pressured to do more than you want to.

Technically speaking, it\u0027s possible to have it maintain one of an infinite number of horizontal vectors (East/West, 1degree/181degree), but it would then be ignoring vertical, requiring the pilot to compensate by pitching up (exact opposite of what we have now which maintains vertical, allowing pilot to pitch off vertical to control horizontal). Near airless bodies, once you\u0027ve gotten to your desired horizontal speed, there\u0027s very little change to it, so pitching up would result in no thrust for controlling vertical. The final problem, is that to control horizontal velocity this way, it would be up to the player to point the ship retrograde, which will never be perfect and require the pilot to adjust the ships heading at least once to cancel out all horizontal motion (since thrusting off vector would increase horizontal speed along another vector).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EControlling vehicle steering opens up possibilities for a horizontal autopilot: Zero your vertical velocity with the throttle autopilot, enter a horizontal speed and compass heading, then the horizontal autopilot could pitch over to (and away from to slow down) the desired direction, allowing the vertical autopilot to adjust throttle accordingly to maintain vertical speed. A \u0022Zero horizontal\u0022 function could detect the heading the vessel\u0027s surface prograde/retrograde direction is on and use that. I imagine the user touching any steering controls would immediately disengage the horizontal autopilot (steering) but leave the vertical autopilot (throttle) on. Conversly, manually adjusting the throttle might disengage just the vertical autopilot but leave the horizontal autopilot running (steering to maintain horizontal speed with whatever throttle setting is used).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know if you\u0027re interested in having the plugin take over the steering wheel, but it sounds like the way to go if you want the option to control both vertical and horizontal motion without RCS. You might also consider an RCS-based horizontal autopilot to take advantage of designs with it, even if all it does is attempt to zero out horizontal velocity on command.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll this is just fun speculation on my part. Don\u0027t feel you need to do anything else with this plugin, since it\u0027s quite awesome in its current form.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Trann","CreatedById":83801,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-31T16:42:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u00225thHorseman\u0022 data-cite=\u00225thHorseman\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI love you.
