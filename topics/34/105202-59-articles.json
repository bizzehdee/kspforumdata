Kerbals, being fairly small, obviously have shorter digestive tracts than humans. That means that, like Earth cats, they have more stringent requirements on what they can and cannot eat \u2013 particularly I\u0027d expect less tolerance of non-digestible stuffing (because they can\u0027t process it away). Things really depend on details (rats are pretty good at being highly adaptable omnivores, but they\u0027re also very small), but I wouldn\u0027t be surprised at all if they were obligate carnivores.
