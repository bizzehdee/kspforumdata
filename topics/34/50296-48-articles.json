That was without DREC. A simple set of struts stopped them from shifting around. But still running at 1120C. Not sure why that was since none of them was getting exhaust hits and they were each about 3m apart at the closest. I suspect strutting them directly might have been responsible because strange things happen with the stock heat model when heat producers have multiple adjacent parts that they transfer heat to which can then feed it back to them.
