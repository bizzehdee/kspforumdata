I\u0027ve ran into a small problem yesterday while playing Kerbal. I went into the SPH and tried to edit the what was in my container type B (KAS mod), but the Edit Container GUI wouldnt show up. After trying different save games (backtrack saves, sandbox game save and even blank save) and it had nothing to do with it. I then uninstalled and reinstalled Kerbal, then I installed KAS and everything went fine. I then added a bunch of mods (B9,TAC ls, LLL, KW, Dock align, rcs build aid, agm, etc.) and kept trying to see if i could edit containers. Everything went well till i added the tweakscale mod. Oddly everything was working fine up to yesterday, nothing was added or removed from my game for at least 2 weeks. I\u0027m using KSP 32 bit on windows, while my bro is on the 64 bit (linux) and everything works fine for him.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI went into the tweakscale mod files and edited the KAS_Tweakscale.cfg to remove the lines reffering to the containers as well as the attachment piece that goes with it, but the problem was still there. Tryed again after completely removing the cfg file, but with no success.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far i can still use both mods, but i have to either go and remove tweakscale when i want to change whats in the containers, or drop them next to the launch pad and add them manually in EVA. Any idea where i should investigate?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I found the culprit! At some point i went into VAB to build a new rover, but couldnt snap any kind of wheel anywhere until i removed tweakscale. But then the game kept replacing the M1 electric powered wheels by the M1X liquid fuel ones (from Racing Wheels mod) when i was launching the craft. Deleted the mod, then tryed again with Tweakscale and everything works just fine! That Racing wheels mod really seems buggy for the very least =/ sorry for the trouble anyway\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-08T19:17:43Z\u0022 title=\u002203/08/2015 07:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by BrainBurger\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EFound the solution\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pellinor","CreatedById":85299,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-08T12:04:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022BrainBurger\u0022 data-cite=\u0022BrainBurger\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAny idea where i should investigate?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first place I would look is search your output.log for exceptions.
