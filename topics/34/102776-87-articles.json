I\u0027ll try again.\n\nI\u0027m finding that landings using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E to land on Eli are consistently trailing to the east of the targets I\u0027ve selected. Never north or south; always east. I can see it trying to make it to the target coordinates, but it never seems to quite get there. I\u0027ve mostly been using a specific engine that I know has a little bit of throttle delay, so I\u0027m not sure if this is a factor, so will be using that as a troubleshooting tactic later today. It may be an issue of the engine struggling to keep up with the spin.\n\nI\u0027ve run the same query by the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E community, and while I\u0027ve seen some others that have had the problem with landings, I was not able to get specific feedback regarding \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E performance in NH. I\u0027m using the most updated version of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s dev versions, as they are working on the formal release of 1.3.1\u0027s fully compliant version. Whether it\u0027s a problem between the interaction of the updated Dev version of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E and the 1.3 version of NH, I cannot say. I do know that it\u0027s pulling off landings reasonably on-point on the Mun, which does lead me to agree that it may be a terrain collider and texture issue. I\u0027m aware that there is work being done on the updates for both mods, and I fully understand that these things take time.\n\nI\u0027ve hammered together a further troubleshooting list that I\u0027m going to work through, to see if the problem occurs elsewhere in the NH system of planets and will report back. If the problem is purely with Eli, then I\u0027ll channel my inner Monolith and tell my Kerbals that all of these worlds are theirs, but they are not to set foot on Eli (I could also channel my inner Mufasa, with a similar comment). If I can replicate the issues on other planets, it may be a further issue to be looked in to.\n\nCheers,"},{"CreatedByName":"MisterFister","CreatedById":85686,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-14T00:17:15Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 8 hours ago, Messernacht said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Never north or south; always east.\n\u003E \n\nAlways east by the same magnitude?

Sorting through like 15 pages on the thread was a pain, but hopefully i should be able to get everything done up soon. I\u0027m hoping to have a crack at finishing Derso (the planet which has been a placeholder up to this point) too. If you want to keep up to date you can follow the github for NH, or you can join the Kopernicus discord if you have any other issues or questions.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-12-26T06:28:03Z\u0022 title=\u002212/26/2017 06:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 26, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by KillAshley**"},{"CreatedByName":"The White Guardian","CreatedById":148627,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-26T10:19:32Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 3 hours ago, KillAshley said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E just an FYI everybody, I\u0027m back and have begun to update NH once again.\n\u003E \n\nTHE LEGEND HAS RETURNED!!! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"MinimalMinmus","CreatedById":172387,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-14T12:14:56Z","Content":"A very cool mod overall!\n\nThe only thing that bugs me is that Sonnah seems to be lit well past the terminator, and the true \u0022dark side\u0022 is quite small, covering 20% or so of the giant at best. This could be a graphical problem on my side however.\n\nAlso, for the OPM integration, how about this: Sarnus replaces Eeloo, just like in the mod, and Minmus becomes another moon (Mimas analogue?). Urlum, Neidon and Plock are pushed further than Vanor.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-01-14T13:05:22Z\u0022 title=\u002201/14/2018 01:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 14, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by MinimalMinmus**"},{"CreatedByName":"dyllanj","CreatedById":161603,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-26T07:54:11Z","Content":"Quick question, has the geostationary orbital period been changed at all due to making Kerbin a moon of Sonnah?
