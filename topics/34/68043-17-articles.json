Thanks for this! I love it. However I seem to have issues with snapping the wedges in. They are a real pain to get to click in. Am I doing something wrong? I seem to be having a lot more trouble than shown in your video.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks! Try hovering your mouse around the outer rim of a tank stacked underneath a core, that should line up the attachment nodes and they\u0027ll snap in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022IrishBandit\u0022 data-cite=\u0022IrishBandit\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThings inside the storage bay are not marked as Shielded for use with FAR, will this be fixed in a future version?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaking the bays work with FAR would mean encasing them completely in a collision mesh, meaning you wouldn\u0027t be able to stack and use them for larger payloads.

Not where the door is of course, but along the rigid side where it connects to the next wedge? Another thing I wanted to ask, is there any way to get symmetry to work with these parts? \u003Cp\u003E1) You can\u0027t place multiple wedges using symmetry\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) You can\u0027t place items into multiple storage science bays using symmetry (For example 4 good cannisters). Instead they all try to place into the same wedge\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) You can\u0027t surface mount things to the outside of the wedges using symmetry. Again they all try to attach to the same wedge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe end result of #2 and #3 is that it is very hard to get precise balance of mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I want to say sorry for sounding so demanding.

I feel like it\u0027s not really designed as if it were something intended to operate in space. For example, there are plants only on one side, where in a zero G environment you\u0027d use every available inch, probably fitting stacked rings of nutrient tubes which would allow the crops to grow in all directions equally. While we\u0027re at it, you\u0027d probably not want to have a huge exposed area like that, as solar radiation is quite a bit more intense without the atmosphere to filter it, meaning at most you\u0027d probably want a few small windows and if you were going to use proper sunlight you\u0027d be much more likely to pipe it throughout the unit with fiber optic cables than you would to just throw open the shutters. In this way you could filter out harmful cosmic radiation while also ensuring even light distribution. Anyway, I know there was a lot of love poured into this model, I just think it could be done with a little more thought to the way a greenhouse would really be implemented in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are a couple of examples of layouts which would greatly improve use of space, even if they were applied to the current model:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Mp71-p2jB8I/TUSbXhG9sPI/AAAAAAAABTQ/UB3iBATEBJE/s320/tour2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022tour2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cdn.architecturelab.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/vertical-farm-vancouver.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022vertical-farm-vancouver.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea is that since gravity isn\u0027t required for proper plant growth, you should lay things out so you have the maximum number of plants with the maximum amount of space in which to grow. A central pillar with planters which is also surrounded by walls of planters would do just that. Such a greenhouse could also be fairly easily converted for surface use, especially if the planters are toroidal, as nutrient baths could still be administered while under the effects of gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AdmiralTigerclaw","CreatedById":92104,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-27T10:24:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf such a thing has dual support for ECLSS, I\u0027d be happy.
