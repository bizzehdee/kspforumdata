I have been able to run my game for hours on end while alt-tabbing and doing things in the background....like looking stuff up on the Internet, and then returning to the game and playing for more hours....not one crash to desktop. No matter how many ships I build or how many times I revert flights back to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E (that was typically when my game would decide to crash).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI solved it because the only thing consistent with every crash dump file generated was xinput1_3.dll in the error log generated with the crash dump file. Xinput1_3.dll was always the first module listed in the error log. I sent you one of my error logs several days ago. I typically only had one to three modules listed and xinput1_3.dll was the only consistent module.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of the mods I have consistently run since I started playing the game is this one. I do so because I cannot fly planes well without some sort of stick to fly with. I am not a fan of arrow keys for flying a plane, or w, a, s, d....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not writing this here because this mod is causing the crashing. The crashes happened without this mod installed. They happen without any mods installed. Now that I isolated the issue to xinput1_3.dll, I\u0027ve done some Internet searching and if you Google just \u0022xinput crashing game\u0022 you\u0027ll find that simply having an xbox controller plugged into your computer has somehow caused some games to crash historically (I was not aware of this).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI want to say I have had crashes without it plugged in that still involved xinput1_3.dll, but I can\u0027t honestly remember for sure at this point. I typically just leave my xbox controller plugged in regardless if I am using it or not, because so many computer games support one at this point that I use it frequently.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce I started pinpointing this as the issue I did a file search on my C drive for xinput1_3.dll and realized it was installed in several different places. There is normally an around 80KB 32bit version in syswow64 and an around 105KB 64bit version in your system32 Windows folders if you have Windows 10. I noticed KSP has two identical 80KB versions(meaning they are both probably 32 bit) in the data/plugin folders for both the 32bit and 64bit data folders. I found it odd that the 64bit version of the game has a potentially 32bit file in it. Some other games I have installed from Steam also seem to supply an xinput1_3.dll, like Witcher 3.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I still don\u0027t grasp is why in ALL my crash logs it lists the file location of xinput1_3.dll as C:\\WINDOWS\\SYSTEM32. Since system32 is the 64bit folder for windows the file size is listed as the larger version and says it\u0027s 107368 bytes. Why it doesn\u0027t make sense to me is as I stated KSP has two identical copies of it included when you install it, and they are both around 80KB. Shouldn\u0027t the game be running the xinput1_3.dll file installed with the game and not the one in my Windows folder?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I ended up doing because of this (since I don\u0027t program or know how to tell KSP to utilize one file instead of another file) is rename the 105KB xinput1_3.dll fille in my Windows system32 folder and then copy the 80KB xinput1_3.dll file from the KSP_x64_data\\plugins folder into my system32 folder. I understand this is a really poor decision because you shouldn\u0027t mess with your Windows files in general. It\u0027s especially bad in this case because as I stated the game seems to have two copies of the 32bit version and I just copied one to my 64bit Windows folder. I imagine I will need to reverse this change if I want my xbox controller to work or not crash other 64bit games I play in the future.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat being said, since I did that the game has been totally stable despite me having so many mods installed. I did notice it takes several seconds longer when I return to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E now, but I can live with it taking several seconds to load the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E if it\u0027s not crashing to desktop instead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of the threads I have found since making this change that was about xinput crashing games in general recommend running the game in Windows 8 compatibility mode. I suppose I should revert the file swap I made and see if that works instead....If that worked it could be less foolish in the long run. To be honest though, I have never had much success with windows compatability mode actually making games function better. It seems to be pretty much hit or miss, and often doesn\u0027t do anything....at least for me the times I have tried using it on a game shortcut due to the game frequently crashing or something.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of the reasons I wrote all this here was to ask if you know of a way to make this mod use the xinput1_3.dll file included with KSP. I noticed this mod puts some dll files in the main KSP folder instead of in the GameData folder....Do you think it would use it if I copied a copy of xinput1_3.dll\u00A0there instead? I suppose I could just try that instead of asking your opinion, lol....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also just wanted to get back to you about seeming to solve my crashing in general. Since you manage so many mods for KSP and so many issues can arise with the game, I figured you enjoy finding solutions to things and solving problems in general....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaving the game crash to desktop after playing for 5-10 minutes is a fairly aggravating issue....especially since the game takes about that long to reload after it crashes....I was about at the point where I was just going to be done playing the game at all....I have like 200 other Steam games I could be playing instead....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"linuxgurugamer","CreatedById":129964,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-07-30T12:52:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223424544\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022175359\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221532954729\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022189611\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022JoE Smash\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 minute ago, JoE Smash said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/129964-linuxgurugamer/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022129964\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/129964-linuxgurugamer/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@linuxgurugamer\u003C/a\u003E,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I believe I finally solved all my crashing issues with the game.
