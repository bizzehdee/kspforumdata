I\u0027ve noticed that at the moment LV-N and real fuels don\u0027t get along very well. In standard KSP you attach an LV-N to a standard (big!) tank and get very good delta-v because of the high Isp. But if you use real fuels then the tank is full of liquid H2 (which is realistic) with a very low density. The result is that the fuel mass/tank mass ratio is only a bit better than 1. For example, a NovaPunch HH-375-C tank full of LiquidH2 has a dry mass of 4.9662 t and a full mass of only 11.0649 t. So the high Isp doesn\u0027t translate into high delta-v because the empty tanks are too heavy. The result is that, as far as I can tell, you can never get a better delta-v with an LV-N than you can with an efficient H2/LOX engine and the same number of tanks if you are using real fuels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the real NERVA project the NERVA stage was projected to have an empty mass (engine and tanks) of about 34 tonnes and a full mass of 178 tonnes. I calculate its delta-v at an impressive 13 000 m/s. Even with a 20 tonne payload it would have a delta-v of 10 000 m/s. Now for KSP this would have to be scaled for game balance because of the smaller solar system. But still, to have the LV-N beat chemical rockets using liquid H2 you need fuel tanks with much lower empty mass. I\u0027m going to make them for myself by editing .cfg files. But a worthwhile addition to some mod (maybe real fuels, since it only comes up with liquidH2 fueling the LV-N) would be a large, thin-walled tank (low impact tolerance, low mass) intended for nuclear engines. It\u0027s not an issue in regular KSP because you use a higher density fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ialdabaoth","CreatedById":57270,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-25T22:14:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022HoneyFox\u0022 data-cite=\u0022HoneyFox\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell that shouldn\u0027t be a big problem if we play effect at different places with different power values.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn Effects has a single power level.
