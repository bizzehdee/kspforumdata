Copy it out, open it in VAB, make the changes then go back to the external program to swap out the modified craft in the save. Might get a bit tricky for several things docked together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo be able to do that with landed crafts it would have to be able to save the position/rotation values of what it\u0027s overwriting, and doing anything which alters the distance of the COM from the lowest parts would very likely result in an intersection with the ground or having the craft dropping a ways.
