It looks like that particular message will log when no model exists, but it should not have any other impacts, as long as you\u0027re not trying to access crew info on the vessel.  It should sort itself out once the internalModel is loaded, as long as RPM receives an OnVesselChange, OnVesselWasModified, or OnVesselCrewWasModified callback.\n\nThe log suggests RPM thinks everything else is running normally - I see messages as monitors are being manipulated.  The problem may be that there\u0027s no Kerbal in the craft, since RPM reduces computational overhead by not doing certain updates if no one is in a particular pod / IVA.
