That\u0027s not counting any lights or other other superfluous things. it takes about 10 min in 64bit just to load the part. i have not successfully been able to launch the ship as every time i go to launch it everything laggs down to about 1 frame for every 2 seconds. i have the feeling im just at the upper limits of what the game can handle at all. try launching this ship without welding and even i can kiss an hour of my life goodby to loading and the crashing... its containing the large stock square surface(.... tons), huge orange tanks with LF and oxidizer, SAS, and monoprop fuel any idea?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EErrr...

I have just quite literally stumbled, totally by accident, on this mod. The premise is such a good idea.

It wasn\u0027t terrible, but it was obviously under some strain.
