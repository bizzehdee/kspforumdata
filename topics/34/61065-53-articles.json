All aboard, rendezvous, home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETurns out Bob is awarded \u0022First Kerbal to set foot on the Mun\u0022 (because he was the first to take an EVA report). I guess planting a flag as an action isn\u0027t on the \u0022first\u0022 list? Could \u0022landed at\u0022 be used, such that literally the first footsteps on a planet would be used as criteria instead of \u0022first to complete an EVA activity (except flagplacing) on xyz planet\u0022? You get my drift here, yeah?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClearly a bug. EVA and Plant Flag not detected. Will take a look into this ASAP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: not reproducable. But in my current build landings are not recognized anymore. Have to fix this before I can release the next version. Changed some log level to analyze this further.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT2: 0.90 seems to generate more vessel situation changed events sometimes (or everytime?). This may have caused a missed EVA event, too.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-29T21:51:59Z\u0022 title=\u002212/29/2014 09:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 29, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Nereid\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dragonchampion","CreatedById":115668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-29T19:39:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENereid, is there any plans to have ribbons give experience bonuses, or even better, experience modifiers?
