Then, when you launch your ship, use a steeper angle than you normally would for the most fuel-efficient launch trajectory (something like be at 15,000 meters at 90 degrees or so). Also try to go a bit higher than minimum orbit (rather than 71-72k altitude, go to 78-80k or more). These two methods will give you a longer time within LoS of Mission Control. Actually you don\u0027t even need to do those, but they make things easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you ascend, switch to map view to keep an eye on your apoapsis. Once your apoapsis is where you want it to be, immediately turn on your flight computer and click the GRD \u002B button so the FC keeps the nose of your ship pointed in the right direction. Now create a maneuver node at your apoapsis for a circularization burn. Quickly click NODE then EXEC on the Flight Computer. Then sit back and let the FC do the rest. If you do this quick enough you should still be well within LoS communication range of Mission Control. Coasting to apoapsis and trying to do the circularization burn yourself is a recipe for disaster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt also helps to add a Communotron 16 to your ship and assign it to Action Group 1.
