Virtually any plug-in that has actual code in it is going to need an update to work in 1.1.  Mod authors know this, and they know that they will have to do some work in order to make their stuff functional in 1.1.  How long it will take will depend on the mod (some will be easier to update than others) and on the mod author\u0027s schedule (they\u0027re doing this for free, in their spare time, to give you this cool stuff out of the goodness of their hearts, and the author may or may not have time to drop everything and update the mod right away).\n\nSo if you have any questions around this (or *\u003Cu\u003Eany\u003C/u\u003E* mod) with respect to 1.1, here\u0027s a handy FAQ:\n\n- **\u0022Does  work in 1.1?\u0022**  Probably not.\n- **\u0022When will a 1.1-compatible version of  be ready?\u0022**  It\u0027ll be ready whenever the mod author has the time and inclination to update it.\n- **\u0022So how will I know when it\u0027s ready?\u0022**  When the mod author tells you that it is (for example, by posting an announcement in the mod\u0027s thread).\n\nIn other words... just take it easy, please?  Mod threads like this one are great places for giving feedback (about how much you love the mod, or what features you\u0027d like to see, or whatever), or for asking questions about how to use the mod.  However, asking for updates is typically not helpful."},{"CreatedByName":"worsin","CreatedById":147746,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-01T16:55:13Z","Content":"Yeah the main reason this mod doesn\u0027t work with 1.1 is the UI changes that were made to KSP.  \n\nAny mod that uses the Parts UI is going to be broken till its updated so with this mod the TweakScale Slider doesn\u0027t show."},{"CreatedByName":"FreeThinker","CreatedById":117389,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-04T11:11:34Z","Content":"I hope pellinor is on it.
