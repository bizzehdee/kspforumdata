For space telescopes this is obviously a problem because extra weight in general is bad. But it also becomes difficult for any system to support all of that weight. A lens can only be supported along its edges, so very large lenses tend to sag a little bit in the middle, affecting the refraction of light. It is also much more likely that large lenses will contain imperfections or tiny bubbles in the glass that distort the light.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReflecting telescopes, on the other hand, use a mirror, which can be supported along its entire back side and is made of a much thinner layer of glass coated with a very thin reflective layer. This allows for much larger and lighter telescopes to be created and is ideal for large space telescopes like the 2.4m Hubble (which is supposedly similar in size and construction to the Key Hole spy satellites, of which there are generally five or six in orbit), and the 3.5m Herschel space telescope . There are several terrestrial telescopes with a single mirror of around 8m in diameter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe support system for the mirror also allows for some rather interesting applications, such as intentionally creating small distortions in the shape of the mirror. This can be used to account for atmospheric distortion in surface based telescopes and greatly increases the quality of the images collected.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMirrors also allow for segmented construction; using several smaller mirrors positioned to focus light onto a single secondary mirror. This allows for the construction of much larger telescopes, as single mirrors become impractical above 5-8m in diameter. This is also, again, useful for space telescopes, as the mirrors can be folded up to fit inside of a smaller fairing then unfurled to create a very large aperture, such as the 18-segment, 6.5m James Webb Telescope.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is one obvious drawback to using mirrors as the primary element of a telescope. In most designs the light is reflected off of the primary mirror and onto a secondary mirror placed directly in front of it. This means that some of the light is blocked by the secondary mirror itself as well as its support structures. This reduces the overall sensitivity of the telescope and introduces some optical artifacts. The braces holding the secondary mirror in place are responsible for the X-shaped, bright lines of light visible in some of the brighter stars in the Hubble image below.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe typical, camera-style telescope records images by focusing light collected by the mirrors onto an array of CCD detectors. These simply collect light within some certain range of wavelengths. Through the use of filter wheels, where individual filters that block or allow the passage of certain wavelengths of light can be quickly rotated in front of the detectors, more selective images can be recorded.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen color photos from Hubble or other space telescopes and cameras are released you are actually seeing a composite of several images taken through a number of filters (this is why objects might have fuzzy, or rainbow-like edges). These are combined to give either a \u0022true-color\u0022 representation of the image, or a \u0022false-color\u0022 composite, where several, normally-invisible wavelengths are shown with arbitrarily chosen colors.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe could stare at Hubble images all day, but instead here is something from the not-nearly-given-enough-attention Herschel telescope showing an IR view of the top of the Horsehead Nebula, compared with the visible/near-IR view from Hubble on the right. The blue, green, and red colors represent different IR wavelengths, and the pink shows the areas with brightest emissions, indicating newly formed stars.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00228e1cU5A.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8e1cU5A.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOther Imaging Systems\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese kinds of large aperture telescopes are common for optical, near-infrared, and ultraviolet astronomy. But there are a number of other types of imaging systems used for observations throughout the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ERadio Telescopes\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the low energy end of the spectrum, radio waves, it is possible to build absurdly large telescopes like the Arecibo Observatory with its 305m reflector. Radio telescopes don\u0027t require a solid mirror, only a metallic mesh, making construction of such large devices much simpler. It is also possible to combine observations from several telescopes to increase the effective resolution. The Very Large Array uses 27 25m dishes that can be independently moved and have the resolution of a 36km diameter dish (though not nearly the sensitivity of such a large dish).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EHigh Energy Telescopes\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHigh energy photons require some very different techniques to capture usable data. X-rays cannot practically be focused by any standard mirror or lens, they would simply absorb or be transparent to X-rays. Something called a Wolter telescope is used at these wavelengths; these instruments use mirrors at very low incident angles (normal telescope mirrors/lenses are set at nearly 90\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003E to the incoming light) to reflect x-rays to a single focal point. Because these mirrors can only reflect X-rays at around 2-3\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003E they have a very narrow field-of-view, but by combining several mirrors can still produce very valuable data.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGamma Ray telescopes don\u0027t really have any method of focusing or altering the path of gamma ray photons. They instead rely on mathematically reconstructing the path of the photon as it passes through several layers of the detector. They have very low resolution but a very wide field-of-view.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESpectroscopy\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnlike the camera-like telescopes discussed above, there are a number of spectrographic imaging systems designed to give a more detailed analysis of the distribution of wavelengths recorded in an image. Rather than collect an entire image, possible using filtered light, these instruments look at a limited segment of an image while separating the incoming light into its component wavelengths.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs an example, the Cassini Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS), one of the instruments that my imaging platform is based on, uses several spectrographs to collect visible and infrared light. This system uses a narrow slit to only allow a thin line of light to pass through. A diffraction grating then reflects that single strip of light, separating the component wavelengths like a prism, which then fall on the detector. This essentially takes a single column of light and creates a two-dimensional image, recording how much of each wavelength is present in each row of that column.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy sliding the slit one step to the side (or moving the mirror to accomplish the same effect) another image is recorded, after repeating this several times the entire field-of-view is captured, creating a kind-of three dimensional recording. In one dimension you have each row of light, from top to bottom, in the second you have each column, capturing the entire field of view as it passes in front of the diffraction grating, and in the third you have the entire recorded spectrum of light for each row and column of light.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese kinds of data allow for a very detailed look within a range of the electromagnetic spectrum. In particular they can be used to identify the surface or atmospheric composition. Elements on the surface will absorb and reflect certain wavelengths of light dependent upon their composition. Elements in the atmosphere can block or allow the transmission of light as it passes through.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA particular method for studying atmospheres is to conduct solar or stellar occultation observations. The imaging system is first pointed at the sun or a bright star. As a planet moves into view its atmosphere will begin to come between the imager and the star. At first only the thin upper layers are recorded, but gradually the deeper layers of the atmosphere pass between the two. Data can be collected throughout the atmosphere, allowing for a recording of each layer\u0027s composition based on the wavelengths of light absorbed or transmitted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA similar technique is used for studying events like the cryovolcanism on Enceladus or the composition of Saturn\u0027s rings. The two images of Enceladus below demonstrate this: the first clearly shows geysers erupting from the surface, the second shows Saturn\u0027s faint E-ring backlit by the sun (this isn\u0027t exactly a solar occultation, because the sun is actually behind Saturn); the ring is probably generated by the materials being vented from Enceladus, the bright object visible in the middle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022VFYHAxD.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VFYHAxD.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis image reveals the many layers of a small segment of Titan\u0027s atmosphere taken during a close encounter by Cassini. Spectroscopic images will reveal the composition of each layer of the atmosphere by recording the wavelengths of light absorbed and comparing that to the known behavior of compounds that could be found in the atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022AtIDXs1.jpg?1\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/AtIDXs1.jpg?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext time we\u0027ll look at some of the rover-based instruments and how they work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-03T19:25:50Z\u0022 title=\u002203/03/2016 07:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 3, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by DMagic\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Elinks\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
