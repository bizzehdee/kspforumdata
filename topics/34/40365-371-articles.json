Forget tritium decay, I don\u0027t like to achieve anything by just time warping personally - if that\u0027s all it takes I may as well just enable it in the VAB and be done with it. That tiny bit in Jool\u0027s atmosphere is an engineering challenge that\u0027s quite different to what stock KSP provides. Yes interstellar gives resource harvesting on planets, but really landing a refinery isn\u0027t much different to landing a \u0027for-the-hell-of-it\u0027 base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I too am very disappointed in the returns from He3 in fusion... as has been stated, the 2.5m is utterly useless and can\u0027t even power itself and the 3.75m isn\u0027t much better. The smaller two do make good use of it, but the gains between the incredibly easy Deuterium/Tritium fuel and difficult He3 are only measured in rather small numbers (about \u002B30% on the 1.25m for example). In short, really not worth it. If the larger two didn\u0027t have the weird reductions then maybe for serious power stations the \u002B~30% gain might be useful to some people, but even then, far easier just to add another reactor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat we have all forgotten, myself included however, is the Antimatter Initiated Reactor. Up until I returned some He3 to Kerbin today I haven\u0027t even been able to test it, and I get the feeling that\u0027s the case for a lot of people (a lot of info about it is missing online as well). Basically it uses 4 resources: Deuterium, He3, UN and Anti Matter. Deuterium comes with 500/500 and He3 must be provided as it starts with 0/500. Both are the \u0027main\u0027 fuel for the reactor and are consumed at the same rate. It took about 191 days @ 100% power to exhaust them (sorry, no qualitative figures yet, experiment results only). UN is provided at 20/20. In the 191 days this figure didn\u0027t even move. The wiki shows tiny, tiny amounts being used. The initial fuel will likely last many, many full cycles of the main fuel. Anti Matter isn\u0027t provided either and must be stored in a separate tank. In 191 days only 0.01 grams had been used, meaning even the tiny 1g bottle would last for many, many refuels of D/He3. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo other than providing a tiny quantity of AntiMatter, it\u0027s basically a Deuterium/He3 reactor and it\u0027s really quite good. 44 GW is a really very nice chunk of power, better than any Fusion or Fission reactor. It can put most of this out as charge particles too to take advantage of direct conversion generators. The core temperature is a little lower than the larger fusion reactors but better than small fusion and all fission so should give decent thermal rocket ISP. The main selling point though is the vastly tonnage compared to similar performance reactors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDeuterium can also be scooped from Jool, allowing both to be refilled at once.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot 100% sure what I\u0027m going to do with it yet... it might be the solution for a long-distance mothership that has to operate away from the power grid?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"phoenix_ca","CreatedById":50380,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-12T10:42:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Atrius129\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Atrius129\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWouldn\u0027t the answer to all of this He3 business be to fix tritium decay on an unfocused vessel?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKinda sorta.

A ship in orbit of Jool when Jool is at it\u0027s closest approach to Kerbin is able to pick up about 30% of Kerbin\u0027s power network per large receiver and only about 1% per medium receiver. Considering how awkward large receivers are to work with this is a major pain in the ass. Planets like Jool and Dres when on anything other than the closest alignment aren\u0027t going receive any significant kind of power even on a large receiver and the easier to place mediums are only going to provide okay power to the inner planets on close approach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is of course an argument for building more power stations around other planets.
