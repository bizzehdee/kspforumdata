First is the Option to have FPSViewer and PhysicalTimeRatioViewer not be centered vertically. I\u0027d like to put them all the way at the top of my screen, but can\u0027t because their (invisible) display box is too tall so it stops short. You can see this when only current FPS is enabled, and max and min displays are disabled.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I second this.\n\u003E I have some more requests:\n\u003E \n\u003E 1) please make **FPS viewer text aligned left,** not centered. This way it is easier for eyes (digits do not move from side to side).\n\nI got something for this already in the works.\n\n\u003E Second is to reduce the refresh rate of PhysicalTimeRatioViewer to once every second. Right now it feels too fast. Perhaps synched with FPSViwer\u0027s refreshes?\n\nWith the next update you can define the refresh rate in the settings.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E 2) please **fix FPS limiter so it is still possible to use Physical Wrap when KSP is minimized.** Currently it sets physical time to ~100% when minimized, despite I\u0027ve set 4x Physical Wrap, and it doesn\u0027t matter what target FPS I set...\n\nThis is a Unity/KSP limitation. The graphics and physics engine run both in the same thread which on low frame rates cause \u0022the time to slow down\u0022. Nothing i can do on my end. The same applies to the fps as in if the physics take too long the fps drop down and that\u0027s why large crafts usually cause lower fps.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E 3) option to disable FPS Limiter completely in game\n\nAs in don\u0027t limit at all ? Or just revert back to game settings?\n\n\u003E \n\u003E 3) sincerely I much, much prefer **more compact UI,** say, like in MechJeb. Screen real estate is precious. As for toolbar - QuickGoTo mod is silver standard of how sub-toolbar might look like IME :-)4\n\nI personally don\u0027t like the MechJeb UI much seems very cluttered and sticks out of the games UI. But i do understand the request for a more compact view of things. As for the toolbar this will change in the future this is basically still a \u0022prototype\u0022 and still open for many many changes.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Also I\u0027d like to know what **exactly** \u0022Use VSync\u0022 does. I prefer my VSync to occur every 2nd VBlank, and it is set so in KSP options. What about the behaviour of that knob in FPS Limiter, then?\n\nDepending on the frame rate that it\u0027s set to: nothing, normal VSync@60 and 2nd VBlank@30.\n\nI\u0027m generally overwriting the game settings so anything that is set there (FPS limit/VSync) will get overwritten.\n\n\u003E And one more thing: when I open KerboKatz toolbar in VAB, and, not closing it, go to launch - it stays at the bottom, it doesn\u0027t move to the upper right where the stock toolbar (and KerboKatz button) moves... This is not handy.\n\nThat\u0027s an issue that i have encountered as well. I have a workaround ready for this as in the window gets closed and has to be opened again using the new position."},{"CreatedByName":"cipherpunks","CreatedById":114858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T07:11:41Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E As in don\u0027t limit at all ?
