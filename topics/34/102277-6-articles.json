It makes more sense now that I understand it. It\u0027s also more complex than what I was looking for.*\n\nSo ok - in the original post it explains it as - (really sorry I misunderstood this the first time I read it...)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Your vessels will be able to keep their rotation relatively to any celestial body. This means you can build Space Stations that follow the planets curvature they are orbiting, but also ships in orbit around any planet always pointing to Kerbol (for best efficiency of solar panels, for example). This doesn\u0027t only work in Timewarp, but also the SAS will do the same in Realtime as long as you have a body selected.\n\u003E 0.4.0\n\u003E \n\u003E - Vessels can rotate relatively to any celestial body in Timewarp and using the SAS in Realtime.\n\nSo that\u0027s fantastic! So sorry I doubted it was there! Trying to wrap my head around this in my own words...as soon as I set a \u0022BODY RELATIVE ROTATION\u0022 my craft initiates a tiny rotation that ensures my orientation to it\u0027s center does not change. And by using SAS to eliminate any other rotation my craft may have on it, this rotation (and thus orientation) is preserved throughout a time-warp. I absolutely love it! ...I do also realize that I wish the UI had wrapped my head around this concept earlier but in hindsight I\u0027m not certain how it would look in order to accomplish that. Maybe some additional SAS mode buttons? Matching their style and hover-text, the top one could say \u0022Match Rotation of Current Body,\u0022 a second could be, \u0022Match Rotation of Target Body,\u0022 the 3rd button, when clicked, would allow you to specify which body?\nConclusions:\n\n- I am certain you already know this but a way to hide the window is critical\n- Ideally, \\*one\\* of the ways to hide the window could be a button on a toolbar, and if Blizzy\u0027s Toolbar was an \\*option\\* that would be helpful to people who like to clean up their stock toolbar\n- I\u0027m going to keep this installed so I can report back any additional appreciation, bugs, or suggestions - I love the concepts\n- I do hope you continue to work on it and improve its flexibility - options I\u0027m certain people will want/require:  \n\n    - \u0022With a config, I can setup Persistent Rotation to just persist my rotation in Time-Warp - I don\u0027t need or want any windows, gravitational messages, crew danger, or body relative rotation\u0022\n    - \u0022I love it but wish it didn\u0027t kill my crew\u0022\n    - \u0022I love it but wish I could set it up and hide the window for the rest of my game play\u0022\n\nThanks man!

I do now see that the whole situation is quite complex. Let me walk through it so others can riff on it (or rip it up) in their own minds.\n\nFirst, let me try to explain in hindsight what I thought I wanted and why I was convinced it wasn\u0027t there. I\u0027ll do this by looking at the existing SAS Modes:\n\n[1] Top Row - Stability Assist \u0026 Maneuver\n\n- Not In Time-Warp: Both of these modes lock my vessel\u0027s orientation to a direction, a point in space, that does not move. The orientation of my craft, and the direction my craft is pointing in space, stays static. My craft does not rotate, even though the world rotates around me.\n- In Time-Warp: Exactly the same as non-warp. Since stock Time-Warp kills rotation, but no rotation needed to be retained in order to maintain the expected behavior, everything works as expected here regardless of warp.\n- Expected Default Behavior w/ PersistentRotation installed: No change - and no option to persist a rotation while in this mode or it would mess up the function of this SAS mode?\n- Actual Default-Behavior w/ w/ PersistentRotation installed: No change - but there is an option to persist a rotation while in this mode - I can\u0027t think of a use case for this but I\u0027m likely missing something. Handle some other way? These SAS modes seems very specific to not rotating. To Persist a Rotation while in these SAS modes breaks their intended purpose.\n\n[2] Second Row - Prograde \u0026 Retrograde\n\n- Not In Time-Warp: Both of these modes lock my vessel\u0027s orientation to a vector which changes as the position of my craft orbits. Even while in a circular orbit the direction of \u0022Prograde\u0022 changes. While not in Time-Warp, the stock game uses a continuous application of reaction wheels to constantly correct my orientation to be the current prograde.\n- In Time-Warp: Since stock Time-Warp kills rotation, and rotation is needed in order to preserve the orientation to Prograde, the desired rotation is not preserved while in warp.\n- Expected Default Behavior w/ PersistentRotation installed: Persist a constant tiny rotation that preserves the crafts orientation with the prograde marker. This is simple in a circular orbit as the direction of the prograde marker changes consistently throughout a single orbit. In an elliptical orbit the rotation isn\u0027t constant and would require changes along the orbit in order to match the prograde orientation at any point. I have no idea how PersistentRotation would/should handle this. If there is a way to program it then prograde orientation should be held and some resource utilization could/should technically be used up to account for the corrections along the way. But mostly I\u0027d personally love it to just maintain prograde without regard for resource usage. ...then there are gravitation sphere of influence changes...I haven\u0027t thought through those but I suspect that they change the definition of what prograde is and thus create a big problem. What would be expected here?\n- Actual Default-Behavior w/ w/ PersistentRotation installed: Nearly identical to the expected behavior described BUT it requires you to choose your parent body before it\u0027ll behave that way. Perhaps because of the drawbacks I described of other usage scenarios.\n\n[3] Third Row - Normal \u0026 Anti-Normal\n\n- Stock Behavior !In Time-Warp: Holds direction of Normal or Anti-Normal which does not change. What does change is that my craft\u0027s orientation towards the body I am orbiting is changing. But in reality, my craft isn\u0027t changing it\u0027s position, the world is rotating around it.\n- Stock Behavior In Time-Warp: Same as non-time-warp behavior. Craft is fixed in orientation, thus things rotate around the craft but the craft doesn\u0027t persist any rotation.\n- PersistentRotation Expected Default Behavior: This is an interesting one but given that the non-warp behavior doesn\u0027t persist any rotation then I have to go with warp isn\u0027t supposed to be rotating. But I totally buy that there should be an option to persist a rotation (a roll) in order to maintain a constant orientation to the parent body. ...that means we\u0027d end up with a lot of questions about what to do about non-standard orbits.\n- PersistentRotation Actual Default Behavior: No persistent rotation as desired. Option to persist a rotation as desired. Win!\n\n[4] Fourth Row - Radial \u0026 Anti-Radial\n\n- Stock Behavior !In Time-Warp: Holds direction of Radial or Anti-Radial which changes as my craft orbits.\n- Stock Behavior In Time-Warp: Just like other modes that move while I orbit (Prograde/Retrograde), time-warp doesn\u0027t persist a rotation to keep up. Nor does a single constant time-warp suffice if I\u0027m in a non-circularized orbit.\n- PersistentRotation Expected Default Behavior: Ideally this would work by persisting a rotation to keep the craft oriented the same way it is during non-warp.\n- PersistentRotation Actual Default Behavior: Requires user to choose to persist a rotation. Doesn\u0027t have a mechanism to handle non-circularized orbits. Just like Prograde/Retrograde.\n\n[5] Fifth Row - Target \u0026 Anti-Target\n\n- Skipping this one as it may be more complex and either way I\u0027ve made my primary point already.\n\n**A solution? Additional SAS Mode Options?**\n\nYou\u0027ll see above that my expectation is that with PersistentRotation installed I would expect the default behavior in warp to match the stock behavior in non-warp. This gives us a good guide for default Persistent Rotation behavior imo. Now UI could reflect this behavior somehow - indicating this functionality amongst the stock UI has the added benefit over just unexpected \u0022default behavior\u0022 because it communicates to a user that something is happening different from stock.\n\nI think it\u0027s fair to say that the craft must have SAS engaged in order to persist a rotation that keeps the craft oriented in relation to another body. So making the BODY RELATIVE ROTATION options SAS modes makes some sense.\n\nPerhaps there are only two at the bottom of the current options:\n\n![05.11.2015-00.12.png](http://content.screencast.com/users/AndyB/folders/Snagit/media/2d42906c-e8a4-48e0-9988-a9054ea413a6/05.11.2015-00.12.png)\n\nPerhaps there is a 3rd circle to the right which allows you to open a menu and select any body?\n\nOnce these options were there, the \u0022maintain orientation with parent body\u0022 could be ticked on automatically when the user selected other modes such as Prograde, Retrograde, Radial, and Anti-Radial. By doing so, the default behavior in time-warp would match the stock behavior of non-warp. And other visuals could be done to represent the reality, if the player had Stability selected and turned on Match Parent Body Rotation, it would turn off Stability I would think. It\u0027s too bad Stability doesn\u0027t function more like a \u0022Kill-Rot\u0022 - then it might still make some sense to keep it on while you selected Match Parent Body Rotation.\n\nAnyway, this turned into something much longer than expected so I\u0027ll let it go at this. Hopefully the idea is spelled out enough to mix and mingle with other ideas."},{"CreatedByName":"MarkusA380","CreatedById":45759,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T04:27:38Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Can\u0027t remove this Persistence window.
