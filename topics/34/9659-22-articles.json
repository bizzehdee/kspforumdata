It then calls the method obj.GetComponent\u0026lt;MeshFilter\u0026gt;(), which returns the MeshFilter object if attached, or null if there is not an instance attached. The problem is that a some point (probably in onPartAwake(), where I understand the object may not actually be built when this method is called) the colliderizeChilds(Transform obj) tries to tell Unity to instantiate the \u0027mesh\u0027 variable contained within the attached MeshFilter, but there is no MeshFilter attached at that time (the reference is null).
