I\u0027m pretty sure \u0022EditorLogic\u0022 regards the KSP editor in general, not the changes to it made by EE (Which aren\u0027t very extensive, btw). If you look at other mods\u0027 threads, you will see most of the logs being posted are throwing \u0022EditorLogic\u0022 problems, but proportionally speaking, \u0022none\u0022 of those problems has anything to do with EE (or whatever mod the log is posted on) or changes introduced by it (/them).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0027s causing the issue? I don\u0027t know! But the fact is that you can use the mod just fine in a new game, so the problem lies in the transition between the format the data was saved with on the old x32-only format and the new x32/x64 (interchangeable) format. Squad warned us all that the update would be a big one and that a lot of things with the transition from the old to the new version of KSP were probably going to be messy, so starting a new game was recommended. And that\u0027s exactly what\u0027s happening: There is noting exceptionally wrong with KSP or the mods that inherently breaks the current system. It\u0027s when the old system is involved that things start going wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Small note here: I\u0027m playing KSP x64, and, aside from EE and MM that I already had installed, I\u0027ve installed a few more mods, like FAR, JointReinforcement, MechJeb, TimeControl, RealChute, HyperEdit, RealFuels, RSS, and a few more minor ones. I installed them one by one and started a new game for each new one. I\u0027ve been playing for the past 3 hours on this same config without a single crash or even a hiccup for that matter, and so I dare say: My KSP has never run so stable with so many mods!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t worry! The devs (both Squad and mod devs) will figure and sort things out! But they need time to do that! And all this fuzz on the forums, with people posting error-logs in the wrong mod\u0027s thread (if there is any right thread in the first place, since most logs I\u0027ve seen so far are KSP errors related to the transition in general), or worse still, simply saying \u0022your mod is broken\u0022 or \u0022my game crashes because of your mod\u0022, is not going to help!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike I said...Have patience. Test your most essential mods, installing one at a time, and play a new campaing of \u0022KSP-stockish\u0022 for a little while, like one or two weeks. If you find any bugs on that time, report them. When you are feeling lucky, update the mods and try your old saves again; And if they don\u0027t work, actually google up some parts of the stack-trace and try to figure out what is the actual origin of the problem before going to the forums; If you can\u0027t figure it out, it\u0027s fine, at least you\u0027ve tried. But when the last pages of pretty much all mods\u0027 threads are filled with logs that have noting that actually points to the mod being the problem, that in itself becomes a problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBest regards. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-27T01:42:43Z\u0022 title=\u002207/27/2014 01:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 27, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by AlmightyR\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RedAV8R","CreatedById":94171,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-27T03:57:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@AlmighyR.

EditorLogic is the name of one of the core game\u0027s objects. This mod is working fine in KSP 0.24.2 for lots of people so there is something else wrong... You should be aware that the 64 bit version of KSP is known to have quite a number of serious bugs that often cause crashes. Also, 0.24.2 in general (e.g. both 32 and 64 bit) also has some serious bugs that can make it look like mods are causing problems but in reality it is the core game causing problems for the mods.\u003Cp\u003ETry posting a complete output_log.txt...\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve noticed that KSPx64 loves to crash a random plugin. Generally it seems that unity fails to load a file as it is trying to address said file. It has been something I\u0027ve had to live with. x64 will improve in time, maybe in the future KSP will be compiled to run on the soon to be released Unity 5 player. For now, the random Kerbally *.dll crash isn\u0027t too bad and not too frequent.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dermeister","CreatedById":41487,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-09T23:31:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy isint this mod out for 24.2 yet?
