The problem is, you have to know what it needs to do LONG before it has to happen. Like on my mission to Eve in the stock game with FAR and DRE and RT2. The probe I sent to land there had a very specific place it was trying to land at, for a challenge that was posted in the challenge forums. I had to program in every step of the decent from deorbital burn to the actual landing almost 20min before they took place. The whole thing was a nightmare to pull off, and I didn\u0027t do it perfectly, the probe took some damage and was only able to transmit the information back to Kerbin for an hour before its battery died. But it survived re-entry and landing and was with in 400m of my target cordinates. By far my most rewarding mission to date.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Major Gene","CreatedById":103683,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-27T23:07:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sparker\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sparker\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI was looking through the thread and found \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55145-0-23-5-Real-Solar-System-v6-2-6-1-14?p=972674\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post972674\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Emetaphor\u0027s report about his mission to get some samples of martian soil.\u003C/a\u003E \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022\u003E I like it and I thought it would be a good Idea to try to do it myself.

I am not doing a auto launch , as you can see in the 2 pics , craft just wont turn and the inclination in the orbit window dosnt change ever. when it dose it turns to 090 and stays there .\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s158.photobucket.com/user/Riddick_album/media/kerbalmj_zpsd0c4fc67.png.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i158.photobucket.com/albums/t86/Riddick_album/kerbalmj_zpsd0c4fc67.png\u0022 alt=\u0022kerbalmj_zpsd0c4fc67.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s158.photobucket.com/user/Riddick_album/media/kerballlaunch2_zps8d066739.png.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i158.photobucket.com/albums/t86/Riddick_album/kerballlaunch2_zps8d066739.png\u0022 alt=\u0022kerballlaunch2_zps8d066739.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AndreyATGB","CreatedById":62674,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-30T09:33:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk I don\u0027t understand what you\u0027re doing at all. Firstly, your orbit altitude is extremely high but I suppose that\u0027s how you want it. Now, your gravity turn settings are completely wrong. \u0022Final flight path angle\u0022 means the angle at which your ship will be pointing when the turn is over, which leads me to the second issue. Since you\u0027re launching in such a high orbit, you should do the turn something like 2km start (which I assume is when you reach 100m/s) and 300km end. Final angle should be 35-45 since 0 would be wasting fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn short, it doesn\u0027t work because you told it to go straight up.

Final flight path angle of 180\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 should have you pointing backwards not on a heading of 180\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0. Also, you said you\u0027re not doing it automatically, but you have the autopilot engaged, which is exactly what I meant. My recommendation is to launch into a much lower orbit (~200km) and then burn out to where you need to go, and I would do it manually as MechJeb ascent autopilot isn\u0027t the happiest with RSS \u002B FAR.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"griffin247","CreatedById":58122,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-30T11:55:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eok so the new remotetech has just rendered my main engines and fuel tanks inoperable , VAB says tank cant hold resorces , so either i ned to somehow reinstall everything and somehow keep my progress and ships or , hell i dont know. am using the dev version of MJ whichi am asured works with RSS.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
