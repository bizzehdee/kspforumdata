When you hit the atmosphere at too high of an angle, the atmosphere becomes a brick wall and crushes the capsule. If you want to see the idea, take a marble or something round. Fill your bath tub with water (a sink works too, but it\u0027s easier to not splash all over the place with a tub). Throw the object lightly into the water at an angle. Note that it enters fairly smoothly with only a little splash. Now drop the object with a light push down as you drop it straight down. Notice the splash is much larger and you probably hear a very audible \u0022plop\u0022 or \u0022kerthunk\u0022 versus the lighter \u0022splash\u0022. This is caused by the water\u0027s surface tension. The atmosphere works the same way. When you enter at an angle, you \u0022shear\u0022 the surface tension allowing the capsule to slide into the atmosphere. When you drop it straight down, you try to tear it, and it pushes back, and pushes back hard, causing the surface tension to bend and then break violently. With a capsule, this bend puts massive \u0022G-loads\u0022 on the capsule and crushes it, then when it breaks, the shockwave destroys the capsule.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pleborian","CreatedById":27820,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-26T21:22:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Edoes this mod destroy the craft from excessive g-forces? not something I have experienced yet, but would be another cool peril to come across regardless.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ddavis425","CreatedById":14725,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-27T01:07:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure what changed, but the heat shield effects suddenly started working for me.

The module calculates the re-entry effects based on the atmospheric properties of the celestial body that you\u0027re landing on. It will already behave differently depending on the temperature and density profile of each atmosphere. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy plan is to eventually define a couple of constants for each atmosphere that will change how the re-entry heating behaves. That way we could make it more or less difficult to land on certain planets and moons. (i.e. Conditions during entry into Mars\u0027 atmosphere are more extreme, for a given entry speed, than for Earth because of differing radiation heat transfer effects.) It may turn out to be pointless though, and for the time being the gas specific constants in the model are the same for every atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sbowyer28","CreatedById":4338,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-30T18:56:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been working on a Duna Entry technique for Slowing to abut 800m/s forentry, I aerobreak at about 30,000 Meters by 50,000 Meters and the atmosphere slows you down after a few orbits and you enter at about 750m/s Hope that helps if you try a Duna entry with this mod dude, Ganna try it with this mod myself soon.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
