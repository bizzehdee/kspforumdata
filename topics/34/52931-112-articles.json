Last time, I clearly remember getting the option to land something on the Mun, when I could barely get in orbit around Kerbin. I just skipped that contract until I could get it done. In that case, it would be the same. Doing that contract before you get the action groups is hard (not impossible though). So the best course of action is to take on other contracts, until you have the necessary tools to do the other contracts correctly. The action groups editor window is just another tool that you unlock as you progress through career.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I /can/ do to help palliate that, is that I could bump the default predeployment altitude to 30km.

I put two RealChute Cone Chutes on a rocket using symmetry (each is mounted atop radially-attached solid boosters), and modified their deployment altitude from the part meus at launch, as I do not yet have actiongroup access in my career game. upon deployment of the chutes, one of them had 3 chutes deploy on shortish lines, and the other had a single large chute deploy on long lines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWill test again to see if this happens again. Not sure if its a bug or intended. All chutes deployed at the same speed and the craft drifted down without tilting, so no noticeable drag change.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
