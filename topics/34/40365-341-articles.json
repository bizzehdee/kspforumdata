The wiki says \u0022if you have a supply\u0022 it makes for good energy production, but I\u0027m at a complete loss as to any sort of efficient way to get to that point. From the sound of it, He3 is actually many orders of magnitude harder to obtain than antimatter. One could argue that Jool provides He3 in the atmosphere but if you\u0027re out there anyway, why not just put a pile of collectors in orbit and get hold of lots and lots of antimatter, in a much shorter time?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, He3 is very hard to get, but with the upgraded power generators, a He3 powered fusion genetator is the most powerful reactor per unit mass until you unlock anti-matter. I could be mistaken, but I believe that if you are in a sub-orbital flight with an atmospheric scoop in Jool\u0027s atmosphere you can obtain He3. I haven\u0027t yet gotten around to messing with fusion yet so I can\u0027t really tell you more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI created my own github account so I could mess around with a copy of the wiki, I hope to improve it by a large margin but it will definitely take me a while. I\u0027ve never edited a wiki before but I\u0027m great at organizing thoughts and ideas. Once I\u0027m done I\u0027ll present it to Fractal for him to judge if its good enough to put up.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-19T14:15:45Z\u0022 title=\u002204/19/2014 02:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 19, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Rabada\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vvaccarello","CreatedById":109049,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-19T14:15:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUmmmmm... When I installed KSP Interstellar Mod, in which I watched many tutorials to correct any mistakes I may have had. Thus the tutorials all did the same thing. Yet either its a bug or Im incorrect. (My installation directions said to put it in the main directory folder not game data) Then I went in and none of the moded parts had NO thrust. So then I went to go watch more tutorials on how to fix tis there were NONE. So I tried editing the parts (didnt work).
