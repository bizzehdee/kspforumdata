It\u0027s going to seem like tiny inconsequential things which make too little difference to matter. And for the most part that\u0027s true but together I think that such polishing tweaks adds up to a big improvement in usability. Usability, UI, layout, and design are the improvements that I desire.

Having the version number is undoubtedly a good thing but on the main user-facing window is a bit tacky. In the settings window is more normal. Am I really getting picky about the title of the info window? You bet. This kind of attention to detail absolutely filters down to a user\u0027s total perception.

It\u0027s off the cuff but hopefully it shows the promise of the process.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA common issue is that of language, picking the right words and phrases to describe specific events and features. Keywords, carefully chosen and disciplined in their use, really help the user feel at ease. For example the word-concept \u0022deploy\u0022 is very muddy in KSP regarding parachutes. Is deploy referring to the \u0022blue\u0022 state when the part is activated by staging? Is it when the first parachute part comes out (yellow state)? Is it when the canopy fully inflates (green state)? What about altitude and height? \u0022Chute\u0022 isn\u0027t a word either. It\u0027s fine as part of the proper noun of the mod but I would avoid it as an improper noun. What is a \u0022chute\u0022 anyway? In the case of a combo parachute is it the entire part or just a single component? Terminology should be separate and decided on to ease use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe concept of \u0022space chutes\u0022 is quite confusing. It suggests physical duplications of materials but that isn\u0027t borne out by the mass of the part. It\u0027s not extra fabric; it\u0027s not extra attempts if one canopy breaks, but a limited number of times it can be repacked from EVA. A different terminology would suit this concept better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Action Groups editor window is a bit of an anarchism. Having to switch to the action menu to edit the parachute info was an interesting workaround when Module Fuel Tanks did it ages ago. It has several issues. Career mode\u0027s upgrade locked action menu means that the user\u0027s UI interaction changes during the career for essentially no reason. It can\u0027t be dragged or resized. There are scrolling windows within scrolling windows. It covers the action menu editing interface. It doesn\u0027t play nice with any other mod that attempts the same. It\u0027s unnecessarily a second point of contact for the user when only one is needed. If there was a \u0022switch to editing mode\u0022 type button on the Info window then both info and editing functions would share a single point of user contact for improved usability and efficiency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Editor window has an odd mix of helper calculator and not. A significant amount of the visual real estate is taken up by essentially a calculator to determine canopy diameter based on certain factors. I feel this \u0022how to arrive at a diameter\u0022 process is an optional \u0022side loop\u0022 process which deserves a dedicated popup dialog which would radically declutter the interface.
