If the NRE crashed the game, it would have crashed at the NRE instead of continuing to load. You crashed while going to flight scene, it looks like.

It\u0027s not an official use of the symbol or anything. The reason it is showing \u0022---\u0022 for moons and not planets is because it doesn\u0027t apply in your current circumstance, which I assume is orbiting a planet. It is an ejection angle that tells you where in your current orbit you should start your burn. It\u0027s only helpful for transferring between two things that share a common parent, such as between two planets orbiting a star. If you are orbiting the Mun, you will see numbers show up below Psi for Minmus. These would be used to transfer directly from the Mun to Minmus, since they both share Kerbin as a parent. Likewise, if you were orbiting the sun, you would not see any numbers for planets or moons there, because theta would be all you would need to transfer to a planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou will see numbers for Psi listed beside a planet when orbiting a moon for use with the \u0022adv\u0022 trajectory (going from moon-\u0026gt;parent planet-\u0026gt;another planet). These are for dropping your periapsis to the parent planet, or I suppose could also be used just to return to the parent planet (such as from Minmus back to Kerbin for reentry).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope that helps!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"smunisto","CreatedById":57789,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-30T16:04:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, it helped alot, thanks!!!!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zak233","CreatedById":73995,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-30T19:33:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI updated to the new version - deleted the old files, put in the new ones...but now I don\u0027t get the protractor window at all.
