It depends on; your ship\u0027s coefficient of drag and how that changes with speed, the initial TWR and how that changes with altitude (which in turn depends on both your atmospheric ISP and vacuum ISP and on your payload and stage dry mass fractions), and on how you stage and all of the above for each further stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are only rules of thumb. The lower your start TWR the higher or faster you need to be before your gravity turn. If you stage to a low TWR stage you will also need to turn later. Turn shape actually shouldn\u0027t have much effect for an optimal turn since for an optimal turn after the initial pitch over you should be locked exactly prograde (AoA limit to about 1degree), however I think it does have an effect on how much you pitch over initially.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is for an optimal turn though, for a general safe turn an AoA limit of about 5 degrees and about 50% shape will usually get your payload to space if you have good TWRs on your stages.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"yuravian","CreatedById":93614,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T19:37:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi! thanks for working on MJ to update it for 1.0.2!

Whenever I try to follow a waypoint, the module divides my top speed by 5, and wont allow me to go back up, but will let me go down. It\u0027s a minor inconvenience, but I\u0027d appreciate for it to be looked into before the next update.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Oh of course it starts working RIGHT AFTER I post about it.

One quick note -- the maneuver node planner in the latest dev build (the only one I\u0027ve used, so I can\u0027t tell you when it may have started) seems not to properly \u0027straddle\u0027 maneuver nodes; that is to say, split up the use of dV to optimize the burn. Instead it burns at t-0 from the node, which can result in an inefficient burn, especially on long, low TWR burns.\u003Cp\u003Ee: it also seems to treat planets/moons as points with regard to \u0027adjust closest approach\u0027, not taking the correct planetary radius into account. For example, the mun\u0027s equatorial radius is 100km, and to correctly calculate a 15km closest approach I had to type 115km as the closest approach. Doesn\u0027t seem to do this with other commands so far, such as \u0027adjust Pe\u0027, just the closest approach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just tested that and the node was well split in two parts and the body radius is already used in that part of the code.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMrherponaderpsherp : yes. it does.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022rosenkranz\u0022 data-cite=\u0022rosenkranz\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ewow, 40 seems way shallow.
