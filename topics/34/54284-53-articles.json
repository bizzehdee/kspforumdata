Then shipping it by hand to the VAB or recovering the Vehicles with these items loaded I would make money, however, this requires a lot of micro managing. I REALLY wish I had the knowledge to program myself but alas I do not. I have come up with an idea and I do not know how easy it would be to implement and figured I would bring it up as people are now mulling over cost and such. My thought is that Materials in Tanks could be edited by hand in saves possibly to move them from one ship to another. If this was the case than it would be a simple matter to have a \u0022ship\u0022 that is close to the launchpad/runway that houses fuel (LFO/Xenon/Monoprop/Ship Parts) that could be loaded on the ship via ground crew near the launchpad. Using this method I could mine a bunch on one part of the world and hack the fuel back to the VAB. This would be a very dirty way of accomplishing this, and I thought what if we have a shipping plugin that moves fuel from one ship on Kerbin to another, over ground and water that takes time. Thus you could mine in one area and set a shipment to the vab or other location and depending on distance it will take a differing amount of time. This would give you the ability to launch your vehicles empty fill them at the pad and then launch them into space. It would also allow you to send ship parts into space easily without buying them, or sending a ship to the mining location to fill and bring back for the cash that the fuel and what not needs... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know if this is the best way to explain it all but its a sort of Kerbal UPS for Fuel and Minable/buildable resources.
