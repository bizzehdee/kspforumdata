If you deploy a probe from a ship named \u0022HangarShip\u0022 with a hangar, and then check which biome the probe is in (using mechjeb, scansat or other mod, or just by doing a biome-sensitive science experiment), the biome will read as the name of the ship which the probe was deployed from. From that point on, the probe is stuck in this nonexistent glitch-biome, wherever you might take it. Obviously the probe\u0027s state has become corrupted somehow by being deployed from the hangar.\u003Cp\u003EWhat is worse, even if you completely get rid of the hangar \u0022mothership\u0022, the probe will be stuck in the biome it created, and if you at that point shut down KSP, uninstall Hangar, and then restart KSP and load the saved game with the probes, the game will enter a completely glitched-out state where nothing will happen if you click most of the KSC facilities, none of the buttons in the main menu will work, and if you enter the science facility (one of the few that responds when clicked upon), you can\u0027t get back out from it again. Your only way out is to force-close KSP. Reinstalling Hangar again is the only way to get the corrupted save file to work. Getting rid of the corrupted probe might fix the savegame so it will work even without Hangar installed, but I have not verified this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWow... never thought it may be \u003Cstrong\u003Ethat\u003C/strong\u003E bad \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will investigate the issue ASAP.

I think I know the reason and the solution:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStock docking ports are surface-attachable by default.

Inline hangars have their \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Etrigger\u003C/span\u003E colliders running along their axis, so a docking port is probably sticking to the surface of a trigger, instead of attaching to the docking port node.
