I was expected something along the lines of what can be seen on page 25 of this thread. Photographs of the real Jupiter and Saturn do not have blurred edges from the altitudes that they can be seen in the game.

Rest assured that I am already working on an update! The haze will most definitely stay, but it will be reduced and blended better. All the planets will have a haze IRL, but it will be less obvious with the gas giants due to their size.
