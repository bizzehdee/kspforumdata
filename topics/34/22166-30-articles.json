If most people would only ever need to find one deposit, this means that one deposit would be sufficient to serve their fuel needs in the reasonably foreseeable future. That would only be true if kethane was a supplementary system on an interplanetary mission, for example, something you add to a ship in lieu of the fuel required to get back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is very definitely not the way it usually happens, i.e. \u0022most\u0022 people don\u0027t only need to find just one deposit. Seeing a screenshot of a ship with a kethane supplementary system like this is quite uncommon, \u003Cem\u003E(I\u0027ve only seen one beside mine own, in fact.)\u003C/em\u003E instead, it is clear from all the screenshots and videos that people show off that the majority of players have adopted the path of strip mining and filling progressively larger orbital fuel or kethane storage systems with resources for extended exploration and base building operations. Even with the current increased density of kethane, creating a mining setup that completely drains a deposit in just a few cycles is trivial, and this is what you typically see done. That makes detailed maps of kethane deposits desirable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat means that scanning as it currently works is not a particularly suitable game mechanic, since waiting for a scan to complete is not actually playing. There is no such problem with actually mining it, since that completes much faster on time warp, and can be readily tolerated, but scanning might take hours. While some people mentioned Eve Online, we\u0027re not Online here. Nobody can come in and interrupt you, so the waiting is just waiting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually, I just had an idea. May I suggest a completely alternative scanning mechanic for such purposes? Burrowing explosive resonance scanners.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe scanning probe must land, upon which it either detaches or otherwise launches \u003Cem\u003E(or IS)\u003C/em\u003E a one-use-only device that burrows deep into the ground and then explodes. The seismic shockwave that specially tuned explosion produces is used as an acoustic radar pulse, revealing in detail all the surface kethane deposits in something like 200-300km radius -- possibly with level of detail being reduced with distance. This permits one to map an entire planetary body in terms of kethane in just a few uses of the device, but on the other hand, requires sending much more complicated \u003Cem\u003E(and heavier, since that device would probably weigh a few tons)\u003C/em\u003E and non-reusable survey missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S. As far as I can see, people don\u0027t typically use kethane as a supplementary fuel system not because it\u0027s not sufficiently efficient or doesn\u0027t offer enough advantages, but because they like being able to land wherever they please, and not on the first deposit located. My own ship that uses it is an airship meant for use on Duna, and moves by electric power otherwise. The only other example I saw was a plane.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Weatherman159","CreatedById":48008,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-12T08:59:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mihara\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Mihara\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E-exploding scanning probe-\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow that is an awesome idea.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HoY","CreatedById":57294,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-12T10:11:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow many people that use the strip mine method, which will take at least a full day of mining and moving fuel (unless you use mainsails) to orbit, are unwilling to spend 15 mins at 50x warp with one scanner at the proper orbit to map the entire planet??\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis detail level of the map is really just to please the people that Have to have everything done completely, but having every deposit hit 4-5 times to give you a cross hatch image of it is more than enough if you Just want the gas, and not the map.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mihara","CreatedById":59752,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-12T10:32:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022HoY\u0022 data-cite=\u0022HoY\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHow many people that use the strip mine method, which will take at least a full day of mining and moving fuel (unless you use mainsails) to orbit, are unwilling to spend 15 mins at 50x warp with one scanner at the proper orbit to map the entire planet??\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m pretty sure you\u0027re misrepresenting things, or not experiencing the passage of time in the same way I do, at least. \u003Cem\u003E(I expect very few of us are actually clocking it.)\u003C/em\u003E Example from personal experience:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMinmus, ~150km orbit, inclination 90.

The time spent waiting for an orbital scan to complete is neither negligible compared to the time actively performing actions, nor it is time spent actually playing. The need for a sufficiently complete scan, however, is very definitely there.

If most people would only ever need to find one deposit, this means that one deposit would be sufficient to serve their fuel needs in the reasonably foreseeable future. That would only be true if kethane was a supplementary system on an interplanetary mission, for example, something you add to a ship in lieu of the fuel required to get back.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, but you only need to locate one deposit at a time. With a proper craft in a proper orbit, it usually takes less than a minute to find a deposit (on an oceanless body). If you really want to strip an entire body, you can do your scan all at once, but that\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Emany hours\u003C/em\u003E of landing and launching craft to mine. If you\u0027re obsessive about getting a full and detailed map, maybe you should build a more substantial scanning craft or accept that it won\u0027t happen instantly. Even if you are strip mining, you can scan for new deposits as you need them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022But I have to identify a good landing site!\u0022 The first deposit you find might be on the side of a mountain, but it doesn\u0027t take long to find a second. You \u003Cem\u003Ecan\u003C/em\u003E get a full map and compare it with a topographic map to find the most perfectly flat mining site, but that\u0027s going to cost you a bit more than simply landing on the first thing you find.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI loaded up a simple Mun probe with a small scanner, two RTGs and a small battery. It took me ten seconds to find two deposits. After a minute, I\u0027d found five more deposits. All of these have multiple data points so you can see that if you land in the middle, you\u0027ll certainly be over the bulk of the deposit. I\u0027m running at 100x warp because it makes the first few deposits look better, but I can comfortably run at 1000x warp if I want a full map. With its large oceans, Laythe will be a lot harder, and I\u0027m okay with that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m no stranger to these kinds of balancing issues. When Kethane first came out, you could only 10x warp the detector, and you couldn\u0027t use time warp \u003Cem\u003Eat all\u003C/em\u003E on converters, extractors or pumps. Refueling a \u003Cem\u003Esmall\u003C/em\u003E Kethane lander meant minimizing the game for thirty minutes.
