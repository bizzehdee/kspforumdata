First let me say thank you to Nertea for making this mod as well as all of his other stuff. Always loved his mods but for some reason I never downloaded CryoEngines until a few days ago in my new 1.4 game after having been away from the game for a while.\n\nLike many others I found the engines to be a bit hard to get a grip with initially. I\u0027ve skimmed through most of this thread looking for advice and I think I\u0027ve got a handle on some principles.\n\nThe most obvious benefit seems to be on large upper stages where you get substantial weight savings thus resulting in savings in the lower \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E stage. This has proved quite effective on a couple of existing large launchers meant to insert interplanetary payloads into \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E and I even got some substantial cost savings. Where things got challenging for me was trying to use Cryo engines for launch stages. I\u0027ll write a little bit of what I\u0027ve learned, but I would really appreciate any further input or challenges to incorrect assumptions.\n\nThe Volcano, Odin and Mars all have lower \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E than their \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E counterparts and you also need to burn them longer to take full advantage of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E gains? This means using SRBs and often 2 pairs of SRBs with differing thrust levels to manage \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E and extend the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E burn time such that by the time they are expended the center core will have at least 1.5 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E on its own. The need to fine tune thrust with SRBs moved me to finally get the Space Y Launch Vehicles mod which adds a variety of well balanced SRBs that fill in some gaps and offer options above the kickback without having to build ridiculous bundles. IMO the Space Y SRBs synergizes very well with CryoEngines. \n\nThe end result is something like this with 6 volcanos in the lower stage and 4 SpaceY R10s with staggered thrust. It gets 30T to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E and is actually cost competitive with similar simple \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E launchers. Ok I don\u0027t go crazy optimizing for cost, I like **good looking** simple expendable launchers without insane stacks of asparagus...etc that still get reasonable cost per ton. I dont mind paying a little bit extra just for the cool factor ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif \u0022:cool:\u0022) (pun intended)\n\nGiven that the objective of the rocket is to expend itself by \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E where the payloads own propulsion will take it to its (interplanetary) destination, the second stage kicks in around 25km with the apoapsis still within the atmosphere. I found the vacuum engines underpowered for this kind of use so I ended up using 2 more Volcanos. Is this whats meant by a \u0022sustainer\u0022. Its a term I\u0027ve seen throughout this thread.\n\nSpoiler\n\n![ImbrL8W.png](https://i.imgur.com/ImbrL8W.png)\n\n![hTabi2S.png](https://i.imgur.com/hTabi2S.png)\n\nBonus downscaled  2.5m rocket 4x Volcano \u002B 1x Volcano\n\n![j1MkIQJ.png](https://i.imgur.com/j1MkIQJ.png)\n\n![ZhfmkdG.png](https://i.imgur.com/ZhfmkdG.png)\n\nStill getting stuff into low orbit is not the best use of cryogenics in real life. You want to use the ISp of the upper stage to carry that low orbit payload to higher orbits and further destination. So I decided to try to build something which can deliver a nice payload to the Mun/Minmus low orbit using the second stage. This evolution of the earlier rocket cuts down the main engines to 5 Volcanos but uses 4 (staggered) kickbacks for boost. The center core is expends just as it establishes Apoapsis and the upper stage takes over for circularization and carries a 22T payload to Minmus with some headroom for say rendezvous. This time a single Tunguska powers the upper stage with much lower stage \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E but much higher \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E. The cost per ton to destination is actually lower than my older mid size moon rocket but perhaps its because I\u0027m designing more carefully? This mod forces you to pay closer attention to all of your performance figures for a given mission profile which is why its got me so engaged!\n\nSpoiler\n\n![rRdiZcF.png](https://i.imgur.com/rRdiZcF.png)\n\n![2EKBops.png](https://i.imgur.com/2EKBops.png)\n\n![43tV2SU.png](https://i.imgur.com/43tV2SU.png)\n\nExtended upper stage with Tunguska. Extra batteries, fuel cells and Solar panels (Near Future of course!) for the journey to Minmus/Mun\n\nAt this point I\u0027m enjoying these engines tremendously but I\u0027ve come to the realisation that I;m struggling to find a use for the big and amazing looking Odin. Anytime I need more thrust its more economical by a fairly large margin to throw more Volcanos at the problem. My 30T to the moons and 65T to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E launchers use 8 and 9 Volcanos in the first stage respectively with various configurations of SpaceY SRBs and another Tunguska for the moon rocket upper stage and 4 volcanos for the 65T lifter upper stage. \n\nThe bigger engine does end up with slightly more Delta V due to the better engine \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E once you manage to equilise thrust levels for a stage but I\u0027m struggling to find a combination once SRBs have been accounted for where a single Odin comes out ahead. I think this is what I\u0027ll be working on the next couple of days and I would really love to hear about or see your Odin and Mars based designs and how to solve this optimisation problem. \n\nOf course all that isn\u0027t to say I haven\u0027t found any use whatsoever for the Odin... I think we\u0027ve all been disappointed by the Mastodon from Making history. This tribute to the legendary F1 under performs the mainsail in every respect except a slight \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E gain for vastly unjustified higher cost. Meanwhile the mainsail doesnt fit into the Saturn V 5 meter base due to the wide engine mount. I actually used a 5 meter engine plate to attach five Mainsails, then used the move tool to nudge the mainsails outwards but they are both still too bunched up in the centre to look good and the top of the plate is already clipping slightly into the shrouds. This was my 150T to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E lifter that has already been improved by a cryo upper stage.\n\nBut now enter the Odin. With Nertea\u0027s switchable mount, the Odin looks glorious on the Saturn V base. The thrust requirement for the 150T payload also means this was way beyond what clusters of Volcanos can solve. The final design uses 5 Odins assisted by 2 thrust reduced long burning SpaceY S115 heavy \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E boosters with a single Yucatan for the upper stage. The way the staging worked out the 2nd stage kicks in at around 35-40km, with a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E of 0.8 a single Yucatan has enough thrust to act as a sustainer and to circularise. Its a vacuum optimised engine but at 35km it has nearly full thrust. I\u0027m glad I found a use for the Yucatan.\n\nThis rocket turned out very slightly more expensive than the 5 mainsails with Yucatan upper stage combo, but the 100 cr per ton premium is worth paying for the cool factor and lack of clipping as far as I\u0027m concerned. The extra 15,000 cr is a small fraction of the total launch cost once the cost of a 150t payload plus launcher is factored in.\n\nSpoiler\n\n![KGDg8aW.png](https://i.imgur.com/KGDg8aW.png)\n\n![XXRxKGa.png](https://i.imgur.com/XXRxKGa.png)\n\n![H4xRNsk.png](https://i.imgur.com/H4xRNsk.png)\n\nIt\u0027s so beautiful I could cry ![;.;](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif \u0022;.;\u0022)\n\n![5Yn55uc.png](https://i.imgur.com/5Yn55uc.png)\n\nThe Yucatan kicks in\n\nSo in conclusion I guess what I\u0027ve learned is \n\n1) great for upper stages with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E lower stage\n\n2) Be more attentive to design parameters when building full stack cryo launchers especially \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E and when staging occurs.\n\n3) Burn your engines for longer where possible\n\n4) SRBs are very important and you usually need 2 pairs with differing thrust limits (and therefore burn times). \n\n5) The need for large tankage is considered a downside. But I love the roomier fairings of big rockets even for lighter payloads, sometimes you just need volume for odd designs. The rocket being bigger for a given payload is a plus for me as I hate the look of bulbous fairings that are vastly wider than the core.\n\n6) You can indeed design full cryogenic launchers (with SRBs) that are in the same ballpark cost-wise as \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E launchers.\n\n7) I now refuse to use the Wolfhound on sheer principle ![:sticktongue:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif \u0022:sticktongue:\u0022)\n\nQuestions\n\n1) What are the economical uses for single or dual configuration Odins and Mars based launchers. I\u0027ve yet to build a Mars based rocket. How best to optimise for single large engines vs clusters of smaller engines? Is Mars a luxury cost no object engine?\n\n2) Does asparagus staging work? I think not given the lower \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E and need to burn longer.. the Centre core ends up with too little \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E when the asparagus boosters are expended as the Kerbal fuel pumps are so efficient! My Delta IV heavy (ish) clone was hugely expensive for what it was. Well at least that\u0027s accurate...\n\nHope this post wasn\u0027t too long and looking forward to what you guys have to say about your launchers.

Since then I did use a Mars as an upper stage for a 200T vehicle but it left me unsatisfied as I what I really wanted deep down was to use it as a launch stage. Was I being unreasonable? Looking for a use case that did not exist by demanding it be cheap? I didn\u0027t even used to care so much about cost but this self imposed challenge kind of took hold of me.\n\nToday I came across some very old \u0022cheap and cheerful\u0022 challenge threads for simple expendable launch vehicles and saw some designs that used a single central Rhino sustainer core that gets all the way to orbit with (big bundles of!) stock kickback \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E side boosters. So that inspired me and I eventually came up with this:  \n\n1x Mars engine on single core stage with 5m tanks, 31.7T of LH2 and 149T of Oxidiser. \n\n2x S109 heavy lift \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E at 58.5% Thrust\n\n2x SpaceY S217 Super Heavy \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E at 46% thrust\n\nPayload to 75km circular orbit of 145T (I count the fairing cost and weight as payload as it makes picking my launch sub-assemblies easier.)\n\nCost 155,388 cr | Cost per ton to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E 1,068.7 cr/T\n\nThis is the lowest I\u0027ve ever gotten my launch costs for a non reusable design! I\u0027m sure it can be optimized further by someone more skilled at rocket building than me. I\u0027m also not great at tuning ascent profiles and so just used the mechjeb standard ascent settings with corrective steering turned on as a repeatable standard. I\u0027m not saying that \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E launchers or hybrid launchers might not be even cheaper. But I am immensely satisfied with what I achieved with the Mars engine. \n\nThis design not super delta V efficient as you suffer some gravity losses when the boosters are ejected. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E on the core is just below 1 when the S217s separate but it increases fast enough to get you to orbit. But I optimized for cost, not delta V efficiency. \n\nAlso someone who doesn\u0027t want to use SpaceY boosters or similar can always use a number of stock Kickbacks. I didn\u0027t try that but I did try a pair of \u0022advanced boosters\u0022 instead of SpaceY SRBs: A pair of Twin Boars with a single additional Rockomax jumbo orange tank. This came out slightly more expensive (100cr/t more that the 4 spaceY SRBs config but still very reasonable). This is all turning out very SLS ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022) \n\nSo yeah the Mars engine... luxury engine for when you\u0027re willing to splash the cash for maximum performance? Yes definitely. But its also a dirt cheap launch engine if you optimise right for a big payload. \n\nCryoEngines mod in general? I think its superbly balanced in all respects and you can usually find a good use for all 6 engines even while being a bit frugal (though you may have to work for it!).
