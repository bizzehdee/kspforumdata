This is why I add a generic lab equipment and generic experiment containers. The different experiments and lab equipments will still show up in the tech tree but not in the part list in the VAB. As a replacement you can add one of the generic transport containers and choose the experiment or the equipment it should transport. You can move around experiments between empty containers on your vessel. To run an experiment you need to install it in the lab, the container it was stored before is then free to return an other finished experiment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis chances a lot internally, unfortunately this means the coming update will not be backwards compatible and will not work with old save games.
