The asteroid science system that I\u0027ve mentioned several times before seems to working. I think I\u0027ve gotten rid of all the bugs and it doesn\u0027t seem to affect any of the non-asteroid science. I\u0027m still using the asteroid mass to determine the class, but I think I\u0027ve got the mass ranges figured out. The different classes determine which results you\u0027ll collect and the value of the report. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve added a full set of science reports for the magnetometer (both nearby and while grappled to an asteroid) and for the laser scanner (while grappled only). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/b1OWtnR.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022b1OWtnR.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe magnetometer\u0027s readout has been tweaked and extended to work everywhere now. There are full magnetosphere simulations for Kerbin, Duna, Jool, Eve and the Sun; the size and intensity of the magnetospheres vary greatly between planets. When you are in orbit around a moon or a non-magnetic planet the readout returns values for the parent planet or the sun. I\u0027ve also reduced the update speed to five times per in-game second while out of timewarp. While in timewarp the update speed increases up to fifty times per second. This should alleviate any concerns about the magnetometer impacting performance. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RGD4NZZ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022RGD4NZZ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd finally, parts.

But you need to have some purpose for drilling into the surface. By itself drilling through rock would be rather pointless. The obvious reasons for doing so are either to drill through the outer layer of rock to reveal something below it, or to take a core sample. Taking a core sample by itself seems pretty similar to the stock surface sample experiment to me and I don\u0027t want to create alternate methods for collecting stock experiments, and besides, there are several other mods that already do just that. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the idea I went with, which was inspired by the old Viking landers and the planned ExoMars mission, was to collect samples to test for biological activity. The methods used by the Viking lander and the ExoMars rover destroy the samples they collect, but since I wanted to allow these samples to be returned for higher value I got a little hand-wavy and made up something about incubation chambers and allowing time for gasses associated with biological activity time to be generated. I really did intend to include this limitation in the part description though, and I\u0027ve already added it to my latest build. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd aside from all that I really like the idea of very specifically targeted experiments. For orbiters there are a lot of instruments that work well in any situation. Pretty much every major interplanetary probe has some kind of radio plasma instrument and a magnetometer and usually several imagers of some kind. But for landers and rovers it makes more sense to come with highly targeted instruments. Obviously I don\u0027t want to make this mod bloated with a bunch of semi-useless parts taking up RAM, but I think the drill is a decent enough compromise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhy not create an atmospheric gas detector or something instead?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe already have the barometer and the nose cone, but this actually brings up an idea for another interesting part.
