The only time I\u0027ve had MJ screw up a landing site is when I did something weird, like forget to turn on an engine in time, or eject an engine halfway through so its Isp calculations were messed up, or deploy parachutes (it can recover from that if you have enough fuel and cut them before they fully deploy, actually). I would be interested in seeing what kind of craft you guys are having trouble landing with, since the issue is apparently not obvious without that information.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efirst little stock craft is the uploads_2013_07_GP-V1.craft from spaceport and the second is the stock craft that comes with the impossible innovations pack..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eboth pretty standard craft, that I used previously in 0.20.?? with no problem(s). matter of fact, they were so stable with MJ 2.0.8 that I would set up the landing session, and go make a sandwich and come back and there it was.....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I can still make my sandwich, but I come back to kerbal splatter on mun......\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gojira","CreatedById":10884,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-10T21:34:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI lost my Delta-V Stats button and orbital information button!
