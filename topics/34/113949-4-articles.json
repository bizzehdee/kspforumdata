Feel free to use these textures wherever and whenever you like, though let \u0027The White Guardian\u0027 know first before uploading anything that includes his texturework. \u0027The White Guardian\u0027 has the right to disallow the usage of any of his textures. However, unless ownership of his texturework is claimed \u0027The White Guardian\u0027 will often allow the usage of his texturework as long as the proper disclaimers are in place.This cloudpack is made specifically for \u0027Asclepius - A Kopernicus planet - SSTO playground\u0027. Therefor bundling this pack with Asclepius is allowed and even advised. In fact, bundling this with any of MrChumley(the author of Asclepius)\u0027s mods is allowed.Thank you for reading, and please have fun!- The White Guardian\n\nAs you can see, I must write a custom license to give proper credit to the authors of some textures. I have, however, added that the cloudpack is allowed to be bundled with any of your mods at any time.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-28T20:22:53Z\u0022 title=\u002210/28/2015 08:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by The White Guardian**"},{"CreatedByName":"The White Guardian","CreatedById":148627,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-28T22:18:36Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m going to be naming it Kryo\n\nUuh...

Found this mod a week ago or so... You know, I am a great fan of a huge planet packs which add new stars with planets. At first I didn\u0027t really think this planet will be something special. But... The heck it is!\n\nThe way you did the atmosphere is a whole new game mechanic which requires balancing and special aircraft design. Theese planes may not work the right way back at Kerbin, but they definitely work for your planet. I have a full-scale mining operation in progress back at Asclepius. And of course I\u0027ve got screenshots!\n\n![8yu7vt.png](http://i63.tinypic.com/8yu7vt.png)\n\nThis is my \u0022Orbital command Alpha\u0022 space station in a 300km equatorial orbit. The big thing on top is The Orecarrier (guess what it does). As you can see, there is a spaceplane docked, the other one is now down at the surface. The single-use capsule is the main way of crew transfer between Kerbin and Asclepius.\n\n![mkesdi.jpg](http://i65.tinypic.com/mkesdi.jpg)\n\nDeorbiting The Orecarrier. I have my mining site in a crack on the equator.\n\n![2layfbr.jpg](http://i63.tinypic.com/2layfbr.jpg)\n\n\u0022If you have a planet with low gravity and a very uncomfortable atmosphere why would you ever use a parachute for a reusable craft?\u0022 - Elon Kerman (just kidding) The ~~SpcaeX~~ way of landing on surface.\n\n![28tf7e8.jpg](http://i63.tinypic.com/28tf7e8.jpg)\n\nA nice rover for refueling all sorts of space things. I have a stationary mining plant, too. (It just arrived first, makes no more sense.)\n\nAnd then it just goes back to orbit to reprocess the ore. No practical use of it, rather than having fun with planes. Now I\u0027m thinking of establishing the \u0022Orbital command Beta\u0022 in orbit around Kruel. This moon seems like a cheap way to get ore.\n\nWill be delivering more screenshots soon. Now building the third plane.
