For example, I tweak a kerbin\u0027s name (or keep generating new ones) until I get \u0022Profession: Pilot\u0022 at the bottom, hit Apply, and then go back to the Astronaut Complex to check... and find he\u0027s actually an Engineer or a Scientist. This holds true even if I transfer him immediately into the ship waiting on the Launch Pad (i.e. I get a \u0022no pilot\u0022 error when I try to activate SAS). If I transfer him out and then Edit him again, it still shows \u0022Profession: Pilot\u0022 at the bottom of the edit screen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn case this is due to a mod interaction, I\u0027ll supply my mod list below.
