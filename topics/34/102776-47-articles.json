Also I am pretty sure the contract system may break easily and halt progression or stop generating new types of contracts. I actually rebuilt my persistent file over the weekend because my contracts were always the same kind and were not advancing (or failing for no reason) and my asteroid generation also appeared to bite the dust.\n\nIf you are looking for something to try, start a new career game and copy the \u0022ResearchAndDevelopment\u0022 and \u0022ProgressTracking\u0022 SCENARIO blocks from your main game to the new persistent file. This straightaway gives me more variety for contracts and options for Derso or Laythe with only 25,000 starting funds and 0 reputation. I don\u0027t know if the tracking of completed contracts and the bloating of the save file is the issue, just wiping the whole \u0022ContractSystem\u0022 SCENARIO block could have the same effect but I haven\u0027t tried it.\n\n\u003E ![yqMadrp.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/yqMadrp.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"Therlun","CreatedById":133436,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-02T21:53:29Z","Content":"Hiho again ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nI started a new campaign a few days ago with 1.6.3.\n\nWhen I updated to 1.6.4 I encountered a very serious performance drop when flying rockets making the game basically unplayable for me in 1.6.4.

I was just thinking of flying planes on stock Eve. The atmosphere there is very soupy and planes make a lot of lift. On Titanus I had to skim the surface at 300m/s and pull parachutes in order to land.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E How do you start the game, and have you checked for correct behaviour on Kerbin?

The same issue occurs if *physics.cfg* gets corrupted or deleted.\n\nI start the game by browsing to the game folder and running KSP.exe. I just now tested one of the aircraft I used on Titanus on Kerbin and it worked normally. I also barbecued a couple of rockets both on ascent from and re-entry to Kerbin, and it seems to be working as expected.
