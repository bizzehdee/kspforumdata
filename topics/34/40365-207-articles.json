The entire setup is dockable to allow for fuel transfers to waiting-to-launch vehicles etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is essentially an introductory mission to show how to use the science lab, ISRU and and tritium breeding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKNOWN ISSUE: There is a bug in the current version of KSPStoryMissions that causes it to (regularly) fail to recognize docking objectives as being completed on surface installations. This made the missions impossible to complete, in order to resolve this the missions do not at this stage actually require docking the parts together - merely that they be placed at KSC - however docking them together is highly recommended (using a remote resource system like Lazor is not very effective in this scenario as actinides cannot be transferred making fuel reprocessing impossible).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScience is my lady (rank 14):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a 4-part mission pack built around deploying science labs at progressively harder locations (based on the multiplier scores from the KSP_Interstellar wiki). The first mission requires the player to land one on the Mun, then on Ike. The third mission places one in orbit around Jool and the final mission requires landing one on Moho. Note that the final mission here is very, very tough - but it also has a very high reward.
