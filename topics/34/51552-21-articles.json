One is already on the bugtracker courtesy of someone else that I\u0027ve now encountered a second time in a somewhat different manner but I\u0027m having trouble getting it to duplicate. I\u0027m going to try and put together a stock case where it\u0027s duplicatable, but I suspect it\u0027s related to bridging omnidirectional antenna and dishes (rover/lander/etc with omni -\u0026gt; mothership with omni \u002B dishes -\u0026gt; Kerbin constellation with omni \u002B dishes -\u0026gt; KSC = problems, sometimes). That I\u0027ve got AIES antenna that I\u0027m modded into the game and whatnot makes it difficult to rule out a problem on my end, so I\u0027ll rebuild it with just stock \u002B RT2 parts. But I\u0027ve seen it a few times now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve also just experienced another problem twice with the aforementioned mothership while trying to nail down the other behavior: after undocking a lander and switching focus the ship then loses all velocity and is left in a free-fall. I\u0027ll try and get that to duplicate as well, but I\u0027ve done that maneuver several times and it\u0027s only happened twice, so its also not easily duplicated, and may not be related to RT2 at all. Could be MJ or something else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I do have two feature requests one small, one larger: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESmall: can we have it so that renaming a vessel does not suffer from the time delay? It\u0027s an action performed on the command module, but in reality its simply a change on the ground so we should be able to do it at will. Besides, it\u0027s damn irritating after undocking a satellite to then have to wait 10 minutes to rename it just so you can properly find it in your list of ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELarge: would it be possible, possibly as part of the flight computer or some such to get a list of issued commands and how long until they are received? I\u0027m trying to decouple my sats around other planets and KSP is sometimes a little twitchy with keyboard focus and sometimes my stage command needs to be issued twice. That\u0027s irritating, but when you have to wait 10 minutes to determine if the stage command went through, well that\u0027s slightly catastrophic and requires a much higher level of F5/F9 use than I prefer. Just being able to see what command RT2 has held in the queue would be very helpful. Maybe a little slide-out panel from the computer to show it or another window or something. I\u0027m not sure how you would do more analog things like throttle input, maybe just note throttle up for 3 seconds, throttle cut, that kind of thing. But I think with a flight delay, we need some sort of ability to see what\u0027s been issued. No other UI on them needed (cancel, reorder, etc) - it\u0027s issued, so you have to live with it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, a third very small: The long range dishes have such narrow cones that they can fire right through the middle of my 4 sat Kerbin geosync array from other planets when I have them set to target Kerbin without hitting a single sat. That\u0027s from Dres, and it\u0027s just on the edge for Jool (CommTech-1). With a 3 sat network it would clearly fire through from Jool. I would think that they wouldn\u0027t design a dish to have such a limitation - that from the nearest planet the dish would have enough angular coverage to hit the full 6200km or so diameter of a geosync array. It\u0027s not necessary to go to geosync to ensure continuous communication with KCS, but it\u0027s exceptionally common. NASA also uses geosync for deep-space communication, so I would expect that\u0027s a RL design requirement as well. Instead of a minimum cone of .005deg, going to .015 I believe will get everything covered. The two giga dishes are somewhat compromised as a result of this. They might only hit your network reliably from Eeloo, and only during part of its orbit. That strikes me as a design fault with the dish.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vardicd","CreatedById":75832,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-16T19:20:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sma\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sma\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYep, the \u0022jitter\u0022 is has been a known bug with kOS and MJ for a while now.

One is already on the bugtracker courtesy of someone else that I\u0027ve now encountered a second time in a somewhat different manner but I\u0027m having trouble getting it to duplicate. I\u0027m going to try and put together a stock case where it\u0027s duplicatable, but I suspect it\u0027s related to bridging omnidirectional antenna and dishes (rover/lander/etc with omni -\u0026gt; mothership with omni \u002B dishes -\u0026gt; Kerbin constellation with omni \u002B dishes -\u0026gt; KSC = problems, sometimes). That I\u0027ve got AIES antenna that I\u0027m modded into the game and whatnot makes it difficult to rule out a problem on my end, so I\u0027ll rebuild it with just stock \u002B RT2 parts. But I\u0027ve seen it a few times now.\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve also just experienced another problem twice with the aforementioned mothership while trying to nail down the other behavior: after undocking a lander and switching focus the ship then loses all velocity and is left in a free-fall. I\u0027ll try and get that to duplicate as well, but I\u0027ve done that maneuver several times and it\u0027s only happened twice, so its also not easily duplicated, and may not be related to RT2 at all. Could be MJ or something else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I do have two feature requests one small, one larger: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESmall: can we have it so that renaming a vessel does not suffer from the time delay? It\u0027s an action performed on the command module, but in reality its simply a change on the ground so we should be able to do it at will. Besides, it\u0027s damn irritating after undocking a satellite to then have to wait 10 minutes to rename it just so you can properly find it in your list of ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELarge: would it be possible, possibly as part of the flight computer or some such to get a list of issued commands and how long until they are received? I\u0027m trying to decouple my sats around other planets and KSP is sometimes a little twitchy with keyboard focus and sometimes my stage command needs to be issued twice. That\u0027s irritating, but when you have to wait 10 minutes to determine if the stage command went through, well that\u0027s slightly catastrophic and requires a much higher level of F5/F9 use than I prefer. Just being able to see what command RT2 has held in the queue would be very helpful. Maybe a little slide-out panel from the computer to show it or another window or something. I\u0027m not sure how you would do more analog things like throttle input, maybe just note throttle up for 3 seconds, throttle cut, that kind of thing. But I think with a flight delay, we need some sort of ability to see what\u0027s been issued. No other UI on them needed (cancel, reorder, etc) - it\u0027s issued, so you have to live with it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, a third very small: The long range dishes have such narrow cones that they can fire right through the middle of my 4 sat Kerbin geosync array from other planets when I have them set to target Kerbin without hitting a single sat. That\u0027s from Dres, and it\u0027s just on the edge for Jool (CommTech-1). With a 3 sat network it would clearly fire through from Jool. I would think that they wouldn\u0027t design a dish to have such a limitation - that from the nearest planet the dish would have enough angular coverage to hit the full 6200km or so diameter of a geosync array. It\u0027s not necessary to go to geosync to ensure continuous communication with KCS, but it\u0027s exceptionally common. NASA also uses geosync for deep-space communication, so I would expect that\u0027s a RL design requirement as well. Instead of a minimum cone of .005deg, going to .015 I believe will get everything covered. The two giga dishes are somewhat compromised as a result of this. They might only hit your network reliably from Eeloo, and only during part of its orbit. That strikes me as a design fault with the dish.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour first two requests are already ingame.
