So I renamed all the planets, both internally with NH\\_[name] for name and identifier, to preserve compatibility with IC and the stock system, and when IC is installed I also change the name displayed in-game.\n\nI don\u0027t provide any compatibility with GalacticNeighborhood in my version.

This way if NH needs something which is defined in Kopernicus, it will be available.

I did a test pull from your fork, and there aren\u0027t any conflicts.  But, looking at the diffs, I think that there are some fundamental differences in the approaches.\n\nHow would you want to approach this?\n\nI\u0027m involved with another group with KCT, the way it worked, I merged in their changes (for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E), and then pushed my changes to them, recently we merged to make mine the main release of it.\n\nCan you explain why you changed the identifiers for all the bodies to this:  NH/Arin\n\nIn fact, looking at all the diffs, it seems that most if not all of them are either the difference in the FOR vs AFTER, and specifically changing/adding these new identifiers to everything.  I did notice the big addition for the Sun for Interstellar Consortium, and the new config for the Interstellar Consortium at the end.\n\nAfter considering this, I think that both can be used;  Add the FOR after the AFTER[Kopernicus] so the final result would be (using the Eeloo config from the original):\n\n    @Kopernicus:NEEDS[!GalacticNeighborhood]:AFTER[Kopernicus]:FOR[NewHorizons]\n\nI\u0027d like to use the new atmospheres that [@OhioBob](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/128005-ohiobob/) is making for me. \n\nEdit:  I\u0027ve looked at JNSQ and GPP re. the AFTER.  I\u0027m a bit surprised, but apparently the AFTER isn\u0027t needed.

The thermometer doesn\u0027t read the ambient temperature, it reads the temperature of the thermometer.  So the temperature reading can be affected by the orientation of the vessel.  For instance, greater exposure to the sun will read a higher temperature.

For instance, if Laythe had an albedo of 0.75 (rather than the default 0.3), that would be enough to bring it\u0027s temperature down to something earthlike.  But to have an albedo that high would mean Laythe would be completely covered by clouds.  I suppose that\u0027s possible, but it\u0027s not the way Laythe is depicted in game.\n\nI could change Laythe\u0027s albedo and recompute the atmosphere accordingly.  I\u0027m now leaning toward this as our solution.  It would provide a realistic explanation for the lower temperature and the existence of oceans.  The only discrepancy then would be the visual depiction of Laythe with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E clouds, where the cloud cover is much too sparse."},{"CreatedByName":"OhioBob","CreatedById":128005,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-01-03T19:46:37Z","Content":"The other body for which I might have a similar problem is Eve.

Of course the usual explanation for Eve\u0027s oceans is that they\u0027re not water, but perhaps a hydrocarbon of some type.  In the case of stock Eve the temperature and pressure is just about right for heavy hydrocarbons to exist as liquid on its surface.
