One thing I was told was that the underwater camera will be \u0027fixed\u0027 in the next release. But, that same dev was unaware of the fact that you could physically pass through the terrain at depths of 1,000m\u002B.

As for the sonar. I\u0027ve already done some testing. Unity has this ability called raycasting. Essentially a beam is shot out from any point and toward any direction. If it hits something, you can get the distance. There\u0027s also sphere casting. Instead of a beam, a ball of x diameter is sent flying outward. So, sending out a \u0027ping\u0027 is possible. And I\u0027ve tried it. Here\u0027s the problem. Water is considered a \u0027solid\u0027 object. In tests thus far, I\u0027ve sent out spheres and got a ping back 1,000m out. And it\u0027s terrain. And I know for a fact there was nothing there except... water. Now, I could have been sending the pings out the wrong direction or not had the filters set correctly. I\u0027m not done experimenting and, for civilian purposes, I\u0027d love to see at least a bottom scanning sonar. But, that\u0027s some pretty involved stuff (ala scansat).\u003Cp\u003ESeems kinda pointless to add the sound without the results so for now, I\u0027ll say maybe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI see, looks so complicated, but from what I saw in movies, the sound from those engines should be heart it less underwater so, you just shrink the engines sound and record over it the sonar sound.

The answers apply to this as well with one exception. Every submarine part is currently under the influence of Firespitter\u0027s buoyancy and until the next patch comes out and I see what effects it\u0027s going to have, that\u0027s not going to change. That means, every torpedo, missile, engine, nosecone, canard, etc. would also have to have Firespitter\u0027s buoyancy code added otherwise it would cause the sub to float extremely well and be extremely slow due to drag.\u003Cp\u003ETest this out by slapping a few stock parts on a submarine and try to dive and then you may understand why.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eis it possible to have a part that, with code, just not interact with water, at all?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fengist","CreatedById":78435,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-31T07:24:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022123nick\u0022 data-cite=\u0022123nick\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eis it possible to have a part that, with code, just not interact with water, at all?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, I can do that.
