Because this node is technically completely independent from the others (i.e. its location on the part may be totally different), it must be handled as an independent node also in CLS.\n\nHence, \u0022Passable\u0022 controls the passability of *node\\_stack\\_xxx* (optionally with blocking some of them using *impassablenodes=...*), whereas \u0022passable when surface-attached\u0022 controls the passability of *node\\_attach*.\n\nHmm, I wonder what Editor Extensions does if you force-enable surface attachment with a part that doesn\u0027t have *node\\_attach* defined. Let\u0027s experiment! Judging visually, taking a Buffalo Crew Cabin and forcing surface attachment onto a Buffalo Command Cab:\n\n![p6ctRJa.png](http://i.imgur.com/p6ctRJa.png)\n\n...it seems to use the origin of the coordinate system of the part being attached, with negative y pointing inward. While the result is decidedly kerbal, maybe this attachment procedure should not be recommended for general use in spacecraft.\n\nNow, \u0022surface allows passable attachments\u0022 is a different thing, and as Fraz86 pointed out, it\u0027s hardly a precision tool: it makes the **whole surface** of the part passable, so that when a child part with a passable *node\\_attach* node is surface-attached anywhere on it, that connection becomes passable.\n\nBased on the above, my answer to the question is that purely from a logical viewpoint, such a configuration is possible: the part has no hatches on its *node\\_stack\\_\\** nodes (hence not \u0022Passable\u0022), but it has for example an EVA hatch somewhere on it that could be kerbalized to bolt something there (hence \u0022Surface allows passable attachments\u0022); and finally, it has no hatch at its *node\\_attach* node (hence not \u0022passable when surface-attached\u0022).\n\nThere is one caveat, though: CLS might require a part to be Passable before accepting the other two options. However, I don\u0027t know if this is the case, or if the three options are treated as completely independent. Papa\\_Joe or codepoet may be able to better settle this part of the question, since it\u0027s related to the implementation.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 25.1.2016 at 7:59 PM, Fraz86 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Structural fuselages should already allow surface attachment, when using a part appropriate for such purposes (Surface Attachable parts, e.g., the Radial Attachment Point, are meant to allow passable attachment on suitable curved surfaces).\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E In principle, I agree it would be reasonable to allow Surface Attachable parts to attach to EVA hatches.

Results:\n\n- When compared to the default config, the \u0022freedom\u0022 config, quite contrary to the name, makes the bottom nodes of landerCabinSmall and mk2LanderCabin impassable! In the other two configs they are passable. I assume this is a bug, but which config is correct? How do you guys want it? I\u0027m fine with the bottom nodes of lander cans being impassable (no hatch and all that), and if it\u0027s up to me, in my PR I\u0027ll just **copy** this change to the default config, too. If \u0022freedom\u0022, OTOH, is supposed to have the bottom nodes passable, I could also **move** this change to the default config in my PR.\n- The default config has some entries, which are missing from both configs in the zip file, namely mk3Cockpit\\_Shuttle, mk3CrewCabin, batteryBankLarge, mk3CargoBay\\*. However, mk3Cockpit\\_Shuttle has the node on the nose passable; I think in a strict config it shouldn\u0027t be, as there is no visible hatch (and I\u0027m not sure if the nose is reachable in the IVA space). Also, curiously, the configs for batteryBankLarge and mk3CargoBay\\* are patched in using *:Final* (which, if I understand correctly, is reserved for local overrides by the user) and the edit-or-create operator (%), instead of filtering for *HAS[!MODULE[ModuleConnectedLivingSpace]]* and just specifying a new module, as in all other entries in the .cfg. I\u0027ll fix this. (The use of the wildcard in the part name is better than my preliminary solution of listing all the parts individually. I\u0027ll adopt the wildcard approach where applicable.)\n- \u0022freedom\u0022 includes just one blank line before mk2CargoBayS, instead of three as in the other two configs. I think I\u0027ll fix this (either way) for consistency...\n- Finally, exactly as it says on the tin, \u0022freedom\u0022 adds passability to several parts. The full list is:  probeStackLarge, asasmodule1-2, decoupler1-2, stackDecoupler, stackSeparatorBig, stackSeparator, adapterLargeSmallTri, adapterLargeSmallBi, adapterLargeSmallQuad, batteryBankLarge.\n\nTo clean up the situation, my suggestion is to:\n\n- Have only one default CLS config for stock parts and delete the extra copy, since it is almost guaranteed that even if we sync it now, it will again go out of sync (OnceAndOnlyOnce is the maintainer\u0027s friend). If needed, a fresh copy of the default config is always available in the release zip of the mod itself. I\u0027d expect the people who install mods to be the type that archives the zips, and failing that, there\u0027s KerbalStuff and Github to download it again.\n- Take the alternative configs out of the zip file to make them easier to work with (so that there is no need to extract the zip in order to e.g. compare them). Remove the zip file.\n- Name the configs e.g. *CLSStockStrict.cfg* and *CLSStockFreedom.txt* (note file extension). Mention the alternative configs in the README. Players familiar with installing mods will know what to do with .cfg and .txt files, if they are just alerted to the fact that alternative configs are supplied.\n\nI haven\u0027t yet asked NecroBones about whether he wants to include the config for the single part (a decoupler) that needs to be passable into MRS itself, or whether he prefers that we handle it here. Likewise for Nertea and the large docking port in Near Future Construction. I\u0027ll do this in the near future (pun not intended).\n\nFinally, by the way, is there a dev thread for CLS? Even though this is just about modifying default configs, I feel like I\u0027m starting to spam up the release thread with technical details that would feel more at home in a dev thread."},{"CreatedByName":"Technologicat","CreatedById":153765,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-01T18:08:49Z","Content":"[PR sent on Github](https://github.com/codepoetpbowden/ConnectedLivingSpace/pull/65), containing the fixes to stock and KIS configs.

On the other hand, the Mark IV Spaceplane System marks its cargo bays as passable, so if we don\u0027t, this will make cargo bays inconsistent unless Nertea changes his configs, too.

(Git has a few idiosyncrasies with how it handles files.  For example, renaming a file is stored in Git as a \u0022delete-and-recreate\u0022 operation.)  So, the old file with a space in its name was removed from the repo, and the new file sans space was created.  Except, in the download, both files are present when there should only be the latter."}]}
