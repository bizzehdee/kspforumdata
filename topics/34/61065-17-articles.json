The good news: I have added a configuration window in which the log level could be adjusted, so we can get a more detailed view if necessary without spamming the log. The strange thing is, that some of the issues are not deterministic. I suspected the ingame time at first (FF relies heavy on those timestamps and reverts ribbon assignments, if time is reverted), but it seems that this part is ok. Hash- and Equal-methods are next candidates for causing such problems. Missing entries in some internal lists may cause this, too. \u003Cp\u003EI will first try to solve the reproducable issue that I have found. Maybe this solve others, too.
