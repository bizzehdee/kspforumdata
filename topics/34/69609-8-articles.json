Although, I planned on using the separation motors for just visuals. Wait, I just got a new idea. I could try to set a spot, and you could define attach nodes for a new type of sepatron. The sepatron could be placed in the slot since it would would be stackable, and have an attachment node on top. That\u0027s pretty cool! Although, you know MUCH more about modding than me. I can make *extremely basic* designs in Blender and that\u0027s it. I don\u0027t even know how to use the boolean tools. :/\u003Cp\u003EGood luck, I hope I can contribute somehow. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also have basic models, man.
