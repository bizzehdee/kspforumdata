The mass and volume don\u0027t match either. For example: a 0.625m RCS fuel tank scaled to 7.5m by moving backwards on the slider masses ~18t compared to it\u0027s normal 0.05t. If what you say when you describe your mod is true, it\u0027s mass should scale to the cube of the scale factor. So, 7.5m / 0.625m = 12 is the scale factor. and therefor 12*12*12 = 1728 is the mass and volume scale. This should yield a mass of 86.4t. Furthermore, if I continue to repeatedly click the button on the left of the scale bar, which should scale the part down (and does if you watch only it\u0027s physical dimensions), it\u0027s mass continues to grow exponentially. The last symptom I found was that mass of scaled parts increases on reloads (like if you go to the space center and back or if you revert to launch). I have a series of screenshots showing a small rover vehicle I made which initially weighed ~7 t, which I show with successive reloads as it grows to reach 39000 t after reverting to launch 5 times. In the same world I have a ~44 Billion ton ship in orbit over Kerbin which I can\u0027t move, because it\u0027s mass reduces it\u0027s acceleration to nearly zero.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpon request I will provide documentation of the bug to the degree that I am able. I will post again when I have more time with further verification and data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore I sign off, I\u0027d like to say that I\u0027ve really enjoyed your mod and that I hope you will continue to do your best to keep it up to date and functional.
