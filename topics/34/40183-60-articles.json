Had to left go as the named asteroid was not coming close enough to Kerbin at the time (MCE was at version 0.62 back then). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, there is another asteroid going to strike Kerbin dead-on. I have a slot free in the contracts, but unfortunately no ARM contract appears (MCE 0.65 now). More than 2 game days passed since that asteroid entered Kerbin\u0027s SoI, still nothing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe above makes me consider if MCE is made aware of the game state. Probably not, as it may mean to deal with very complex situations. Believe MCE reads only about the state of its own stuff (missions, budget, ships, kerbals, etc...) but there is no (at now) a system to check (e.g. from the persistent.sfs) if a specific situation exists, and use that for filling contracts slots.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I\u0027m going for ARM with that \u0027roid above, can\u0027t let it come down without doing anything. So, tried to \u0022generate\u0022 a user contract for ARM by copying the relevant section from MCContracts.cfg, and amended the name of the \u0027roid written in the MCE career *.sp file, to show the correct one. The contract shows fine in the contracts window, but there\u0027s something weird in the mission window, it only shows \u0022This mission has docking Goal or Undock. It must be done in one sitting, the docking goals are not saved to bypass issues with Vesel ID\u0027s\u0022. No conditions shown. Would be glad to know if I\u0027m doing something wrong, and how to correct that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"malkuth","CreatedById":57414,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-27T13:29:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBest bet is to use debug tool to make arm mission come up.
