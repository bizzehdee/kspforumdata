This has been tested on Linux x86, with Lazor System v26. Deleting the .cfg and .txt files in PluginData/romfarer did not fix the problem. The work-around is to put all the lazors back into one group at the end of use, at which point, ending the flight is again possible. The error in the log reads as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E ArgumentException: An element with the same key already exists in the dictionary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E at System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary\u00602[system.String,KSPParseable].Add (System.String key, KSPParseable value) [0x00000] in \u0026lt;filename unknown\u0026gt;:0.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E at Romfarer.Util.SaveKSPParseableRect (System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary\u00602 partDataCollection, System.String i, Rect r) [0x00000] in \u0026lt;filename unknown\u0026gt;:0.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E at Romfarer.CFG.onFlightStateSaveX (System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary\u00602 partDataCollection, System.String identifier) [0x00000] in \u0026lt;filename unknown\u0026gt;:0.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E at Romfarer.CFG_yellow.onFlightStateSave (System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary\u00602 partDataCollection) [0x00000] in \u0026lt;filename unknown\u0026gt;:0. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E at Romfarer.LazorSystem.onFlightStateSave (System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary\u00602 partDataCollection) [0x00000] in \u0026lt;filename unknown\u0026gt;:0.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E at ProtoPartSnapshot..ctor (.Part PartRef, .ProtoVessel protoVessel) [0x00000] in \u0026lt;filename unknown\u0026gt;:0.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E at ProtoVessel..ctor (.Vessel VesselRef) [0x00000] in \u0026lt;filename unknown\u0026gt;:0.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E at Vessel.BackupVessel () [0x00000] in \u0026lt;filename unknown\u0026gt;:0.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E at FlightState..ctor () [0x00000] in \u0026lt;filename unknown\u0026gt;:0. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E at GamePersistence.SaveFlightState (System.String saveFileName, System.String saveFolder, SaveMode saveMode) [0x00000] in \u0026lt;filename unknown\u0026gt;:0.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E at PauseMenu.draw (Int32 id) [0x00000] in \u0026lt;filename unknown\u0026gt;:0.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E at UnityEngine.GUI.CallWindowDelegate (UnityEngine.WindowFunction func, Int32 id, UnityEngine.GUISkin _skin, Int32 forceRect, Single width, Single height, UnityEngine.GUIStyle style) [0x00000] in \u0026lt;filename unknown\u0026gt;:0.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Romfarer","CreatedById":20387,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-22T21:47:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Elazor version 27 is coming soon and it will use all the fancy stuff added in 0.20 \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eit\u0027s possible that the launch clamps will not explode anymore.
