I fixed that up last night. EditorTime modifies the UT in the FlightState, which doesn\u0027t affect the Planetarium\u0027s universal time (which is what KCT reads from). All I had to do was make KCT look at the UT in the FlightState while in the Editor, and the Planetarium everywhere else. It was a little freaky to watch ships being built while in the editor!

Taking destroy a satellite in the atmosphere happened to me the bug. I deleted KCT (use CKAN) and I tried again the scene, yet the bug. Install yet KCT, MissionController2 removed, repeat the scene, and the bug goes away.\u003Cp\u003ENow I can go on the satellite KU-Sentinel and everything works back to KSC , the problem is MC2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for your help\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGlad you\u0027ve determined the source of the error!
