In particular they\u0027re lacking the reaction wheel nerfing (I think on next release I may just delete the wheels in probes/pods rather than nerfing them), per-pod battery configs, and rescaling, in part because I didn\u0027t have time to sit down and figure out what size/mass made sense for them. I mean, the big cube is obviously a Block II GPS bus, but not sure about the rest. What sizes / masses do you think appropriate?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegarding the engine. The \u0022going into the fueltank\u0022 thing is a trick SFJackBauer devised to get around the issue that most KSP engine models are actually engines \u002B giant fuel tank butts, basically. (Look up pictures of rocket engines. At most they have a turbopump etc at the top, or a set-of-girders thrust structure. Not a fuel tank cap.) Which is bad if you, for instance, want to use the engine on a different-sized fuel tank. Can\u0027t do anything about using an engine with a giant honking dome on a *smaller* tank, but for bigger tanks SFJackBauer devised this system where the unsightly dome is hidden inside the fueltank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo idea why the bottom stacknode is moved too, though.
