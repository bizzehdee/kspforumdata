Also a history tab for example: kerbal dies and his info is sent to a honored tab there you can view all your kerbal that gave their life for space. This tab could show all there information on missions etc... maybe even add a screen shot plugin that adds a screenshot of them next to there ship or one taken by you in game.

Perhaps its just me, but I dont like the idea of a death ribbon. Its just because in real life you wont find any officer walking around with a deatch ribbon of any kind. The main problem is, he wouldn\u0027t be walking anymore. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause me and some other wont like this or some kind of ribbons I will include this type only if ribbons could be deactivated.
