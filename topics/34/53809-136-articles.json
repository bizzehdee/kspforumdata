Instead, \u003Cstrong\u003Eit probably is KSP itself downsizing the icon\u003C/strong\u003E. It might not happen for stock icons and most other mods, because their icon textures are larger than neccessary (if that were true, it really would be ironic, because then KSP would basically force modders to use wasteful texture sizes).\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood catch rynak. I think you\u0027re onto something there. I\u0027ve used enough GUI code in KSP to know for a fact that if a \u0027texture\u0027 is larger than the space allocated for it, it does indeed get squashed and if it\u0027s too small, it gets stretched.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT - And nope. Huh. The latest version of RealChute has a toolbar icon that\u0027s 1kb and 38x38. That shouldn\u0027t be a problem. There is a FilterIcon_selected.png which is 52kb (!) which is 32x32. If that\u0027s stretched to fill a 38x38 allocation, then it could end up blurry but is that the toolbar icon? Don\u0027t know, I don\u0027t use RealChute. Regardless, I think you\u0027re right that it isn\u0027t ATM at fault here and that an exclusion file in that folder does actually work.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-24T12:52:35Z\u0022 title=\u002201/24/2015 12:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by AlphaAsh\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
