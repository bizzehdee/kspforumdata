I ran into the same problem using a hand-scaled docking washer (tweakscale is... *twitch*) and I had set the node sizes to 2. The 1.25m waser worked fine, the 2.5m version did not. I poked around the thread and found the above posts and thought \u0022oh, of course!\u0022. I set the node sizes to 1 and the 2.5m washer worked just fine and dandy \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI believe the problem is KSP\u0027s \u0022new\u0022 (as of 0.23.5) stack joints: node sizes 0 and 1 are unaffected, but 2\u002B get extra joints that effectively lock the larger washer in place. Before searching the thread, I had noticed that the washer was \u003Cem\u003Etrying\u003C/em\u003E to turn, but just wobbled around instead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, long story short, I guess I need to take another poke at IR\u0027s code and see what I can do (might even be able to sort out the docking port issue).\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you can that would be splendid.
