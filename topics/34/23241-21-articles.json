Even in FAR, as it can\u0027t override PartModule drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn 2-6 thanks to ferram4 pointing out and some little-used parameters of the intake module I was able to give the S2W intake the same drag as the equivalent area of stock intakes, but if you fill up the part with fuel, it is likely (untested) that the total mass will be used rather than the dry mass, and with the appropriate amount of fuel that means the intake will have 4-5x as much drag as it should have moving forward. Believe me, I tested such values while figuring out the fix and it is a noticeable hit on your airspeed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou misunderstand. What we want to do is have the cone and rings in the intake move forward and back a little with airspeed up to the engine\u0027s max speed - which is currently ~ mach 5.4, btw - but it will only \u0027close\u0027 visually when you toggle the intake closed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a side note, these will be the first intakes in game (that I know of) where the drag decreasing when the intake isn\u0027t drawing air is appropriate ...\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh I see.. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Then it is even more cool!! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Yep that is a very serious progress in terms of engine capability and first of a kind air intake that has more smart control then just on/off \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E Really good work guys!
