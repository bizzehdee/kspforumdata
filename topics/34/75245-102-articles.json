Is it possible to implement something like a \u0022command/action battery\u0022? What i mean by \u0022command/action battery\u0022 is, that the commands you do (extend panels, throttle control, etc.) need \u0022command/action points\u0022. These are stored in the \u0022command/action battery\u0022 (like a HDD). When command your probe/vessel you use up your \u0022command/action points\u0022 (like the SAS draining your normal battery). If you run out of points, your probe becomes inaktive (like having no signal or no electricity). You can \u0022recharge\u0022 your \u0022command/action battery\u0022 with a connection to your control center. It would work like solar panels recharging the battery, but with the signal delay we have in the current system. The \u0022recharging\u0022 would be cut as soon as you lose the signal (range or moon/planet shadow). I hope you get where im heading to. I dont want to make RT into easy mode. Right now we have two opitons: signal delay on or off. My suggestion is somewhere in the middle. Since I like signal delay, because it gives me a sense of how far I\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4m away from kerbin, but once you got like 30 sec delay and more, things like multi probe ships are a bit sluggish. Automating things like landing, ascending, activation of engines or action groups with kOS, smartparts, and landertron are fun, but once you\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4ve set them up, its basicly hitting the \u0022go\u0022 button and sit back. Thats the point where it gets a bit boring for me. KOS, smartparts and the flight computer aren\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t made useless. You could make them not use the \u0022action points\u0022 and keep the \u0022command battery\u0022 \u0022charged\u0022 for unpredicted corrections/fine adjustments. SAS would be seen as one command. SAS control don\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t drain your \u0022battery\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPRO:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- easy to get used to\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- keep signal delay without having command delay\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- limited control without signal\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- \u0022player needs to do the job\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- less \u0022AI/computer fail\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECON:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- use of kOS, smartparts and fight computer are reduced\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

After 10 seconds my \u0022battery\u0022 recharges with x \u0022points\u0022 per second. I lose connection. Immidate recharge halt. I recieve signal. Recharge starts after 10 seconds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. The signal delay is 10 seconds. The connection window would be 9 seconds. Result: You dont get any recharge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope you get my idea (and like it). In case this has been already suggested and rejected, I apolagize. I wouldn\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t want to play KSP without RT. Thats why I hope this idea will get implemented. It could be a game mode (like signal delay on/off) so people who don\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t like it, don\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t need to play it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBest regards\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKoprolith\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Padrone","CreatedById":132505,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T16:11:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@ Koprolith\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only thing I know of that might help is the mod \u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/630/AmpYear%20Power%20Manager%20\u002B%20Reserve%20Power%20\u002B%20Ion%20RCS\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAmpYear Power Manager\u003C/a\u003E.
