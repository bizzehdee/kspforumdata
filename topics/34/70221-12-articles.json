In case of Venus, clouds reflect so much light that the light emitted by gases fades.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEarth atmosphere remains blue even above large landmasses, like Asia. The color comes from the phenomenon called Raylegih Scattering. Molecueles of air absorb light and then emit it in random directions. In case of Earth, the 21%O 78%N atmosphere mainly absorbs short length waves, namely blue. At high angles, the light passes through atmosphere without much impact on color, and atmosphere emits blue light. At low angles, the light has to travel much further in atmoshpere, so most of the low wavelength light is absorbed on the way, making sun look red. Note that the sky above you is actually blue at sunset. Later, however, it becomes red and that is due to the fact that atoms reflect much more red light then they absorb and emit blue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, effects vary depending on atmosphere thickness as well as composition. On Mars the sky is red for most of the day and it isn\u0027t until sunset that you can see the blue tint. In case of Eve however, even without clouds the atmosphere is so thick that it\u0027s color should depend almost entirely on atmosphere composition and altitude you\u0027re making observations on. Now, this is where it gets strange. We don\u0027t know the composition of Eve\u0027s atmosphere since it\u0027s never been stated by devs. Whatever it is that composes it however, it\u0027s absorption spectrum is messed up enough that the sunsets are... green...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, if it lets green go so far through, then it aparently absorbs higher and lower wavelengths. So, upper atmosphere emits red and blue, which gives you... magenta. However, first of all, the atmosphere goes from purple in upper atmoshpere to white in deeper.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut it would make more sense if it was purple-magenta in higher, and green in lower atmosphere. Near surface you would get a very dark surface bc the wavelegnths it reflects have been absorbed. At surface level, at midday, the sky would be green near horizon and get purpler when you look up... Honestly, I give up, I can\u0027t even imagine what it looks like.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHOWEVER, the actual reflective surface of the planet is at arround 10km altitude - the entire surface is obstructed by clouds. Now the thing is, I have no idea what kind of chemical would produce so dark clouds that would sustain at such altitude. We have 2 clouded bodies in solar system, Venus and Titan and both have bright clouds. Also whatever it is, with such low reflection rate it would absorb ludicrous ammounts of radiation, heat too. It would probably vaporize instead of forming clouds (remember clouds are made of small drops of liquid).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way it looks on Sonic\u0027s latest screenshots makes much more sense then before but I\u0027m still gonna mess arround and see what I can come up with - it turns out everything is adjustable in this mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow that we\u0027re at it: Sonic, should I remove the original config or leave it be?
