There you can go on top of this window click \u0022Force Check Requirements\u0022 and check which requirement is yellow after that.

The point is to force the user to somehow \u0022check out\u0022 the planet/moon beforehand, whether by SCANsat or the stock ISRU-scanner by:\n\n- Probe\n\n- Orbit\n\n- Scan\n\nSo, why the need to re-orbit Kerbin? That didn\u0027t make sense to me, especially since, in theory, the antenna would relay all the information. I think it makes perfect sense to just need a probe doing some scanning, so I think the wording can just be changed and it\u0027s alright for it to be a pre-existing scanner.\n\nOne thing you could include (more work, though, for you and the users) is to require that the probe has actually transmitted some sort of scanning data. I\u0027m no ContractConfigurator whiz, but is it possible to check to see if the probe sent back scanning data? If so, that could be a good middle ground. So, I can use my SCANsat probe already around Minmus, but I have to actually send back data to Kerbin. You\u0027d have to allow it to just auto-process if scanning data is maxed-out, though, since ISRU is all or nothing; if someone isn\u0027t running SCANsat, and has already ISRU-scanned Minmus, they need a way to be able to trigger it. So, maybe this isn\u0027t such a good fix.\n\nI suppose the logical work-around is to offer some scanning contract if there is something they haven\u0027t scanned, but if they\u0027ve maxed out ISRU or SCANsat, screw it just let \u0027em build the base there without the first basescan contract.

Mostly because my rover is part of a 3 part vessel, an autonomous transfer stage, skycrane, and the rover, each with it\u0027s own core.
