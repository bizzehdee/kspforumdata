Here are some of the things that attracted me so much to this mod, and probably the others too: 1. You clearly put a lot of effort into it. The fact that you made separate biomes, and science descriptions immediately told me that this mod was legit. 2. The creativity. The idea of an easy to get small planet for those who are tired of going to Mun and Minmus all the time but aren\u0027t ready to go to Duna yet is just generous. All the little details about it, such as the low atmosphere, the breathable (only in the canyons where there actually IS an atmosphere) oxygen air, and the fact that its full of different geography such as sand, water, shores, and more! 3. The stock-alike-ness. Ranging from the looks to the silly descriptions, this mod should be implemented into the stock game. I\u0027m dead serious.\n\nWell, I hoped my review let you understand how great this mod is, and hopefully make your day a little brighter, as you made mine by releasing this mod.\n\nps, sorry for the late review, I just got a forum account:P"},{"CreatedByName":"Karosieben","CreatedById":113589,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-02T14:56:24Z","Content":"FIrst of all, Asclepius looks gorgeous!

It felt very different to control takeoff versus atmo entry and landing, where it seemed to have OK control. Taking off it seemed like it would not settle on a heading and would start to sideslip like the aircraft was asymmetric (its not!), then the engines would shut down from the high angle to the airstream.
