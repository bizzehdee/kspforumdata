I love the way the shrouds look inside.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a fresh 0.24.2 install with just a bare minimum of mods (KER, FAR, DRE) I put the 2.5 heatshield from this pack on the mk 1-2 pod and launch to low orbit. Standard reentry profile (initial peri around 40 km), the heatshield works as advertised and the crew lands safely. One worrying thing: FAR displays excessively high ballistic coefficients (over 2000 kg/m2; the pod bottom alone would have sligthly more than 700 IIRC).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn an old but trusty 0.23.5 RSS \u002B full Realism Overhaul install I put the 3.75 heatshield on the resized mk 1-2 pod and launch to low Earth orbit. Obviously I realize this was not designed to work under RSS conditions, but I decided to test it anyway. Standard reentry profile (initial peri around 70 km), the heatshield works, but it provides pretty much zero drag and flies through the upper atmosphere like a javelin. Ballistic coefficients reach ridiculous heights (over 4000 kg/m2; the pod bottom alone would have about 500 IIRC). At about 45 km of altitude, the heatshield overheats and the crew dies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn closer inspection in the VAB, I think I\u0027ve discovered the source of the excessively high ballistic coefficients. You see, FAR bases its drag calculations in this case on node sizes, and the bottom nodes on your heatshields are tiny. Consequently, FAR thinks your heatshields are much smaller / more aerodynamic than they actually are, and thus calculates ridiculous ballistic coefficients for the craft. Unless this is an intentional feature, you would probably want your nodes to be like those on default DRE heatshields - bottom nodes in the same size as the top ones. Even if this is an intentional feature, you\u0027d probably want to increase the size of the bottom node on the 3.75 heatshield sligthly, since it\u0027s the same size as on the 2.5 heatshield.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LostOblivion","CreatedById":111504,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-17T14:32:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow, I never would have expected such an insightful review of this.

Also the mod would then require a dependency to the AnimatedDecouplers mod, which, although it\u0027s really nice, is something I want to try and avoid. So for now, I\u0027ll recommend sumghai\u0027s mod to those of you who want this pretty cool feature, but let the command pod heat shield in this mod be a bit simpler.
