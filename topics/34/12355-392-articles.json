I used to set a pitch of 70 degrees when reaching 5km, but with the new aero this much of a sharp turn causes a spin. So I\u0027m currently just using the \u002B/- buttons you added (nice 1 for those btw). But I\u0027d still prefer to set a heading like 70 and not have to keep clicking. So what I like to suggest is to have a delay functionality that sets how fast MJ turns the craft to the new pitch/heading/roll. so for example I could set heading:90, roll:0, pitch:90 at launch and then at 5 km I\u0027d set pitch:70 and also set the delay value to say 20s. So then it would turn the craft toward a pitch of 70 over a period of 20 seconds. This could be a nice feature for other situations as well launch, ie with a very small craft, rather than have it turn to the new heading as fast as the SAS allows, you could set the delay value and have it turn more gradually.
