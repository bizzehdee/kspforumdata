So, placing it on the back, seemed to keep it in a straight line... except when it hit the terrain (specifically on the Mun). Then the heading went off, and the autopilot would simply ignore the fact the steering error was -140.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes MJ somehow interact with the probe body? I found this was also necessary for MJ to work, so I mounted one on my rover, on the top (the only place available for placing probes on a rover body part).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny tips would be most welcome!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"viperwolf","CreatedById":66190,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-19T16:36:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI found this \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/MuMech/MechJeb2/issues/121\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/MuMech/MechJeb2/issues/121\u003C/a\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eso i guess it is a bug they are calling the 68yr bug?
