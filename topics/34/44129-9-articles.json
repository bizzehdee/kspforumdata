One tip: Don\u0027t do the entire maneuver. Tug the normal vector 5-10 degrees, then use prograde or retrograde to re-aim at about where you want to go. Go back to normal, then back to pro/retrograde. Repeat until you\u0027ve got it. If you\u0027re doing a really huge Normal burn, eventually the pro/retrograde will affect the normal more and the normal will affect the pro/retrograde more.

Do it a few times, and you develop a sense of how the orbit will develop.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, PreciseNode is precisely the kind of tool that lets you do so in a better way, rather than just grabbing the maneuver gizmo around. I always go for the perfect burn by adjusting the velocity components in PreciseNode, and then continue to move the timing with those components until I set the maneuver with the minimal total DV bringing the orbit exactly where I want it to be. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, my end result is exactly what you want but is done by hand. I actually move all velocity components at the same time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, you certainly know some maneuvers are best executed at periapsis, some at apoapsis, while inclination corrections at the nodes. So, matching different maneuvers together actually means to have a sense for timing with all those single maneuvers. If mixing, e.g., a change in inclination with a raise in apoapsis, those are unlikely to be more convenient when combined, even if one node is at periapsis (because you would spend more DV to change inclination while your speed is greater, so it is best done with a node next to apoapsis). Instead, for changing inclination and periapsis, they go together very well and perfect when the apoapsis is aligned with a node. So, if timing for both single maneuvers is the same, joining them together is \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Ejust as simple as to add the single velocity components\u003C/span\u003E. If timing for the two maneuvers is different, it may not be convenient to do them together at all. But I believe you know when not to join those maneuvers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Montag","CreatedById":62945,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-15T23:31:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have been moving in the slow lane and just now using plugins and mods.
