I will await the word of those smarter than I in terms of Computer Language. Something is CLEARLY wrong here. I do not know what it is. BOTH vessels have Clampotron SENIOR docking ports for what it is worth, IF you intend on trying to fly a full mission profile from launch to docking with either vessel. They have action groups, but I neglected to take note. They are NOT flight critical as all operations can be done by hand. I await word as to what this gremlin in the works is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIterations 3/4/5: Reused the craft from Iteration 1 and the results are scary. THE FIRST Time I re-used for Iteration 3, it actually held firm until things lined up. I had a rapid unplanned disassembly mid-flight. Reverted to VAB to adjust some struts and relaunched. Iteration 4: same as 3 with regards to craft used. Hit ENGAGE AUTOPILOT. I DID NOT TOUCH SPACE BAR. Had 0 time to wait to do anything else, because as SOON as I HIT ENGAGE AUTO-PILOT, MechJeb was off to the races again. No waiting, no NOTHING, just hit ENGAGE AUTOPILOT and the thing LAUNCHED. Iteration 5 is currently Paused as I write this. While, it DID THE SAME THING: LAUNCHED THE INSTANT I clicked: ENGAGE AUTO-PILOT, I am seeing if it will fly the full flight profile, even tho, its currently something like 65 DEGREES OFF OF COURSE, just to see IF MechJeb will get the bugger into orbit. Will Update when I finish Iteration 5.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIteration 5 is currently in an orbit. It is NOT the orbit I asked for, nor the orbit I desire. Here is a small album with 3 images of the 5th iteration. Image 1 is moments after hitting engage autopilot. Image 2 is mid way through ascent. Image 3 is after circularizing with one of the Nodes highlighted to show just how FAR OFF MechJeb is because it launched when I hit ENGAGE AUTO-Pilot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/6mPIh\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

It now, on ALL of these last tries, with what, amounts to the most SIMPLE ROCKET: A 1 man command pod, a decoupler, a parachute, a MECHJEB and an RTG, will NOT FLY. I chose the station from all prior iterations as my test target. Iterations 6-9 ALL went the same EXACT WAY: I target the station, I choose: Launch to rendezvous, and I hit Engage Auto-Pilot. It starts promising: it actually waits, and then it CONTINUES to wait. All I hear is the sound of the engine activating \u0026lt;iterations 6 and 7 were LIQUID/OXY fueled, 8 and 9 were SRB powered\u0026gt; and it waits and waits and waits and waits and waits and waits and waits and waits some MORE. I am about to re-launch KSP to grab an output log for my 10th and FINAL Iteration, as I am going to declare MechJeb 2.4.2 NOT COMPATIBLE WITH KSP V 0.90.0.705 BETA.

I am so sorry to Sarbian, the person whom seemingly handles MechJeb now, but, I will contradict you now sir. No, MechJeb 2.4.2 is NOT working fine in KSP V 0.90.0.705. If it were, I would not be making what is amounting to a small novel for you and others to look at and TRY to help me. I have used MechJeb RELIGIOUSLY for ALL ASPECTS of my game since I came to KSP back at .21. I use it as religiously as others use FAR or KER, and it is as vital to MY space program as those 2 mods are to others space programs, and asking me to fly with out it, is like asking them to not use THOSE mods. Look, the long and short of this is, MechJeb 2.4.2 is NOT working as it should. SOMETHING is wrong with it. I can state, that it USED to work before .90 came out when mechjeb was like version 2.4.0 or so, and since then, it has been a nightmare after going to .90 and MJ 2.4.2. I am seeking help, not derision or condescension or anything else. I am sorry to have had to say the previous line, but, I felt it needed, sorry if that offends, but, im at my breaking point with this issue as it is 100% game breaking for me. There is a CLEAR and PRESENT issue going on. This post contains multiple output logs, craft files, a specification of my final test rocket, my PERSISTENT save from the save that this is happening in. SOMETHING is wrong with the mod, and help is needed. I really hope this issue can be fixed, found and fixed. Yes, I said fixed twice, because with this gremlin, I think its gonna need two whacks or MORE with the bug swatter.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-30T08:57:46Z\u0022 title=\u002212/30/2014 08:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 30, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Higgs\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nukeboyt","CreatedById":68397,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-26T13:03:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Higgs\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Higgs\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis is one LONG post,..\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgreed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf someone wanted to replicate the issue on THEIR machine, what steps would be necessary?

MJ is just trying to have a close encounter, but it doesn\u0027t care what happens next. So, this option is best used only when, at all times during the launch, your craft is aligned with the target\u0027s plane angle. In short, that means Equatorial orbits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor what I understood of your album, your issue is that MJ is launching your craft on a totally different plane angle. In order to fix that, choose the \u0022Launch into plane of target\u0022, instead of \u0022Launch to Rendezvous\u0022. This will set the craft on the same plane as the target, but most likely, won\u0027t rendezvous with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Because to do so in one single burn, the target would have to be at one exact spot on that orbit at the same time as your craft is crossing that target\u0027s plane during the launch. And that synchronism is pretty rare to happen; again, due to how a polar orbit is different than an equatorial orbit.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, after you\u0027ve launched your craft and it is on a stable orbit, on the same plane as the target, you\u0027ll have to set a second autopilot burn, now using the \u0022Rendezvous guidance\u0022 feature on MJ. This should make a few burns and set both crafts pretty close to each other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd finally, use a \u0022Docking guidance\u0022 functionality if that\u0027s what you\u0027re trying to achieve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope that will fix your issue.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-26T23:28:34Z\u0022 title=\u002212/26/2014 11:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 26, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Kowgan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Espelling\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
