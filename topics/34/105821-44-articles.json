The camera effect variables are described in the link above.  In my configuration, setting the gain higher increases \\_Gain, making the image brighter, but it also decreases \\_Blend, which makes the image noisier.

In MFD40x20.cfg, homeCrosshairColor is set to (0, 0, 0, 0), so it\u0027s invisible.  Change that to (255, 255, 255, 255) and it\u0027ll be a white crosshair.\n\n2: There is no maximum if you make changes to the config files.  You can add \u0027maximum=100\u0027 or whatever value you like to the JSIExternalCameraSelector module in each external camera part to increase the limit in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E.  However, you will also have to edit MFD40x20.cfg to list all supportable cameras, which is tedious.\n\n3: Yes, active camera id is no longer displayed.  It was for a while because of a hack I put in RPM, but that hack no longer works due to performance changes I\u0027ve made.  If I can find a good way to add that ability back in, I will.  One way to change that is to edit MFD40x20.cfg so each camera has its own page, instead of a single page shared by all cameras.  That also allows you to place any text you like on the page, so you can show names for each camera.  However, it also means you have to manually cycle past each \u0022missing\u0022 camera before you can reach the working cameras.  This is part of the reason there are only 8 cameras by default in RPM - each camera had its own page, and not many people installed more than a small number of cameras.\n\nAs for the suggested enhancements: Adding defaults for MFD displays is not likely.  The way pages are selected is complex, and there\u0027s no good way to provide a user interface that can record that information, especially since there\u0027s no user interface for RPM right now - I would have to add that, first.\n\nNaming cameras is a good idea - NavyFish allows that with docking ports with DPAI, but displaying the name is a problem due to (3) above.  Very likely such capabilities will have to wait for an overhaul of the MFD code."},{"CreatedByName":"_Astra_","CreatedById":155195,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-03T18:25:37Z","Content":"MoarDv, thank you.\n\nI meant not defaulting any settings for a cockpit, but introducing a complete \u0022save cockpit / load cockpit\u0022 functionality per craft.\n\nThe complexity of a such task is well understood.\n\nFirst each display should provide a fully serializable data set - at the moment the code looks not very suitable for serialization.\n\nI would also ask a simple question: where the camera view rendering is called?\n\nUsed cameras with both \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E and Scatterer and the picture looked weird if not crazy.

I stopped playing KSP for a while came back, deleted old mods, and replaced them with the newer versions.  Everything else seems to work but RPM.  =(\n\nI keep seeing JSI pop up but I have no idea what that is.  \n\nEdit:  I tried a few other things after reading the FAQ and even after all the files are under JSI i still cant get it to work.  I\u0027ve also deleted the files so can someone tell me, simply, how to install this mod from the beginning.  Thanks in advance,\n\nEdit2: RPM works.  After many hours of trying to figure out what was wrong, realized i was missing the ModuleManager.  \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-07-06T14:43:07Z\u0022 title=\u002207/06/2016 02:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 6, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by LnX**"}]}
