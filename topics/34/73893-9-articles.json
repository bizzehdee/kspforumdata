You\u0027re already doing what qualifies as at least standard computer-literate tasks just to INSTALL your mods. But there is a distinct lack of BASIC tasks such as search skills, and basic reading skills that is all that is needed, as I have SHOWN in the above procedure, to remove ModStatistics in its entirety.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMajir and co won\u0027t say it because they\u0027re trying to play Good PR and not be toxic, but I\u0027m not afraid to say that a lack of \u003Cem\u003Ebasic skill\u003C/em\u003E is shocking, if not disgusting. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, they\u0027re going to work to make it nice and pretty GUI point and click for you, but I\u0027m going to mention a few things because someone needs to say it, and say it clearly and firmly because the attitude towards them I\u0027ve been seeing is completely uncalled for and worthy of a few slaps to the back of the skull.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: Relearn your basic PC skillsets. I find you lacking if you stumble on this but not mod installation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: You were never \u0027forced\u0027 to opt in. If you\u0027ve ever read past the first line of any End User License Agreement, EVER, you\u0027d realize: \u0027that in downloading and installing this software you agree to sell your soul\u0027 is a completely valid turn of phrase, and the most common first line of legal defense in the software industry. Any variation of something like that either directly or indirectly (with varying levels of Legalese) is usually enough for a rock solid legal defense and a firm establishment of which party is at fault. (Hint: The End User, you.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mods that are starting to package this with them ARE pointing out they are putting it into them, and this mod CLEARLY tells you what it does. If you installed having read that information, you are at fault for disregarding it. If you installed this without reading that information, I have to wonder what contracts I could get you to sign without reading. Because seriously, if you can\u0027t do your homework...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, given that, your only viable actions are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea: Download and install the host mod (opt in)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eb: Don\u0027t Download and install the host mod (opt out)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ec: Download and install, but take a few steps to remove ModStatistics (opt out)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeing too lazy to read up on it or complaining that it\u0027s \u0027too hard\u0027 to remove when it\u0027s easier than a google search isn\u0027t an excuse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3: Given what I just pointed out in #2, you should be very happy to realize that Majir has made this mod in such that it IS optional to run along side everything else, and that he IS a nice guy, and that the modding community is full of cool guys doing this for the sake of fun. Because if a corporation (like say, EA), did this, your options would ONLY be A or B. And no amount of complaints would change their mind. Just food for thought on that one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4: I should point out that KSP\u0027s modding system is very easy, and user friendly. Every mod package is held in GameData directory as it\u0027s own self-contained folder. All mods share the same basic file structure of having some sub-folders within them holding parts and plugins... maybe sounds and textures if they\u0027re more sophisticated. The most sophisticated thing around is no more than some nesting of folders within folders for organizational purposes. It couldn\u0027t get any easier to handle unless they made mind-to-machine interfaces that turned your ideas directly into mods without any of that pesky \u0027coding\u0027 stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5: Just for you guys, one more time, It takes fifteen seconds to remove ALL instances of mod statistics, without headaches or effort:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea: Go to the GameData Directory\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eb: Type \u0027ModStastics.dll\u0027 into your search bar and hit enter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ec: Wait... For the search to complete scanning of your mod directories.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ed: Highlight all instances of ModStatistics that show up in your search results and delete in one go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ee: PROFIT... or... something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6: Majir is apparently working on making things more elegant for those who seem to have a strange dichotomy of PC skills. Give him the space he needs to help you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7: Am I calling you stupid?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, but you\u0027re pushing it guys. You really are. Wake up, drink your go-juice, and shake the cobwebs out. It\u0027s not hard.
