Never heard of major problems with that mission and never heard of any problems regarding fuel. Can anybody please tell me what the matter was just for me to google it maybe?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat is wrong with those screenshots where an engine has options for the fuel but nothing regarding oxidizer?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWho knows what was the specific impulse of the attitude thrusters on the Apollo command module? As far as I can believe the web including Wikipedia they did not carry that much fuel but even that was sufficient for several minutes of intense control inputs. Also what makes me think that those engines were bipropellant? Regarding the game I am still looking for a way to simulate this on the command pods. Is it possible to add the configs for working thrusters just directly to the command pod not a separate part that would fit on via the module manager for example? Quite impossible to get the same effect by fitting bulky thrusters on the outer surface of the capsule.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
