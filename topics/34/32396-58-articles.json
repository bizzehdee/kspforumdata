There aren\u0027t actually particle emitters defined on the auger model itself. KethaneParticleEmitter is a self-contained module for defining a Unity particle emitter from a part config file. In the case of the auger (and the normal Kethane drills) the KethaneExtractor module manipulates any KethaneParticleEmitter modules it finds, positioning them at the drill point and controlling whether they emit particles. The reason adding KethaneParticleEmitters to the smelter doesn\u0027t work has nothing to do with the smelter model. It\u0027s not working because your emitter definition has \u0022Emit = False\u0022 and there are no modules on a smelter that programmatically turn emitters on.

I\u0027m definitely going to test this. Suggestion (I think already considered for the Orbital Construction) for the eventual release. Limit how much can be built at any given time, but the limit can be raised somehow. Maybe an extension on the \u0027builder\u0027 component, or added computer power, or just actual energy transfer mechanism (meaning a component and some energy needed, scaling with size of vessel). It would seem logical to have some off-world construction plant start small, able to build small rovers and escape ships etc, then increase the scale of output gradually. Myself I\u0027d say the components to increase it\u0027s size should be a hair larger than it can build, at least at first, forcing you to ship upgrades from KSC at least for a little while.
