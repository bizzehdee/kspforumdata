We really don\u0027t need another high-Isp low-thrust propulsion system; those are headaches to use (KSPI magnetic nozzles, plasma engines, and every ion engine mod ever, I\u0027m looking at you) and we already have a whole bunch of them. \u003Cp\u003EYou can theoretically just stuff more propellant through a plasma-core rocket to increase your thrust and lower your Isp anyway, so the physics check out. There\u0027s no need for a rocket with 800,000s Isp anyway with the Kerbol-sized solar system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 10-meganewton figure given on Project Rho for the beam-core engine is the maximum theoretical that you could get from an engine made of matter. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA rocket with an Isp of 10,000,000 seconds (exhaust velocity of 98,000,000 m/s) and a thrust power of 405 gigawatts would have a thrust of just over 4 kilonewtons, but I think you could get away with just injecting more antimatter and getting higher thrusts that way up to a point, but the real issue is not vaporizing your engine when \u0026gt;40% of the input power is turning into heat. The wasteheat generated by my torch drive is almost certainly several orders of magnitude too little, but I pulled some hand-waving that it\u0027s not thermalizing the gamma rays and most of the energy is lost that way. I\u0027m not at all sure that\u0027s plausible. I wanted ships that use that drive to have to carry the next size bigger radiators than normal, but anyone who\u0027s tried to get the maximum possible power out of an antimatter reactor knows that 405 gigawatts is a lot of radiator, and my engine probably should put out close to that in waste heat. Once again, I encourage you to edit that file however you like. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince this engine seems to operate on some similar principles as the Vista, maybe you could solve this problem by scaling your engine the same way, i.e. high thrust = low Isp \u0026amp; vice versa.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NeoAcario","CreatedById":24645,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-11T21:59:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Fractal_UK\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Fractal_UK\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis is entirely the rationale behind the change.\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m certainly open to suggestions about small changes to thermal rocket performance, NorthStar made a good point about a universal specific impulse cap for all propellants not being as elegant as properly accounting for the temperature of different elements a couple of pages back and I certainly will take that into account in future changes.

Other engines could be competitive with thermal rockets but only in a particular range of use cases while the thermal rockets performed generally excellently in all use cases. Having to make a tradeoff between different performance considerations is a nice thing, so despite it removing a cool toy, I think it is a change that makes the range of options available in Interstellar more interesting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlright... so then give us a thermal, magnetic rocket nozzle option?
