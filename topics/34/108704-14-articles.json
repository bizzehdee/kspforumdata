Good times and happy rendezvous results.\n\nWith MNE, you pin the menu and float the mouse up to Next Orbit.  Press once and instantly, the arrangement of the buttons changes: the topmost button changes from Next Orbit to Previous Orbit, and Next Orbit is now the second row, below where your mouse is pointing.
