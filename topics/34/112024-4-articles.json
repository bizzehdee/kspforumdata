The ships are complex, and it would be very hard to make most of them with other parts stripped away. \n\nCan confirm that the latest download now loads all the parts correctly in Sandbox mode, even with the other 70 odd mods I\u0027m running. Not unlocked full tech tree in career yet, so not sure if it works in that mode.

All of them lol. So its really hard to tell if something is missing. I have about half the tree unlocked and so far I\u0027ve got a good portion of CMES parts. There probably needs some balancing, but so far the parts are there. \n\nSo I got half a mind so try this on a bone stock install, cheat the tree unlocked and then see. Maybe even get rid of Squads parts to make it easier. Thing is... How exactly could I go about checking off each and every part in this pack? Should I just cross reference every single part in gamedata or is there a better list of sorts I can use?\n\nOh the craft files maybe. If I were to unlock the entire tree, enable stock craft then see if any of the sub assemblies or CMES crafts can\u0027t load because of a part missing. If I can load them all.. then is it safe to say all the parts are in the tree? Forgive me if its a stupid question, but are there parts in this pack that might not be in a .craft?"},{"CreatedByName":"technerd89","CreatedById":107395,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T14:00:28Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E That\u0027s really cool looking!
