In the \u0022Maneuver Planner\u0022 window, I adjusted the \u0022Tolerance\u0022 default value of 0.1m/s to ~4-6m/s. Mind you, I wouldn\u0027t recommend this for *all* flights, as it can really throw off your precision. But when a butter-knife will do just as well as a scalpel, it works fantastic! Some baby-sitting might still be needed, but for typical low-orbit rendezvous and whatnot, it\u0027s just fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELast but not least, if I may be so bold to make a request/suggestion...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould it be possible/feasible/not-a-huge-pain-in-the-you-know-what to add the control group options of \u0022open/close\u0022 in addition to \u0022toggle\u0022 for items like the hinged radome, cargo bay doors, and especially the landing gear?
