Splash down at the Polar Ice Caps,  write a crew report, go on EVA and do a temperature reading. Didn\u0027t sound that hard. I managed to splash down close enough to the icy coast several times. But it did never fulfilled the contract. After a couple of failures I edited the craft exactly to the waypoints recomended. Nothing. By chance I recognized, the the biomes were no longer called Polar Caps but Northern or Southern Ice Shelves. Might that be an issue or am I just to dumb to hit the spot propperly?\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Has anyone else expererienced a phenomenon like that?\n\u003E \n\nYeah, there was some biome changes in 1.2 along with the cleanup of biome maps.  I\u0027m not familiar with the details ([@RoverDude](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/105198-roverdude/) is the one who would know), but it certainly sounds like you\u0027ve got a contract from 1.1.3 that is no longer possible in 1.2."},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-23T10:08:06Z","Content":"Will this be compatible with Strategia once it\u0027s updated?"},{"CreatedByName":"nightingale","CreatedById":119307,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-23T15:14:46Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 5 hours ago, Veeltch said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Will this be compatible with Strategia once it\u0027s updated?\n\u003E \n\nIt was in 1.1.3 and will continue to be in 1.2"},{"CreatedByName":"SchrottBot","CreatedById":166514,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-23T15:21:09Z","Content":"Okay, than I\u0027d better ditch that special contract.

Would it be possible to separate them into two groups? Easy (to get to and find) Grasslands, Shores, Highlands, Lowlands and Mountains which are offered from the start, and the remainder only offered after you have the biome scanner parts unlocked and so a map you can find them with (SCANSat gives you that I know, not looked into what KerbNet gives the player mapwise for stock).
