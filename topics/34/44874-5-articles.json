Well, obviously one could simple keep terrain loaded at full detail with regards to physics, up to the load/render distance - but that would be quite ressource intensive. Another problem is, that even the ground wouldn\u0027t swallow the vehicle, the fact remains there\u0027s a landed vessel with constant physical contact to the ground - hence there will be plenty of physics to simulate. TL/DR: Simply \u0022disabling\u0022 the current restrictions isn\u0027t an option - it would be too cpu-intensive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat really is needed, is a third physics mode - something in between \u0022fully simulated\u0022 and \u0022on rails\u0022. Just one example: For far away vessels with ground contact, one could skip most of the physics simulations, and really just check distance to the ground (at full detail, obviously) - if it\u0027s close enough, simply keep it \u0022landed\u0022, and thus ignore any gravitational effects for \u0022landed\u0022 vessels: Just assume that what is already landed stays landed. Will such shortcuts allow exploits that could be considered cheating - like something not breaking when it should? Yes, but IMO the current restrictions are even more \u0022bad\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf they have any serious plans for \u0022multiplayer background work\u0022 as they hinted, then something like this would be neccessary anyways.

It\u0027s caused by the ground literally no longer being there *at all*, low res or high res. At farther distances, KSP replaces the ground with something that amounts to just a fake image that has no physical substance of any kind. The ground becomes just a hologram. Ironically, it actually can make the visual detail *higher* when it gets farther away and changes to a hologram instead of a mesh of physically collide-able polygons. (Thus why mountains look nicer from a distance than close up.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat the MCE mod did to deal with this problem is just put a hook on the moment a craft becomes unloaded (i.e. farther than 2.5km away if stock rules are used), and when a bit of debris goes away because it\u0027s too far from the camera, a check is performed to see if it has deployed and ready parachutes on it, and if the planet it\u0027s around is Kerbin. If so, then it treats it as if it had \u0022landed\u0022 right then, giving you the same salvage money back that it would have had it landed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s no reason the stock game couldn\u0027t do that too, but I can see an argument against it being a realistic idea to do it. The reason they don\u0027t bother recovering most first-stage rocket parts in real life isn\u0027t a matter of it being impossible to do so, but rather because the wear and tear of the launch and hard parachute landing would render it unsafe to reuse the part. They\u0027re designed to withstand the abuse of the launch long enough to last just the one launch. The shuttle\u0027s solid boosters were a rare exception, and it can be easily argued that it was proven to not be a good idea given how much it cost to refit them for a second use, and what famously happened to them on one occasion.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoboRay","CreatedById":46556,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-17T14:18:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ObsessedWithKSP\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ObsessedWithKSP\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe thing is, are they cheaper than adding on a bunch of parachutes and a probe core?
