I chose the wet to dry mass ratio and the overall density of each tank type based on the stock versions. Choosing a ratio for liquidfuel/oxidizer was easy because the ratio is nearly always 9:1 (except for the really tiny tanks), but choosing a ratio for things like pure liquidfuel was difficulty because you have a really dense jet fuel tank that has a high dry mass and also really light fuselages that have super low density. I tried to balance it as well as I could while not any parameter worse than stock, so I made pure liquidfuel have the 5:1 ratio of fuselages but denser than them closer to the dense cylindrical tank. For oxidizer I had no references, but clearly from the pure liquidfuel tanks it\u0027s more inefficient to store a propellant separately I chose a ratio of 6:1 for oxidizer. Its tanks also have a density greater than pure liquidfuel but less than liquidfuel/oxidizer combined.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"asmi","CreatedById":59068,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-13T17:22:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs there any way to make it work with modular fuel tanks mod?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-13T17:56:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/stretchy-tanks-0-2-2-modular-fuels-compatibility-unofficial-fix/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/stretchy-tanks-0-2-2-modular-fuels-compatibility-unofficial-fix/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFixes the dry mass bug, and incidentally some bugs with MFT too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AncientGammoner","CreatedById":77111,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-13T18:34:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not a bug, the mod works fine with standard modular fuel tanks.

Nowhere does it store the multiplier its using to calculate basemass, nor does it give any indication to even know when it\u0027s using RealFuels instead of normal. Starwaster\u0027s \u0022fix\u0022 is to store that information in my plugin... which I\u0027m not exactly enthused about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Starwaster\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Starwaster\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWrong. \u003Cp\u003E if you really supported the official release then MF basemass would be complied with rather than being overridden.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, it has to be overwritten since MF does not update basemass after the initial load, so it would have no way of knowing if the tank was stretched.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eyour understanding of the MF mod and its contributors is flawed and based on incomplete knowledge.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sorry but are you the author of MFT?

You\u0027re missing the point. He did write in support for it. But it doesn\u0027t do it properly. It\u0027s ridiculously simple to fix. (Like 5 lines simple) incensed? No. Closer to exasperated. I would rather not have done any coding at all and originally intended not to be involved further. But whatever.
