But it\u0027s easy enough to understand for a new player I guess. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway: Spaceplanes are a different thing. You want to build up as much speed as possible while still in the Atmosphere. Climb up as fast as possible to a ceiling height(start experiment with around 15000m), there you level your flight and manitain a climb of around 10 degrees. You should gain a lot of speed during this phase but climb very slowly. As soon as you lose the Air to run jet engines (you should\u0027ve reached minimum 1500m/s now) you switch to your rocket engine (-mode) to push up to a good apoapsis (75km) (if even needed), coast there and circularize your orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the AtariMk3: I don\u0027t tested it yet, I don\u0027t even know if it has a vacuum engine, and you\u0027ll need one for space. But the Turbo-Ram-Jet your speaking of is just a multi mode Jet Engine, and it switches automatic if it runs out of the one air and needs the other. So no need to do anything for a new player. Like the stock RAPIER engine, you know? Except that the rapier has a rocket mode which can be used in vaccuum. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor youtube just search for \u0027SSTO\u0027 , the general idea of how to fly is the same anywhere, just the precise execution matters on craft design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the Flipping: Two options: Either you have made a to large command input on your plane at high speed , causing it to stall. Or the Craft is poorly built and shifts its center of mass to far back while burning fuel, causing the craft to flip engines-first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: anyway, I don\u0027t know how new of new you are, but you already should be able to land on the mun (with a rocket) before attempting to build an SSTO. In Kerbal terms the moon landing is easier and gives you a lot of learning about orbital mechanics while doing it. THen you can build a spaceplane, or go interplanetary\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit2: Test flown the Thing, and I can assure you it is more than capable of getting into orbit in stock. I flew it in 5xRSS and got 3600m/s at Apoapsis. try an Acent of 20 to 30 degrees once your over 15000m , and turn RCS on over 40000m cause you\u0027ll have less aero control. So very capable that craft. Although the reentry behaviour is a little \u0027backwards\u0027... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit3: Tested with FAR of course.
