It also appears that MJ isn\u0027t able to locate the docking port correctly and seems to be about 20 meters off on where it thinks the port is? The port has five nodes, one is occupied, and the ones that are open are radial from the main ship.\u003Cp\u003EWatching the RCS bursts, MJ seems to be trying to fire all of the jets around the circumference of the ship over and over again in sequence as if it is searching for the target and missing it. Watching the navball while this goes on, MJ seems to be aiming for a point on the outer edge of the target icon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny thoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m having this issue as well, build 213, and a clean 23.5. It\u0027s not just RCS in docking guidance, it\u0027s happening whenever MJ is trying to stay on a node (or docking), whether RCS is on or off. Both large and small vessles of mine can be seen oscillating when zoomed in. It seems to oscillate around the target, and cannot seem to stop on the target. I get the impression that it corrects to get on target, but fails to slow rate of turn until the target has passed, thereby pushing it into a perpetually correcting loop.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
