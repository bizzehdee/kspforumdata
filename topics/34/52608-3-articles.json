In 0.6 there is now a clear distinction between how often the screen is redrawn, how often text is processed \u003Cem\u003E(which is actually kind of slow)\u003C/em\u003E and how often the calculator runs across the ship asking parts how much resources do they have and other stuff like that \u003Cem\u003E(which is faster than I expected it would be)\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMemory use is also not that high, seeing as how the major memory consumer in KSP is part textures loaded from disk and kept up in there in perpetuity.

So we render a 3D navball to a 2D plane to display on a 2D screen in a 3D world to heighten your immersion. Like the Enhanced Navball \u003Cem\u003E(where many of the ideas and a little code comes from)\u003C/em\u003E it displays more directional markers than the stock ball. This example package does not enable it on it\u0027s screens, as all of them remain side by side with the stock navball. But you can uncomment the lines in the prop.cfg to take a look at it with my really rough placeholder textures... For a properly polished example, you will want to see ALCOR.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThere are now variables for time to ascending and descending node with target.
