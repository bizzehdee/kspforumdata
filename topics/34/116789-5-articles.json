It seems that while the contract states a required antenna power, what it actually desires is antenna range. The range is modified by difficulty settings in the advanced portion under \u0022Range Modifier\u0022. So if you are playing on hard (0.65 range) then your 5M relay becomes 3.25M range.\n\nI would imagine this would require a change in ContractConfiguartor with its antennaPower parameters and accounting for difficulty modifiers.\n\nIn the mean time, you can either adjust your range modifier to 1.0 to match, or you can patch the contracts to modify the relay power requirement by your settings, though you\u0027ll still have a mismatch between what a relay power stat says, and what the contract requires.\n\n    @CONTRACT_TYPE[CommNet*]:NEEDS[ContractPacks]:FINAL\n    {@PARAMETER[HasAntenna]{\t@minAntennaPower *= 0.65 // Change this to your difficulty range modifier}\n    }"},{"CreatedByName":"OmegaConstruct","CreatedById":177903,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-04-13T19:28:58Z","Content":"I was having the same problem as many others where the contracts wouldn\u0027t recognize when I had more than 5m antenna capacity.
