I do have a question though, are there any plans to add a S2 wide body cargo bay? The fuselage itself is massive, and I think there\u0027d be plenty of room for detachable cargo inside. It would be nice to have a decent amount of cargo without having to go all the way up to the HL body. A widebody passenger section might be nice too, but I think someone else already mentioned that. Inline docking ports for the S2 and S2 Widebody would also be nice, but admittedly that\u0027s a luxury. Either way. Excellent work.
