The lava planet has actual lava, and trying to land on the lava will cause your ship to explode.\n\nLet\u0027s see the new planets and moons\n\nPIGGE\n\nPigge is a large and hot \u0022sun-hugging\u0022 planet, as it\u0027s located one million kilometers from the sun (Moho is at around five millions kilometers). Because of the extreme heat, some parts of the planet are covered with molten lava which destroys any ship attempting to land on it. Pigge\u0027s atmosphere is extremely hot, and an heat shield is required. Pigge is extremely hard to reach, and even harder to land on, but the science rewards are worth the efforts.\n\nRadius : 800km (A bit larger than Eve)\n\nAtmosphere : Yes\n\nSemi-Major Axis : 1 000 000 km\n\nCHANI\n\nChani is a beautiful light green-turquoise gas giant with rings. It hosts a system with five different moons. This planet has the same orbit properties as Urania, an amazing planet from an old PlanetFactory Planet Pack : Sido\u0027s Urania System. Chani orbits between Dres and Jool.\n\nRadius : 5500 km (A bit smaller than Jool)\n\nAtmosphere : Yes\n\nSemi-Major Axis : 46 000 000 km\n\nNAMO\n\nNamo is a small rocky moon orbiting Chani. It has a very large impact crater which was created by a gigantic collision in the distant past. The crater is filled with hot lava. The surface is also very spiky.\n\nRadius : 95 km\n\nAtmosphere : Yes\n\nSemi-Major Axis : 40 000 km\n\nYUIL\n\nYuil is a frozen moon of Chani. The majority of the surface is covered by ice, and only a small band near the equator remains unfrozen.\n\nRadius : 320 km\n\nAtmosphere : Yes\n\nSemi-Major Axis : 77 500 km\n\nHOTHIVE\n\nHothive is a large moon orbiting Chani. It has a dense atmosphere and oceans of an unknown pink liquid which apparently tastes good.\n\nRadius : 500 km\n\nAtmosphere : Yes\n\nSemi-Major Axis : 100 000 km\n\nROCKO\n\nRocko is a moon of Chani with mountainous and uneven terrain. It looks very similar to Dres in colors.\n\nRadius : 220 km\n\nAtmosphere : No\n\nSemi-Major Axis : 177 500 km\n\nCarta\n\nCarta is a small, very small, moon of Chani around twice the size of Gilly. It\u0027s orbit is very inclined and excentric. Scientists thinks Carta is a remain of the gigantic collision that Namo suffered. It also rotates pretty fast.\n\nRadius : 25 km\n\nAtmosphere : No\n\nSemi-Major Axis : 7 750 000 km\n\nGallery\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/lTkgf)\n\nSome questions about the mod\n\nQ : Do the planets have biomes?\n\nA : Yes, most of them do.\n\nQ : Do the planets have custom science reports?\n\nA : No. It will be probably included in a future release.\n\nQ : What are the resolutions of the textures?\n\nA : All planets are 2048x1024, exept for Pigge and Hothive, with 4096x2048 resolutions, and Chani, with a[resolution!\\[arrow-10x10.png\\](http://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png)](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/#93143433) of 288x144.\n\nQ : Is the lava real lava?\n\nA : Yes. If you try to land on it, your ship overheats and explodes\n\nVersion History\n\n[1.0.2] : Added rings for Chani\n\n[1.0.1] : Changed Yuil texture\n\n[1.0.0] : Initial Release\n\nPlaned Features :\n\nBiomes for all planets/moons\n\nCustom science reports\n\nMore planets/moons\n\nThanks to :\n\nThe Kopernicus Team, for creating Kopernicus\n\nArtyomka15, for creating the KerbalGalaxy mod, as I based my planets configs on KerbalGalaxy\u0027s configs\n\n Download and Installation\n\n[http://www./download/f5v77hpnpem0i7h/ChaniPack.rar](http://www./download/f5v77hpnpem0i7h/ChaniPack.rar)\n\nTo install the mod, just drop the \u0022ChaniPack\u0022 folder in your gamedata folder.\n\nDon\u0027t forget to leave a reply (so the mod doesn\u0027t sink!) if you enjoyed the mod ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nAlternate Configs\n\n**Chani as Gas Planet 2 and Eeloo orbit change**\n\n[http://www./download/d2n21o8w6z28d6n/ChaniPackChanges.rar](http://www./download/d2n21o8w6z28d6n/ChaniPackChanges.rar)\n\nThis config will relocate Chani beyond Jool (kinda turning it into the second gas giant) , and move Eeloo further away from the Sun. Warning : This config might not work with mods which change Eeloo\u0027s orbit, such as Outer Planets Mod. You MUST install the base mod first, then install this alternate config.\n\n(Config Idea by Gkirmarthal)\n\nIf you have an idea for an alternate config, just send me a private message, or post a reply with your idea.\n\n ![QE1ncUT.png](http://i.imgur.com/QE1ncUT.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-02T16:43:10Z\u0022 title=\u002208/02/2015 04:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Elowiny**"},{"CreatedByName":"MoeKitsune","CreatedById":127670,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-18T18:21:31Z","Content":"I have 2 questions: 1, Is Chani\u0027s orbit beyond Jool? and 2, Can I help with the science defs?"},{"CreatedByName":"Elowiny","CreatedById":117659,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-18T18:27:30Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I have 2 questions: 1, Is Chani\u0027s orbit beyond Jool? and 2, Can I help with the science defs?\n\n1 : No, it\u0027s between Dres and Jool.\n\n2 : Yes, of course you can!"},{"CreatedByName":"MoeKitsune","CreatedById":127670,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-18T18:55:08Z","Content":"I already have an idea for an EVA report def for Pigge\u0027s lava oceans: HOTHOTHOTHOTHOOOOOT!"},{"CreatedByName":"Elowiny","CreatedById":117659,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-18T18:57:44Z","Content":"If you want to help with the science reports, just create a notepade file, write the reports in it and send it to me using mediafire or dropbox."},{"CreatedByName":"Nansuchao","CreatedById":135151,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-18T23:23:17Z","Content":"Hi Elowiny, just a little question: why this name for a planet pack?"},{"CreatedByName":"Elowiny","CreatedById":117659,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-19T06:14:27Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Hi Elowiny, just a little question: why this name for a planet pack?\n\nLook at the name of the gas giant.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-19T06:17:21Z\u0022 title=\u002207/19/2015 06:17  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Elowiny**"},{"CreatedByName":"Nansuchao","CreatedById":135151,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-19T07:08:25Z","Content":"Yes, I was talking about that :-)))"},{"CreatedByName":"Elowiny","CreatedById":117659,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-19T07:15:02Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Yes, I was talking about that :-)))\n\nI found this name on a sci fi world generator website.
