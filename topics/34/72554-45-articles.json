The mass of the cable increases by the cube of the winch size; assuming the cable\u0027s diameter stays the same, that means its length must increase by the cube of winch size. This could also be replaced by maxlenght = 1, cableWidth = 1, if you want the cable to scale in all dimensions. I haven\u0027t had any trouble with the other factors, so I don\u0027t feel the need to scale them, but from a physical perspective, the damping factor and springiness of a chunk of material scales by its cross-sectional area (because they depend on material parameters like Young\u0027s modulus, which links deformation to force per unit area), so if you scale cableWidth by 1, then cableSpring and cableDamper should both scale by 2. EDIT: or maybe by 3, since the length is also increasing -- F = kx, so the force should scale with the length as well -- and this would also apply to the case where only length is being scaled. I haven\u0027t tried towing anything with a supremely-long cable, but using a super-long anchor line didn\u0027t seem to cause any problems, so it\u0027s probably fine to leave the force parameters unscaled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, some advice for using long winches: maybe attach some lights to the grappling point, so that it\u0027s easy to find (and thus release) the anchor, or bind it to an action group during assembly.
