I bet that if you had the cockpit pod and the curved engine bank in the back of the ship to the same scale, that a dedicated fan could recreate the rest of the ship easily enough with either stock parts or existing mods. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThough keeping the part count down is a good counter-argument. Making some of the larger Star Wars ships with stock parts or existing mods might cause some people\u0027s systems to lag too much.
