I sent my tiny command pod along with a large pod into orbit and the separated pod controlled correctly, yet my much larger lander with many more pieces did have inverted controls. Idk if it was the extra parts, or that I was in the Mun\u0027s orbit that caused it though (I\u0027m assuming it\u0027s the extra parts).\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust a guess for now, but I think the RCS thrusters are remembering the previous vessel configuration, and the changed center of mass makes everything work in reverse sometimes. I\u0027ll take a look at this, and if that is the case, see if I can tell them to re-analyze the vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PatientZero","CreatedById":34150,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-17T02:15:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m getting an error here\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022This part type isn\u0027t available in this version of KSP\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have 0.16 and the plugins dl\u0027d...

I found the same issue in SAS on Debris. After forcing SAS to apply torque, it would act as if the center of gravity was still where it was before decouple. The SAS PID would run on killRot, but the error correction values would be way off.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cyclestart","CreatedById":37482,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-17T03:47:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs it possible to use mechjeb to keep ones ship pointed at a another ship similar to how you can use smart ass to stay pointed pro/retro grade, normal ...ect?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
