See, the optimal ascent trajectory (in terms of delta v expended) is a \u003Cem\u003Ezero-lift\u003C/em\u003E turn, which means your angle of attack is always zero. Put another way, your rocket\u0027s nose is pointed straight at the prograde marker on the navball at all times, throughout the ascent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re burning such that your rocket is at terminal velocity during the early part of your ascent, you\u0027re going to end up burning way too hard.

The kinds of rockets I build tend, as a rule, to get very close to a zero-lift profile when I limit MechJeb to 18 meters per second, start turning at 500 meters, finish turning at 40 kilometers, and set the curve parameter to 60%. I got there empirically, by trying different strategies with the same rocket and dialing it in to the point where varying any parameter significantly cost me delta v. I could optimize things further, but I\u0027m happy with where I ended up, so I\u0027m sticking with it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Big_Ron","CreatedById":58256,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-13T17:58:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eis anyone having an issue Docking with 2.0.8.
