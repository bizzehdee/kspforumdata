The \u0022current biome\u0022, \u0022height\u0022 and \u0022slope\u0022 stuff in it do only work on the outermost zoom level for kerbin, more on that in the technical details below.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlthough this version can be scrolled indefinitely to the left and to the right, POI and anomalies will only show up in the \u0022center\u0022 of the map.

I had to change a lot of small bits inside of the Leaflet KSP plugin to make it work as my setup is somewhat different to the original one. i also made changes so that my different directory structure works better, and this should be also good if ever someone else gets this project as there are no more hard-coded urls in the Leaflet KSP plugin. everything now smoothly works from the base dir with subdirectories, without the need for subdomains and such. also, the whole thing could be zipped up and should work locally without trying to reach external servers, which the current zip version does.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe graphic tiles for sat, slope and hight inside the ZIP archive were complete, but the tiles for the biome layer were missing.

between land and water.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis does not work out for water \u0027\u0026amp;\u0027 or desert \u0027(\u0027 and all of the other characters though - this might be for the reason that the caracter \u0022 (0x22) is skipped because it is needed inside the json files to begin and end the strings. that means: \u0026amp; (0x26) is the 6th valid character (not the 7th, because \u0022 is skipped), the 6th key is 0, and 0 is water. for the deserts: ( (0x28) is the character for deserts, ( is the 8th valid character, the 8th key is 5, and 5 equals deserts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, the slopes data does not have a data field because it needs no text translation - in the keys there are all needed informations: if you scroll back up the the post about the slope data, you can see that the dark-blue part on the ice caps of the planet are space characters in the text grid. the space character is the first valid character, so the slope at that position is equal to the first key - it is 0\u00B0 (which is correct if i believe the map overlay).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthe same is true for the elevation data: the elevation file has tons of keys because there are so many different heights. around the ice caps, there also are space characters in the json files. 0 is the first valid character, and the first key is 30, so the height at the poles is 30m, which is exactly the height shown on the map overlay. the elevation data has no textual representation, so the \u0022data\u0022 field is empty as it is in the slopes data.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthe elevation data has another quirk though - it has far more than 96 keys which would exhaust the ascii charset - in fact it has about 2000 different keys (which comply to about 2000 different elevations). the grid looks weird, because i guess that the file is then encoded in utf-8.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nso much for the file format - what next?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n---edit: i am now pretty sure about the UTF8 - first, because it is named \u0022UTFgrid\u0022 (duh!) and second because there are UTF-specific decoding functions in the parser.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-11-21T12:15:52Z\u0022 title=\u002211/21/2016 12:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 21, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by damaltor\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Drew Kerman","CreatedById":103177,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-24T02:20:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just now poked \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/162625-ivansanchez/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022162625\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/162625-ivansanchez/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@IvanSanchez\u003C/a\u003E on twitter so hopefully he will stop by at some point to let us know how he\u0027s getting on with his v1.x leaflet version of KMaps.
