In the CFG files for certain engines, for instance the RS-68B/C, the \u0022ModuleSurfaceFX\u0022 is added but no launch smoke shows up in this game. However, when I tested the SLS block 1 SRB with the ModuleSurfaceFX launch smoke shows up.\n\u003E \n\nCorrect... without doing a lot of homework we threw that on a few engines just to see what would happen, and didn\u0027t tinker with it further. More on that later.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 2 hours ago, Delta\\_8930 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Both the LV-900 engine and the Orion main engine \u0022LV-900 with extended nozzle and higher ISP\u0022 send me an error message that it is \u0022occluded\u0022 when I try to ignite it. It says that igniting is not possible. When I attempted to manually ignite the engine through right clicking it nothing happened and the the game said that the engine was off.\n\u003E \n\nYeah!  The concept was rolled out before 1.0.5 and now it doesn\u0027t work until we re make the Orion Spacecraft Adapter Collider. This is simple enough, but didn\u0027t want to put the update off any longer. So the part was pulled from Orion however it gets used for other things so it\u0027s still in the pack.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-15T01:57:30Z\u0022 title=\u002212/15/2015 01:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by YANFRET**"}]}
