In general let\u0027s say the price is too low and the impact tolerance is way too high. I\u0027ve started a new game an will give examples only from the second tech tier, but from what I have seen, it\u0027s not different in the other tiers. However, I do not think they need their own tech node and I think they are only \u0022not\u0022 to \u0022moderately\u0022 overpowered (not taking impact tolerance into account), as far as I can see having not unlocked everything yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample 1: fuel tanks\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVanilla FL-T400 vs. HH-125-A and B. First of all the extremeyl high impact tolerance popped into my eye. The unit fot this is m/s so the HHs have 160 m/s wich means that they yould still function after they had been thrown againt the ground with 576 kph or 358 mph if you prefer that unit. The Vanilla tank a a realisic 6 m/s . Imagine a car or bicicle rider that hits a wall with 6 m/s, it\u0027s already not that slow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the princing, the vanilla tank costs 850 credits an the HH-125-A costs 800 which is actually a bit worse, when you take into account that the latter one has about 22% less fuel, so that\u0027s totally ok. \u003Cem\u003EBut\u003C/em\u003E the HH-125-\u003Cstrong\u003EB\u003C/strong\u003E has twice the amount of fuel an costs...well, the same 800.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample 2: (upper stage) engines\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERMA-3 vs. vanilla LV-909. Again, the RMA has a whopping 60 m/s impact tolerance, again the LV has a realistic 7 m/s. The specs of the RMA are actually totally ok. It\u0027s a bit heavier than the LV but more effective and a quite a bit stronger. If it\u0027d cost a tad more, it\u0027d be just right, but actually it costs less than half of the LV (300 vs. 750). However, the lower stage engines do not show such a pricing discrepance, the are well in sync with the vanilla lower stage engines (if you don\u0027t take the impact tolerance into account \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E ).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers o/\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tiberion","CreatedById":8356,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-01T10:34:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot too much done due to Thanksgiving, but I did get everything unwrapped, materials set up in Unity, so its time to texture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8MDhoSS.png\u0022 alt=\u00228MDhoSS.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wasmic","CreatedById":64885,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-01T11:47:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENow that there\u0027s talk about balancing, a rebalance of the Orbital Bertha would be in order.

The new career mode uses entryCost and technode only, which are based off of the stock costs per node (so parts in the same node are the same entrycost) - when they do add part purchasing I\u0027ll re-balance the actual costs, but you can safely ignore those for now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are probably a few of those parts with the weird crashtolerances - I generally keep them slightly higher for 2 reasons: Its not realistic that each and every part explodes itself into oblivion when it crashes, there should be some debris. And due to the massive larger parts in NP, some parts which might be weight bearing need to have higher tolerances or they\u0027ll be crushed when it spawns on the pad (the breakingForce and Torque is related, but for joint strength, this is just managing when a part explodes due to impact.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, there are some that are too high still, hold-overs from older versions or typos. I\u0027ll do a balance pass on them. I don\u0027t consider it a factor in something being overpowered though, since even is they are on a lander, where crash tolerance is a balance factor, other parts like landing legs, engines, pods, and such are balanced around that, so an entire craft won\u0027t survive a hard landing and you\u0027re just left with useless debris.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was actually expecting you to discuss node placement or entryCosts related to career mode - do you find those mostly balanced?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually the Poodle itself has a weird balance setup, its TWR is 88, whereas the other stock engines range from 130 to 250. Back a few pages in this thread you\u0027ll find another discussion of engine weights, which resulted in the changes in the last release, and we made sure the NP engines fell between 150 and 250 TWR (that\u0027s maxthrust divided by mass) - though I may be wrong on the numbers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll actually turn down the thrust on the Orb.
