Try putting him on a vessel and then recovering through the *flight view*\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B9 (any other recovery method will result in the tourist not leaving).\n\u003E \n\nI have a somewhat similar but not really issue.\n\nI have just completed Tito\u0027s contract, but I have failed it, due to him being \u0027killed\u0027. I am slightly peeved about the game concluding this, as I recovered him fairly and squarely. However, the manner of recovery was... non standard. Specifically, that I used StageRecovery. We slapped a pair of parachutes on the passenger fuselage, and a heat shield, and just ejected them off the end of the rocket. StageRecovery brought Bill and Tito back just fine - both were mentioned on the SR popup, and Bill is back in the Astronaut Complex. Tito is nowhere to be found, and I have the perks of having failed the contract. \n\nQuestion one, is how do I edit my save file to show that I completed the contract rather than failed it?\n\nQuestion two, is whether this interaction between CC and SR is something that should be fixed by Squad, something that should be fixed by SR, or something that should be fixed by CC?\n\nThanks for the help.\n\nEDIT: Question one is low priority, have just made some changes to my persistence file and will be testing them shortly... fingers crossed!\n\nGuess I will have to make a point of recovering Tourists \u0027normally\u0027 rather than with StageRecovery.\n\nEdit2: question one is mebbe medium priority for me... Im not sure where to add TouristCount and TouristLowOrbitCount? Other than that, I think I fixed everything else associated with the contract.\n\nEdit3: If I have this right, I add those keys into the DATA section of the PersistentDataStore SCENARIO... but I suspect I have to add them underneath a node. Which I dont know the name of.\n\nEdit4: I feel like this would be easier if I knew how to code. Would this be easier if I knew C#?\n\nEdit5: well, it no longer throws an argument out of bounds exception when I load it, so thats good. I think I fixed it? Fingers crossed. I feel like the more important thing for the thread at least, is seeing what could be done to make these mods interface better, rather than details of how to fix the save file when the current behavior happens due to user error.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-05T12:25:18Z\u0022 title=\u002212/05/2015 12:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by blu3wolf**"},{"CreatedByName":"nightingale","CreatedById":119307,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-05T17:47:18Z","Content":"I\u0027ll need to look into the StageRecovery compatibility, likely they need to be firing off a specific event that they are not firing.

Accept the contract again (it should show up again even though you\u0027ve failed it), and then go to the alt-f12 debug, and find the contract on the contracts tab.
