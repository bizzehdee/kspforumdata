There is no information about any error. All I can do is waiting or ALT\u002BF4.\n\nIf this is your very first time running the game (fully, without quitting), then the load time will be HUGE.\n\nThis is because ATM is converting and caching each texture file it finds. In many cases, and depending on your machine\u0027s hardware, this can take a very long time.\n\nI would recommend removing CMES and running KSP so that ATM can cache all the Squad/NASA textures (This can take a long time). Then put CMES back in and load it again (again, it will take a long time). This is due to ATM, not CMES.\n\nAlternately, you can use utilities such as KSP2DDS and DDSLoader, which would considerably cut down on the ATM texture caching and general memory usage of KSP in general. But, this has been known to create some texture issues with various mods, but I\u0027m assuming you don\u0027t want to go through and manually convert all textures to DDS.\n\nIn Summary: ATM takes a REALLY long time to load on first run due to it caching files. This only happens on the first run. On some slower machines or when trying to load too many new mods at once, it can sometimes cause the computer to hang. This is an ATM issue, not a CMES issue. Just start up KSP, go eat dinner, come back and it should be done."},{"CreatedByName":"YANFRET","CreatedById":90547,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T14:51:51Z","Content":"Also most CMES textures are DDS now and it\u0027s memory footprint is 25% of the last beta which makes it quite economical presently."},{"CreatedByName":"edemlama","CreatedById":100153,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T15:51:22Z","Content":"is there a way to only use the inflatable heat-shields?
