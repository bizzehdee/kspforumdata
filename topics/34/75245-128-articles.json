I\u0027m using RT2 1.6.7 and KSP 1.0.4. I\u0027ve created a com sat network at 776.6 km using the tutorial in the RemoteTech docs. I modified my satellites to include two Comms DTS-M1 dishes. One is pointed at the Mun and the other is pointed at Minimus. As I understand it, the satellites should only use the dish for connections if the another satellite is both in range and in the cone of the dish (and in the target\u0027s SOI according to the docs but I think this no longer applies in the new version).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe weird thing is that periodically, two neighboring satellites in the network will connect to each other using the dish of one or both even if both dishes of both sats are pointing away from each other due to the position of the Mun and Minimus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow are two screenshots. Both show dish connections only as well as the Mun and Minimus. In the first, the cones are hidden and the other has the cones visible. If you look closely in the second image, the only dish connection should be the one between the sat to the left of Kerbin and the one above. If the cones drawn in the map view are intended to be just a simple representation then the dish connections to KSC might be possible but I\u0027m not sure if that would explain the dish connection between the sat to the right of Kerbin and the one above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/70102736/RT2%20-%20Dish%20connections/screenshot1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/70102736/RT2%20-%20Dish%20connections/screenshot2.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TrooperCooper","CreatedById":110599,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-11T15:07:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAhoy!

Your antennas are not required to be set to active vessel, that just assigns the center of it\u0027s cone to the active vessel.

The problem with Active vessel is if the vessel is moving in a large orbit, the cone could shift out of communication range of some other satellite that is needed to complete the relay.
