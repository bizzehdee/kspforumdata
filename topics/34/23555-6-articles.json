I released the cable, retracted it, and grapple appeared again on the nose, but the cable was still not retracted.

I used another ship with vertical winch/grapple combo - this time not mounted straight on the capsule, but on a small cubic strut. I went up, shot the grapple at spent upper stage of another rocket and it connected this time. So i started tugging (gently) backwards with RCSes at first. Junk started swinging badly around, but i figured it was due to grapple attached in 1/3 of the piece, so i was not worried. I tried to reduce swinging with RCS pulses, and it seemed to be working...until the piece of junk broke in half. Great, now i had two pieces to deorbit instead of one. I tried to catch closer of the two, and bug struck again. My ship was literally torn to pieces, with capsule again frozen in space and unable to end flight. I got Jeb out into EVA, and he was able to change his orbit and end flight.
