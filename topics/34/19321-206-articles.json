The trick is placing them in the vertical mode first and placing the CoT through the center of the CoM. The next task is to make sure the CoM does not move as the fuel drains out of the craft. This means placing the fuel tank(s) in the center of the CoM. The last thing is getting the airbrakes setup so you can slow down to transition from horizontal flight to vertical flight.
