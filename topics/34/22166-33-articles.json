I guess I\u0027ll keep trying to look with infinite fuel on, but how does one officially find kethane on the surface with the detectors? :l\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imgur.com/OByUnux.png\u0022 alt=\u0022OByUnux.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts a bit tricky finding a place for the detector, but it usually ends up stuck on a radial fuel tank on my landers. Now, for landing at a deposit. Usually I go in a low orbit, around 5000-6000 meters over Minmus, that way I have the least amount of velocity, then, when I have a deposit, I kill off My horizontal velocity, and attempt to land. Its a bit tricky finding a place for the detector, but it usually ends up stuck on a radial fuel tank on my landers. I suppose that would work at the mun too, but you would need more power to kill the velocity, but not that much more. I always begin landing/killing velocity, as soon as I find a deposit, as they seem to go for a kilometer or two, so I have enough time to kill off the velocity. Now I know all of this from experience, and the only mission failures using this method are... (A) Running out of fuel.
