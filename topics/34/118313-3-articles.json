Even the descriptions in the individual tabs (sat coverage, bases, stations, etc...) are gone.\n\nStrangely the satellites are not recognized even when I delete the AntennaRange folder.

If you lower the resolution you can play with more mods. Sacrificing graphics quality of game play. I only lower by one just so I can enjoy the game looking good while being able to play with a moderate amount of mods.
