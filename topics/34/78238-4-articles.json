I\u0027ve found in the past that the partRef is null when not in the flight scene, which will have disastrous effects if it\u0027s referenced (because KSP fails very spectacularly for simple issues). Half the time you\u0027re referencing the partRef to get the partInfo, but the ProtoPartSnapshot has the same access to partInfo (in fact, half the time you\u0027re referencing the partInfo directly from the ProtoPartSnapshot). Additionally, are you assuming that the partInfo.cost is the dry cost? Cause that\u0027s actually the full cost. If you pass the ProtoPartSnapshot through the ShipConstruction.GetPartCosts() function you can get the dry cost and the cost of any resources contained.\u003Cp\u003EI just briefly browsed the source to see if you had added anything for KCT yet, since I don\u0027t know what function you need me to add (more specifically, if the damage value should be an int, float, or double), but it doesn\u0027t look like you have yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKinda crazy that I haven\u0027t been able to reproduce any of that, but thanks for the advice! I\u0027ve fixed those, reuploading it now. Right now, I\u0027m just assuming the damage is essentially a float, that\u0027s applied across all the parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
