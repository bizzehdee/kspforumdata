However, you can have an alternative \u0022ration\u0022 mode, which reduces their consumption to a much lower rate (1/4 or 1/10 of normal, perhaps), but this gives you the reputation penalty. If a kerbal runs out of rations completely, after a suitable period (a few days, perhaps), they die.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOptionally (I don\u0027t know if this could be coded), kerbals in ration mode are disabled: they can\u0027t be doing tiring activities while on strict rations. They have to conserve their energy. So, kerbals in ration mode would be unable to pilot, go EVA, do science, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENaturally, changing modes applies to the entire ship, rather than individual kerbals, for two reasons: one, I can imagine it\u0027d be fiddly and annoying to go through a 10 kerbal ship toggling modes (and probably more difficult to code?), and two, it\u0027d be horrible for the moral of the poor kerbals to have Jeb eating heartily while Bill starves on his reduced rations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis gives you some interesting gameplay options. Got a ship stuck out on Duna with a diminishing snack supply? Crap! Better send out a resupply mission pronto! But to launch a resupply mission powerful enough to get out there in time, taking a very inefficient fast route, would be very expensive. What about the alternative...telling the kerbals on the ship to conserve their rations? They\u0027d go hungry, but they\u0027d live. It wouldn\u0027t look very good for you back home, though: starving astronauts are a very high-profile failure, hurting your reputation. Which do you pick? Funds or reputation...or lives?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would LOVE to play that variant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny thoughts on this suggestion?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Levelord","CreatedById":57711,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-16T18:58:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWill there be an update for this mod for 0.9?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Doctor Axel","CreatedById":64944,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-16T20:10:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust discovered Snacks - looks like fun. ^^ TAC is cool but not quite whimsical enough for my KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI second the notion that a Deadly version should be possible - maybe a configuration option of some kind.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vardicd","CreatedById":75832,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-17T12:37:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWould love to see an update here! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tygoo7","CreatedById":57345,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-17T22:14:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWorking in 0.90 for me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vardicd","CreatedById":75832,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-18T02:50:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyeah I see its working too\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jlcarneiro","CreatedById":79196,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-18T16:34:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWith 0.90, I had to update a lot of mods and get drawn to Snacks once again!
