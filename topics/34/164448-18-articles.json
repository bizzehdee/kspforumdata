Thank you so much for making it. I\u0027ve tried\u00A0all the parts failure\u00A0mods\u00A0around\u00A0and I like the experience that BARIS the most by far. That being said I play with KCT which I\u00A0also love,\u00A0and I love that this mod integrates with it but I do have one tiny thing that irks me\u00A0about it. I may be\u00A0alone in this but I truly hope you consider this\u00A0as\u00A0an\u00A0alternative integration option.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI feel like KCT integrates with BARIS in\u00A0a way that makes the integration feature of BARIS unnecessarily\u00A0dichotomic with the construction\u00A0aspect of KCT thus removing\u00A0a feature of this mod I rather enjoy\u00A0and simply replacing it with what I feel is\u00A0a slightly different feature in KCT. In my eyes, integration and construction do not necessarily have to be mutually exclusive. I rather enjoy the option of investing\u00A0additional time into\u00A0a rocket to make it more reliable\u00A0and I simply do not have that option in KCT. I also do not have the option of paying workers which not only makes multiple event cards meaningless in my save but also removes another valuable functionality of the mod as an additional resource sink. In my mind the perfect integration\u00A0between the mods would be rather than making the user choose between only one or the other method, to simply\u00A0append integration\u00A0after KCT does the construction phase. To be more specific my view of integration would have KCT complete construction, then\u00A0allow the option of undergoing integration instead of rolling out to the launch pad while the craft is in KCT\u0027s \u0027storage\u0027. Integration\u00A0would function\u00A0as it does in BARIS without KCT except that\u00A0after integration is completed the rocket would be returned to KCT storage with the reliability points altered\u00A0as needed. If it is rolled out before integration is done, then it would instead function\u00A0as if integration was not done.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI understand this would probably require\u00A0a complete rewrite of the KCT-BARIS interactions but I do feel it\u0027d be\u00A0a much welcome touch if only because I feel that KCT\u0027s time factor is more necessary as in\u00A0building the rocket, while BARIS\u0027 time factor is separate\u00A0and optional\u00A0akin to stress-testing it\u00A0and ensuring it functions\u00A0as intended. Again thank you for making this\u00A0amazing mod and for considering my humble suggestion for potential improvements.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: Also\u00A0not sure if you\u0027re\u00A0aware of this, but when KRASH is used with BARIS installed, KRASH simulations\u00A0are\u00A0always treated\u00A0as if the vessel had not undergone integration which makes it difficult to use.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-08-27T19:32:31Z\u0022 title=\u002208/27/2018 07:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 27, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by ThatOneBritishGuy...\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Elkram","CreatedById":151154,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-30T09:25:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello.
