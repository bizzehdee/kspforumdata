Render your clouds filter (I assume that\u0027s how you made the cloud detail texture?) at multiple resolutions--1024, 2048, 4096, and so forth. Then scale the larger ones down to 1024 each. (If GIMP supports variable cloud size for the cloud filter, just do it that way; Photoshop doesn\u0027t.) Then paste the larger ones as new layers into your 1024 image, and set the layers for the new ones to multiply. That will give you a few octaves of fractal noise.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rbray89","CreatedById":48847,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-04T06:02:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NathanKell\u0022 data-cite=\u0022NathanKell\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESome new cloud textures, a bug report, and a suggestion.\u003Cp\u003EClouds: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/yigd9ia740mq4ur/CloudsTextures.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/yigd9ia740mq4ur/CloudsTextures.zip\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt has two 2048x1024 (actually 1/2 the memory footprint of your textures, because of the upscale of non-power-of-two textures) cloud textures, and a new detail texture.
