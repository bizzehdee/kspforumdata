I was so excited following your dev process and downloading each dev build. Flying it was a lovely experience; I used it to fly 2 prop-driven firespitter bi-planes to Laythe in the cargo bay, which remains about the most fun I\u0027ve had with KSP to date. It worked great with or without FTL mods and your other ST and scifi offerings were just icing, all working great but none quite as versatile as voyager for general kerballing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince then, it seems your mods have been limping forward in a half-to-fully-broken state, compounding problems with each KSP update, which is heartbreaking considering what a positive first experience I had with this wonderfully conceived and well executed mod as a lifelong star trek superfan.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI dowloaded the new version 3.0 with bated breath, hoping that some of the problems keeping me from using this mod would have been cleaned up, but alas. I can\u0027t quite bring myself to keep testing with so much other non-broken kerbal content to explore, but I will certainly keep an eye on your changelogs and try later versions as they\u0027re released. I\u0027ll list some of the issues that have been plaguing my Kerbal SciFi experience and I apologize if some have been resolved; I\u0027ll start with what went wrong with this latest version and go backwards a bit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Voyager nacelles with stock propulsion are grossly overpowered: This problem has become even worse with the new thermal mechanics as the saucer section explodes in atmosphere with the throttle set to anything above 1/100th or whatever. I can\u0027t imagine why you would ever give it this much thrust. The saucer section propulsion is well balanced for landing but has been made largely redundant with Voyager\u0027s RCS system. The way I\u0027m looking at it, I don\u0027t need to get to Eeloo with a 1 second burn and if I want speed that extreme I would use voyager in conjunction with an FTL mod anyway. Having an imperfectly balanced load in the cargo bay ensures that voyager spins out immediately with this much raw thrust. I edit the .cfg as a workaround but it\u0027s a bit of a chore to find the right value with each update considering each test requires a re-launch of KSP on my aging rig. IIRC, Enterprise has a similar issue but less severe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. The green attach nodes aren\u0027t working properly (affects landing gear, nacelles, cargo bay.) The current workaround in the VAB is to put everything together upside down (or backwards) and use the rotate tool to position correctly. I think you can fix it in the .cfg file for the parts as well but I never bothered doing this since the VAB workaround is simple enough in general while waiting for updates. A lot of mods had this problem with KSP 1.0.x including the classic habitat pack and the parameciumkid jump drive (which still has this issues as it hasn\u0027t been updated for KSP 1.0.x) and I think of it as a minimum requirement for claiming 1.0.x compatibility. I\u0027m not sure how you missed this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. I had texture problems with both ATM and Texture Replacer. With one, the entire hull would glow bright white when saucer lights were activated and with the other, the IVA for voyager was almost completely black (respectively, I believe.) I remember that the Enterprise didn\u0027t have the black IVA problem but did share the lighting issue. I didn\u0027t bother testing the new version with Texture Replacer or ATM since it doesn\u0027t look like you\u0027ve changed anything about the models and it\u0027s not so big a deal to play without TR if I want to do Voyager things. Your pack is worth a separate KSP Scifi install if everything else is working correctly but it means I don\u0027t play with it as often and can\u0027t do as large a variety of different things without having it part of my main KSP install.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. It was valiant to try to have compatibility with KSPI, KSPI lite, and the Standalone Warp Drive plugins but it always seemed spotty and often times I had trouble getting the voyager nacelles (for example) to recognize whatever plugin was installed. This was always the most reasonable issue since mod dependencies can be frustrating for everyone, especially with mods that update frequently or change significantly. I only ever looked into them for your star trek ships anyway and usually settled on stock propulsion (impulse) and telling myself a story about how warp wouldn\u0027t be installed until Tuesday. I wish your mods came bundled with an optional FTL solution that works for sure, even if it starts to fall out of date before you can update it, like some mods do with firespitter. I think the standalone warp plugin is the best for your purposes, especially considering its very appropriate warp bubble effect and the fact that it\u0027s not embedded in a large, complicated mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Why is voyager so light? Increased mass would allow for more of a better unbalanced load margin in the cargo bay and then the thrust from the nacelles would make a lot more sense. It might be my memory playing tricks or the new aerodynamics, but I feel like voyager was much more massive when you first released it. Its terminal velocity as it stands is hilarious given that Voyager is a reasonably aerodynamic thing when pointed in the direction of travel. Semi-related, I think you should give all of your parts a ridiculous thermal mass. I\u0027d like to think that nothing short of flying into the sun should pose a realistic risk of exploding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, those are the biggest things that have kept me from really using your mod. All of your ship models are gorgeous and the IVA\u0027s are fantastic. I\u0027m happy you\u0027re still working on them but I hope you can put just a bit more care into the actual gameplay aspects as well in the future, for a better out-of-the-box experience. I sort of miss where things were going with the LCARS mod too but I haven\u0027t tried it in a while and I\u0027m not sure if it ever outgrew it\u0027s teething issues, especially with performance on my older rig. All the same, it just seemed to make sense to bundle it with scifi shipyards and I\u0027m surprised the partnership didn\u0027t stay as tight as it started out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for all your work!

The ships definitely don\u0027t explode as often now, and I think I messed with the thrust values a bit for the new update. I will however later this week actually go through everything and balance them out. Hopefully some level of consistency can be reached.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Fixed. That was an issue with the new node system. In the new system nodes can only face one way (to prevent placing parts inside of each other) so I had to go through all the parts and make the nodes face the right way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.

I was always sort of looking at those module manager patches and thinking \u0022good enough\u0022, so I\u0027m not too surprised they didn\u0027t always work.
