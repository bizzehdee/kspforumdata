For some reason, the RPM screen doesn\u0027t show the image from the custom port, and I suspect I\u0027m missing a configuration somewhere. First, here are a couple of shots showing an image from the stock Clamp-O-Tron.

Anyway, here\u0027s how I set up my custom port:\n\n![ZKlReis.png](http://i.imgur.com/ZKlReis.png)\n\nAnd here is the setup for the stock Clamp-O-Tron Jr port:\n\n![ml76Teo.png](http://i.imgur.com/ml76Teo.png)\n\nFinally, here is the config from the clamp-o-tron jr:\n\n    MODULE  \n\n    {  \n\n        name = ModuleDockingNode  \n\n        referenceAttachNode = top  \n\n        nodeType = size0  \n\n        stagingEnabled = False  \n\n    }\n\nHave you seen this type of issue before?

It looks like the docking port camera uses the root game object transform of the model.  It rotates the camera 90 degrees around X, but Mihara didn\u0027t document why it does that.  The first thing I would look at is to see if your root transform is oriented the same way as a stock docking port.
