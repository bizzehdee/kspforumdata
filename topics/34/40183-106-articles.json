I decide to change the RepairParts resource with the Community Resource Packs \u0022SparParts\u0022 resource. This is the same resource used in DangIt and other awsome mods like Kerbanite, OKS, and MKS. So now if your using DangIt you can use the same SpareParts that the mod uses to do Mission Controller Repair Missions (hence the plural). Thats correct I plan on expanding the Repair Contracts in 1.09 a lot more then whats in this release. More types of repairs.. Think ISS!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe catch was... and is.. that SpareParts is not a transferable resource like the old RepairParts was! Thats an issue, because I have no existing code in Mission Controller to overcome this fact. So instead of Writing about 2000 more lines of code. I looked around and found out that community already has EVA resource managment done. Kerbal Attachment system is a prime example and is now needed to carry around the Repair Can (yes its now KAS Enabled) and for the transfers of Non Transferable Resources I decided to use KERT (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/93627-0-25-Kerbal-EVA-Resource-Transfer-v1-1-2-08-10-2014\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKerbal EVA Resource Transfer\u003C/a\u003E).

Awesome mod! I really enjoy the Missions including the historical ones.\u003Cp\u003EI do have the issue with timer. Not that its game breaking or anything, but it happens to me very often that the \u0022stay in orbit\u0022 timer gets stuck on another Vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example: i lauched Skylab3 mission to dock do things and stay 59 days. While waiting for the rendevouz i switched to another vessel to pass the time and do other things. Suddenly the timer appeared at that Vessel not the Skylab Mission Vessel. Sadly the craft with the timer on it does not have enough life support to endure 59 days (using TAC life support). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs the Mission a failure? Can the timer be somehow stuck onto another vessel? I tried docking with the skylab Mission craft with the skylab and re-setting it via the debug menu to the skylab craft. But the timer still is on the other craft...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eany suggestions?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethx for that great mod!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Egreez\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt jumped after you went into orbit, or was your vessel that was doing the contract in orbit yet before you jumped to a new vessel? The timer check starts when you enter orbit, so if that was the case then makes sense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo way to stop that I know of on how contracts work.. meaning that any vessel can do any contract. I have a few checks but sometimes they don\u0027t work. I might check out one more thing to see if it helps while in flight, but of course it won\u0027t help now. for now I suggest on timed contract not to leave the vessel until you are in orbit. Once in orbit the timer is actually applied to your vessel ID, and can\u0027t change after that. (this has a few issues too).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut for now you can ALT F12 go to contracts and you should see all the current active contracts you have. For this one select COM (Means complete) and the contract will be finished and you will get paid. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"malkuth","CreatedById":57414,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-13T20:45:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Coga19000\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Coga19000\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell, is that an interesting and well -thought mod indeed. \u003Cp\u003EHowever, is it Fine Print -compatible, or is each going to make the other obsolete?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinePrint and MissionController work fine together.

Remember I always release ONLY pre Releases on Github! The official versions are posted on the 1st page of this thread. Thanks guys.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELittle preview of changes in 1.9 (also now in preview version)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Changed way contracts work when changing vessels. Should help with other vessels accidently doing contracts you don\u0027t want. (borrowed from finePrint)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Also added a new check for Vessel Launch time. If vessel launch time is older then Contract Acceptance Time you can\u0027t use that vessel for that contract. Whats this actually mean? Well basically you have to build a new vessel for Most contracts now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. New Civilian Contract Expedition to Mun, Minmus (and soon Duna).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. New Civilian Contract Expedition to One of your space stations for a short Stay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. New Repair Contract. EVA and Repair one of your stations that has a malfuction. You need to place a Repair Panel for this to work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Smaller Repair Panel available for those smaller satellites.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Redid the way contracts are loaded, to help with Error loading. Since the default KSP Node loading is horrible. Sorry.... just saying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. Working on timed parameters. And ways around a few problems. Still some issues to work out but they are getting better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9. You don\u0027t have to use KAS anymore to use SpareParts. I have aloud SpareParts using KERT (included) to be transferred to EVA Kerbal now. Only 1 part though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10. Oh Revert was changed a little bit by the user named RealGrep. He added the ability in settings to change the price it cost to use revert button.
