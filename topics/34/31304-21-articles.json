The mission payouts are a little high.. Because not only do they pay for the missions.. But they pay for your own missions.. Want to set up a Space Station? Guess what its going to cost you about a Million to do it... And with these missions.. You can pay for it after a few.. Won\u0027t be easy.. 1 Mission won\u0027t pay for your whole space program.. But they can be edited in the future to fix any issue we might have. So now with Mission Controller you can still do Sandbox.. Only now your going to pay money for those vessels you use.. And trust me... I used some of your vessels they are not cheap..

Perhaps now we can think up interesting cost calculations based on part category. My theory is that by applying a unique formula to every category we should gradually remove the dependency on the generalized \u0027mass/structure value\u0027 (currently 3500 per kilogramme) in the vesselResources loop. Each proposed formula should continue to incorporate mass in their own way. However, the mass offset should not be confused with the average cost of putting mass into LEO/LKO. Think of the mass in terms of an implied cost of producing/purchasing/shipping a part for your rocket. Allow the rocketeer to solve for mass, intrinsically. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Fuel is the only category that currently does this. e.g. oxidizer cost = 6 * volume.

This might be as simple as a modifier for each category - \u0022propulsion\u0022, \u0022structural\u0022, \u0022aerodynamic\u0022 etc, or it could be more specific - \u0022engine\u0022, \u0022tank\u0022, \u0022fin\u0022, \u0022sensor\u0022 etc. This basically gets the calculation to take into account the general complexity of the part. For example, structural parts like girders would have a pretty low modifier, while engines would be higher because they\u0027re harder to make. Science parts like the sensors might have really high modifiers because their mass is tiny but they\u0027re really high-tech, and therefore expensive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Level refers to the quality of the part relative to the category. For engines, this would probably be based on Isp and thrust/weight ratio. Thus, a really efficient engine would cost more than a less efficient engine that was the same mass, and an engine with higher thrust at the same efficiency would cost even more. For landing gear, the level modifier might be based on their strength; solar panels might use efficiency, batteries could use storage to mass ratio, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"soranno","CreatedById":58351,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-30T07:59:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022malkuth\u0022 data-cite=\u0022malkuth\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe Civilian Space Program Pack Updated with fixes..

Costs in hard mode balloon up very rapidly, and even basic ships to make orbit cost in the region of 90,000kb to put up, and bring down with something salvagable under deadly reentry conditions. And that\u0060s using a bare minimum of engines, which are the most expensive components. A single skipper engine, for example, costs 55,000kb or so to use when set to hard, an lv-t45 about 18,000kb(the often seen 4x30 and 1x45 engine cluster checks in at about 100 thousand), and even a humble 909 is 6,000kb. Say goodbye to mainsails, as they cost 90,000kb each. Comparing that then to the rewards of various missions, playing on hard just seems to be more grind than it\u0060s worth, as to make any meaningful launch outside the missions requires so much money that you must grind through dozens of satellite launches with some cheaply designed vehicle in order to pay for it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did for example, mission 8 of the civilian space program pack, landing unmanned on the mun and returning to kerbin. My vehicle going up cost 90,855kb. The reward for the mission was 90,000kb. I only made some gain off it, because there is 40,000kb in bonuses, 20 of which was for the return... with deadly reentry looming over proceedings, was pretty heart racing \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI came up with a fairly bare bones vehicle to launch satellites, just a solid booster and on top a 909 with small tank, and the payload on top with an ant and oscarb. I\u0060m surprised this thing even works but it still costs 30,000kb with nothing recoverable. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope you can appreciate the kind of grind that could develop. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENevertheless, I\u0060m having a whale of a time using this mod and seeing my engineering go in all manner of new directions. I\u0060m thinking I\u0060ll start switching it to easy and use it like a subsidised test mode or something, where I can make flights for testing at reduced cost and then switch back to hard after completing design to attempt missions or make real launches. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe challenge it seems is not just to get through all these missions, but rather to operate the same kind of space program we have all come to enjoy in the sandbox mode up to now, while having to operate within a budget that needs supplementing through commercial missions and government funding for specific tasks. I don\u0060t think anyone wants kerbal\u0060s career mode to be a linear story progression without the room to build and create wonderful things in the way we do now, but rather to experiment and create while within the framework of a system that has budgets, and necessary targets to achieve. Looking at some of the other creations I have worked on in kerbal so far, I very much want to see my space program expand the same way while having costs and budgeting to consider, but without it ever descending into grind after grind at low profit missions by the dozen just so that I can pay for the lifter to get this station component up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0060ve quite enjoyed looking up some of my past designs and seeing what it would cost to launch them.
