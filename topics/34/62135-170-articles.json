I\u0027ve tried it in WINE as well in Linux and it worked great on my system. I don\u0027t have a Mac system so I couldn\u0027t test it out in WINE there but one of the testers has a Mac so they may be able to do that if they\u0027re willing to install WINE. The phases may also be in separate downloads at that point but I don\u0027t know if that\u0027s for sure (because there is a bit of overlap between phases 1 through 3: phase 3 requires OMS from phase 1; phase 1 and phase 3 need round docking ports to ease payload installation; phase 1 needs aux fuel tank and stack shroud from phase 2; phase 2 needs right-angle docking mod from phase 1; etc). But you\u0027ll just have to be patient for its release. helldiver and Nazari are quite busy trying to get phase 4 done. So you can either remove the parts you want yourself, run the script included with v309 if you have a windows system, or wait until phase 4 is done. It really isn\u0027t hard to remove them yourself, especially since I made the phase part lists for you already.

Before that most modders didn\u0027t put a license on their stuff (or were using the old share-alike). However, every mod back then had some form of copyright, particularly any mod for games that were technical (flight simulators or racing simulators).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo here\u0027s what would happen; you\u0027d have some magazine that would include a CD with everyone\u0027s mods in them. Magazine got to charge, but none of us would get any money for it. Happened with Quake, Microsoft Flight Simulator, and on and on. You had very serious mods that required hours of research, suddenly show up on the back of a magazine CD that would charge. Mod authors got nothing from it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you think that\u0027s fair?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyhow, after a few lawsuits (I can\u0027t be bothered to look it up at the moment), this all started to change. I believe these lawsuits also covered things like volunteer moderators or game guides. Mods have also significantly improved since then. Take a look at KSOS. Would you consider that the quality I put into it is on par with a DLC Squad would put out, or some indie company\u0027s game?

Suddenly you had a bunch of folks posting their alternate textures and other folks asking where to download and so forth. In the interest of keeping the thread relevant to bug reports, config file improvement sharing, usage sharing (which has been priority for me), I asked to take such threads to private messages. The core textures were also being changed and updated, hence why I discouraged it (\u003Ca href=\u0022http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Esee license details regarding no derivatives\u003C/a\u003E).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The license does not allow you to make changes to any KSOS resource (it\u0027s art, 3D models, and now sounds) and share publicly.

Would you consider that the quality I put into it is on par with a DLC Squad would put out, or some indie company\u0027s game?
