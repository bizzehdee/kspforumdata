This mod\u0027s \u0022support for FMRS\u0022 only aims to support the principle what FMRS is doing and would\u00A0not actually depend on FMRS in any way. The player would be able to track a complex mission with returned stages without FMRS installed at all\u00A0by manually\u00A0making a savegame like FMRS does and loading it to fly back the reusable stages. Not using FMRS would however result in the stages not being counted as recovered while tracking the actual mission\u00A0even though the ordered repeat missions would take into account the savings amongst other things.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DStaal","CreatedById":155685,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-02T14:05:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFair enough.\u00A0 I just wanted to bring it up as a possible better technical fit.\u00A0 I do understand the pros and cons and even run both myself, I just thought it might be simpler - especially if you didn\u0027t want to maintain what I assume could be a complicated codebase for this one feature.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The_Blazer","CreatedById":169708,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-03T01:30:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre there any plans to support ship-to-ship or surface-to-ship missions ?
