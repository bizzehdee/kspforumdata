When I pressed the shortcut Win-Shift-S, the UI for snipping tool would appear and the cursor would change, but only for like a frame and then it would close again. Removing AnyRes would fix the issue, and it was happening as far back as 2.0.8.0. It sounds similar to the above alt-tabbing issue, with the interface showing for a split second then disappearing again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRemoving AnyRes would keep the resolution I\u0027d set, but not the window position, which got set to be x0 y3, and it doesn\u0027t seem to be a setting in KSP\u0027s settings file. It\u0027s a decent enough workaround though, at least allowing snipping tool, but there\u0027s a 3px y offset now, and no idea how to fix this otherwise.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: the 3px offset was due to windows force-centering the window, since my custom resolution was just full width but slightly short. I\u0027ve mostly worked around it now without AnyRes but setting my game resolution height to be just one pixel short, allowing the taskbar to work, while not being so short that windows moves the window down from y=0. I can\u0027t find any way to force the window to y=0 besides AnyRes.
