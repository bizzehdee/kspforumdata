I did some tinkering, and realised that each part has a TechRequired fieldthat is similar to many of the ETT node names. So for example, the MK1 pod is unlocked from the start with ETT instead of being in the Manned Space Exploration node. I checked the TechRequired for Mk1 Pod and it says \u0022start\u0022, when I changed it to \u0022spaceExploration\u0022 and did a clean save it appeared in the correct node.

That\u0027s what I\u0027ve been playing around with.  If you are on a laptop I would suggest picking one major parts mod and stick to QoL and UI enhancement type mods.  I really like a lot of different part mods.  For realistic models I would suggest FASA over BDB because BDB is soooo big for a small laptop.  I also like many of the Near Future mods or Interstellar mod. Soooo many great part mods out there."}]}
