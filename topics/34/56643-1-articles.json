Ship Manifest moves crew, Science and Resources around from part to part within your ship or station. It also manages docked vessel refueling, hatches, deployable Solar Panels, antennas and lights. Kinda like your Ship\u0027s bridge...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShip Manifest has a LOT of flexibility and a lot of Options. So much is available that is NOT seen in a default installation (Realism mode set ON by default) that you may be missing a lot of what SM has to offer. Please go to the Settings Window to see what options are available, and play with them. You will be surprised at the number of features that exist in this tool. I believe in choice, so you can configure SM to be pretty much exactly what you want. You want a \u0022realistic\u0022 experience? Check. You want to be a god and chafe at realism mode restrictions?

SM will remember these settings  between saves.\n- Fixed: Correct window scaling issue where other mods were affected by SM when chaning the KSP Scale.\n         This was caused by GUI.skin issues as SM was altering the built in skins.\n         SM now uses a custom skin constructed dynamically from the selected builtin scales, so only SM windows are affected.\n         Issue: Forum post https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/56643-112x-ship-manifest-crew-science-resources-v-6070-25-apr-23/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=4277051\n- Changed:  adjusted window heights for the Unity skin and the KSP skin.

This button appears if you disable the Settings icon\n        on the toolbar.  This setting is in the Config Tab.\n - Changed: Refactored remaining windows and tabs to clean up display code.  Moved a lot of redundant code into GUI utility methods.\n - Changed: Refactored all windows to cache all localization strings and object size values.\n            Object size values only recalculate if the screen resolution is changed.  Hopefully this helps a bit with performance.\n\nVersion 6.0.6.0 - Release 19 Jan 2022 - KSP 1.12.3\n--------------------------------------------------\n - New: Added ability to open Transfer window separately from Manifest window.

Some UI elements cannot be blocked, such as the Crew Portraits, and the Control panel at the top of the screen.\n   Click thru will still occur in these areas.\n - Fixed: incorrect localization string references in Science Tab.\u00A0 Lab Boost should now read Xmit Bonus.\u00A0 Some ToolTips were incorrect.\n\nVersion 6.0.3.1 - Release 27 Nov 2021 - KSP 1.12.2\n-------------------------------------------------\n - New: Added support for changing vessel types in Vessel Control panel\n - Changed:  Refactored Vessel Control Panel localization strings to improve performance.

So, I removed Crew Manifest as I thought I would simply be duplicating effort. I then offered to continue support of Crew Manifest, as Sarbian was also supporting many other important mods and I felt I could \u0022relieve some pressure\u0022 from him. He declined, stating that he would welcome a change of pace from all the math he has been doing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry for the long explanation, but I\u0027m just trying to be respectful to the modding community as I get my feet wet. However, the license on Crew Manifest is \u0022do what you want\u0022, so there is no \u0022reason\u0022 that I couldn\u0027t incorporate that functionality into Ship Manifest. Of course, this would then present users with a couple of choices for Crew Manifest, and I suppose that is not necessarily a bad thing, but I also do not wish to offend any modders. I will consider resurrecting my code and enhancing it with suggestions made in the Crew manifest thread if enough people express an interest.

Yes, with all the effort to reduce memory... 4 mb sounds. Hey, it was .wav and it was quick. I\u0027ll convert to .ogg on the next release. That should reduce it to respectable levels. However, if you are that concerned about 4 mb (and I understand that that \u0022could\u0022 make a difference), you can convert them your self and replace the files there. Note that KSP does NOT care about the extension, so you can replace the files with .ogg easily. You can also change the file names in the settings window, so you are not limited to what I provided. Hope that helps in the short term.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022THobson\u0022 data-cite=\u0022THobson\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis may be me but...
