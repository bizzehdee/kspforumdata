I needed Anvil to do more than what the last release allowed for so there you go. One new part I am particularly pleased with enables a player to manage the launch debris in orbit. I was doing a lot of testing for Anvil V and had some real trouble with the crud those tests left behind but with proper planning all that goes away. How exactly? You\u0027ll have to wait and see. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deltac","CreatedById":12493,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-29T00:42:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s stable because I used struts.
