What sort of combined part count are you looking at within 2.5km? While fusebox only processes the currently selected vessel, everything inside 2.5km gets calculated by KSP and can lead to lag. I changed things a few versions ago to limit the amount of times fusebox updates per frame, if lag is high it may well lead to that sort of discontinuity. I also noticed I wasn\u0027t capping the current to maximum if people were using more generation than needed, I put in\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003Eif (am_cur \u0026gt; am_max)\u003Cbr\u003E\tam_cur = am_max;\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhich should fix that one too.
