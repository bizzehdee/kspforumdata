See the [GitHub](https://github.com/DMagic1/KSP-EVA-Transfer) or Kerbal Stuff documentation for more details.\n\nIt allows for multiple resources to be transferred to and from two disconnected vessels. A Kerbal on EVA can grab the resource transfer pipe (which must be attached to the source vessel in the VAB/SPH, KIS support may come later) and carry it over to a second vessel within the maximum allowable distance. Once connected the EVA resource transfer window can be opened to control the transfer of resources between the two vessels. The connection does not dock the two vessels together, it is purely cosmetic, and all of the resource transfer logic is handled by the addon itself, not stock mechanisms.\n\nThe stock Fuel line part is used (and Ven\u0027s stock part revamp fuel line is supported if that is installed); if anyone feels like creating a replacement part I would be more than happy to include it here. The part has some fairly strict requirements about how its individual game objects are arranged, the stock fuel line can provide a good example if you import it into Blender/Unity.\n\nThere are a number of configuration options available in the included part config file; see the first post and the documentation for more details about these options and the currently known issues.\n\nLet me know if anyone discovers any other bugs or has questions about how any of the features work."},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-21T04:09:07Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I uploaded a new modlet here; EVA Transfer\n\u003E ...\n\u003E \n\u003E Let me know if anyone discovers any other bugs.\n\nI discovered a bug.
