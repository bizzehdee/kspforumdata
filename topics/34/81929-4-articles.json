Dang it I was looking forward to mods that can convert science experiments into resources. not to mention everyone made mods using extra models in anticipation of you having plans for the stock science lab. Oh well can\u0027t be helped if you didn\u0027t follow your own whims of fun and fancy we wouldn\u0027t have this mod at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eas for kerbal penalties I think the science transmission penalty would be the best another would be a union fee but only have it charged once when a kerbal goes from having snacks to having no snacks not every round the kerbal goes hungry\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI never actually tried to calculate how many snacks a RoveMate should get based on weight. I just felt 10 was about right, maybe I\u0027ll revisit it. Ovens are coming, I have no intent of abandoning them. I just have limited time at the moment and I think that would be better spent on penalties.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whyren","CreatedById":119798,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-31T16:23:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Veeltch\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Veeltch\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhy only 10 snacks in the RoveMate?
