In the logs there was \u0022No experiment with id PNSeismicProbeExperiment was found\u0022. Similarly, the Magnetometer was also not functioning as a science experiment, although it was functioning in detecting antimatter flux. Again, in the logs, \u0022No experiment with id magnetosphericExperiment was found\u0022 (not exactly precise wording, its from memory since KSP overwrites the logs). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was happening on a clean install of KSP 0.24.2 and Interstellar 0.11exp, with the full contents of Interstellar copied into the GameData folder as per instructions (not merging, not patching previous version, totally fresh install).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter some digging I figured out where Interstellar is defining the impactor and magnetometer experiments - WarpPlugin/Parts/Resources/ScienceDefs.cfg. I had a custom ScienceDefs.cfg (Community Science Reports or whatever it\u0027s called), so I restored the backup of Squad\u0027s original ScienceDefs.cfg, and the problem was still occurring. I manually copied the EXPERIMENT_DEFINITIONs for the seismic scan, magnetometer, and gas chromatograph into Squad\u0027s original ScienceDefs.cfg, loaded up the game, and the magnetometers and seismic scanners were working perfectly - the seismic impactor even had the custom \u0022Ship Name crashed into Planet\u0022 science report.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESo the problem is\u003C/strong\u003E that the ScienceDef.cfg in Interstellar\u0027s WarpPlugin that defines the new experiments (NOT the cfgs that define the new parts) is not being copied into the game\u0027s ScienceDefs.cfg, or is not being made available to the game the way that the original ScienceDefs.cfg is. Not sure if that\u0027s a ModuleManager limitation (it seems like MM doesn\u0027t handle ScienceDefs.cfg files, since the Community Science Reports mod doesn\u0027t use MM, it just replaces the file with its own) or if 0.24.2 broke however Interstellar is handling its ScienceDefs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe workaround is\u003C/strong\u003E to go to GameData/WarpPlugin/Parts/Resources/ScienceDefs.cfg, open it in a text editor and copy the entire thing (three EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION{ ... } blocks), then go to GameData/Squad/Resources/ScienceDefs.cfg and paste it on to the very end.

I was having this problem on a clean install of KSP 0.24.2 and Interstellar 0.11exp, with the Interstellar files fully copied over (no merge, no previous versions).
