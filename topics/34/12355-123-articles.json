What that means here is that 21.1 is essentially a *new* install, with all the parts installed fresh from the Spaceport. The 1.9.8 version is what shows in the Spaceport, so I installed that. No Mechjeb control. A bit if searching showed that the 1.9.8 doesn\u0027t work with 21.1, which makes me wonder *why* it\u0027s got star billing, and why the more modern version isn\u0027t being pointed to, but whatever...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI then followed the link to 2.0.9, but as you say, all that has is a few dll\u0027s and no modules. I\u0027ve been trying to get these things to work ever since, and getting more confused all the time. I\u0027ll see if these instructions help.
