The key questions I have are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) What happens if you load a single vessel with more than one MapSat dish (i.e. a multi-stage rocket with 4 probes that get separated from each other prior to scanning?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) When does the data files get read and is there an attempt to make sure the data file doesn\u0027t get red multiple times before whatever is used to store it is freed up.... namely if I have two MapSat satellites around Kerbin and switch between them, does the Kerbin data get loaded in twice? What about if I have a Kerbin satellite and a Eve satellite, does the Kerbin data get freed up when I switch to Eve? The reason I ask is my csv files for each of these places is extremely large (Kerbin is 750m, Minmus for whatever reason is 1.3Gb) if it is reading in each of these into memory in order to prevent writing duplicate data and not freeing up those spaces in memory when I switch away, that is a over 2Gb of memory hanging around just between those two planets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) How are the data structures being freed? I have not gotten into unity development but my understanding is it is C#/.NET Framework at its core. Memory management and garbage collection in .NET can be an extremely finicky/difficult thing... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Why is a \u0022completed\u0022 map of Minmus\u0027 CSV file bigger than my \u0022completed\u0022 map of Kerbin\u0027s? Why is either so large?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose are my thoughts, but as I said I have never gotten into Unity development myself. But based on the little testing I have been doing even aside from this it definitely seems to be MapSat related and affected by how long (or how many) maps you have been working with and not really related to other Mod inter-dependancies except that all the mods need to compete for the same memory state.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy next step is to wait till there is a problem again and try just quitting/re-entering (should have tried this first but you know, insane) to see if it is simply a memory allocation issue and quitting the program/coming back in fixes it. Also I wonder if scanning without creating the CSV files might work better, but personally those CSV files are awesome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEither way just hoping some extra info might help.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-02T03:31:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022artao\u0022 data-cite=\u0022artao\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell, I tried to launch my first 0.20.x mapsat last night.

MapSat is something of a memory sink but there is something more at work here than just a memory sink.\u003Cp\u003EI launched a bunch of probes with MechJeb, LazorSystem and Kethane (along with MapSat) and put them into various orbits (Moho, Eve, Gilly, Kerbin, Mun and Minmus).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the time I got them all into orbit, I switched to Gilly to scan and I was getting around 3.5\u002B GB memory utilization, \u0026lt;1 fps my machine was unresponsive and that was even before switching to 50x speed. This was with the resolution set to 200.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I quit and ran with an empty MapSat data directory (except Hilo and the textures) I could get reasonable scanning performance even with extremely high resolutions (\u0026gt;1000) at 50x speedup. The FPS never dipped. The KSP memory utilization stayed around 2.2gb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELoading in all my new maps (not from old version, all recreated under the new devel version) and artifacts.dat/etc... and going back in and scanning the same planet, I got \u0022reasonable\u0022 speeds... I was getting about 11fps on 50x speedup with anywhere from 200-1000 resolutions with the memory utilization staying around 2.25gb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENone of the other plugins changed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo my questions lead me down the path of memory leak or garbage collection problems in MapSat. The key questions I have are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) What happens if you load a single vessel with more than one MapSat dish (i.e. a multi-stage rocket with 4 probes that get separated from each other prior to scanning?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) When does the data files get read and is there an attempt to make sure the data file doesn\u0027t get red multiple times before whatever is used to store it is freed up.... namely if I have two MapSat satellites around Kerbin and switch between them, does the Kerbin data get loaded in twice? What about if I have a Kerbin satellite and a Eve satellite, does the Kerbin data get freed up when I switch to Eve? The reason I ask is my csv files for each of these places is extremely large (Kerbin is 750m, Minmus for whatever reason is 1.3Gb) if it is reading in each of these into memory in order to prevent writing duplicate data and not freeing up those spaces in memory when I switch away, that is a over 2Gb of memory hanging around just between those two planets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) How are the data structures being freed? I have not gotten into unity development but my understanding is it is C#/.NET Framework at its core. Memory management and garbage collection in .NET can be an extremely finicky/difficult thing... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Why is a \u0022completed\u0022 map of Minmus\u0027 CSV file bigger than my \u0022completed\u0022 map of Kerbin\u0027s? Why is either so large?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose are my thoughts, but as I said I have never gotten into Unity development myself. But based on the little testing I have been doing even aside from this it definitely seems to be MapSat related and affected by how long (or how many) maps you have been working with and not really related to other Mod inter-dependancies except that all the mods need to compete for the same memory state.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy next step is to wait till there is a problem again and try just quitting/re-entering (should have tried this first but you know, insane) to see if it is simply a memory allocation issue and quitting the program/coming back in fixes it. Also I wonder if scanning without creating the CSV files might work better, but personally those CSV files are awesome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEither way just hoping some extra info might help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just did a few tests, and I seem to be getting different results than you. I\u0027m not running Lazor System or Kethane though, just MechJeb, Map Sat, and a few other mods which I don\u0027t think cause much difference (Protractor, Kerbal Alarm Clock, etc). Here\u0027s what I found, answering some of your questions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELoading the game used a little over 1GB of memory. Opening the VAB and loading a ship with no map sat used a bit over 2GB. Launched it and memory went to a bit over 2.25GB. This is a very simple ship with only a few parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELoaded my biggest ship, a Jool system mapper with a main ship and four probes, each has a map sat dish (so 5 total). This is a fairly complex ship, three main stages, lots of struts, engines, etc. Loaded a bit slow, memory use jumped to 2.5GB and frame rate dropped, maybe to below 20 FPS (is there a way to show FPS in game?), but it wasn\u0027t drastic enough to cause me any problems, and once I had it launched and started dropping stages, frame rate improved. This is with map scanning off of course. Memory still at 2.5GB. Game runs fine, though CPU and GPU are both running a bit over 50\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 C and fans are on high, but this is no different than with any other 3D game running like FarCry3.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am also not saving CSV files, so I just turned on CSV saving and memory didn\u0027t change yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo try to answer your questions, already covered the first one, the second \u0026amp; third will have to be answered by the mod author, but as far the your last question, CSV files, as far as I know, will continue to grow in size the longer you leave the map sat active for that planet/moon. So, if you completed the visual map for Kerbin in an hour or so, but left the Minmus mapper running for several hours, it\u0027s quite possible to get a very large CSV file. I know in previous versions of map sat, I had a CSV file well over 2GB for Kerbin, as I let it run long after the visual map was completed. If you use the map gen program to render a larger map than is used in the game, you will have gaps from the data that was enough to complete the smaller map used in game. So, letting it run longer fills in the gaps that would complete a higher resolution render. If you\u0027re exporting the data to another mapping program, this might not apply, as those program may interpolate the missing data to give a complete map for a given resolution.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the TL: DR is, loading a map sat for me isn\u0027t much different than loading a normal ship, memory usage stays pretty much at 2.5GB no matter what I\u0027m doing in the game. This is all at a scan resolution of 1500 as well. It seems that the save raw data does create an FPS hit, when I have it turned on, the MET counter goes yellow no matter what planet I\u0027m mapping, but turning it off makes the FPS jump back to green and the game runs smoothly again. Memory stays the same though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Maddmatts","CreatedById":21071,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-02T18:25:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENow that I can zoom into the map I\u0027ve just noticed that some ocean trenches south of the KSC (-33, -81) show up as \u0022=D\u0022.
