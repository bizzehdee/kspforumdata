I used \u0027MODEL { scale = }\u0027 to work around that. Reverting o original size seems to be triggered by a reload of the craft in flight (revert to launch, switch to another vessel outside of physics range and back again).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The CM has what looks like bits of white texture floating out of it. It looks like they could be texture masks for rasterprop (not installed). Those bits have a position \u0027in 3D\u0027 near the CM and are slowly drifting about. See image:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cPNk24M.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/cPNk24M.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I found that there is a lot of movement between the CM and LEM docking ports, when docked and under thrust.

If I launch the engine, by itself, it will fire, but not move as it is attached to the redstone clamp. If I release the clamp, it flies for a couple of seconds and shuts off. If I release the clamp and fire the engine, nothing, no movement, no firing. Perhaps someone could explain what I am doing wrong here as it seems I just do not know how to use this system.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre you using RT ?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mikifox","CreatedById":99872,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-01T06:40:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MeCripp\u0022 data-cite=\u0022MeCripp\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAre you using RT ?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*facepalms* \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:blush:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENever even crossed my mind for some reason.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cdodders","CreatedById":85280,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-01T09:18:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI seem to get a lot of wobble and slight-off-trajectoryness when using the Nova rocket on the 1st stage, Saturn V 1st stage starts rolling when launched/used\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MisterBennock","CreatedById":111444,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-01T22:59:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi, I have a rather inconvenient issue.

Easy way to fix it is just re build the CM and LEM crafts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"}]}
