But the standard, continuous palette works fine. The delay for calculating the new min and max terrain height limits is essentially zero (it does it every time you zoom in/out, or re-center the map), and as you can see, it handles the clamped settings for ocean planets like Kerbin fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther features for version 14.4 include:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn ocean depth meter when splashed down:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/X7oBAH3.png\u0022 alt=\u0022X7oBAH3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA scanning threshold setting to complete the stock resource scan after a certain level of SCANsat resource scanning:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/GyGAKRK.png\u0022 alt=\u0022GyGAKRK.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few export-focused options:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2fHYxCG.png\u0022 alt=\u00222fHYxCG.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGrey-scale uses a true black-to-white color scale instead of the standard black-and-white option (which uses several discrete shades of grey to construct the map), the text box allows for manually setting the big map width, and there is an option to export a .csv data file. This file writes out: pixel row, column, latitude, longitude, terrain height. Writing out such a file for a really big map is super-slow, but it runs nicely in a separate thread, so there is no noticeable impact (other than not being able to spam the export button, which is probably a bad idea anyway).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere we go, the discrete color scheme seems to be working OK, too:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/oehdH2k.png\u0022 alt=\u0022oehdH2k.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-14T04:41:52Z\u0022 title=\u002211/14/2015 04:41  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by DMagic\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Prime flux","CreatedById":57347,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-14T09:53:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DMagic\u0022 data-cite=\u0022DMagic\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAmazing stuff\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWow!, Thanks.

When I\u0026#39;m flying my probe with the M700 Survey Scanner I can activate the overlay and toggle back-and-forth between Ore and MetalOre. The overlay and avg amount change accordingly. So it certainly knows what MetalOre is, where it is located on the planet, and the avg amounts of it there are.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt\u0026#39;s just on the Big Map that the resources dropdown only shows Ore. I don\u0026#39;t have a Narrow Band Scanner up yet so maybe you need that first before the Big Map offers a MetalOre option?
