If you follow those instructions for KAC it will not have texture issues as seen here. If you didnt follow those instructions before 2.7.0.0 it would still have worked.

There was one posted a long time ago, but that was before the changes to the GameData folder and the loading changes, and after that we ended up with (I think) two zip structures, but no \u0022approved\u0022 structure from an official post.

Simply moving the files without editing and/or recompiling might not work (it will work if and only if the mod contains no such path references in any of its config files or code -- this used to be common but is becoming less so as mod authors become more conscious of memory issues and write mods that reuse textures and other resources).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-23T00:46:23Z\u0022 title=\u002212/23/2013 12:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 23, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Gaius\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TriggerAu","CreatedById":57838,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-23T01:16:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere will always be mistaken installs, I\u0027m not discounting that, but the variations in zip structure do make it harder for people to install every mod correctly.
