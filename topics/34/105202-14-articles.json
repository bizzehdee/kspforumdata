Also it\u0027s fairly common for people to have multiple version of MM in their gamedata since so many mods use it and don\u0027t update it when MM does. I\u0027ve seen people with close to 10 mm versions in one folder lol. It can cause problems too. \n\nIf people are only using USI mods then yes it can cause an issue. But chances are most people will end up with MM anyways once most mods are updated for 1.0. \n\nA notice somewhere would be great, but anything that saves Roverdude from doing things other than updating his own work ends up better in the long run since he can focus on his own mods.\n\ni didn\u0027t notice at first either, until I watched loading screen on startup and didn\u0027t see the message. It was noted in the first release of 1.0. Though I don\u0027t think it\u0027s seen on the newer ones. (Well nvm that. It was noted in mks release.

And I\u0027m pretty sure he removed mm from every bundle. it saves him time most likely. Because if he does bundle, then need to constantly follow the MM people and see every time they update it, then update all of his mod packages and re upload them all to github and anywhere else he hosts his mods for something that is really a small change. \n\nIt\u0027s much easier for him if he puts a dependency notice on the post somewhere an has the player download and worry about MM themselves.
