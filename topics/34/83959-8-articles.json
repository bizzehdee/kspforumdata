Spaceplanes and I have never gotten along. Mk2 parts are a waste of my texture cache and that\u0027s why I asked earlier about making sure things were easy to remove. To me, that\u0027s part of the allure of MRS - the focus helps it target its audience, IMO.

The 1.25m LFO engines aren\u0027t really that useful once you start building larger vehicles, since the \u0022thrust to diameter\u0022 ratio isn\u0027t very good at that scale. I\u0027d love to fill a gap here, but I\u0027m hesitant since it messes with the stock balance. I could see doing something like that, by placing it late in the tech tree though. As in, now you\u0027re building heavy lifters, so here\u0027s a new \u003Cem\u003Eadvanced\u003C/em\u003E 1.25m engine with some power behind it.

I think it would be a great idea for you to make one that looks essentially the same as your radial battery, with a matching weight. Then it would look nice an symmetrical, you wouldn\u0027t need to worry about your vessel being off balance, or the probe core running out of juice before you have time to get back to it (should you use it for a spent stage). This could also be useful for small probes as well, say ones that need to be short enough to fit in a short space plane cargo bay.
