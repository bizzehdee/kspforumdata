Cause this (normally) has nothing to do with stationscience (or any mod that doesn\u0027t alter/edit any controls). Usually wrong orientation happens when you flipped part(s) of the ship in VAB that were (part of) a root node, mostly cause halfway through you wanted something to be flipped if it looks better, etc, you can see if this happens when you are on the launchpad and the navball isn\u0027t blue but brown, or when your North-line isn\u0027t pointing at the usual direction. \u003Cp\u003EEasiest solution is to select a docking node or any other part (during or pre-flight) that has some \u0027control\u0027 functionality (pods, docking nodes, etc.), right click the part that is facing the right way and select \u0027control from here\u0027 this will notify the ship which way is forward and the controls should work the right way.
