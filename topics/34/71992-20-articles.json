I\u0027d need to make yet another updated skin for the Bonny though, the current skin is pretty basic and needs updating to be more in line with Porkjet\u0027s parts. I have actually found the model for it now, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@Spork of Doom,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, the file paths in the cfg need updating since things got moved from their old folders into the main Squad/Parts folders. You\u0027ll need to open the cfg and change the MODEL{} section to this\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003EMODEL\u003Cbr\u003E{\u003Cbr\u003E\tmodel = SXMk2/Parts/RotatingMk2Ring/model\u003Cbr\u003E\ttexture = fueltTanks_cm , Squad/Parts/FuelTank/Size3MediumTank/fueltTanks_cm\u003Cbr\u003E\ttexture = mk2CrewCabin , Squad/Parts/Utility/mk2CrewCabin/mk2CrewCabin\u003Cbr\u003E\ttexture = mk2CrewCabin_LUM , Squad/Parts/Utility/mk2CrewCabin/mk2CrewCabin_LUM\u003Cbr\u003E}\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou may want to add this as well for some extra utility\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003EMODULE\u003Cbr\u003E{\u003Cbr\u003E\tname = ModuleScienceContainer\u003Cbr\u003E\treviewActionName = Review Stored Data\u003Cbr\u003E\tstoreActionName = Store Experiments\u003Cbr\u003E\tevaOnlyStorage = True\u003Cbr\u003E\tstorageRange = 4.0\u003Cbr\u003E}\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll update the download for the pack at some point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@CrisK,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks.

About the edge-split, I did look the model up the other week, and it doesn\u0027t look so bad. I think I might have fixed that bit of it, but not finished the updates to the newer style.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@ThatOneBritishGuy,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks. Don\u0027t have that much time for dev work or playing, but it\u0027s good to at least have \u003Cem\u003Esome \u003C/em\u003Etime (a 50-70hr week is so much more relaxing than the 90hrs I was working before).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@ Yemo,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYep, I\u0027ll get it uploaded at some point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@minepagan,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, it\u0027s a good shout. Still plenty of work to be done fixing things before I start making too many new things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, I may have made one new part\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mVHxHsC.png\u0022 alt=\u0022mVHxHsC.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone know if Firespitter can handle contra-rotating props?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@boostedM,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESounds like the node_stack bit needs fixing. You could either have a look at it in the cfg (and compare it to a squad part) or there\u0027s some option in the cfg to disable the whole direction dependent stacking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe airbags, I suspect it\u0027s linked to the landing gear module (I have similar issues with some of the parts in LLL).
