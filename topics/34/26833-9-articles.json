I may not understand the question tho...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou are right, it would take a plugin, and Connected LivingSpaces is working out space recognition vessel wide, to determine which spaces are \u0022connected\u0022, meaning a Kerbal \u0022could\u0022 travel to these spaces internally, without EVA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecodepoet is actually discussing hatches and opening and closing. so the framework is being built to do a lot of crew stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E... Thanks! And for the time being I don\u0027t think it is core to what I\u0027m trying to achieve, meaning that I want kerbals bouncing around ship/station interiors trying to get from place to place. However if you have an alternative to the sfr code for displaying kerbals while in IVA I would gladly try it out.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI see where you are going. Actual interior views that can be \u0022walked\u0022 in? Very cool, and that is not the direction codepoet\u0027s api is going. he is setting up a means to determine where kerbal can move internally. Still helpful, but not core to what you are doing for sure.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alskari","CreatedById":57638,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-04T04:28:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Papa_Joe\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Papa_Joe\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ecodepoet is actually discussing hatches and opening and closing. so the framework is being built to do a lot of crew stuff.\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe sfr code has some functionality as far as hatches opening and closing already.
