The MechJeb integration with choosing a landing site via the ScanSat map is no longer an option. I hadn\u0027t noticed it since I haven\u0027t had to do any real precision landings until tonight but when I went in to try and land a few meters off of a Mun base the MechJeb target choice integration was no longer there. And I don\u0027t mean working - I mean, the choice to have MechJeb integration wasn\u0027t even appearing in the setup options. I tried re-installing ScanSat and MechJeb both but to no avail. There\u0027s nothing showing up anywhere in any logs nor do I have an Exception Detector messages at all. I was wondering if this is a known issue with the new version of MechJeb that just released a couple day ago or if I\u0027ve just somehow mucked up my setup along the way.
