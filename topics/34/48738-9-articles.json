I had to eject the head of the winch from the vehicle control it self.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I had to send Jeb over to pick it up. Grab is now changed to \u0022Y\u0022 but still says \u0022G\u0022 in the context menu. I grabbed it and then refueled the ship for Jeb\u0027s return no problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen there was no way to retract the winch and the GUI only said close and rename.

Whenever I\u0027m building some sort of \u0022solar power module\u0022 for my base ( which i connect with pipes) I end up wondering myself why the power transfer from the solar panels to the other parts of the network doesn\u0027t work. The energy flow inside the network itself is fine, don\u0027t get me wrong but whenever I\u0027m attaching a solar array while EVA it doesn\u0027t work. I can retract and extend the panels from my control module (and usually this means they are connected) and I\u0027m also getting the feedback from the solar panels that the solar panels indeed produce energy and nothing is in their way.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Secret Squirrel","CreatedById":69453,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-03T03:50:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Olaf\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Olaf\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFirst of all thank you for this great mod.
