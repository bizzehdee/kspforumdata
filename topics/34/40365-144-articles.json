You don\u0027t get DepletedFuels anymore until you do some fuel reprocessing (and you must have a container to store the DepletedFuels in). Thus the resource tanks have slots for UF4 and ThF4 plus DepletedFuels, you take new fuel out of these tanks and slowly fill them up with DepletedFuels. The reactors then use one type or another of nuclear fuel and turn that into Actinides.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-25T04:27:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Fractal_UK\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Fractal_UK\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EJust to check but do you have thorium tanks on there? You cannot mine thorium directly into a reactor, you have to put it into a fuel tank first. You can only refuel the reactor itself via the EVA option.\u003Cp\u003EYes, it\u0027s a nice idea in theory and I have actually discussed this issue with Majiir but both of us are rather set against acquiring cross-plugin dependence. Interstellar requiring a Kethane install is out of the question and the reverse is likewise true. The only option that remains would therefore be a third plugin that could be distributed with any compatible plugins to provide the interface for the mods wanting to make use of it but this has issues that have been discussed recently, e.g. in the ModuleManger thread. Particularly, if a user downloads one plugin with an older version of this resource handler, a newer version might get overwritten and cause bugs that are quite opaque to the user.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKethane has a very good API for third parties and I know that Majiir is helpful to people who want to make use of it. I\u0027m likewise happy to help anyone who wants to make use of Interstellar\u0027s resource system, which I have tried to make very easy to use and to mod but I obviously have no feedback about this aspect yet. I would however recommend these features mainly to modmakers who are interested in making resources a supplemental part of their mod. Obviously this is definitely not the case of Kethane and while it\u0027s probably true of Interstellar as of 0.8, it will become less so over time as many of my plans for expansion revolve around use of the resource system - particularly using the resource system for new science experiments, maybe even some science experiments that require a bit of thought from the operator, as well as things like Helium-3 mining from regolith and potentially tracking abundances of more common materials. Of particular interest amongst these is obviously Aluminium, which already has a place in the mod but is currently a binary thing that is either present or not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know it\u0027s nice for players to have common frameworks so that everything appears to be unified and tidy but it\u0027s unclear whether such a mechanism will become viable by any means at this stage. Additionally, the two resource systems are already quite different and I guess it depends on the direction of both Interstellar and Kethane as to whether they evolve to be more or less similar in the future - I actually hope for the second because two systems that do more or less the same thing are far less valuable to the community than two systems that have unique strengths.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe situation will change when/if Devs will add mapping and resource scanning system(s?) into the game.

For instance, I got the following number for the thermal turbojets in clamped-burn tests on the KSC runway with solid-core reactors and basic thermal turbojets:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.25 meter Reactor \u002B Thermal Turbojet ISP = 78.0 Maximum Thrust = 19.1 kN\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.5 meter Reactor \u002B Thermal Turbojet ISP = 78.0 Maximum Thrust = 59.7 kN\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the 1.25 meter combination, at least (the workhorse of my plane designs, based on the much better TWR I observed on the runway), the thrust roughly doubled at high altitude flight to a maximum of around 38 kN.

This represents a \u003Cstrong\u003E26% reduction in thrust\u003C/strong\u003E- which I found very disturbing and annoying for a part that was already hard to use because of its low TWR, and after I had already gone through all the effort of sending up a couple copies of a plane utilizing the 1.25 meter Thermal Turbojets to Duna on the side of a rocket- for a challenge no less (the Flying Duna Challenge).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really don\u0027t think the thrust values should have necessarily been reduced. I can see maybe it is to give more incentive to use the new fusion reactors- but the fusion reactors are overpowered if you ask me, and unrealistically so (it\u0027s completely unrealistic to expect fusion power technology to develop to those kinds of efficiencies anytime in the reasonable future- the technology of controlled fusion has improved linearly, \u003Cstrong\u003Enot\u003C/strong\u003E exponentially- and will not yield those kinds of returns in net of power consumed to maintain the reaction at those kind of reactor weights for a LONG, LONG time- probably no for at least 70-100 years or more...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hremsfeld","CreatedById":23422,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-25T17:49:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Northstar1989\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Northstar1989\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EChangelog questions and observations\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe engines produce lower thrust at lower altitudes, much like real-life rocket engines.

For instance, I got the following number for the thermal turbojets in clamped-burn tests on the KSC runway with solid-core reactors and basic thermal turbojets:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.25 meter Reactor \u002B Thermal Turbojet ISP = 78.0 Maximum Thrust = 19.1 kN\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.5 meter Reactor \u002B Thermal Turbojet ISP = 78.0 Maximum Thrust = 59.7 kN\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre you using the same vehicle for testing purposes? The only thing that has changed and could affect the results slightly are some tweaks to the atmospheric limit code, which prevents flameouts. The nuclear reactors are fairly hampered by atmosphere, their specific impulse using atmospheric propellant is very low - the advantage of that is it gives you more thrust, the downside is it makes flameouts occur quicker than is ideal. Anyway, on the launch pad, my testing shows 16.3kN from a clamped thermal turbojet and a basic uranium MSR and an 85.5% atmospheric limit - that means with more airflow I could get up to 19.1kN, exactly the same value as you recorded in the previous version.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis change was neccessary in order to prevent twin-jet engined aircraft from yawing unpleasantly due to the two engines producing different thrusts, something that often happens when intake propellant is available but in short supply (but before a flameout).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, intakes are quite velocity dependent and stationary on the launchpad is not their ideal operating regime. Under actual flight conditions, you shouldn\u0027t see such a big difference between this version and the last - once you get off the ground, you\u0027ll start to see the benefits of increased specific impulse due to more ideal atmospheric conditions as well as higher intake values due to aircraft velocity. You can also add more intakes to your plane in order to make sure you get access to all the atmospheric propellant you need and try and push that atmospheric limit close to 100%.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, switching over to thorium fuel can be an asset for an aircraft you plan to make regular use of. By doing so, you will see a 27% increase in thrust as well as an 8% increase in specific impulse. By doing both this and adding a couple more intakes, you should actually see a big improvement in un-upgraded nuclear flight compared to version 0.7.4.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the fusion reactors - it\u0027s hard to say whether they are overpowered yet because they are a new addition. That said, the unupgraded fusion reactor is available on the same tech as the upgraded fission reactors and they are a moderate improvement - 175MW thermal power compared to 120MW but the fusion reactor requires an ongoing 7MW of electrical power to continue operation, which can cut off somewhere between 14MW and 45MW from the thermal power depending on operating temperature conditions and whether you have upgraded generators. Unupgraded, they therefore offer a very modest increase in power output compared to the upgraded fission reactors at the expensive of drastically increased fuel consumption. A fusion reactor burns through it\u0027s fuel way more rapidly than the fission reactors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce upgraded, they are a lot better but are by that point competing with the first generation of antimatter reactors, which give you a whole new set of capabilities again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I hope some of that rundown helps you get your aircraft working smoothly again.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WAS","CreatedById":42674,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-25T18:07:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWeird issue I\u0027m having with latest build 0.8 on 0.22 of KSP.
