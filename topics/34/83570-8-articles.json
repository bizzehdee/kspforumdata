My ships seemed roughly as ludicrously massive as they ought to be, but that doesn\u0027t mean the masses were correct after reloading. In real-time, it does the same thing it does for tank-swapping parts: if you put the tank in or swap the mesh, THEN scale, the scaled values will appear correct. If you scale, THEN swap, it will revert to whatever the non-scaled mass or tank capacity is for whatever you just switched to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT AGAIN: This particular problem is not related to TweakScale; removed it and nothing changed.
