I\u0027m experiencing the classic \u0022wobbling/disassebling/exploding rocket problem on the launchpad\u0022 with bigger rockets (not that big actually, let\u0027s say a Moon launcher).\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s hard to help without seeing screenshots, but one thing I would suggest is to make sure that you are constructing your interstages correctly. Correctly constructed interstage should have:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Empty space between the engine(s) and the procuderal interstage base\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.

If one of your rocket\u0027s stages has a *final* TWR of significantly more than 5, then the higher it goes, the more unstable it will be towards the end of this stage\u0027s burn. At a TWR of 7 to 8 it\u0027s still somewhat manageable, but if you get to 10 or more, it becomes a nightmare rodeo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you do in fact construct your interstages correctly and have reasonable TWRs, and it still wobbles too much, then it is possible that your payload is unstable within the fairing.

In other words, you are on your own. The only supported way to use 64-bit KSP is the linux version, which unlike its windows equivalent is reasonably stable and does not implode when you sneeze at it. If you are unwilling to install linux, use 32-bit KSP (yes, it does run on 64-bit windows, no problems there) or deal with the problems that arise from your decisions by yourself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ale260382\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ale260382\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m a newbie modder and i\u0027d also like to understand how exactly part scaling works.
