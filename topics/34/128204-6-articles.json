We can simply increase the pressure with which a resource (liquid fuel, oxidizer, solid fuel, mono propellant, etc) is stored in a tank and thus increase the maximum amount the tank can hold. On the backend-side it\u0027s the same way battery-improvements are working right now. This won\u0027t get too overpowered either, because more fuel in a tank will also have more weight. I will put this in the next release.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhat do you think, should we allow upgrading the storage capacity for all resources, even modded ones like ore, uranium, life support, spaceship parts, etc?

Compress all resource types, according to gradients predetermined to approximately model \u0022compressibility\u0022 of a substance; 2.) Compress a single resource type, affording for greater maximum achievable compressibility of that specific substance given that structural modifications to the tank in question can all be oriented around reinforcing a specific inner pressure vessel exclusively instead of \u0022all of them equally\u0022; 3.) No compression changes, but allow a multi-resource container to be internally reconfigured to accommodate a different loadout of various substances; 4.) Interact with DangIt or other part failure mods -- an upgrade tier can offer an either-or choice as between increasing compression, thereby \u003Cem\u003Eincreasing\u003C/em\u003E failure / leak severity and occurrence; or instead, a player can invest to reduce failure likelihood /\u00A0reduce failure severity /\u00A0reduce potential repair burden (with no increase in compressed resource capacity as a result of this upgrade purchase.)\u00A0 This means that future upgrade choices and upgrade effectiveness are profoundly influenced by previous upgrade purchases -- do I keep compressing the material further, subjecting the tank material to greater strains and resulting in reduced structural tolerances, or do I invest in strengthening the tank hull design to increase impact resistance for equipment being sent to hazardous environments such as a land-base on Eve or a Tylo landing?\u00A0 If I have a very important and profitable orbital station (profitable in terms of science gain, an RT command outpost, or a fuel depot) located in a spot where dV margins are very tight (Eeloo, Moho, Eve, or Kopernicus-modded systems such as RO / RSS) where it\u0027s difficult to ensure that incoming craft will have the fuel needed to reduce their closing velocities in time, so upgrading the impact-tolerances of the parts of this station would make the station more resistance to docking-collisions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExamples of #3, above, all starting with Tier-0 KRnD initial part upgrades with a single Stock Big Orange

maximum wetmass as a result, or possibly even \u003Cem\u003Eslightly increasing\u003C/em\u003E overall internal volume because of the space freed up by removing the internal bulkhead separating the twin internal compartments, with\u00A0a proportionally-slight decrease in drymass.\u00A0\u00A0Subsequent upgrades can then compress this mono-tank further, though at a slightly reduced curve of per-upgrade gain opportunities, owing to the fact that the tank has been slightly weakened by the removal of an internal bulkhead and therefore continuing to overpressurize the single larger containment vessel with subsequent upgrades is proportionally less feasible, from a safety and reliability standpoint, than if you were to instead leave the SBOT as a stock-LFO tank and simply pressurize the two compartments equally with each upgrade.\u00A0 For this option to convert to mono-tank, this must only be cost-effective as a first-tier upgrade purchase.\u00A0 The only way to reliably remove the internal bulkhead separator as between the internal compartments after first overpressurizing\u00A0the twin-compartments is to bleed off the now-overpressurized contents and undo the pressure and compression tolerances back to stock (with no refund in original purchase price, perhaps even a nominal purchase price for the labor cost of the undo) before removing the internal bulkhead.\u00A0 Then subsequent purchases can be purchased as normal, but continuing the exponential cost increases -- in other words, paying to undo the first compression upgrade still counts as the cost-equivalent of a second upgrade, and the now-first compression upgrade of the mono-tank still counts as the cost-equivalent of a third upgrade, etc.\u00A0 Always: Slight (minor but noticeable for expert craft designers) remodel of CoM as between wet and dry states.\u00A0 First-upgrade-incentive:\u00A0Negligible effect on part reliability.\u00A0 Non-first-upgrade-penalty: Slight, non-negligible

SolidWaste (life support) or stock-Ore, etc.\u00A0 I speculate that for this to work, some hand-modeling would be useful to analogize resource default-densities of other substances to figure wetmass / drymass values appropriately, both after initial conversion and after each subsequent compression upgrade.\u00A0 Similar to 3A, this can be performed at any time, even repeatedly between several resource type changeovers, but each resource-type change resets the compression / capacity values to a sort of \u0022default.\u0022\u00A0 Always: Slight-to-moderate remodel of wet / dry CoM positions depending on circumstances of the selected changes.\u00A0 First-upgrade-incentive: Negligible-to-slight effect on part reliability, depending on above.\u00A0 Non-first-upgrade-penalty: An either-or choice at time of upgrade, between \u0022moderate effect on part reliability with highly efficient use of reconfigured overall internal volume\u0022 (maximum capacity-benefits combined across all involved resource types)\u00A0and \u0022negligible effect on part reliability and reduced efficiency in the use of overall internal volume\u0022 (special attention to detail and safety will mean that safety valves and sensor wiring will take up pockets of space that cannot also be occupied by tank contents.)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n3C -- Same as 3A, but \u003Cem\u003Eadd\u003C/em\u003E a

the changes made.\u00A0 Always: Moderate to significant remodel of wet / dry CoM positions, depending on resource changes involved, especially when adding a fourth resource compartment.\u00A0 First-incentive: Slight-to-moderate effect on part reliability.\u00A0 Non-first-penalty: Choice between \u0022significant effect on reliability with moderately efficient use of internal volume,\u0022 and \u0022slight effect on part reliability and reduced space efficiency.\u0022\u00A0 Note: perhaps one option is to \u0022add a compartment\u0022 for battery power (embed a battery system into the tank hull) allowing for simpler but heavier and lower-fuel-capacity self-contained structures with batteries built right into the fuel tanks.\u00A0 I imagine\u00A0peculiar tradeoff considerations for DangIt purposes, especially for un-kerballed missions.\u00A0 Battery capacity can never be \u0022compressed,\u0022 but can be \u0022expanded\u0022 once and only once at the cost of significant drymass increase, significant loss of resource storage volume available for other compartments (maybe a user-selected decision as to which compartment is cut into?) and significant reliability decrease.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n3D -- Maybe tanks have \u0022flow values,\u0022 representing their valve routing systems.\u00A0 Overpressurizing a compressed tank would initially result in slightly faster fuel outflow, but as a tank drains, flow rates level off.\u00A0 An upgrade option could be to expand the flow control valves in a tank to allow for faster or slower resource flow rates.\u00A0 The inverse would also be true -- on an overpressurized tank, transferring resources INTO a tank above stock-capacity levels results in a REDUCTION of the resource transfer rate.\u00A0 With a flow-increased capacity-increased tank, you can actually deliver fuel to engines faster, resulting in useful over-thrust scenarios for limited periods -- another DangIt tie-in opportunity as to engines.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAll examples above: DangIt failures can result in internal leaks as well as external leaks, which can\u00A0create sudden heat buildup leading to explosion hazards unless a tank is vented or drained immediately depending on the substance combinations involved (and heat buildup in the resources in v1.1 means that temperature is transferred when those resources are transferred).\u00A0 An internal or an external leak can also mean a sudden change in CoM position within the tank, which can make attitude control impossible without a lot of attitude control to compensate, engine thrust vectoring, and thrust and throttle limiting.\u00A0 Untreated leaks can even result on CoM imbalance symptoms that get worse as a leak increases in severity (venting escape of resources into the vacuum of space can cause material erosion in the pressure vessel of the tank, resulting in a pinhole leak that gets bigger and bigger as materials continue venting -- fuel escapes more and more rapidly, begins applying noticeable asymmetrical thrust as an uncontrolled RCS nozzle that can\u0027t be turned off, and as the hole progressively\u00A0widens the thrust-vector changes and gets worse because the direction of the escaping jet of leaking fuel is changing according to the size and shape and placement of the hole... until the tank is drained or offloaded, and then the leak stops applying thrust and stops getting wider.\u00A0 Some very severe leaks might not be repairable at all in the field, and moderately severe leaks might only be field-repairable with the tank drained first.\u00A0 This would factor into designs for orbital stations and ground bases, as a prudent thing to do is to include always-empty tanks on hand so that a tank with a sudden leak can always be drained in an emergency without the resource being lost to the environment (remember, v1.1 allows us to consider designs with vastly higher partcounts, this is one of the earliest ways we can take advantage of that in mod design.)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI don\u0027t have much programming experience (I can learn, I did some stuff with BASIC and VBASIC in high school, so I

You want to use old Steal from the early 1900s that contained high imperfections and brittleness instead of modern steal which is far higher quality and less prone to breakage in order to intentionally made a less reliable ship, bridge, building, etc. This is what \u0022downgrading\u0022 parts that have had R\u0026amp;D done to them actually means. As stated, no one in their right mind would use such. All improvements are exactly like this. In no situation is a part that has not been upgraded via KR\u0026amp;D ever better suited to any situation.

If a particular ship is overthrusted you adjust the max thrust, a stock stetting, as with any engine. If your tank holds too much fuel for your particular mission, same thing you adjust the capacity. As stated, there is never a situation when a non upgraded part would be desired. This would be akin to re-locking tech tree nodes. If you progress beyond the parts it unlocked you just don\u0027t use them, but you don\u0027t revert to the prior technological state.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rasta013","CreatedById":140002,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-22T03:23:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell at least you caught the joke...\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d disagree that your analogy is any better than mine since you\u0027re trying to compare early 20th century tech to early 21st century tech. \u00A0I was more referring to an idea similar to\u00A0differences between using cold roll vs. hot roll steel. \u00A0Regardless, neither of our analogies is very good in relation to the game or the current state of the mod\u00A0anyway...
