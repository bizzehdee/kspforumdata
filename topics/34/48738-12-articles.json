I remember with one of the earlier versions of KAS (when you had the hook storage containers) you were able to just plug the hook in and take it away as you pleased even while the winch was retracted and locked. Shouldn\u0027t there be a plug grabbed option while the winch is retracted so things don\u0027t wobble about while you try to stick that hook on there?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/BwtNTFR.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022BwtNTFR.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EuSouONumero345","CreatedById":40840,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-20T01:45:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWith this mod I can \u0022connect\u0022 two kerbals with a tether?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike in the movie Gravity, then with the ECLSS mod I could save some RCS fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPs:AWESOME MOD!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Greys","CreatedById":57109,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-20T01:48:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Enope, I tried that but it glitches out, one of the kerbals is rendered brain dead and the other one bugs out a lot.
