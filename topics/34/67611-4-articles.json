Steam, as you say, is perishable due to heat loss and AFAIK in all real life applications it moves through pipes under its own pressure. This latter would make fuel lines equalize pressure between tanks instead of allowing flow from a the tank with the lower pressure (steam leaving via its own engine plus the fuel line) into the tank with the higher pressure (only its own engine). So IMHO steam should indeed act like mono, not LFO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe monoprop rocket has not caused issues in my testing, however i did have kerbal joint reinforcement in my test install.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry with stock joints.

This ship had a steam plant that ran, after going through the superheater, at 950^F and 1200psi, AFAIK the highest pressure ever put afloat as standard equipment. From about 1900 to the end of true steamships, naval steam plants doubled in pressure every 10-20 years because higher pressure, which goes with higher temperature, makes for more efficiency. For instance, the standard pressure of top-line warships in WW2 was 600psi. But 1200psi was a bridge too far; conventional materials like stainless steel couldn\u0027t handle it so it was always springing man-killing leaks (as in lopping off body parts), so today\u0027s steam plants (now only found in nuke ships and any type of electrical power plant) have MOSTLY reverted to the reliable 600psi or thereabouts. Back in Victorian times, steam pressures struggled and usually failed to reach 100psi. Ironclads of the time, the most high-tech things then in existence, mostly ran in the 2 digits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile a pinhole leak in a 1200psi steam line can cut somebody in half and make its immediate surroundings untenable, nobody else on this 4400-ton DDG would notice until the engine room escape scuttles opened and the steam vented up on deck as the half-boiled snipes struggled out. The ship wouldn\u0027t even shake, let alone move, due to this thrust. And a pinhole creates the highest exhaust velocity and thus the most thrust. So I\u0027m really not thinking steam is very viable heavy lift engine, even with mid-20th Century 1200psi, and certainly not with the much lower pressures available in Victorian times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, realism is 1 thing, KSP is another, and steampunk is something else. So feel free to disregard all the above. But if it was me doing this, I\u0027d make whale oil the main lift engine (so it would need several sizes like stock LFO engines) and use steam for transfer stages and RCS. As a transfer stage, it would be analogous to an LV-N, as in low TWR but economical. Due to an inability to store steam at high pressure, you\u0027d have to have the boiler, which is where the weight comes from.
