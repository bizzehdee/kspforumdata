That will likely take a bit of time - the converters are a bit more detailed because you can get away with only having a few. I try to keep resource containers as conservative as possible, around 1000 - 2000 tris each. The water tank has 996 at the moment, hydrogen 1696, oxygen 1550, etc. The generators go up to 3000\u002B. KSP underutilizes polygons (and relies on a \u0022grab everything at once on startup\u0022 asset loader that bloats RAM) and i feel that expressing detail with actual mesh is more performance efficient than dumping a ton of memory-hungry normal maps on there.
