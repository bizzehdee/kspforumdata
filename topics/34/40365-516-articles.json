Of course, at 5t each, that\u0027s a full 120 tons of the ship dedicated purely to radiators, so it\u0027s not going to be easy to launch, but it\u0027s certainly possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have that much power in your microwave network, microwave thermal rockets start putting out enough thrust to easily rip the craft apart if it doesn\u0027t have a bunch of struts holding everything together.

Solves the \u0022too much thrust\u0022 problem quite nicely, and it takes a lot less fuel to do it as well. From ground level, the large plasma thruster at full power can put 150-175t in orbit for around 1500 liquid fuel. The TWR at that kind of payload weight isn\u0027t great, but the efficiency of plasma thrusters more than offsets the higher gravity losses you get with lower TWR launchers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Coga19000\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Coga19000\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWait, I just got a crazy press for a no fuel spacecraft.
