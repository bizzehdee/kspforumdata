Or any of the nuclear engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe nuclear turbojet provides free propulsion with no fuel required, which is a pretty major benefit not available from any other component in the game (other than rover wheels). I think Porkjet did a good job of giving it compensating disadvantages (mainly, being incredibly heavy, barely able to lift its own weight on Kerbin when thrusting straight up). Turning it into a multi-purpose engine would seem overpowered to me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor one thing, different engines are designed to run well at different speeds. As an air-breather, the Rapier works well at very high speeds, like Mach 3; it\u0027s a poor choice for cruising around at low speeds. The nuclear turbojet is designed as a low-speed jet engine, like the Wheelsey (again, I think a good choice on Porkjet\u0027s part).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing I find unfortunately limiting about the design is the lack of a bottom attachment node. It means that if I want to send one to another planet, I pretty much have to have two of them, unless I want to build a really awkward ungainly ship. Of course, the same limitation applies to the other jet engines, but it\u0027s not such a big deal there because they mass a lot less and having 2 of them isn\u0027t such a big deal. The nuclear turbojet is so massive that requiring 2 of them really limits the types of ships one can build. Would love to see a bottom attachment node.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RuBisCO","CreatedById":59540,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-01T20:57:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne of hte kinds of nuclear engines I would like to see is a rotory nuclear engine, that is with a spinning core held together with centrifugal force not mechanical strength.
