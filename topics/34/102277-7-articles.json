I haven\u0027t tested how PR and RT work together currently, however, so I don\u0027t know (yet) how they interact.

RT completely disables stock SAS/Autopilot, to the point that if you want to turn on the stock SAS/Autopilot you have to manually delete your current RT command. For example \u0022point to node\u0022, \u0022point to retrograde\u0022 etc., disables stock SAS/Autopilot. And this mod only works with stock SAS/Autopilot.\n\nEdit: Actually I\u0027m not sure if it would be more appropiate to ask in RT thread for a compatibility config with Persistent Rotation instead...?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-13T15:54:01Z\u0022 title=\u002205/13/2015 03:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by eodh**"},{"CreatedByName":"MarkusA380","CreatedById":45759,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T10:48:38Z","Content":"Small Feature Trailer released!"},{"CreatedByName":"Svm420","CreatedById":136047,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T15:25:29Z","Content":"Is the window supposed to be open every flight?
