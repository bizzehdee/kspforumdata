Once i\u0027m getting connection to the relay network my power ramped up to 52gw as I got out of atmo out of 68. Thats not bad. But I don\u0027t think that should happen as the source is on the ground. Once on the network, it doesn\u0027t seem to track where the power is coming from, so the only attenuation you see is between you and the nearest relay. I\u0027ve not tested to see if this works at other planets yet, so I\u0027m operating on limited info. Theoretically, if my hypothosis holds up, once you have a relay in orbit around a body, a ship in the area would only see attenuation to that relay as if the relay is the sum total of all sources.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually, since the source is only 3km from the pad, I should see less attenuation on the pad and more as I go up where there is more atmosphere between me and the transmitter. Once on the network, I should see more losses depending on how many relays the power had to go through to get to me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll that said, I don\u0027t have a clue as to the coding difficulty that might cause. It\u0027s not like a control relay where everything goes back to KSC (single source). You could have a ground station like I\u0027ve got. You could also have Kerbol solar sats. You could have anti-matter driven transmitters in Jool orbit. Not every path would lead to one source. A receiver would have to calculate the distance to each source it connects to and attenuate accordingly. That may (or may not) generate a lot of overhead lag if it\u0027s doing it 5 times per sec (a tick is .2 secs?).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow the receiver does seem to be tracking the number of sources total and the number it\u0027s connecting to. It also seems to track the total number of relays and the number of relays it can see as well as the network depth. You can see this when you right-click on an activated receiver. So, it looks like some of what I\u0027m talking about is already coded. I was kinda hoping to hear some of Fractal\u0027s thoughts on this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rabada","CreatedById":66044,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-19T20:08:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022AndreyATGB\u0022 data-cite=\u0022AndreyATGB\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EReading through some of the discussions here, I think this mod will change the most in 0.24. Budgets will completely change the way we use microwaves since you\u0027d need an insane amount of money to build a big power plant.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have been thinking the same thing! In my current save game I have been experimenting with the various ways to mine resources. I still havent quite figured out exactly how I would handle tritium once interstellar is updated for .24. I bet Fractal will make tritium ridiculously expensive. I really like the Vista engine for my re-usable ships, like my fuel tankers, so I was trying to figure out a good way to fill them up with tritium. Currently the best way I have found to produce tritium is to use a bunch of 3.75m green fission reactors breeding tritium. I have a microwave transmitter attached so they are always at 100%.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that tritium in .24 could end up being very interesting. It cannot be mined, so either you will have to pay a ton for it, or figure out how to produce it. However it is really only consumed by the Vista engine, and by He3 decay at the moment. (fusion reactors don\u0027t count because they can also breed tritium.) I would like to see tritium be more useful in the future. I believe I have heard that fractal wants to add an engine that consumes charged particles. If so, then the best way to power them would be with He3 fueled fusion reactors. I have not yet been able to make a ship to mine he3 from Jool, so I can only get he3 from tritium decay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomeone suggested earlier that perhaps Interstellar could use a new breeder reactor to produce tritium. I read up on tritium, and read it is breed by neutron bombardment of lithium. Instead of adding a new part, would it make sense to have fusion reactors produce more tritium? I read Deuterium/tritium fusion produces a lot of neutrons. Maybe fusion reactors could have a super tritium breeding mode where they produce a lot of tritium and waste heat, but they won\u0027t produce any thermal power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways these are just some rambling thoughts I\u0027ve had.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"galactictaco","CreatedById":112257,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-19T22:48:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eso i replaced my warp plugin, and when i loaded up i had a load of new techs, but im having trouble with some. my radiators wont deploy, some interstellar science equipment like the gamma ray detector doesnt do anything, some items dont react at all to right clicks like the IR telescope and my reactors. now what do i have to replace?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BigD145","CreatedById":417,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-19T22:53:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022galactictaco\u0022 data-cite=\u0022galactictaco\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Enow what do i have to replace?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEverything.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hellbus","CreatedById":51207,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-19T22:57:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m having an issue with the dome-shaped ISRU.

So far so good. I then built an aluminium hybrid powered rocket and landed it at the base. Hooked it to the main craft with a KAS pipe link. My problem is that while the refineries will mine Alumina, and electrolyse it, they are producing only oxidizer. I know they should make more oxidizer than aluminium, but im getting 0 aluminium.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are no AH rockets on the base itself so the main structure doesnt technically have anywhere to store aluminium, just alumina in the refineries and oxidizer all over the place. Is this the problem? I was under the impression that a KAS pipe link works exactly like a docking port, so these 2 vessels are now 1 craft in the game\u0027s eyes. Why isnt it storing the aluminium in the hybrid rockets?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedit: done some fiddling with part files and my persistent file and determined that the aluminium will indeed not refine into the AH rockets linked via KAS. Is this resource set to not flow somewhere? Gave the refineries a little aluminium storage and they began producing it correctly, but I still have to manually shunt it from the refinery into the rockets. While this may be as intended, I would like the aluminium produced at the refinery to behave like stock liquid fuel when it comes to locating and auto-assigning storage space for it, can anyone tell me which variables I need to alter to get this behaviour? (I really really want to avoid giving my AH craft their own refinery)\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDid you ever get your problem figured out? With documentation lacking I built a AH rocket with refineries to mine/refine aluminum as a persistent mun-explorer. In theory it works well but in reality I can only mine OR refine...but not both at the same time. And only from one refinery at a time (I have one for each rocket to appease my need for balance). So in effect refuleing an AH rocket takes FOR EVER! Constantly turning mining on/off and letting the refinery electrolyze the aluminum to produce oxidizer and very small amounts of aluminum. It took me about an hour of real time and several days of accelerating game time to start/stop production enough to refuel one AH rocket...it was a better use of my time to just launch a more simplistic ship and accept that I won\u0027t effectively have a persistent prescence on the Mun. I do not currently use KAS as I\u0027ve read too many horror stories of stuff blowing up. I use ScanSat (or somethign like that), KSP-I, EVE, and an improved docking indicator. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI figured either I\u0027m doing something wrong or this is just the reality of how it\u0027s programed - I poured through the source code and had a plan to change it but then realized that the code was compiled in the DLL and wasn\u0027t adjustable (without recompiling)- I was going to have it NOT check if a certain \u0027flag\u0027 was set to do mining...and just do it. My hope was to allow constant mining while the \u0027flag\u0027 told the refinery to continue electrolysis. From the code it looked like mining was checked prior to electrolysis..and if the \u0027flag\u0027 was ON for mining it wouldn\u0027t do any other processing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"G\u0026#039;th","CreatedById":98595,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-20T14:24:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDoes the size of the AD matter?
