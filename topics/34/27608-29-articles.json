And thank you for answering DYJ, I really hope, that you make these procedural glass for us. I think, that I\u0027m \u0022advanced user\u0022 of these fantastic procedural wings and if you don\u0027t mind, I can make little suggestion what can you do, to make this procedural system little more friendly use. This is G button. When we use R button we can control preciselly root of wing, the same for T button working great for end of wing. But G button is responsible for two things; moving left and right, and for lenght regulation in the same time. Well, making rectangle is quite hard to make. If you separate these function into two button, for example F for moving left and right, and G for making wing longer and shorter it will be much, much comfortable for use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Maybe you need some tester of these procedural glass panels when they are almost ready?

No expensive shaders or models to bog down performance.
