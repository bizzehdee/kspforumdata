Can you implement an idea from a recent re-pack of RT that allows you to always be able to control the antenna on a probe. This is not far off from real-life behavior of probes that will autonomously attempt to re-gain signal by re-positioning and re-purposing antennas. Full control of the probe is not necessary, but that one small change makes playing with signals much more fun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ShotgunNinja","CreatedById":159391,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-19T03:38:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/1396-pringleman/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u00221396\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/1396-pringleman/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@PringleMan\u003C/a\u003EConditions external to the probe determine if it has a link: distance, occlusion,\u00A0other vessels relay state and the signal processing from the tech tree.

This time I really wanted to have life support in my game, including the consumption of ElectricCharge\u00A0the background.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo I proceded to download and try all existing life support mods, one after the other. Some\u00A0of them, to some degree, claim to require EC and consume it in background. Well, that isn\u0027t really the case, and the reason why it is this way is simple: they can\u0027t possibly consume EC in background without producing it too\u00A0(or the player\u0027s Kerbals will just die...).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I started to develop my own life support mod, out of desperation. I also\u00A0come to discover \u003Cem\u003EBackgroundProcessing,\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0that looked like the perfect solution\u00A0until I actually tried it: occlusion from celestial bodies was broken, and there were many more problems. I attempted some kind of collaboration with the author to improve on that, but he probably is busy with other matters. It wasn\u0027t his fault either for the broken things, hell there are families and genera of things you have to get around in KSP to make stuff work in background coherently. So I ended up rewriting the background processing from scratch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen the ISRU. I never really played with it, but I wanted to see how it behaves with my background simulation as I\u0027ve read somewhere it was somehow already simulated in background by squad. Well, it was utterly broken. The squad simulation just isn\u0027t mean to deal with complex setups, and for complex i mean a drill, an ore container and a converter. So I just went ahead, drink all the caffeine my body could take, and rewrote that thing from scratch. Yes, now IRSU work in background for arbitrary setups. Alleluyah!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll well. I dediced it was enough modding and I went to playing. I remembered from my 1.0.4 days that DangIt added a lot of spice to the game. Well, I could\u0027t manage to get to orbit without the engine or the fuel tank near to the engine failing. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022what\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022what\u0022\u003EWTF\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E? Why was that happening, what has changed? I tell you, the temperature model has changed from 1.0.4 to 1.0.5 and probably the carefully balanced DangIt juts had its balance thrown out of the window. I tried to tweak that in DangIt source for my own perusal but then I said to me \u0027\u003Cem\u003EBuddy its just faster to rewrite this thing from scratch\u003C/em\u003E\u0027. At that point I looked in the forums for ideas about a malfunction mod and I found a lot of people complaining about random failures. I could sympatize with them. The fact is\u00A0planning for failure is fun, but no plan survive contact with reality so it all result in unusable vessels in a way or another. I wanted to provide an alternative to that, and specs getting reduced logarithmically just looked perfect. And also now I can get failures on unloaded vessels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow\u00A0(this is the last point i promise), I had AntennaRange installed. I did some kind of Sputnik replica mission in the\u00A0early game, then the batteries run out in a few hours and it was just there orbiting for eternity, monument to my space program. And I forgot about it... until, during a tense moon mission the damn thing start relaying data! Yes, dead vessels can relay data in AntennaRange. That was not really acceptable to me, gameplay-wise, and at that point I knew very well what to do: I put down\u00A010 espresso in rapid succession and start writing the whole signal shebang from scratch. Like with malfunctions, I just explored the forums to see if somebody had some good idea and I found out about SQUAD wanting to add antenna ranges and relaying to the stock game, that was delayed. So I through it would be good to implement something similar to it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen I through it was done.\u00A0500 man-hours later this was good enough to release to the public.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd so this is the story of how I came to make this mod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHm.. that\u0027s a pretty dedicated development... makes me lean towards your mod more... makes my choice that much harder. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d test your mod right now, but my 1.05 game is in the middle of a fairly regular Career mode, so I\u0027m not really up for doing that.
