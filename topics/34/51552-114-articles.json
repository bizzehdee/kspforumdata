How does it do that? \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, the stock game 0.23 allow you to transmit EVA reports and other collected science without boarding, as long as the ship have the comm devices. The cap is the same as if you send from capsule. But with Remote Tech Kerbonauts seems doesn\u0027t have antenna in the suit anymore. This may become a problem when you collect say two Mysyery Goo experiments and try to board with them. Since capsule can only have one experiment you will have to dump one of the resoults since you can\u0027t transmit it from EVA without boarding and and up loosing the all results.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
