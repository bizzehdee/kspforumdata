Rover contracts were similar, but instead of visiting every waypoint, you had to find the \u0022correct\u0022 waypoint hidden in a larger cluster of them. This added some interactivity to the search, but was somewhat confusing at times. Both of these contracts had some pretty strict restrictions on the player and his vessel. Rovers required wheels to be on the ground, aerial contracts can only appear on planets with atmosphere, and require the player to be in a pretty tight flight envelope.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo these were the issues, the contract felt a bit restrictive on the player, rover was somewhat confusing, but aerial didn\u0027t have the interactivity I was looking for.

There can be more than one type of experiment per contract, but they are generally themed, like atmospheric surveys include pressure readings and atmospheric analysis. Each waypoint will also require you to be on the ground within a small area, below a certain altitude, or above a certain altitude. There are no vessel type restrictions anymore. The smaller ranged ground ones might be hard to hit without a rover, but if you have a lander or a VTOL, that will work just as well. The high altitude ones can even be done from orbit, if you pass over accurately enough. Right now there are five types of survey: seismic, temperature, atmospheric, gravimetric, and \u0022visual surveys\u0022 which include samples, EVA reports, and crew reports. This gives the player a lot more freedom in how to approach each contract, while keeping the exploration aspect and the interactivity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a lot more that has been added to Fine Print, but I figure this should tide you guys over for a while!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bdito","CreatedById":112760,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-26T19:26:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENow you\u0027ve got me really curious with that teaser.
