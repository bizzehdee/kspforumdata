To fix that, the material from another visor from the scene is applied to it.\n\nSo, it\u0027s compatible with TextureReplacer.\n\nLicense is WTFPL.\n\n[**Download on Kerbal Stuff**](https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/1094/A%20visor%20for%20Valentina)\n\n[**Sources**](https://www.dropbox.com/s/59c7aycb6llafhq/valVisor_1_01_src.zip?dl=0)\n\nChangelog :\n\n-Version 1.01: Fix compatibility with Kopernicus.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-20T22:07:35Z\u0022 title=\u002208/20/2015 10:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Lilleman**"},{"CreatedByName":"jlcarneiro","CreatedById":79196,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T22:10:49Z","Content":"Great idea, thanks!

I had to remove TextureReplacer v2.4.7 to get Val\u0027s visor to show up. Let me know what info you require for tracking down this issue\n\nHuh, after putting the TextureReplacer folder back in GameData and starting up the game again the visor was now there. I had started the game up twice with no visor before removing TextureReplacer. I think that brought back the default visor material that then persisted when I put TR back in. \\*shrug\\* hey, it works!\n\nActually it doesn\u0027t work any more if you return to the menu from the space center, even with TR removed.
