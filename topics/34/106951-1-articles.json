All the different sizes, the filters, reactors ... it really should be called Kerbal Accountancy Simulator. TAC is also the best supported LS mod. The others are great. I like IFI and I miss the original IonCross CS, but TAC is the market leader. I find myself always returning to TAC for important saves but I hate the number of parts it requires. And the models, especially hexcans, look far more Trek then Kerbal.\n\nOver a year ago there was a great stockalike parts pack for TAC, radial cans built from the long monoprop tank and a large inline built from the cupola model. It was lightweight and non-intrusive parts pack. But TAC and KSP have changed in the last year. So, with permission of Somnambulic, I\u0027ve updated his mod to support TAC\u0027s current resource definitions. I\u0027ve also added a new combined tank containing all three TAC resources (the one with \u0022life support\u0022 written on the side).\n\n[![XQuLHMmm.png](http://i.imgur.com/XQuLHMmm.png)](http://imgur.com/XQuLHMm)[![d5fQQ2Im.png](http://i.imgur.com/d5fQQ2Im.png)](http://imgur.com/d5fQQ2I)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/uhTYg)\n\nEach tank contains 30 kerbin-days worth of resource, based on a 24-hour kerbin day. The combined radial contains 10 days worth of all three and the combined in-line contains a massive three kerbin-years.\n\n**All parts are Tweakscale-ready!**\n\nGet tweakscale here: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/112693](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/112693)\n\nOriginal concept and non-Squad models/textures reproduced with permission of **Somnambulic**.\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n**Download:** [https://www.dropbox.com/s/bzlms27gil28pk0/TAC_Stockalike_v0.5.rar](https://www.dropbox.com/s/bzlms27gil28pk0/TAC_Stockalike_v0.5.rar?dl=0)\n\n**Installation:** Put contents of rar in ksp gamedata directory.\n\n**Dependencies:** Relies on two stock models.

I intend no more. The radial tanks contain either a 90-day supply of a single resource or 30days of each for the combined can. The 2.5m inline can hold three years worth, or one year for a three-kerbal crew. All are now tweakscale compatible. So you can probably delete all the stock TAC parts. I do not want to discuss volume and part dimensions. I don\u0027t care that these parts do not comport with realworld resource volumes. The cans contain 90 or 30 days of resources because that keeps the math simple. Their mass comes from the resource definitions. While they may or may not be the wrong volume, they are properly heavy and therefore not \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Original Post(er).
