THE BIG UPDATE HAS ARRIVED! :D (2.0)","CreatedByName":"SmashingKirby148","CreatedById":130193,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T15:35:21Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"SmashingKirby148","CreatedById":130193,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T15:35:21Z","Content":"![XZw2fj8.png](http://i.imgur.com/XZw2fj8.png)\n\n![a3yGqvW.png](http://i.imgur.com/a3yGqvW.png)\n\nThe EnginesPlus Mod is designed to fill in some of the gaps in stock KSP. An example is the Mainsail, the Skipper and the Poodle are 2.5m engines. But in 1.25m we only have the LVT-30/45 and the Terrier. So the 1.25m Skipper is missing.\n\n![BqvZzfr.png](http://i.imgur.com/BqvZzfr.png)\n\nThere are 7 engines in this mod. And believe it or not, we have 3 fuel tanks as well!\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![xVivLhH.png](http://i.imgur.com/xVivLhH.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E This engine is the little brother of the Skipper and was designed as a landing engine where the Terrier is too weak and the Swivel is too powerful, making this engine a nice little in-between. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![oKYUEPi.png](http://i.imgur.com/oKYUEPi.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E Are you all about power and not efficiency? Then this engine is not for you! The Rottweiler is the 3.75m brother of the Poodle, and is very good for space where you need efficiency! \n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![bYCN8oq.png](http://i.imgur.com/bYCN8oq.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E The Vase nuclear engine was designed for small probes where efficiency was needed. Note, no Kerbal Engineers where harmed in the making of this engine! They\u0027re just a bit radioactive, that\u0027s all. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![rcti8oE.png](http://i.imgur.com/rcti8oE.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E Seeing that it got it\u0027s 0.625 brother, Astro Inc decided to give the Nerv a BIGGER brother, and so, the Tsar was constructed. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![XVzAfCg.png](http://i.imgur.com/XVzAfCg.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E The Aeroneedle\u0027s name obviously gives away that it is related to the Aerospike. But this one is big enough to hold it\u0027s own amount of fuel. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![7KqvSEm.png](http://i.imgur.com/7KqvSEm.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E This is the biggest engine you can buy at AstroTech Inc. Almost resembling a turnip a small bit at the base, the awesomeness of this engine will make you flip your (vege)table. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![r5LgIAW.png](http://i.imgur.com/r5LgIAW.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E A smaller version of the LVT-45, this engine was designed for small rockets that need that extra \u0022Uumph!\u0022 that the Spark doesn\u0027t have. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![258zXLj.png](http://i.imgur.com/258zXLj.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E AstroTech Inc has constructed many nuclear engines, but they only run on liquid fuel, and getting rid of the oxidizer leaves a small amout of liquid fuel left with tons of unused space, so AstroTech Inc has developed their first three fuel tanks to counteract this problem! There are 3 variants. \n\n![xnAad9b.png](http://i.imgur.com/xnAad9b.png)\n\nThe download is here!\n\nKerbalStuff: [https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/952/AstroGamer%27s%20EnginesPlus%20Mod](https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/952/AstroGamer%27s%20EnginesPlus%20Mod)\n\nThank you for viewing (or downloading) my mod!
