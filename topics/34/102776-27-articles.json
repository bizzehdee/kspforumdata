It is more challenging, matching inclination or circularizing orbits would take too much fuel and I would estimate it takes maybe 5x as long to get my node the way I want over stock KSP even with the help of Transfer Window Planner.

Every planet has its own plane that it\u0027s moons orbit around, even if it\u0027s just a LAN change...this makes planning missions critical.

With stock, you could pretty much just guess a transfer if you plotted it at the right time, and it\u0027d be good enough. With NH, first you need to get into Sonnah orbit\\*, usually around 50,000km - and the orbital period is rather long, so you can be a week or more off the desired burn. \n\nMostly I find I can get encounters using MechJeb, with a bit of playing with the porkchop, so at least there\u0027s a backup option. And that Aptur refuelling station is making more sense by the day... if only it wasn\u0027t so hard to get the tech :\u003C\n\n\\* sudden thought, I wonder if it\u0027s possible to wait for the correct alignment of Sonnah and Kerbin and your vessel to throw you out onto the right trajectory... in my mind, when Kerbol is eclipsed by Sonnah is eclipsed by Kerbin, from your ship view, that\u0027s a good time to burn prograde to go to an outer planet..."},{"CreatedByName":"MinimumSky5","CreatedById":115138,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-17T15:21:25Z","Content":"I use KSPTOT, its long winded and complex, but isn\u0027t confused by inclination and can give you all the graphs and diagrams your heart desires!"},{"CreatedByName":"Tynrael","CreatedById":144990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-17T15:32:45Z","Content":"Oh wow!
