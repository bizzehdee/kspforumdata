Nice work.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Is that LEE a KAS magnet? ... It allows me to dock it on a appropriate docking port on the station when the shuttle is already docked to the station.\n\nNo the LEE is not a KAS magnet, it is a docking port (as is the PDGF). I think I know you are getting at (it is very hard to explain, I know!).\n\n- You are starting with what is essentially one vessel: the space station, the shuttle, the solar truss, the robotic arm are all docked/connected together.\n- You want to move the solar truss. It is connceted to the whole vessel by a docking port, and you basically want to move it from that docking port to another docking port.\n- **With KAS**: You can grab the truss with a magnet, undock the truss (*so it becomes it\u0027s own vessel*), and then move it to the destination docking port (where it re-merges with the space station vessel).\n- **With RKE Kanadarm**: it is a very similar procedure, but *everything remains one vessel the whole time (almost)*:\n- The truss needs a PDFG on it somewhere for the LEE to grab (the PDFG is grabbable in KAS, so you can go on EVA and put one where you want.)\n- Use the robotic arm to position the LEE (which is a docking port) to the PDFG (which is a docking port of the matching type).\n- They will *dock* together, because you can dock a vessel to itself. This forms a \u0022self-dock\u0022 which is a weaker kind of docking then a normal pair of docked parts. You can tell it has docked because either (but usually not both) the LEE or the PDFG will have an \u0022undock\u0022 or \u0022decouple\u0022 action on the right-click menu.\n- Now: undock the solar truss from the space station. The means that the \u0022weak\u0022 self-dock between the LEE and the PDFG will convert to a strong normal docking connection.\n- **NB: Do a F5/F9 or change scenes** (see below).\n- Move the solar truss to the destination docking port, so that it forms a \u0022weak\u0022 self-dock.\n- Undock/decouple the PDFG and LEE, and the solar truss and space station will go from a \u0022weak\u0022 dock to a strong normal coupling.\n- **NB: Do a F5/F9 or change scenes** (see below).\n\n**NB: Do a F5/F9 or change scenes** after docking and before using Infernal Robotics to move the arm. There is some residual weirdness in IR (which I am trying to fix) to do with docking ports. For now, existing the scene and re-entering the scene should fix the weirdness..\n\nI\u0027ll spend some this week making a clear tutorial video on how to do this."},{"CreatedByName":"Viruzzz","CreatedById":78314,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-14T02:31:42Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Thank\u0027s for the screenshot.

I\u0027m pretty sure your problem is the InfernalRobotics \u002B Docking = Extra caution to avoid the Kraken problem. The solution is to F5/F9 after docking with the LEE (see my [extended walk through above](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/112881-0-90-RKE-Kanadarm-v0-10-0-March-12?p=1785729\u0026viewfull=1#post1785729)).\n\nPlease let me know if that doesn\u0027t address the problem.\n\nThis feels like it will be a recurring gotcha for everyone. I\u0027m in the process of debugging the underlying issue in Infernal Robotics. This might take me a week or so.\n\nEDIT: Also: try putting a part (e.g. the RKE spacer) between the rotating joint and the LEE. Connecting the LEE (a docking port) directly to a rotating part can lead quickly to trouble.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-15T10:57:42Z\u0022 title=\u002203/15/2015 10:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by spudbean**"},{"CreatedByName":"sirkut","CreatedById":57229,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-15T15:43:05Z","Content":"Love this mod!

So does F5/F9\u0027ing avoid the vessel graph traversing parts in the incorrect direction? As I\u0027m sure you know, an IR part has a fixed and moving mesh, so if you place it on backwards the fixed part still remains fixed (and thus floats in mid-air). It\u0027s hard to tell from the gif in the OP, but I think this is still a problem with your parts and something that would need code to resolve."},{"CreatedByName":"spudbean","CreatedById":66541,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-16T00:03:49Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E So does F5/F9\u0027ing avoid the vessel graph traversing parts in the incorrect direction?\n\nYeah that\u0027s my current hypothesis.
