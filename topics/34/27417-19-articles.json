See this is pretty much why I didn\u0027t bother initially. The little car wheels also all have different models. No single one of them is the same. They do have identical components within those models, which under normal circumstances could be shared. But since they are embedded in the model hierarchy and can\u0027t be up the top of the model (else they won\u0027t work properly) It means sharing models isn\u0027t ideal unless I wanted them all to look identical... Then they\u0027d be impossible to differentiate. The truckwheels do have some sharable assets that aren\u0027t within hierarchy, as in the arches, but sharing just the arches only is more or less a waste of time and effort for the end result. For the included textures as some do vary again the benefit isn\u0027t great.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe biggest benefit I\u0027ve seen is just that people may find it easier to install (but I wouldn\u0027t be shocked to still see it be done wrong) and that modders might have a better time with it when doing things like their own textures.
