Instead, they use a system where the parachute is deployed reefed with an explosive bolt system that holds it until either a barometric, radar-altimeter, or speed-based switch (depending on application) is used to set off the explosive bolts and release the risers, thereby disreefing the parachutes. While they actually do engineer a new parachute for each application (based on load to carry and drag requirements), the basic system is the same, with only the actual canopy and the disreef trigger being altered to suit requirements.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECorrection: They use mortars to fire out pilot chutes, that in turn pull out the drogues / mains.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-14T02:32:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUpdated to v0.1.1a!
