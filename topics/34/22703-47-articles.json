The WT-52 could be a possibility but it\u0027s in very early stages yet. Thing pegasus\u002Bwt-51 and you get the wt-52\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd old R2Djeb.. I always planned on finishing that little guy, so far my attempts to undock the full version and place him on the surface have not worked well, so it seems to deploy old good R2 it\u0027s going to be the drop method \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-06T09:20:13Z\u0022 title=\u002208/06/2013 09:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 6, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Devo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tyren","CreatedById":76757,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-06T09:19:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all it could just be a Skin for the mechjeb module(?).
