I admit I haven\u0027t been playing around with the science stuff of mods outside the Kerbin SOI so I didn\u0027t think it would be that much. Then maybe I would say that there should be a scaling factor of costs involved... Since you already have the increase in total science for each mod maybe you could start with that, although I wouldn\u0027t use the full amount since I think people might not make the full use of science from mods simply due to ignorance. So maybe 75% of the increase? So if you have SCANSat it would cost ~36% more in total.\u003Cp\u003EIn the end, if people don\u0027t like the scale factor they could remove it right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERighto.

I get somewhat detailed when I get obsessed with something like this that uses excel sheets for some reason.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI went ahead and read Station Science\u0027s forum post and played around with it for a couple hours, and I think I know what to do. I will never be happy with an unobtainable conversion curve, so I just have to pick what feels right. So most of the science requires the orbital lab and the cyclotron can only operate in space, so I can ignore science gained on the surface for the most part. Same with L-Tek. So I am pretty close to finishing now. I keep thinking I am almost done though, and then think of something to add or have to fix, so no promises. I can almost promise adding new mods to the tree will be much quicker after this with one of the excel tools I made.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anyone knows a way to make the research and development area bigger, I would sure like to know.
