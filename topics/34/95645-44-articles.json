If you think about it, it would only be logical that they could be removed, since the goo canister should have a canister release switch, and since the science bay would contain a whole lot of small experiments for observation, which then could be taken out for examination. Then, when a science lab is involved, the crew inside could take another batch of test subjects and prepare them, so ultimately, there isn\u0027t much of a realism concern with keeping players from recovering their experiments on EVA.\u003Cp\u003EFurthermore, doing this only harms gameplay, since players conducting Apollo-style landings with disposable landers cannot return their mystery goo and science bay experiments for recovery back on Kerbin, thus turning a already complicated mission either into a more complicated one (by either making the lander recoverable or making a separate third lander that can also be recovered), or turning one mission into two separate missions (like a mystery goo and science bay unmanned lander mission separate from the manned landing). It doesn\u0027t make any sense--the current system already works! The balance is that players have to bring a lab if they want to perform more science, or bring duplicate experiments, the reward being that you can transmit science back at a higher return than normal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Olsson\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Olsson\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E1 - I kind of agree with you. I pointed this out earlier to dear Yemo and he told me that this is to buff probes and nerf manned landings. I agree with him and I understand why, but part of me disagrees because I\u0027m not entirely convinced its a neccesary balance change as manned landings are nerfed significantly with tech delay, life support, deadly re-entry, etc.\u003Cp\u003E2 - The part with apollo-style landers, I agree. It\u0027s not really a problem in the Kerbin SOI since you\u0027re probably just going to launch, land and return the same vessel. But if you\u0027re landing on duna and want to get those experiments back, well, that\u0027s a whole different story.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3 - You can change it in the configs quite easily, there should be a value in the parts that you change from False to True.

It is essentially a workaround.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince apollo style missions in KSP have no value at all based on game mechanics (attaching a heat shield to a lander can or a capsule gives the exact same gameplay results), I can hardly take them into account for gameplay balancing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey are roleplay exclusively (not my idea/intention, just a result of squads design), just like the different antennas in stock ksp.

That would allow for greater flexibility.

I recently ran into a seriously strange problem and I don\u0027t know if anyone else has already brought it up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe all know that Unity\u0027s Garbage Collector is, itself, garbage. It\u0027s usually just a minor annoyance but I narrowed it down to the main culprit that is causing my frames to rapidly dip up and down from 60 to as low as 12. For some reason accepting the contracts provided by your SETIcontracts overhaul causes the GC to absolutely lose its mind. I did a lot of troubleshooting to be sure of the cause; removing all mods, slowly re-adding mods, monitoring memory GPU and CPU usage, using the same control for my test, and I have no idea why but certain contracts are definitely the cause. If I use the debugger menu and manually complete the contract in question, my FPS immediately jumps back up to a steady 60 again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really don\u0027t want to uninstall that part of your mod because it really helps with immersion and driving the game with a logical progression of goals.
