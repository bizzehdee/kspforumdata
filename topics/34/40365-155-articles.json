I suppose by spreadsheet you mean that you intend to produce a device which will enable the user to predict in advance how much waste heat they will need to be able to dissipate, and how the number of radiators they use will affect the efficiency of their generators. If so, let\u0027s leave that to one side; I suggest that the best way to go would be a new UI in the editors rather than a spreadsheet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, the graph. On the left are our (local) sources of heat, reactors and solar panels. On the right is the great sink: all of space-time, represented in miniature (well, all of it within your light-cone, but we can abstract that detail away). In between are all the artifices of human ingenuity which either alter the energy flowing from source to sink from one form to another or which performs some useful task using that energy. Most of these artifices do not connect directly to the reactors, instead drawing electrical power from a generator. Similarly, these artifices are only capable of dumping a small quantity of their waste heat directly to the great sink; the bulk of it must go out through a radiator designed specifically for that purpose. Each connection is sized in proportion to the quantity of energy flowing across it, and when the sum of the energy entering at the left is greater than the sum of the energy leaving to the right then the craft must shut down some or all of its systems lest it suffer some damage. (That damage, incidentally, would serve to rapidly increase the rate at which the craft can dump waste heat directly into the universe; the rules of the game do not allow you to remain in an unbalanced state forever, or indeed for very long.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, the reason why I suggest that this not be a spreadsheet is that there is a clever feedback mechanism built into the rules of the universe. When the graph is unbalanced, the first thing that happens is that the internal temperature of the craft begins to rise; it is retaining waste heat. This causes the craft and it\u0027s radiators to be more efficient; they can dump heat out into the universe more quickly. Eventually, the craft will reach equilibrium and the heat released will exactly equal the heat absorbed. Your goal as a spacecraft designer is to arrange things so that the entire craft does not need to heat up to the same temperature as the inside of your antimatter reactor in order to dissipate the heat released by that same antimatter reactor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFractal_UK: an in-game UI that drew this graph and let you see how the energy flows will change as you turn various components on and off would blow everyone\u0027s socks off.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jpinard","CreatedById":89401,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-01T18:10:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFractal-UK,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease don\u0027t take offense as I think your mod is amazing, but is there any chance you could change that solid blue-purple engine cone into something that\u0027s a particle effect instead?
