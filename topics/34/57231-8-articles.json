At this stage I wait for the position to settle and then turn OFF SAS. For some ships it might be necessary to time warp on and off quickly to kill and residual movement but you can see across the solar system without doing this. Then slowly zoom in adjusting the camera using I,J,K,L (with RCS off!!!) to control the camera servos directly. Doing this you should be able to take a stable picture of any of the planets without too much difficulty, though killing off the movement of the ship is most important. There will always be a little jittering and movement as the angles when you\u0027re looking at distant planets are so small (the field of view for max zoom is about 0.001 degrees).\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: 4.1 now up with HDD fix\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-26T09:50:35Z\u0022 title=\u002207/26/2014 09:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 26, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by tobyb121\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sralica","CreatedById":116496,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-26T10:14:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDownload link not working.
