Bugs are all well and good but I need to assuage my OCD.\n\nI\u0027d like to add a configurable text filter to science.cfg so you can eliminate \u0022Kerbin Splashed Highalnds\u0022 and \u0022Kerbin Splashed Mountains.\u0022  Current filters work with replacement star systems.

You can use \u0022|\u0022 and \u0022-\u0022 for OR and NOT.  To check your filter type it into the science report window filter \u0027cos it is the same parser.  Any science left in the report window will be filtered out.\n\nSo both the new filters only remove a hand full of science in stock solar system (at least once you have the astronaut complex upgraded,) but they were annoying me.\n\nDifficult science is\n\n- Anything flying low or high at a star\n- Anything flying low at a gas giant\n- EVA report in space near a star (kerbals always explode)\n- With initial astronaut complex - EVA not on homeworld\n- With initial astronaut complex - EVA on homeworld in flying high, space near or space high. - Remember to press space-bar to make kerbals jump.\n\nYou can restore difficult science by turning the tick-box off in the settings window if your name is Whackjob or Scott Manley or something.\n\nThe difficult science should apply to modified solar systems.

It appears (a small educated guess on my part) that any solar system that has moved/renamed the sun (in GPP\u0027s case the sun is replaced in whole by Ciro) that [x] will have problems detecting that some experiments can be run.  It goes a bit deeper though...\n\nFor this test I was using Sounding Rockets since those 4 experiments have a history of misbehaving for me in various circumstance.  All 4 experiments have both situation and biome masks set to 63 (run anywhere/any situation) but only have a \u0022default = \u0022 definition and no custom definitions by body.  When I add the custom definitions for a body in GPP, [x] still does not detect that the experiment can be run.  However, it will show up under Experiment Tracker which behaves identically to [x] when the custom definition is not present (no experiment shows as eligible).  You can see some screenshots below.  These were taken at separate times with only [x] or Experiment Tracker installed (never both).\n\nSpoiler\n\nYou can see the experiments are available to run in Gael High Space...\n\n![flLFetI.png](http://i.imgur.com/flLFetI.png)\n\nYet despite being present and available to run they do not show up as available on the list once I leave Gael (home planet)...\n\n![0bZBgNZ.png](http://i.imgur.com/0bZBgNZ.png)\n\nAnd the same vessel with Experiment Tracker in Iota High Space as in the previous image with [x]\n\n![xHBif0Y.png](http://i.imgur.com/xHBif0Y.png)\n\nI discovered this quite by accident but since I use [x] instead of Experiment Tracker it would be lovely to see this little issue go away. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022)  I\u0027m not sure of what other mods may be affected in this way but will inquire with other GPP users to see if they know of any off hand.  I\u0027m still not entirely sure what could be the root of this issue though since there are other experiments out there that do not have custom definitions for GPP and have both masks @ 63 but behave as expected...\n\nAlso, if this isn\u0027t something readily found/fixed would you prefer that I open this as a GitHub issue to track and test it properly?
