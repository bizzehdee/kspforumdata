I sent you a PM before you edited this, asking you if you would like me to take this over for you, as you had stopped development.  No reply.  I then decided to go to work on my own.  I personally find this update has helped boats.  It may have killed plugins, and made you need to fix colliders and rewrite configs, but it hasn\u0027t killed anything else.  This should have made it easier.  You can simply add a buoyancy key to the config to add buoyancy to your pontoons.  You need to remember that we have a great community to consult with whenever you have any issues.  You also need to realize that Unity put out an update which is giving Squad a hell of a lot of trouble with updating KSP to for 1.1.  If they reacted the same way to Unity 5 as you did with KSP 1.0.5, they\u0027d only be a little marketing company in Mexico.  They have been working for months on updating it to the new version.  It\u0027s how software works.  When you got into modding, you signed up for this.  I expect this with every new version.  Of any piece of software.  Example: Xcode 7 brought Swift 2, which broke everything.  I expected this, and did all I could to make it as smooth as possible.  I personally am developing a game which has been broken several times by Unity updates, even before it has even reached prototype.  Doing this requires work.  Everyone else:  don\u0027t listen to what he says.  Don\u0027t expect it to require no work at all."},{"CreatedByName":"mcirish3","CreatedById":50775,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-28T20:26:52Z","Content":"[@CliftonM](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/140061-cliftonm/) do you happen to know the licencing on this?

It\u0027s pointless to try to improve things for Squad when they don\u0027t even consider all the effort modders put into their work. I got fed up because, at the time, mine was the only boat mod out there and Nathan decided his goal was to make stock parts float so players could make flotation planes. Not one consideration was given to my mod in the process. Now, should I consider myself so special that they should consider my mod before changing the game?  No.  But, look at how many mods have utterly vanished because Squad doesn\u0027t even have the courtesy to ask modders their opinion or give them a chance to test the changes before they slap them in the face.  I was not once consulted, asked what I thought, given a chance to test the patch... all I got was, \u0027you shouldn\u0027t need to change anything unless you\u0027re exploiting bugs.\u0027   Had that been the truth, I\u0027d still be working on this mod.  In reality, it took me 5 minutes to realize just how screwed over my mods were.\n\nDice figured this out a long time ago and gave up. I know this because I talk to him weekly.  Even he told me not to bother, it\u0027ll just get screwed over again and again and again.  \n\nI\u0027m sorry. I had a blast creating this mod and seeing what everyone could do with it.  It\u0027s an amazing feeling, really.  But, like many modders, I\u0027m in no mood to keep chasing my own tail.\n\nNextly...\n\n[As of Oct. 19, the license changed to CCANC](http://www.datainterlock.com/Kerbaltopia/creative-commons-attribution-noncommercial-4-0-international-public-license/) just to keep Squad from stealing the concepts I created and profiting from it.  Now, whether the NC can be linked to the fact that Squad is profiting from my mod is debatable so any derivative would be in a legal grey area.\n\nBut, since you guys won\u0027t leave me alone with this (2 months later and I\u0027m still getting blasted with e-mails), I\u0027ll do this:\n\nIf one person is willing to take over this mod AND the submarine mod I will provide them with everything I have on it.  This includes, all models created in Wings3D.  All of the Unity files. The source code I was working on to \u0027improve\u0027 flotation and the source code for the Sub pack.  I will also edit the OP for both mods and point them to the new forum post.\n\nHere\u0027s the catch.  It\u0027s over 5 gigs of data.  If someone is willing to mail me a thumb drive with return postage paid, I will copy that data onto the thumb drive and mail it back to them. Yes, 5 gigs.  There\u0027s a lot of junk in there including models I didn\u0027t finish or release. (no I will not upload this anywhere).\n\nWhoever takes this over best know something about C#, Wings3D, Unity, multi-layer png files... etc.\n\nSo, if you\u0027re brave and want these headaches, pm me."},{"CreatedByName":"Randazzo","CreatedById":136468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-29T21:25:59Z","Content":"Edit: Nevermind, I\u0027m quite sure I\u0027m wasting my time.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-29T21:30:03Z\u0022 title=\u002212/29/2015 09:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Randazzo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Fengist","CreatedById":78435,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-29T21:38:12Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 11 minutes ago, Randazzo said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Edit: Nevermind, I\u0027m quite sure I\u0027m wasting my time.\n\u003E \n\nNo more than you wasted mine.

I feel I must point out that you cannot retroactively change the license of a mod, it is governed by the terms given when distributed (this is one reason why a copy of the license must be included in the download package. Looking at the last download I have of Maritime Pack it would appear these are the terms:  \n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Quote\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Copyright (c) 2015, DataInterlock  \n\u003E \n\u003E All rights reserved.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.  \n\u003E \n\u003E Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.  \n\u003E \n\u003E Neither the name of the DataInterlock nor the names of its contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.  \n\u003E \n\u003E THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \u0022AS IS\u0022 AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

I dont know, it just wouldnt seem right to me...  \n\nBut that is just MY opinion... Which as always, doesnt matter much in the scheme of things...lol  \n\nAs to second statement, is it just me, or does there seem to be increasing posts of whining, complaining, and downright demanding posts, towards modders regarding fixes \u0026 updates?... Maybe its just due to increasing numbers of people buying the game, so the numbers of people doing such things will of course increas..??  \n\nI just hope it doesnt start discouraging more and more modders to leave or drop things... ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif \u0022:(\u0022)\n\n[@Fengist](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/78435-fengist/) , I commend you on your response above, to basically give your blessing to the right person to pick this up, given the unfortunate state of affairs...\n\nI really have enjoyed playing both the Maritime and Sub packs...  \n\nThe Sub pack inspired me to start  an attempt at picking up modelling \u0026 making my second ever part for KSP...
