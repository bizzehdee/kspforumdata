IRL, everything is an engine, and all engines use some type of fuel. That\u0027s it. Every engine has a specific purpose (or multiple) and generally what type of fuel and/or oxidizer used though is mostly irrelevant, besides obtaining the necessary thrust and efficiency required for it\u0027s purpose.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, so basically what I thought you meant.
