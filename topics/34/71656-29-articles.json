DMP may be treating both entities as existing, but since the database is not updated with the location and name of the second unlinked fuel truck, the database only has info that a second vessel exists, with the same name as the first truck, in the same place as the first truck.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve tried no warp, MCW, and subspace, and am able to duplicate this with any of those warp methods enabled on the server. I have not found a work around. This is something DMP related in how it doesn\u0027t seem to recognize KAS unlinked vessels that were previously linked, or simply not saving the vessels when created by KAS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKAS\u0027s fuel transfer pipes is the only way to transfer fuels between vessels short of docking them, or ramming one with a claw. Not very elegant. On a multiplayer server using resource mining, an easy way to link up vessels and transfer fuel is quite necessary. Would you be willing to at least take a look at duplicating this when you get a moment? I know you\u0027re very busy this side of the year.
