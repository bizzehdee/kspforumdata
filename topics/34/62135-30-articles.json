The Kerbin Shuttle Orbiter is a space shuttle as if the Kerbals designed one. In other words, here on earth... humans made the space shuttle (or buran on the other side of the pond).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn Kerbin, they designed the KSO. At least that is the story.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is why the KSO is small. It is designed, inspired by, and modeled as if little 1 meter tall green men designed a space shuttle. Would it have a 2.5 meter cargo bay, or a 3 meter cargo bay? I don\u0027t know. I don\u0027t think so. Artistically it wouldn\u0027t make sense (and there were 2.5 meter versions of the KSO, in fact the first KSO had a 3 meter wide cargo bay!). Visual tests at different scales made the Kerbals look off next to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the end the decision was based on community feedback and my own artistic slant. As mentioned several times; The Kerbin shuttle orbiter is a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_deformed\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Echibi\u003C/a\u003E \u0022Kerbalized\u0022 space shuttle.

The artwork has a set style and direction as well as concept art done already. You\u0027ll start seeing the first module masters next week hopefully as right now we\u0027re taking a break. The only problem I\u0027m having with the Cargo Bay in terms of size is a technical one regarding its center of mass and its floor when mounting something centerline. However this is a simple fix involving minor editing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlayers who download the KSO project, will have no need for the default game\u0027s lab, as the KSO system will include multiple fully IVAed Labs and accessories all fitted to the cargo bay of the KSO. Trusses, solar panels, power modules, will all be made so you can take up payloads in the KSO. You may have to do more than one trip on the KSO to build a fully functioning station, but that has been my plan all along.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMay I suggest you ask around the community and develop a training program for de-orbiting the KSO.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExcellent idea.

Maybe ... maybe ... it\u0027s because he didn\u0027t design his shuttle to booster forty tons into space. It\u0027s actually a little larger than Bac9\u0027s Mk2 fuselage internally. It damn near fits two meter parts. You can always get Bac9 if your dream is a plane the size of a building instead of asking Helldiver to stop making things he wants to and make things you want him to. Plus, I have a practical reason for him to avoid this kind of request. .There are a large number of part packs that focus on larger and larger and larger ships/rockets. 0.24 is supposed to have 6m\u002B pieces. This fits the bill for anyone who wants a smaller space program.

My only conundrum is if I scale up the orbiter then I should add some extra mass to make up for it and extra fuel since the main tank is bigger now.
