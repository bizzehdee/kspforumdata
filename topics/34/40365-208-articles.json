However if you send up anything with a receiver it should tell you everything it\u0027s able to connect to. For a quick test, if you change the mode of one of your network satelites to receive you can verify that it can see at least part of the rest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-What I did was this: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 1) place the first relay at 1000km orbit, this is high enough to give you a decent margin of error which helps a lot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 2) launch the second relay to a low (75Km) orbit, go to map view mode, set the first relay as your target. Now expand create a maneuver node somewhere on your orbit doing pure prograde until your new orbit will intersect relay 1\u0027s orbit. The map will show you and intersect marker indicating where relay1 will be at the time you arrive (this assumes your relay placement takes only a few seconds to circularize at high orbit btw). 120 degrees = 360/3 - in other words you want that target-position indicator about 1/3 of the way around it\u0027s orbit from where your apoapsis will be. If it\u0027s not there, you can try altering it a bit if it\u0027s close, else look where it is (this gives you an idea of the relative speed of relay1) and place a new maneuvre node based on this until your intersection puts your apoapsis 1/3rd of an orbit from relay 1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 3) Do the maneuver and circularize at the apoapsis, your first two relays should now be quite close to 120 degrees apart (it certainly was close enough in my case to work).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 4) Finally the hardest one is relay3 - because this must be exactly halfway between the other two (i.e. covering another 1/3rd of the orbit) - launch to low orbit like before. Unfortunately you cannot target two nodes at once so you can only see where ONE will be at intersect, but if you look at the distance between them - and work on the basis that they move at the same speed, you can fairly accurately work out where the other will be and place your maneuvre accordingly. I found that for me the right spot was almost exactly between the two nodes on the wrong side of the orbit (i.e. the short part between them) but I can\u0027t say this will hold for others. Once you have your spot, execute maneuver and circularize at apoapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"metalpoetza","CreatedById":97739,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-06T00:03:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Shad0wCatcher\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Shad0wCatcher\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMechjeb won\u0027t help you.

I tried using thermal and plasma engines as well all with the same result.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThermal turbojets artificially lower the ISP of intake air to something around 200 - 300 s. This is hand-waved as integrated turbomachinery compressing the intake air and results in much higher thrusts when using intake air/atmosphere compared to any other propellant. Pure liquid fuels is almost the exact opposite, having much higher ISP but also much lower thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll want to use LFO instead as it offers about 3x the thrust of liquid fuel with about 0.6x the ISP. Also note that your thrust will increase as you go higher in the atmosphere and your engine\u0027s ISP increases. You can get 12 kN out of a fusion rocket at high altitudes using pure liquid and 46 kN using LFO. If that\u0027s still not enough to circularize, you\u0027ll probably need to strap on some smaller booster rockets to help you get into space. You can turn those off once you get into space and fly around using only the high-ISP thermal rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022CleverLikeMe\u0022 data-cite=\u0022CleverLikeMe\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...\u003Cp\u003EFirst, as a KSPI newbie in general, I\u0027m noticing that the power transmission from the 3 nukes I placed in LKO is fluctuating (and decreasing). Is this normal? I used Uranium in the reactor, I have 8 huge deployable radiators, and a 3.75m fission reactor and generator on each one, along with one microwave transceiver.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s likely because your waste heat levels are rising and thus your generator\u0027s efficiency is dropping. If your generators and radiators aren\u0027t upgraded, you might not have enough radiators to cool off your reactors when running at full power, meaning they\u0027ll eventually overheat. It\u0027s a bit cheaty, but if you swap away from the satellite while the transmitter is on, it will stay frozen in the state it last was and will continue to produce that much power without gaining any more waste heat until it is loaded again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10 huge unupgraded radiators is enough to dissipate the entirety of the 3000 MW of power the unupgraded 3.75m reactor produces. I\u0027m fairly certain you can get away with 9 since some of that thermal power will become electricity instead of waste heat, but 8 is pushing it. Regardless, you aren\u0027t likely to get any good efficiencies out of these unless you spam radiators or you unlock the generator upgrade.
