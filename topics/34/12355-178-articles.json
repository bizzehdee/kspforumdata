However, if you just go with the plot it figured out at the beginning (in my example, 80 days out), about half the time it really screws up when it comes to the actual transfer. Sometimes even attempting a retrograde burn (while you are in a prograde orbit). Very weird.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I\u0027ve been having to watch it closely, and stop it about 11 days before the transfer and let it recalculate from there, and *usually* it will then work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther than that, I just want to thank the author.
