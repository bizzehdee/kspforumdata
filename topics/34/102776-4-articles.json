I\u0027d probably assume any SOi problems would be fixed by this update, it just might take a little while (I\u0027m having a hard time with porting oceans across mods atm). When it updates to 1.3 expect MANY fixes to all major issues i have atm.\n\nBut thanks for letting me know...and welcome to the forums!"},{"CreatedByName":"Hotblack Desiato","CreatedById":93895,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T09:16:16Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E that is my exact thoughts about this, which leaves me with the dilemma of what to do about the problem, leave the system with the bug, or simply remove sonnah and bring Kerbin back to it\u0027s own orbit again. I\u0027m not too fond of the idea of removing Sonnah, as it changes the entire atmosphere of early game mechanics so im hoping the stand alone kopernicus will do better with the issue. I\u0027m currently in the process of upgrading to the latest dev build and seeing how it turns out.\n\nI remember the alternis mod from novasilisko, he had put jool on kerbins orbit and turned kerbin into a jool-moon, together with minmus, laythe, moon, bop and pol (one of them later became a kerbin-moon).\n\nand he had similar issues, spaceships which should spawn on the launchpad spawned in mid space (at the position where kerbin should have been, and launchclamps in mid space are fun...). the ksc didn\u0027t show the correct daytime, and didn\u0027t show jool in the sky.\n\nand sometimes parts in orbit of kerbin or other joolian objects suddenly were on a trajectory that sent them directly into the sun.\n\nhe managed to solve these problems, maybe he tells you what he did. that would save you from searching for the problem..."},{"CreatedByName":"_Augustus_","CreatedById":115084,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T13:41:16Z","Content":"When is 1.3 coming?

I mean, it\u0027s a PRE ALPHA, and from all I can tell is that it doesn\u0027t use Kittopia for PQS and the rings are not affected by the atmosphere in ScaledSpace anymore. I don\u0027t see anything wrong with using KittopiaTech for PQS, and I didn\u0027t even notice the tiny partial ring \u0027invisibleness\u0027 caused by the atmospheres of atmospheric planets.\n\nAnyway, as [KCreator said on the KopernicusTech thread](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/109122-WIP-KopernicusTech-An-integration-attempt-between-Kopernicus-and-KittopiaTech-%28v0-13-03-26-15%29/page83):\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Until Kopernicus adds an ingame UI for editing PQS components, this mod remains relevant. And the particle system thingy in KittopiaTech has yet to be integrated into Kopernicus, so that\u0027s one more reason this mod is still relevant.\n\u003E Don\u0027t demoralise Gravitasi with sayings like that, as he is the only person to ever show an interest, and skill, in continuing my plugin.\n\n See? Tekno\u0027s Kopernicus doesn\u0027t even have an ingame UI yet! See what I meant by pre alpha?\nSo, what I\u0027m saying KillAshley, is that you should port it back over to KopernicusTech, as Tekno\u0027s Kopernicus is just in no where near developed enough yet."},{"CreatedByName":"KillAshley","CreatedById":128696,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-05T16:26:00Z","Content":"@ nicholander\n\nor i just could not port back? the major save breaking bugs that effect my mod are all caused by KopernicusTech, and switching to stand alone kopernicus has solved amost every issue i faced.

Okay, I admit, I might have made my post a bit too strongly worded (I think that\u0027s the correct phrase in this context), sorry about that, but that doesn\u0027t mean it\u0027s an attack against you. As I said before, I just didn\u0027t like your decision to convert to Kopernicus, and perhaps what you say about the advantages of Tekno\u0027s Kopernicus are true, but I would like to say that I haven\u0027t run into any major problems with KopernicusTech, the only one I can think of off the top of my head is some occasional lag.\nI\u0027d just like to say again that I\u0027m not trying to be angry at you, I just prefer KopernciusTech at the moment and thought it\u0027d be nice if you could use that instead.\n\nEDIT: I noticed that you changed the Kerbol Minor Bodies link from \u0022(removed temporarily)\u0022 to \u0022(removed indefinitely)\u0022. Like I said above in this post, I\u0027m not angry at you, and I\u0027m also not fully convinced this is just because KopernicusTech is incompatible with Kopernicus. I\u0027m thinking about switching Minor Bodies to Kopernicus when it\u0027s out of pre-alpha, but I won\u0027t switch it now in it\u0027s current 0.0.6 state.\n\nEDIT 2: KillAshely changed that back in the OP, but I\u0027ll still look into Kopernicus, maybe even before it\u0027s out of pre-alpha, that\u0027s one thing for sure. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-05T20:45:42Z\u0022 title=\u002204/05/2015 08:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Nicholander**"},{"CreatedByName":"KillAshley","CreatedById":128696,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-05T20:41:08Z","Content":"i may have acted a bit harsh, been a bad couple days, been drinking a bit tonight and may have taken it personally...sorry dude\n\nlooki had MAJOR issues with koptech, thats why i had to switch.
