But in my \u0022normal\u0022 game when I use a procedural tank, I have to select either a \u0022procedural liquid tank\u0022 or \u0022procedural RCS tank\u0022. Can anyone tell me which mod it is that allows you to select the contents of a procedural tank?\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003EAlso, is there a way to have procedural tanks that support the fuels from Near Future Propulsion?\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003EEDIT: Never mind.
