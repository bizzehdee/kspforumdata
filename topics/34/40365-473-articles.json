They used to use Sabatier Reaction and Fischer-Tropsch all the time back in the 1800\u0027s in relatively small/simple and lightweight chemical refineries in order to produce Kerosene/Methane for street lamps and early cars and such back before the Oil Industry really began to hit it big...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Germans also relied on Fischer-Tropsch (as well as Coal-Liquification) back in World War II in order to produce fuel for their tanks/airplanes when the Allies cut off their access to oil from the Middle East/ Baltics, if my memory of history serves me correctly...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, both Fischer-Tropsch and the Anthraquinone Process (Hydrogen Peroxide from H2 and O2) coupled with Hydrazine production (Hydrazine, not coincidentally, is also the main substrate for the production of some of the most common Hypergolic fuels, such as UDMH, MMH, and Aerozine; which only need to be combined with N2O4 to burn) can be used to make more advanced and easily stored fuels for RealFuels mod to use...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth Oxygen (in the form of CO2) and Nitrogen (in the form of atmospheric HNO3, and likely, vast subsurface deposits) are readily available on Mars. So, in that environment, it\u0027s possible to produce anything that\u0027s made of Carbon, Nitrogen, and Oxygen (and a little Hydrogen- which is confirmed to be present on Mars, and theorized to be indicative of subsurface ice deposits).

Duna\u0027s atmosphere is quite a bit thicker, however, so atmospheric filtration should be more practical there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Moon (Luna) also has large deposits of Nitrogen (regolith air bubbles), Aluminum, Oxygen (Aluminum Oxides), Argon (regolith air bubbles), and even a little Carbon (graphite), Hydrogen (water ice in polar craters), and Xenon (regolith air bubbles) in its regolith/craters... So the \u0022Mun\u0022 analog in KSP could be assumed to have minable deposits of those as well...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis may all seem like a tangent, but it\u0027s NOT. What I\u0027m pointing out is that there are MAJOR opportunities for expansion of the KSP-Interstellar ISRU system, which is currently only limited to the best-known of the possible ISRU processes (such as water-harvesting from ice on the Mun\u0027s poles and in the soil of Mars...) ESPECIALLY when RealFuels is also installed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWater is important for life-support and all, but the best FUELS that can be produced from ISRU are actually those that are Hypergolic- since they don\u0027t require cryogenic temperatures and can be stored for long periods of time without boil-off (unlike LiquidHydrogen or LiquidOxygen). They also have the highest fuel-density of common chemical propellant mixes, meaning you need the lowest tank mass/volume for a given amount of Delta-V (the ISP is lower, however, which makes them suboptimal for the upper stages of high Delta-V voyages... That being said, Hypergolics were actually what they used on the Apollo Service and Lander Modules- due to their high density and easy storage...) Their main/only disadvantage is that many of them are highly toxic in sufficient concentrations, and could potentially poison astronauts in the case of a leak...
