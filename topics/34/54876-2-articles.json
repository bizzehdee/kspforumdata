I am using quite a few of the realism mods so I cannot be %100 sure that this plugin is the cause, but I have not had this issue in quite some time and the only recent addition to this instances plugins I have made is this mod so here goes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDescription:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScience prob gets destroyed via Deadly Re-entry mod at around 33km up. Game fails to recognize destroyed status. I hit escape and go back to Space Port. Unable to click on anything besides exit. Main menu is then unclickable. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom output_log.txt at time of destruction:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E(Filename: C:/BuildAgent/work/7535de4ca26c26ac/Runtime/ExportGenerated/StandalonePlayer/UnityEngineDebug.cpp Line: 54)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EprobeCoreCube Exploded!! - blast awesomeness: 0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E(Filename: C:/BuildAgent/work/7535de4ca26c26ac/Runtime/ExportGenerated/StandalonePlayer/UnityEngineDebug.cpp Line: 54)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ERemoteTech: SatelliteManager: OnVesselCreate(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000, )\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E(Filename: C:/BuildAgent/work/7535de4ca26c26ac/Runtime/ExportGenerated/StandalonePlayer/UnityEngineDebug.cpp Line: 54)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E[probeCoreCube]: Deactivated\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E(Filename: C:/BuildAgent/work/7535de4ca26c26ac/Runtime/ExportGenerated/StandalonePlayer/UnityEngineDebug.cpp Line: 54)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EInvalidOperationException: Operation is not valid due to the current state of the object\u003Cbr\u003E  at System.Linq.Enumerable.Last[arpStage] (IEnumerable\u00601 source, System.Func\u00602 predicate, Fallback fallback) [0x00000] in \u0026lt;filename unknown\u0026gt;:0 \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E  at System.Linq.Enumerable.Last[arpStage] (IEnumerable\u00601 source) [0x00000] in \u0026lt;filename unknown\u0026gt;:0 \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E  at KSPAlternateResourcePanel.KSPAlternateResourcePanel.BehaviourUpdate () [0x00000] in \u0026lt;filename unknown\u0026gt;:0 \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E(Filename:  Line: -1)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E1 explosions created.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E(Filename: C:/BuildAgent/work/7535de4ca26c26ac/Runtime/ExportGenerated/StandalonePlayer/UnityEngineDebug.cpp Line: 54)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ETAC Fuel Balancer [FFE32800][2454.318]: Rebuilding resource lists.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E(Filename: C:/BuildAgent/work/7535de4ca26c26ac/Runtime/ExportGenerated/StandalonePlayer/UnityEngineDebug.cpp Line: 54)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EInvalidOperationException: Operation is not valid due to the current state of the object\u003Cbr\u003E  at System.Linq.Enumerable.Last[arpStage] (IEnumerable\u00601 source, System.Func\u00602 predicate, Fallback fallback) [0x00000] in \u0026lt;filename unknown\u0026gt;:0 \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E  at System.Linq.Enumerable.Last[arpStage] (IEnumerable\u00601 source) [0x00000] in \u0026lt;filename unknown\u0026gt;:0 \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E  at KSPAlternateResourcePanel.KSPAlternateResourcePanel.BehaviourUpdate () [0x00000] in \u0026lt;filename unknown\u0026gt;:0 \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E(Filename:  Line: -1)\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EError repeats until I exit to Space Center and then this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E(Filename: C:/BuildAgent/work/7535de4ca26c26ac/Runtime/ExportGenerated/StandalonePlayer/UnityEngineDebug.cpp Line: 54)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ENullReferenceException\u003Cbr\u003E  at (wrapper managed-to-native) UnityEngine.Transform:INTERNAL_get_position (UnityEngine.Vector3\u0026amp;)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E  at UnityEngine.Transform.get_position () [0x00000] in \u0026lt;filename unknown\u0026gt;:0 \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E  at PlanetariumCamera.FindNearestTarget () [0x00000] in \u0026lt;filename unknown\u0026gt;:0 \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E  at PlanetariumCamera.RemoveTarget (.MapObject tgt) [0x00000] in \u0026lt;filename unknown\u0026gt;:0 \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E  at MapView.OnDestroy () [0x00000] in \u0026lt;filename unknown\u0026gt;:0 \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E(Filename:  Line: -1)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ERemoteTech: ModuleSPU: OnDestroy\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEverything works fine after restarting KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Removed plugin and attempted with the exact same ship and it happened again.
