Then I unzipped and merged the appropriate folders from the KSPRC archive. However, I made sure that I did *not* overwrite any of the other mods\u0027 .dll or .version files, and I also left KSP\u0027s own sharedasset files intact! So this step requires some care and manual confirmation for the files that KSPRC wants to overwrite (it\u0027s not that many, most of the stuff drops neatly next to the existing mods without harming anything).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other day TextureReplacer did a new release that ships less files than the previous ones, so here you also have to make sure that you don\u0027t copy any of the stuff from the PluginData folder KSPRC ships in its bundled TR version, in addition of skipping the .dll.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat was about all I did.
