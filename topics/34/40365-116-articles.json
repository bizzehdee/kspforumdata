I can see the very obvious reason for this, with the lack of thermal energy venting. However, I don\u0027t think the addition of heat mechanics contributes to good gameplay. When the weight of your heatsinks exceeds the weight of your reactor, then something has gone wrong somewhere. Also, heatsinks of any kind are ugly and contribute to part count.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is also talk of fast atmospheric jets but I am just not seeing them. Nor am I seeing working examples of any kind of ship. That is pretty telling in and of itself but let\u0027s go back to the jets. You would think a jet powered by an antimatter reactor would be able to reach at least mach 2 speeds in the lower atmosphere but that seems to be a stretch right now. Before - on .5.something the turbojets would put out a few thousand kn of thrust on one of my designs and it would seem to be a good amount of thrust but I really was not impressed even then. Now it seems like the engines have been nerfed further and they are 100% useless now, putting out only a few hundred kn of thrust. If there is a combination with high thrust now, it is certainly way too large to fit on a fighter craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe trouble with the thermal rockets is they need this massive stacked assembly to work, necessitating the design of your ship in a certain way. It would be nice to see remote antimatter tanks able to feed the reactors to reduce the overall length. Also, all the other configurations below the heaviest antimatter reactor are useless.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo summarize:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDT Vista - working great\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlasma - too much trouble with heat\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThermal rocket - too large and heavy\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThermal turbojet - too poor thrust and isp\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy main point is not to make the game easier, but to open up possibilites that are being restricted right now.
