So I made a Lander and injection craft to get there. 3 man cap with a separator and MJ module, SAS remote command section with fuel, rocket legs RCS and fuel and all that jazz attached to a multistage orbit delivery system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is where things go bad. With the new patch we can play around with kerbs so I want this rocket to go up without any crew and use the remote system to get it to mun. So I first launch goes without a hitch. Perfect in every way until I notice I forgot to remove the kerbs from the capsule. No problems. Reload launch, remove kerbs and fire again, this is where things go wrong. After 5 attempts later with my rocket going ape**** at around 20km I notice on attempt 6 that while im sitting on the pad, the navball is showing at 30deg of vertical. well that\u0027s odd. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaunch anyway, ship goes stupid and finally dies at around 20km again. Reload and add crew. On the pad with navball sitting dead center where it should be. Remove crew, 30 degrees off. OK something wrong here so I made the fateful choice to take the mechjeb unit off to test if its a game or a MJ issue and game over. Once I got rid of the MJ off the ship i can no longer select any of the top righthand buttons, launch quit and all that. Had to close the game from task manager so I restarted and problem persists. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe saved game is dead. Starting a new game there is no problem but the game I removed the MJ mod is totally locked out now regardless of restarts.
