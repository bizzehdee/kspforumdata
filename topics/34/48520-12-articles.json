KIDS doesn\u0027t alter that, you always need 3500m/s for orbit, regardless of KIDS settings. What KIDS does alter is the size of the rocket (to put it simply) that can deliver that dV. If you switch to stock settings for KIDS (no need to remove the mod), you\u0027ll see that your 4600m/s rocket suddenly jumps in KER to 5700 (or more). That\u0027s why you had an apparent extra 1100m/s. Or make a stock (no KIDS) rocket of 4600m/s and then turn on the \u0022FAR to Stock\u0022 setting, now KER will show you 3600 roughly. That means that a rocket that barely reached orbit in stock, now barely reaches orbit with FAR. The problem is that you now have worse performance in vacuum.
