There\u0027s a few things I wanted to include that I\u0027ll have to skip for this round, but really it\u0027s very minor. The code for the update is all done, the only thing missing is to squash the bugs that can be found here and there. Good news again, is that it\u0027s not some nasty game breaking bugs. It\u0027s really just some issues with persistence and \u0022saving\u0022 the chutes, else. The bad news is, I work for the next six days in line, no breaks, 9h/day. That means it cuts down the time I can spend on this by a bit, must say 0.24 is very badly timed for me.\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll have this released as soon as I physically can. I work \u003Cem\u003Eat minimum\u003C/em\u003E 40h/week lately, and I\u0027ve got a ridiculous amount of things to attend to IRL, and I\u0027m doing everything I can to get this rolling down to you guys. I\u0027d really appreciate for everyone to be comprehensive of this.
