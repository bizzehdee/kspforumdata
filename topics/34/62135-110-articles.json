I was really looking forward to a shuttle type descent where you pull up kinda hard and barely slow down in time and land with the nose up to a degree. But if I do that with kso I end up overshooting the runway entirely. Even if I\u0027m only going 60 m/s. With the air rakes it slows down to stall speed and it still looks awesome, but I would prefer a high speed landing.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre you using FAR? Without FAR, the descent you\u0027re describing would be very hard to model in KSP.

As the orbiter nears the Shuttle Landing Facility, the commander takes manual control, piloting the vehicle to touchdown on one of two ends of the SLF.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs it aligns with the runway, the orbiter begins a steep descent with the nose angled as much as 19 degrees down from horizontal. This glide slope is seven times steeper than the average commercial airliner landing. During the final approach, the vehicle drops toward the runway 20 times faster than a commercial airliner as its rate of descent and airspeed increase. At less than 2,000 feet above the ground, the commander raises the nose and slows the rate of descent in preparation for touchdown.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding-15 seconds\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main and nose landing gear are deployed and locked in place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETouchdown!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe orbiter\u0027s main landing gear touches down on the runway at 214 to 226 miles per hour, followed by the nose gear.
