They generally sort into two classes, however, guidance rings for LVs (large, support lots of mass, heavy (but light compared to supported mass), draw lots of power) and probe avionics (lighter, smaller, don\u0027t support much mass but don\u0027t draw much power). The octo2 that you presumably used is 1960-equivalent technology, so it\u0027ll be very bad compared to pretty much anything else. 15 charge/min is 250 watts--not a ton, but not nothing either.
