There\u0027s no indication in KSP.log or Player.log that anything went wrong; it just hangs. It\u0027s probably not a memory issue, as Player.log usually mentions something about malloc and being unable to allocate region when that happens. The only other theory I could plausibly see is that it\u0027s ATM, but it hangs for 5 minutes on a single texture, which sounds a bit extreme, even for ATM.\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not expecting anyone to have a magic solution to this problem, and I\u0027ll be working to try to figure out the relevant conflict, but before I do, does this sound like anything that\u0027s come up before?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Also, how\u0027s StarSystems compatibility?
