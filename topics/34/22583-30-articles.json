The first thing I made was the radial engine, and it needed to be fast enough to take off with a small single engine plane, but not fly stupid fast. To make bombers work, I tuned the wings and engines again so that it would fly well with four engines on them. For the Lancaster engine, I threw that thought out the windows and just gave it lots of power cause I know people want that, so it has something like 4x150 thrust. Maybe 150 thrst isn\u0027t a lot compared to a Mainsail, but as you said, these ain\u0027t jets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a more powerful radial engine, I\u0027d like to do a new model on the casing at least, so that it\u0027s a bit heavier and longer, so it could house one of those massive engines, but still attach to a regular round piece of course. Maybe throw in my particle fx code on it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow that I can make more consistent lift values, I will set up a new set of bomber wings with the proper span and surface area, and we\u0027ll see how much lift they would actually give in comparison to a smaller wing. My plan for the wings with new lift code is to release them as an extra, not replace the existing wings. This is because they require a bit more setup if you are using a wing in the \u0022wrong\u0022 place. An aileron will only respond to pitch by default, and you have to alter its response values if you want to make it work as a rudder or flap instead.

I use this to limit top speed, just like you see in jets etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe atmosphericCurve is really dumb in most cases. It lowers the ISP of the engine at different altitudes. While that sounds nice, it does nothing to your thrust output, so the result is just that you drain fuel super fast all of a sudden when you reach a certain altitude. I don\u0027t really use this, cause I have a better method.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe FS Atmospehric Nerf lowers the thrust output of the engine as the air gets thinner. Since these are propellers, their efficiency is directly related to the atmospheric density. If the air is thin, you get less thrust, but without the fuel just draining straight through the engine. To make things more stable, there\u0027s a service ceiling option that halts this reduction in efficiency until you reach a certain altitude. (And a way to make it super efficient in the denser atmospheres on Eve)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the answer to your question is, yes, the stock engine module handles this effect just fine if you set the values properly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(If you meant the effect of the propeller spinning too fast, that would really just mean you have an engine with a lower max thrust, right?)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tanya Sapien","CreatedById":58405,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-05T20:43:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey Snjo, got some fanmail and a suggestion for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe new tech tree insertions have really made my space program feel realistic. I started with the planes section of the tree, and the tech available to me really feels appropriate to the WWII-Cold war tech era. A perfect example of this is what I made for some science. I took the Corsair design base and rebuilt it with mystery goo loaded where drop tanks would be and a Science Jr in the fuselage. Surprisingly enough, the design auto-stabilized at different speeds and altitudes. I could fine-tune my cruising height and speed by altering nothing other than the trim and throttle. The plane peaked at 143M/s at high altitude, with 120m/s being the sustainable cruise. It got up to 170m/s in a dive, pulled a maximum of 6Gees while pulling out of one of these dives (4.8 g\u0027s in a regular turn at peak speed) and had enough range that I was able to take it roughly 500Km from KSC before reaching PNR (there\u0027s an alternate and more common term for PNR that fighter pilots use, but for the life of me I can\u0027t remember it, any help would be appreciated.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E When its mission was finished, I flew it to the island runway and parked it in one of the old hangars.
