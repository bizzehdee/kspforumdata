Unless you also mean the fuel tanks are always pressurized? But no many engines need to pump their fuel, usually small low power engines can be pressure feed (by small-high pressure fuel tanks no less) to make a very high powered pressure fed engine requires fuel tanks at extreme pressures.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Psycix","CreatedById":76916,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-12T13:10:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re right, I was mainly talking about first stage engines and stuff, I should have specified that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HoneyFox","CreatedById":19237,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-12T14:24:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022rhoark\u0022 data-cite=\u0022rhoark\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThere\u0027s no other kind of resource that needs to be kept.

I thought about that a bit, the acceleration brought by engine/rcs thrust or by the ground when landed is the main factor of course. and besides, I think the pitch/yaw rotations will increase the possibility of fuel getting into the inlet while the roll rotation will decrease that. Finally the possibility of successful ignition will slowly reduce with time if no acceleration/rotation is applied.
