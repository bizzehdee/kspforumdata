So... career, random and suddenly you have no idea how much the kerbal will cost? This is the issue. If I made a \u0027generate a kerbal and let you hire or not\u0027 function you could just keep doing that until you got the kerbal you liked so that is pretty much the same as picking the stats.\n\nThe one option would be to give a set cost if it was \u0027random\u0027 giving you a chance to get a \u0027bargain\u0027 but that kind of defeats the whole purpose of this mod in some ways. You could just use stock and deal with the random kerbals provided as possible hires in that case? Not sure. In any case the UI is a big kluggie at this point anyway, and if I were to change that I\u0027d probably have to go in and gut the system and rebuild it to be more efficient! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022) \n\nIf you have ideas you can at least look at the source code, free on git hub.
