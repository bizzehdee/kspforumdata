Now that the \u0022Program ended\u0022 messages are going away for sub-program calls (once 0.8x gets fixed well enough to be usable) it\u0027s going to become more practical to use the \u0022run progname(arg,arg,arg)\u0022 command as a subroutine call. It\u0027s got a lot of overhead behind doing the call, which makes it a bit slower than a native routine but for a thing like a scripting language it\u0027s about like a shell script running a lot of small programs to each do one little thing.\u003Cp\u003EAnd while a forum thread might be an appropriate place to ask questions about such a hypothetical library of example routines, or make announcements about them, I don\u0027t think it\u0027s an appropriate place to store them for download, as only the thread starter would have the rights to edit the head post of the thread so it would end up meaning it would be a thread of scattered examples to search for.
