Can you explain the differences between the subpace/warp settings? A few friends and i were playing yesterday with it set to MCW_LOWEST, but it didn\u0027t seem to do anything. Basically everyone was still warping when they wanted, and our game times were different...meaning we were in seperate subspaces. We\u0027d like it so that we were always in the same subspace together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother question is how do we get to fly together as shown in your videos? Will the safety bubble prevent that? I had built a rover in the SPH and drove it over to the rocket platform to watch someone\u0027s lift off, but his rocket wasn\u0027t visible.

Apart from that, I noticed that all players share the 50 kerbals generated by the server and that they seem to actually die when they are killed. This could be a problem as one of our players has a tendency to die...a lot. (Which is why I was trying to watch his take off! HA) I thought I\u0027d have kerbals 0-49, the next guy would generate 50-99, etc. I\u0027m not sure how I\u0027ll feel if someone else manages to kill off my Vlad Kerman \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E Any chance each player could have his own kerbals, or would that create problems because our kerbal lists wouldn\u0027t match up?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022godarklight\u0022 data-cite=\u0022godarklight\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYeah, I saw that in IRC.

As such it was now on a collision course with the surface. Would you believe even with the disasterous glitch when it smashed into the ground tail first the command module, an antenna, and a solar panel actually survived? Vlad Kerman lives to fly again!

In KSP, a docking destroys one of the vessels and updates one of the old vessels with a new copy containing both vessels docked. *however*, As a defense, When a players vessel attempts to get deleted it is resent to the server and back to the client (causing a duplicate in the same place).
