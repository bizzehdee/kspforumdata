If you have an MK4 cockpit, which is almost 6m wide, there is a lot of empty and unused space. You would be able to fit a dozen Kerbals in there comfortably and allow them to sleep, eat and do science, and still have room to spare.\u003Cp\u003EAn idea here would be to have the cockpit occupy the top section of the module, and have a service section or cargo bay underneath. You could even think of \u0022drive-through\u0022 roll-on, roll off cargo bay designs through that. Alternatively, a smaller bridge or cockpit module that can snap into a slot in the top section of the fuselage may be an option.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Captain Sierra\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Captain Sierra\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo we have all this space below the crew cabins thats great for medium-ish rovers, lots of KIS containers, smaller cargo, etc. I find the cargo tail ramp to be overkill for unloading this and would rather make use of the space for something else (like fuel). Since I imagine the THunderhawk cockpit space is the same profile as the crew cabin, what about something like below?\u003Cp\u003EEverything below the cockpit section splits and hinges open laterally (alternate version perhaps since this means no 1.25m attach node on the front) like a clamshell, and a ramp lowers to unload. \u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think 2-3 pages back Nertea mentioned something about this concept.

Is the intent to include a \u0022pod\u0022 style arrangement where a cargo container is lowered/raised through a middle \u0022frame\u0022? Or alternately is the intent to make a variation on the existing ventral door cargo bay with a platform/elevator? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the former, obviously there are problems with something like a cargo section being a separate piece. I don\u0027t think KSP would handle that very well. You can\u0027t just \u0022swap out\u0022 pods like the original TB2 could and not have some significant stability/wobble issues. At least not in that exact fashion. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I expect the \u0022pod\u0022 will either be a permanent part of the module/part, or you\u0027ll be working with something more along the lines of the latter moving platform idea. (which has been done before with a few mods - Wayland\u0027s Devo once had a large shuttle mod with such a design, but that was about 4-5 versions of KSP back and it had some other unrelated issues that made it impractical to work with.) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn either case - I\u0027m wondering if a \u0022cargo pod\u0022 could be developed that would fit with the existing model - something with perhaps an integral pair of docking ports opposite each other so they can be secured even without the use of something like KAS/KIS? My experience with the Wayland Eagle tells me that it\u0027s better to have close-fitting sets of opposing docking ports/CBMs for flight stability. I don\u0027t think it matters whether they are a fore/aft config or a port/starboard config. But any \u0022pod\u0022 that is a separate piece that docks with a larger craft to become an integral unit MUST have an opposing docking port arrangement for stability. Otherwise you have to secure it with KAS or something (like I did with the rover above in my earlier post). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe even have an integral set of \u0022rollers\u0022 or wheels integrated like a rover so that it can be manipulated or rolled into place by other rovers? Or maybe even make an optional pod that can configure like a KIS container that can fit larger volume stuff inside and can be placed aboard? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe intent with my ideas above is to provide a suggestion for a cargo pod/container that is NOT dependent on a particular cargo bay/part arrangement. In other words, it could work as both a \u0022roll-on/roll-off\u0022 container for a regular aft ramp load in the field or be able to work with the vertical arrangement of a TB2 style ventral/dorsal cargo section. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m considering putting something together using existing parts/mods to better illustrate the above concept. But I hope you get the basic idea of what I\u0027m talking about. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t mind me - I\u0027m just \u0022brain-storming\u0022 with the full knowledge that I may well be \u0022over-thinking\u0022 this. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T18:53:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Logan.Darklighter\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Logan.Darklighter\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E-snip-\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYa I know the C5 style cockpit is coming, but that\u0027s geared towards the full-sized bay cross section.

Is the intent to include a \u0022pod\u0022 style arrangement where a cargo container is lowered/raised through a middle \u0022frame\u0022? Or alternately is the intent to make a variation on the existing ventral door cargo bay with a platform/elevator? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the former, obviously there are problems with something like a cargo section being a separate piece. I don\u0027t think KSP would handle that very well. You can\u0027t just \u0022swap out\u0022 pods like the original TB2 could and not have some significant stability/wobble issues. At least not in that exact fashion. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I expect the \u0022pod\u0022 will either be a permanent part of the module/part, or you\u0027ll be working with something more along the lines of the latter moving platform idea. (which has been done before with a few mods - Wayland\u0027s Devo once had a large shuttle mod with such a design, but that was about 4-5 versions of KSP back and it had some other unrelated issues that made it impractical to work with.) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn either case - I\u0027m wondering if a \u0022cargo pod\u0022 could be developed that would fit with the existing model - something with perhaps an integral pair of docking ports opposite each other so they can be secured even without the use of something like KAS/KIS? My experience with the Wayland Eagle tells me that it\u0027s better to have close-fitting sets of opposing docking ports/CBMs for flight stability. I don\u0027t think it matters whether they are a fore/aft config or a port/starboard config. But any \u0022pod\u0022 that is a separate piece that docks with a larger craft to become an integral unit MUST have an opposing docking port arrangement for stability. Otherwise you have to secure it with KAS or something (like I did with the rover above in my earlier post). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe even have an integral set of \u0022rollers\u0022 or wheels integrated like a rover so that it can be manipulated or rolled into place by other rovers? Or maybe even make an optional pod that can configure like a KIS container that can fit larger volume stuff inside and can be placed aboard? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe intent with my ideas above is to provide a suggestion for a cargo pod/container that is NOT dependent on a particular cargo bay/part arrangement. In other words, it could work as both a \u0022roll-on/roll-off\u0022 container for a regular aft ramp load in the field or be able to work with the vertical arrangement of a TB2 style ventral/dorsal cargo section. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m considering putting something together using existing parts/mods to better illustrate the above concept. But I hope you get the basic idea of what I\u0027m talking about. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t mind me - I\u0027m just \u0022brain-storming\u0022 with the full knowledge that I may well be \u0022over-thinking\u0022 this. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack in Mk4 1.0, I was testing a pod drop system which had two parts - a frame and a pod.
