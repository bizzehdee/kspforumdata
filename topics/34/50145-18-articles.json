I.e., a reason to make trips up and down to/from the station.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry for not getting back to this sooner but I\u0027ve been severely busy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, back to the payoff for doing Station Science. You can\u0027t even break even on it because the payments are way too low compared to the cost of setting up and doing them. First, you have to launch the 15-ton lab. Just getting that into LKO, even using the cheap 1.25m rockets and SRBs (which ain\u0027t easy to do, BTW) is going to cost you about $90-100K. But you can\u0027t do anything but Plant Growth with just the lab; you need the massive cyclotrons to do anything else. The cyclotrons cost about the same to launch as the lab. So just getting set up to do several types of experiments is going to cost in the neighborhood of $200-300K. This is money you\u0027ll never see again, because the contract payments don\u0027t even cover the cost of launching the experiment pods. Contracts at Kerbin only pay $3-5K, regardless of the type of experiment. But it\u0027s going to cost you ~$20-30K to fly several pods up and back. So you\u0027ll be losing $10-15K at least per experiment launch, on top of the sunk cost of building the station itself. And for all this expenditure, you don\u0027t get but 50-100 science for doing an experiment, even with the contract bonus thrown in. You can get way more science for way less money by sending stock Goo and Material pods to a Mun biome. IOW, Station Science isn\u0027t even close to being competitive with stock contracts on either money or science, which is a big deterrent to using this mod in a career, even though that\u0027s what it was designed for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe above is at Kerbin but really it\u0027s not much better at Mun. Experiments at Mun pay $10-15K, which is still less than what it costs to carry them out there. And of course getting the heavy station modules out there costs rather more than just getting them into LKO. The science rewards are better, but again you can still get more science for less money doing stock stuff. I submit that as the Station Science contracts stand at present, it\u0027s just not economically viable. I do it anyway because it\u0027s cool, but I have to do a LOT of crazy but lucrative part tests to be able to afford Station Science, and Station Science is not my primary means of gathering science, nor even an important auxiliary method. This is why I think there should be well-paying contracts to launch the station modules. I wouldn\u0027t mind losing money on the experiments so much if launching the station wasn\u0027t such a huge sunk cost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, here\u0027s a video I made of my 1st-ever attempt to do Station Science, as soon as it became available. Not yet having anywhere near the solar panels needed to run a cyclotron, all I could do was plant growth. Because of this, there was no real point in keeping the station up there, especially as adding modules in the future with just the Station Science \u0022docking port\u0022 wouldn\u0027t have worked too well. Also, I lacked a big capsule so couldn\u0027t get the Kerbals back down again without spending a lot of money to get them 1 at a time. And I could barely afford to launch just the lab, so all things considered, I brought it back down again after the experiment, in hopes of recovering some of its cost that way.
