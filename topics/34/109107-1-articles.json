This mod seeks to remedy this problem. It\u0027s one simple config file that allows the stock \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E to mine water, oxygen, oxygen and liquid fuel, plus waste resources.\n\nTo install this simply put the folder \u0022TACLSMining\u0022 into gamedata.\n\nThis mod requires TACLS for it to function.\n\nI would suggest you also download MunSeeker Mk1 Greenhouse on the KSP forums so you can grow food. TACLS Mining is designed to mine waste resources for the MunSeeker Mk1 Greenhouse so you can grow food off world.
