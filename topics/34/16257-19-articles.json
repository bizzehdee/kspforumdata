A \u003Cstrong\u003Elot\u003C/strong\u003E of work has gone into both coding and part making, hence the jump to 0.5.0.0. RemoteTech now functions on a whole new level compared to before. Let\u0027s get to the changelog shall we?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003EChangelog:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERewrote entire plugin to use only PartModules.\u003C/strong\u003E Thanks to input from Alchemist I found a way of persistently handling data in PartModules, whether they be loaded or not. This hass allowed me to completely do away with the old RemoteTech part classes and in stead work only in PartModules. Making RemoteTech a lot more versatile.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EExpanded the RemoteTech animation modules to allow for multiple simultaneous animations, inter-module events and looped animations.\u003C/strong\u003E The modules have evolved to a small animation suite. Again they are made with RemoteTech functionality in mind, so each animation can be tied to certain RemoteTech variables in the config.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERewrote the modding interface to use only KSPfields and KSPevents.\u003C/strong\u003E This is mostly for other modders. With this new interface, it should be a lot easier to interface with RemoteTech. The way I\u0027ve implemented the interface you don\u0027t need the RemoteTech assembly at all, and can still easily get RemoteTech data and influence the relay network.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAdded a new RemoteCore handler to run parallel with vessel handling.\u003C/strong\u003E RemoteCores used to be contained within each SPU, with only one per vessel activated. Now the RemoteCore handler cointains a RemoteCore for each RemoteTech vessel and the SPU\u0027s don\u0027t contain anything at all. This amounts to RemoteTech running smoother, a lot more eficcient, and does away with docking bugs.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAdded an in-flight settings menu.\u003C/strong\u003E If you press \u0026lt;modifier key\u0026gt; \u002B f11, you now get a settings menu where you can edit everything you normally would edit in the RemoteTech config file. I\u0027ve also included the option of resetting window positions in the settings menu.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAdded rover mode in the flight computer.\u003C/strong\u003E If your ship has wheels, it will now be possible to switch the flight computer into rover mode. This mode gives you rover oriented controls, such as turning specified degrees and driving at a certain distance at a certain speed. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAdded remote access to other RT vessel\u0027s flight computers.\u003C/strong\u003E If another RemoteTech vessel is within loading range and you have a signal connection with the vessel, you can now access the vessels flight computer directly from the \u0022list comsats\u0022 menu\u0022. With a bit of advice from Romfarer, I\u0027ve implemented a tweaked loading range to allow control of all vessels in a 2 km radius. This can be switched off in the settings if it causes you lag.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAdded MechJeb 2.x compatability.\u003C/strong\u003E Speaks for itself. From 0.5.0.0 onward, RemoteTech is compatible with MechJeb 2.x. I\u0027ve scrapped MechJeb 1.x compatability though.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETweaked loss-of-signal behaviour.\u003C/strong\u003E Now your vessel will be truly lost if you loose signal. You won\u0027t be able to edit any of the antennae to switch on/off or point your dishes. So your only hope is to regain the connection naturally or mount a manned resque mission. Every antenna now has a manual override that can only be activated by a kerbal on EVA.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAdded the MicroSat.\u003C/strong\u003E This small satellite carries an omnidirectional antenna, small engine, onboard decoupler, and solar panels. it\u0027s very good for establishing quick preliminary relay networks.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAdded the AeroProbe.\u003C/strong\u003E This UAV comes complete with twin RTGs, powerfull landing light, deorbit-engine, onboard decoupler, lightweight folding wings and twin electrical ducted fans, that will provide thrust in any atmosphere.\u003Cbr\u003EThe AeroProbe can be a bit difficult to assemble, so I\u0027ve included an example vessel; The \u003Cstrong\u003EI\u003C/strong\u003Enterplanetary \u003Cstrong\u003EP\u003C/strong\u003Erobe \u003Cstrong\u003EV\u003C/strong\u003Eehicle.

I lost contact with my comsats (and any other probe) since their dishes folded up, but once I re-established contact with them via their short range omni-directional antennas I was able to bring everything back online. I did have to manually load/control each comsat, but once I did that, they appeared to function normally. That said, I don\u0027t use MechJeb for what can only be described as religious reasons, so that probably helps, since you say there\u0027s a compatibility problem with the old version.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I noticed this with the old version too, but RemoteTech doesn\u0027t seem to work with the native docking mode.

Again, this is almost certainly just a result of the F.A.R. mod, but if so, would it be possible to get a compatibility patch for it?

I know most people probably don\u0027t use docking mode, but it would be helpful, since it can be a nice docking aid.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe docking mode implementation currently in place is a featureset that\u0027s only there due to player reuests, since I personally don\u0027t really use docking mode at all I must have overlooked the stock behaviour of toggling SAS. I\u0027ll look into adding this behaviour in the future. I might not add it though, since not having space automatically toggle SAS would give you a bit of extra control of vessel behaviour. You can still toggle SAS with \u0027T\u0027 if you need to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Firov\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Firov\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, I\u0027ve noticed some very unusual behavior from the aeroprobe, though its likely a result of the F.A.R. mod. I\u0027ve found that it can actually float at basically zero speed with the engines off as long as you point the nose up a bit, and the electric fans are ultra effective, getting it up to 1,000 to 1,200 meters per second, maybe even faster, at around 25,000 meters up, plus, they don\u0027t seem to require any electricity to run, which is a bit odd for an electric ducted fan. Again, this is almost certainly just a result of the F.A.R. mod, but if so, would it be possible to get a compatibility patch for it? I love the concept of a little aeroprobe like that, and your implementation is near perfect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFAR might give you somewhat of a bad time, since the wings used by the aeroProbe aren\u0027t built with FAR compatability in mind. The AeroProbe was made as an end-game high-tech probe. So it having superb glide capabilities while being able to travel at blackbird comparable speeds at altitude doesn\u0027t concern me that much. Actually it needs to be borderline overpowered in order to be able to fly anywhere from Duna to Eve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually it\u0027s possible to gain enough speed on Duna to completely escape Dunas SOI. All you need to do is fly at 45 degrees pitch with full throttle.

If you test the wings out on their own, you\u0027ll see them flame out once they deplete their on-board batteries. The body of the AeroProbe has two RTG built right into it that supply enough electricity to keep all systems on for extended periods. You should be able to drain the batteries, but only if you turn on absolutely everything and run the engines at full throttle.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"waerth","CreatedById":57167,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-20T03:21:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello JSP.

A guy did a similar thing a couple of months back. It\u0027s going to be a lot of time consuming hard work though. Since you\u0027re on the surface, it takes a long time to drive anywhere and you quickly loose line-of-sight. So what you end up needing is a relay tower every 100 km or so.
