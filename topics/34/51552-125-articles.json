I say this because I noticed I send commands to my delayed probe, and when the timer ends and the probe executes them, the probe itself does it with signal delay built-in, just like I was piloting it myself remotely, thus losing control very easily (i use RSS, which means x10 distances). If this is the case, I find it a bit silly for the flight computer on the probe to be having signal delay. Once commands are sent to it, the probe should execute them in its own time and space, which means no delayed controls. That is what i hoped RT2 would work with signal delay, but it\u0027s not what i\u0027ve experienced.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf im mistaken, or been talked before, i apologize, i didnt find anything trhough search and dont have spare time to read 312 pages XD\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sidfu","CreatedById":70409,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-17T16:06:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ekimaera just disable signal delay in the remotetech2.cfg\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cilph","CreatedById":21477,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-17T16:32:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kimaera026\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kimaera026\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EOnce commands are sent to it, the probe should execute them in its own time and space\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat are you talking about.
