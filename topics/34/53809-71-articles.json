Finally, Intel and AMD are *censored* liars. That apparent speed boost when running in 64bit mode? You think thats because 64bit is faster? Well, that is what they want you to believe, because else back then there would have been no reason to buy 64bit CPUs and OSes. Here\u0027s what really happens: When they introduced 64bit CPUs, they not only upped the addressing and increased the size of registers, they also VASTLY increased the NUMBER of cpu-registers. And not just a bit, but almost TEN-FOLD. Then they went and made those features only available for apps running in 64bit mode, even though this got nothing to do with 64bit at all. But they needed an incentive to make 64bit LOOK faster, to justify the switch (No, RAM limitations wouldn\u0027t be a justification, because 32bit x86 can actually address more than 4GB in total... thats another lie. In fact, XP32 was already capable of addressing more than 4GB from the POV of the OS, but the feature was purposefully disabled in a configfile, so that applications wouldn\u0027t use it, and thus users would think they have to upgrade to a 64bit OS, to access more than 4GB).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JonBar","CreatedById":90458,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-19T22:25:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022rynak\u0022 data-cite=\u0022rynak\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe only thing that 64bit solves for KSP, is \u0022out of memory\u0022-crashes with regards to main RAM.

The exact texture on which it eventually crashes varies depending on my texture settings, but the same settings with almost the same mod mix (I added DMagic Orbital Sciences for 0.24, but shouldn\u0027t be so massive as to cause memory crashes at launch) I crash not even half-way through texture loading. I\u0027m getting this line for a lot of textures in my KSP.log:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E[LOG 21:52:56.439] Load(Texture): KWRocketry/Flags/KWFlag02 OUT OF DATE\u003Cbr\u003E[LOG 21:52:56.439] Load(Texture): KWRocketry/Flags/KWFlag02\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would seem that I\u0027m loading two textures for a single file when this line appears, which could explain why I\u0027m running out of memory.

Might be a bit higher, but again shouldn\u0027t be enough to crash it that early.
