But now, flying the Explorer craft includdd with SpaceplanePlus, I get scary red flames when I exceed Mach 3 around 20,000 meters.

Again, I\u0027m using FAR, DRE, KSPI, and the plane is entirely built of SP\u002B parts. At, say, 20,000 meters, what\u0027s the maximum \u0022safe\u0022 speed for DRE/FAR purposes?
