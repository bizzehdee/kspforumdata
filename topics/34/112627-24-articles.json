First, because they are available waaay too early (actually only requiring 5 science points to unlock) compared to all other manned spaceflight technologies. Second, because the Survivability branch mostly deals with chutes and not with recycling and recreation. I suggest putting them into Long-Term Habitation and/or Space Stations sections. Not sure about specific nodes as I haven\u0027t reached those yet (and I play with Fog of Tech)."},{"CreatedByName":"Probus","CreatedById":102512,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-13T00:04:39Z","Content":"Released a new update for the Engineering Tech Tree.
