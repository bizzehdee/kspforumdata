Notice that if you want, you can configure the mass to remain the same, no matter how light or heavy the resource is. Note you can also switch in flight while the tank is empty and you have advanced tanks fuel tanks reseached. In this case, the mass will of cource remain the same, no matter the propellant.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 10 minutes ago, ThePixeledFox said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E im confused i dont know what you mean i dont understand scripts\n\u003E \n\nSimply put, you need to change the order of fusing.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-18T16:15:10Z\u0022 title=\u002205/18/2016 04:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 18, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by FreeThinker**"},{"CreatedByName":"Iam aspaceman","CreatedById":144531,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-19T01:31:47Z","Content":"Anybody install the latest update and it breaks an existing career game?  CKAN told me that there was an update - so I installed it.  When I started my existing career game it told me 2 of my ships were unloaded due to a missing fuel tank and wouldn\u0027t let me do anything.  I could only enter the R\u0026D area and I couldn\u0027t exit again.  It wouldn\u0027t let me exit the game either - I had to do that from windows.  So I uninstalled IFS and the core and the same thing happened. I reinstalled IFS and the same thing happened - each time telling me two of my vessels couldn\u0027t be loaded.  Any ideas as to how to salvage my career game?"}]}
