Is this correct?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe easiest way I know to set a specific LAN is indeed to start from a flat (incl=0) orbit. When a vessel burns in the normal direction along its orbit, it changes the orbit inclination making it raise at the longitude 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 next from the burn (if burning \u002Bnormal; the inclination raises at the opposite longitude if burning -normal). The ascending node is more or less positioned where the burn is with a \u002Bnormal, 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 before that point where the orbit is raised. Then, to set the LAN at a specific point of the orbit, the vessel must burn \u002Bnormal at that longitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking at the figure n that wiki page I linked, you see the ascending node in red, where the inclination angle is drawn. The point where the orbit is raised is 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 beyond that, and would appear placed more or less where orbit meets the violet line (actually, that violet line is the periapsis distance, not related to the LAN in any way).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf starting from an already inclined orbit, one should figure how burning normal will alter the orbit inclination: it will also make the LAN rotate if the burn is done at a point different from where the orbit is raised the maximum (from the reference plane).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, in KSP I can\u0027t find easily the Reference direction (AKA the direction of the Vernal point), that is the origin from where the LAN is measured. The Vernal point in KSP has no feature to make it recognizable, and is just an internal frame reference for positions of objects in game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, to make a specific LAN, my suggestion is to start with a very slightly inclined orbit, use one of the many tools that give orbital parameters (e.g. Kerbal Engineer Redux, or MechJeb, or VOID) to read the current LAN, and calculate from that where the LAN you need would go (so, if you read LAN=30\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, and the desired LAN is 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, that means it is 60\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 CCW on the orbit from where the Ascending Node is placed now). Then, set to burn \u002Bnormal at the desired LAN (or, 60\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 beyond the current LAN n that example). That should do the trick.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-11T07:13:46Z\u0022 title=\u002206/11/2014 07:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 11, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by diomedea\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Ecorrections (was tired and put a mistake in)\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Apollo13","CreatedById":74572,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-11T00:16:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@diomedea: thank you for that info.

Examples.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I quick save I do it right before a main MCE objective. So If I mess up I go back to where I started before everything bad happened, and nothing is out of line. But say you have 5 objective mission (pretty rare in my work) and you do 3 objectives, and then messed up on the 4th. But you for some reason didn\u0027t quick save until before the 1st objective. What would happen is that when you loaded your quick save you MCE proggress would still be done up to objective 3. This is not really bad, because you can just get back to objective 3 and continue from there!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe best thing about quicksaves is that it saves your vessel IDs.. So they never change. So complete safe to use for MCE.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for your 2nd question. Totally possible yes. But is it worth the work since .24 is coming out and the mission system in MCE will be obsolete? Anyway .70 fixed most the issues (ie its a hack but works) with Apollo style missions so I\u0027m not going to worry about it for now.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"guto8797","CreatedById":89191,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-11T13:52:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI might be missing something, but how do you make rockets actually cost something if you use KerbalConstructionTimer?
