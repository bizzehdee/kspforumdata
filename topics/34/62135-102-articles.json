The KSOS project as of v1.13 shouldn\u0027t install RPM screens on default Command Pods or Cameras as I felt it was a bit intrusive to do that in a project that wasn\u0027t RPM specifically. I believe you can still install RPM or Hyomoto as normal to get the standard RPM screens on your default command pods. But the KSOs (both of them) will always refer to their own directories as it was becoming a nightmare to customize RPM while still pointing all over the place. I will be editing the HUD and ADI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGoing to clarify: \u003Cem\u003EI will be editing the ADI and the HUD to have speed and altitude tapes that give more information\u003C/em\u003E.

I have been downloading versions of this MOD since it was first released. I really have so much fun with it. That being said it seems like it is always \u0022almost\u0022 perfect. There is always a little thing or a few little things wrong that just make it unreliable. So after downloading this version I have noticed a few things. First the KSO mechjeb doesn\u0027t work. No matter how I attempt to install it, it just doesn\u0027t work, the part doesn\u0027t show up. Second after I decouple a piece from the cargo bay the Kerbalnauts inside the piece don\u0027t show up in the bottom right corner even after I return to the Space Center and go back. I can still IVA and click on the hatch to EVA so its not a problem but it does seem like a glitch or bug worth mentioning. \u003Cp\u003EThis isn\u0027t exactly a problem but it seems like the light on the tug are overpowered? I haven\u0027t seen anyone else comment but I turned on the tug lights in the cargo bay and it lit up entire continents while flying over in orbit. So unless the intention is to create a new sun I doubt thats what you were trying to do. I took a screencap but for some reason I cant upload it. But it was pretty funny having an entire part of kerbin lit up but two lightbulbs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep up the great work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny light in general can have that effect. Usually during time warping.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Z3R0_0NL1N3","CreatedById":60881,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-10T03:37:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m so excited for the larger KSO.
