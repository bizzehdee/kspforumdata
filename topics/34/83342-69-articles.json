The idea is, currently science gets added directly to your science balance. Instead as an option, that science gets added to a completely different variable, the science buffer. When there\u0027s science in the buffer, it trickles into the vanilla science balance at a rate equal to the current development rate.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022magico13\u0022 data-cite=\u0022magico13\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EWhen BROKE is released it will have some additional features to make grounded kerbals useful. I\u0027ll probably add some more things into KCT for grounded kerbals at that time too, when I\u0027m in that mindset. I could easily add a variable for the total grounded engineer/scientist/pilot levels to several of the formulas to add those bonuses in a configurable manner. Assuming that\u0027s as easy as I think it will be, consider that to be in the next release. The Default Preset might not use them, and if it does they won\u0027t contribute a huge amount, but people can make other Presets that depend entirely on the ground crew for instance.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThat sounds awesome! I\u0027d love if you added the variables soon, it would be fun to do a career where ground crew is the only source of KCT build speed, KSC acting something like a super-powered ExtraPlanetaryLaunchpads workshop, rather than having to fiddle with an honestly sub-par GUI. Not that I\u0027m complaining about the current GUI, but switching to the GUI style you find in, say, Kerbal Engineer or BetterTimeWarp, would make the mod just that more enjoyable.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-16T09:33:58Z\u0022 title=\u002210/16/2015 09:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Prezombie\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fallout2077","CreatedById":131638,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-16T17:52:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey Magico, I think I found a bug involving your mod and the x64 version of KSP.
