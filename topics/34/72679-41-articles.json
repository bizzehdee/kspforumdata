Like, what if instead of insta-scanning the entire planet, you only insta-scan the parts that are immediately visible? That could be as much as half of an entire planet, which would require two or three scans at most to get all of the information that you could want out of the big scanner. It isn\u0027t as efficient as insta-scanning the entire planet, but it is more immersion and involves the player more.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"micha","CreatedById":113840,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T10:00:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RoverDude\u0022 data-cite=\u0022RoverDude\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ERE the instascan.\u003Cp\u003EWhat folks are not realizing is that the mechanic is radically different from Kethane or SCANSat.

(IMHO). Haven\u0027t played Kethane, so can\u0027t comment on that, but SCANSat is one of the few mods to actually give a use to satellite probes, and provides a great start-game when exploring a new body. The mid-game is the detail-scanning, and the end-game is the actual resource gathering (whether it\u0027s ISRU, science from different biomes, or landing at anomalies). It was an absolutely brilliant game-progression in combination with Karbonite and taught a lot about setting up scanning orbits which are both efficient as well as covering the planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the stock scanning mechanic, there is no start-game. Just attach the scanner to your mission pod, polar orbit, BANG, dunnit, now straight off and perform the detail scans on the same mission, possibly even landing and starting to mine, all in one go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith a SCANSat-like mechanic, you\u0027d FIRST send a probe off to scan your target, then \u003Cem\u003Ewhile it\u0027s doing that\u003C/em\u003E, design, build, and launch your detail-scanner/mining-rig/science-lander missions. By the time you get the actual mission launched and on it\u0027s way to the destination, your low-res scan is done. And for the people that just want to send a single mission, time-warp completes the scans in a couple of minutes anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry, RD, but some people would prefer not to have the Insta-scan, no matter how you justify it. Not saying it\u0027s a bad solution, but it\u0027s not for everyone, and it would be awesome if modders could override it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SydKhaos","CreatedById":141865,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T10:14:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow...no one is seeing it....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou dont just attach one scanner and BINGBANGBOOM your done scanning....for you have only done 1/3 the scanning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have been doing it like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDish orbital scan (the insta-scan) gives you clues on basic ore distribution.
