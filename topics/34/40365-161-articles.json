Try either right-clicking the warp drive and stopping charging or timewarp until the exotic matter is full. Both of those options should immediately start you generating MJ and then thermal power and then antimatter. If there isn\u0027t a bug present, I believe what is happening is all the antimatter you are collecting is immediately being burned by the reactor, converted into MJ by the generator, and then the MJ are being consumed by the warp drive to produce Exotic matter (it\u0027s either 1GW or 1TW per exotic matter, can\u0027t remember off the top of my head).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-04T15:58:26Z\u0022 title=\u002212/04/2013 03:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 4, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Eadrom\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deadpangod3","CreatedById":58339,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-04T15:56:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Eadrom\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Eadrom\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI hope it\u0027s not \u00221413482E-547\u0022.
