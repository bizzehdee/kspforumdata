Similiar to the target cam in Lazorsystem, but as a MFD and not as part of the GUI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically a camera that can be moved around like any other camera part through MFD interaction. Just that it locks on to your target as soon as you set it and then tracks it with a stabilized view. A secondary mode could be that you can move the camera to a spot on the ground which creates a virtual target and the cam will track this spot too. Right now in Lazorsystem you have to target a vessel or object to have a real tracking target for the laser and the target cam, so if you target the ground, the laser willjust continue looking in that irection but will not track a particular spot. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomething like this would be awesome, having some functioning recon- or lantirn-pods available.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbrud","CreatedById":92900,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-10T17:17:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello, Mihara!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m trying to reverse-engineer some of the code that Hyomoto used for his MFD, but I\u0027m actually having a hard time understanding C#.
