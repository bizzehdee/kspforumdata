Also, can you include an edited common.cfg with the distances scaled up so that clouds appear when in PQS mode?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther suggestions: for square detail or bump textures, you need to set the x scaling to 2 times the y scaling (otherwise they\u0027ll appear quite stretched). Unless that\u0027s intentional. Or you can just use textures that are already 2:1 rather than square. You also might want to play with the radius values so that, for instance, Kerbin\u0027s clouds aren\u0027t 25km and 50km up. Try 1.003 and 1.004 for Kerbin? That means 20 and 25km roughly, which is a bit better. Any lower and they start clipping the scaled space mesh.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven better, just get used to using the same aspect ratio for all cloud-related textures as you do for the planet textures (i.e. 2:1) and then you can leave scaling at 1:1. Also, and this is something I keep bugging rbray about but s/he still hasn\u0027t done it, you NEED to be using power-of-two textures; Unity _will_ scale non-power-of-two textures, either leading to ugly loss in quality or wasted RAM. That means i.e. 2048x1024, not 640x320 (use 512x256 or 1024x512 instead).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and since KSP converts textures itself anyway to a format that takes more memory than jpg, there\u0027s really no point in not including a losslessly compressed texture (PNG or TGA, though each has issues) or an uncompressed texture (mbm). MBM takes the most space on disk but (apparently) the least in ram, because the TGA loading code is bugged; png loading code has a different bug (it doesn\u0027t take more RAM, but it also doesn\u0027t get mipmaps generated so it flickers when you\u0027re far away). Best bet is probably make PNGs and use the PNG to mbm converter? (Then, obviously, delete the PNGs so there\u0027s only one texture each in the folder, per above).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope that comes across as advice, not criticism; the work you\u0027ve done is very pretty!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SRFirefox","CreatedById":67434,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-14T07:31:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI came across a rather entertaining bug this evening trying to see if I could get something out to Dres-Saturn.

That translates pretty well to this mod. A heat shield alone will only take you down to about 1000 m/s in the very thin atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is also a problem with the way terrain altitudes work in KSP. In real life, all the rovers and lander we\u0027ve sent to Mars have landed below \u0022sea level\u0022 (the average altitude of Mars), where the pressure is higher. But in KSP the 0m altitude is that of the lowest point on the body. The atmospheric pressure of Mars is 0.007 bars at the average altitude, but the KSP Duna/Mars has its pressure set to 0.007 bars at 0m, which is its lowest altitude. One way to fix this is to make the atmospheric pressure at 0m equal to the atmospheric pressure at Mars\u0027s lowest point, which is about 0.012 bars.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince the stock parachutes have their minimum inflating atmospheric pressure at 0.007 bars for the drogue and 0.01 bars for the regular parachute, the parachutes will never work on Duna/Mars as it is now. You can change the values that the parachutes open in the Squad folder to make them able to be opened on Duna/Mars. Or if you set Duna/Mars\u0027s base atmospheric pressure to 0.012 bars you will be able to use the stock parachutes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mounti","CreatedById":28432,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-14T20:01:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDidn\u0027t MSL open it\u0027s parachutes an roughly 450m/s after entering Mars\u0027 atmosphere? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI changed the pressure parameter and I see a glimpse of hope on the horizon.
