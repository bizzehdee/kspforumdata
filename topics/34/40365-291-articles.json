The thrust is terrible - think of it as a really big version of the Ion Drive. What makes it pretty good is when you build a really light vessel relying on beamed microwave power. Someone else carries the heavy reactors so the low thrust is only pushing a lightweight ship. Things change once you unlock the final tech node - then your plasma thrusters can run on \u0022quantum vacuum\u0022 and require NO propellant at all. Just add electricity and you can thrust forever, saving the weight of the fuel and allowing you to do really long burns to cancel out the low thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo that craft above would be a lot better if you just used a Thermal Rocket Nozzle instead (which works fine with just basic fission).

Add a probe core so you can steer while two kerbals are sitting on the science lab doing Science Things and you\u0027ve got a simple ship you can dump into orbit around another planet to generate science for a few years. Attach a UF4 tank to it too so you can reprocess your spent nuclear fuel into more fuel and it\u0027ll run for a few decades.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bonesbro","CreatedById":104036,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-06T04:20:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022lewisd\u0022 data-cite=\u0022lewisd\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m stumped about a problem I\u0027m having with the seismic experiment.\u003Cp\u003EI successfully used it on the Mun, deploying 4 probe landers, one near each pole, and two near the equator, opposite each other. I\u0027m trying to do the same thing on Duna, and whenever I crash my impactor into Duna, I don\u0027t get the message about an impact being recorded (and when I try to collect the data, nothing happens.)

I think I solved it! I renamed the impactor vessel, after it was decoupled from the orbiter.

I have a \u0022Pinto 2 Probe\u0022 in orbit and my 4 \u0022Pinto 2 Probe\u0022 vessels on the surface. When I separate an impactor from the orbiter, it keeps the same name. When I impact it, even though it\u0027s the first impact I\u0027ve done on Duna, it doesn\u0027t get recognized. If I rename it to \u0022Pinto 2 Impactor\u0022 first, it gets recorded fine. I just impacted a 2nd impactor with the same name (after transmitting the science from the original) and it got recorded as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt sounds like maybe multiple impacts without transmitting might not get recognized if the impactors have the same name, and that in addition, they need to be named differently than the vessels with the sensors?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Arrowmaster","CreatedById":57556,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-06T04:34:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022lewisd\u0022 data-cite=\u0022lewisd\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAHA!
