The version that was briefly out, worked great for 10m, previously and now I\u0027m back to editing the config file myself... Anyway, I get the design in the VAB... good, put it on the pad (or EL construct it) and it rezes up normal, then switch away or the game crashes and I come back, and it is completely and utterly glitched out. On the EL construction site, only the lower of the two tanks is glitched, on the launchpad I have just a single tank hovering, all of the decorations and secondary equipment is gone. =\\"},{"CreatedByName":"FreeThinker","CreatedById":117389,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-10T21:48:35Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E All scaletypes use scaleFactors now, max/minScale is obsolete.\n\nCould you please give some example how to use the new features.\n\nI like to create a high grained freescale part, how to do it?"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaalidas","CreatedById":111158,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-10T22:32:32Z","Content":"One question: by \u0022max/minScale is obsolete\u0022 do you mean that it is now simply not necessary or that it is now not even functional?
