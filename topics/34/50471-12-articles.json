I\u0027m thinking we should try out an 8x4 Earth heightmap for kicks, see how that goes. If we\u0027re replacing, might as well go whole hog. But you\u0027re right, it\u0027s a drop in the bucket. We\u0027d get 0.043 degree (~5km) per pixel resolution at the equator. I wonder if there\u0027s any way to use the scatter system for Munar craters to generate procedural detail on Kerbin?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell then we\u0027ll need to mod PQSMod (lol) so that it would work with texture patches instead of whole thing. But then there is a problem of memory - these textures aren\u0027t gonna be small. To get our KEarth to Kerbin resolution, well need to increase resolution by factor of 11, which will increase total texture size by factor of 11^2 (area is proportional to radius squared)...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich basically means that we will have to implement paging mechanism for heightmaps and textures since they simply won\u0027t fit into process memory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy editing KSP\u0027s config file I\u0027ve made engine to render planet beyond max level 10 (I\u0027ve made it to lvl 11, but theoretically we can go even further).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother problem of PQS system is that it generates geometry in RAM using CPU, which could become a bottleneck (although as far as I understand Unity allows initializing its\u0027 objects in other threads, so moving init code out into separate thread could possibly alleviate the issue). In my engine for Orbiter (and another space sim engine I\u0027m working on now in a background) I was generating all that stuff on GPU right within rendering pass - via vertex shader for initial vertices setup, then tessellation(for DX11) or Geometry shaders(for DX10) for subdivision. PQSMod components even do bilinear filtering on CPU (while in GPU there is hardware dedicated for that, so there you get it essentially for free).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBottom line - this is not easy nor simple, but it could be done. And whoever manages to do that will probably end up hired by Squad since this mechanics would be useful for stock game as well \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NathanKell\u0022 data-cite=\u0022NathanKell\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EZRM...heh, life. :]\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe have complete access to Unity runtime, which basically means we can do just about anything that Unity itself can do (and as such, Squad devs can do).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing - you\u0027ve probably noticed that speed indication doesn\u0027t automatically switch to orbit mode as you do ascent.

The shaders are all written in Cg, but the build of Unity used by KSP uses an oldish Cg version, and it only renders under DX9 on Windows and OpenGL 3.x on other platforms, so don\u0027t expect anything like tesselation or compute shaders any time soon. The plugin also works as a manager for shader resources. I will release it once the whole KMS project is ready. BTW I also started work on a mod designed to allow parts to attach via multiple points to different objects based on proximity to their attachment nodes, so that you can make things in the VAB like 3 point connections on the Space Shuttle, or space stations with loops.

Basically, using the legacy (exponential) atmosphere model, a planet\u0027s atmospheric density is clamped to 0 when the exponential calculation (as shown on the wiki) falls below 0.00001. That means, with a scale height of 7.5km, it hits zero at approximately 104km. I\u0027m currently trying to switch the atmosphere model over to the new pressureCurve system, which will allow a quite-close copy of Earth\u0027s atmosphere. However, when density \u0026gt; 0, then time acceleration is disabled (and the game thinks of you as not in space). So it makes sense to formally cut it off at some point. Ferram suggest 135km.
