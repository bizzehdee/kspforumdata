I\u0027m firing up New Horizons and a few small mods (mostly things like KER, MJ, and Tweakscale) in OpenGL at about 2.2GB of memory at the menu, which is pretty impressive. This gives me good hope that a mix of planet packs might work - as long as I don\u0027t get too heavy on the parts mods.\n\nThe real question is whether there\u0027s room for Near Future, or Interstellar, as well, because those would really lend themselves to a game where there\u0027s more planets and much bigger distances between them (and more science points to farm)... something I shall have to try out later ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"KillAshley","CreatedById":128696,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T15:51:09Z","Content":"Trust me Eddie, near future is on my must-have list, I can\u0027t play without it anymore!

I\u0027ve been playing around with this just about all day and it seems the planet Titanus is a little buggy. \n\nWhen I approach, it\u0027s almost as if the atmosphere jumps in all of a sudden and the sudden dramatic increase in pressure tears my ship apart. (My poor Kerbals, well we just won\u0027t mention them to the others.) I get the sense it\u0027s suppose to have some extreme pressure I was looking foreword to the challenge. \n\nI did manage to make it to the ground on 3 attempts in one piece and right around 8,000km above sea level I noticeably hit an \u0022invisible wall\u0022 actually stopping my lateral movement altogether even though my NavBall showed I was still moving across the ground. Right after I made landfall I violently tipped over every time and exploded, the debris from the ship would go careening off into space at warp speeds. \n\nThis all only seems to be a problem on Titanus, the rest of the planets seem to other them minor glitches like terrain shifting be land-able at least. Hope this helps. I\u0027m sure you don\u0027t have time to test everything, on every planet, every patch.\n\nI\u0027m running the game in 64-bit with about 5-6 rather large mods(MKS/OKS, Karbonite, KIS, etc.)The game uses quite a bit of memory around 6-7GB but I have not had any crashes all day. other then when I slam in to Astrid, damn thin atmosphere. I know you said your not testing x64 but thought I\u0027d mention.\n\n750\u002B parts 6 individual pieces, still getting a respectable 25 fps. \n\n![3505970A3BEA744EA9C7A623327D341B567E0B68](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/717540674512187172/3505970A3BEA744EA9C7A623327D341B567E0B68/)\n\nAll in all the mod is pretty awesome, best I\u0027ve come across for adding planets. I\u0027ve put (not proud) 1,700\u002B hours into KSP and this is exactly what the game needed for more of a challenge, \n\nNow I have to go figure out how I am gunna get Jeb home from all the way over their where you moved minmus.

I needed that new challenge, especially for remotetech satellites (i look forward to a proper playthrough now it\u0027s updated). There\u0027s still a lot of features I\u0027m still toying with before i bring it in though...\n\nI\u0027ll have another peek at atmospheres, the \u0027invisible wall\u0027 you mentioned was the reason for the 1.4.1 update which i hoped fixed it, seems i might still need tweaking.

I think it would add a great challenge to the game figuring out when to launch to rendezvous. \n\nNot totally sure how you\u0027d handle landed craft on them while they were elsewhere in the galaxy, maybe just remove the ships from Tracking station till the time is right?

I just don\u0027t know of any way to actually hide bodies until certain years, AFAIK all bodies show up no matter what....I\u0027ll start asking around and see if theres a way.
