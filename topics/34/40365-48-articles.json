So I went in, figured out the equations used in the Mod, and reverse engineered a new set of part values. I haven\u0027t played with the plasma engines, just the thermal- i don\u0027t think it will mess them up balance-wise, as I believe they were ok (it will change the thrust to weight ratios somewhat, but in a useable way, IMO).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn any case, if you change the part file parameters as listed in the following chart, you will get ISP, Thrust, and T/W Ratios as per the chart. Note that the values fall directly in line with the LV-N (ISP is better per the mod, but I made the weight slightly higher to compensate):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E............waste.heat.....Core.Temp.......Thermal.Power....Thrust...........ISP...........Reac.Mass.......Jet.Mass.....Total.Mass.......T/M.R\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EN625........112.50.........2900.00..........20.00............4.46............914.91........0.225...........0.001........0.226............19.72\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EN625U.......112.50.........26100.00.........60.00............4.46............2744.73.......0.225...........0.001........0.226............19.72\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EN1250.......2500.00........2900.00..........350.00...........77.99...........914.91........3.00............0.00.........3.00.............25.99\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EN1250U......2500.00........26100.00.........1050.00..........77.99...........2744.73.......3.00............0.00.........3.00.............25.99\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EN2500.......30000.00.......2900.00..........750.00...........167.13..........914.91........6.00............0.00.........6.00.............27.85\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EN2500U......30000.00.......26100.00.........2250.00..........167.13..........2744.73.......6.00............0.00.........6.00.............27.85\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EN3500.......150000.00......2900.00..........1600.00..........356.54..........914.91........12.00...........0.00.........12.00............29.71\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EN3500U......150000.00......26100.00.........4800.00..........356.54..........2744.73.......12.00...........0.00.........12.00............29.71\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA1250.......500000.00......10000.00.........5000.00..........600.00..........1698.95.......2.00............0.00.........2.00.............299.85\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA1250U......500000.00......1200000.00.......55000.00.........602.49..........18611.03......2.00............0.00.........2.00.............301.10\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA2500.......4000000.00.....10000.00.........18000.00.........2160.00.........1698.95.......6.00............0.00.........6.00.............359.94\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA2500U......4000000.00.....1200000.00.......198000.00........2168.98.........18611.03......6.00............0.00.........6.00.............361.44\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA3500.......13500000.00....10000.00.........40000.00.........4800.00.........1698.95.......12.00...........0.00.........12.00............399.97\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA3500U......13500000.00....1200000.00.......440000.00........4819.96.........18611.03......12.00...........0.00.........12.00............401.63\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efor comparison\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELV-N 60.00 800.00 2.25 26.67\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust edit your parts (save it somewhere so you can copy over updates) and you will have baseline parts that are equivalent to Stock, and all the functionality of the mod.
