It certainly supports KW. There\u0027s two main reasons to use MFS with RSS: first, it gives you realistic mass ratios and performance; for example, KSP engines mass about 3-4x what they should, and tanks somewhere between double and 10x what they should for how much fuel they hold. Second, it gives you specific impulse in line with reality. Kerosene-Liquid Oxygen is the \u0022standard\u0022 fuel, as in real life, and has Isp on the order of 340 seconds (more for vacuum-optimized closed-cycle engines); KSP generally has vacuum (and ESPECIALLY) sea level Isp too high. It alos, however, lets you use hydrogen-LOx engines, with realistic Isps (order of 450 seconds vacuum), which makes a big difference. Though note that since hydrogen is very very very not dense, you\u0027ll need BIG tanks full of the stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sternface","CreatedById":83299,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-16T19:05:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Starwaster\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Starwaster\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou mean negative right?\u003Cp\u003EEither way I think I know what the problem is with them.

There was also the issue where my first forays into heating either resulted in rockets overheating 5 seconds after liftoff or being able to survive anything. I can look into adding what Deadly Reentry does to FAR, but I would expect somewhat bad things to happen if I did that. Before that I want to actually model the differing compositions of atmospheres (currently FAR assumes everywhere is 78% N2, 21% O2, 1% other).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sternface","CreatedById":83299,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-16T19:28:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBTW, what DR Continued heat modifier do you all use?
