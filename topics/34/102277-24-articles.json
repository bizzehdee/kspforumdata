For some reason, if you have anything else but the regular hold it disables the rotation with the orbit. This is most likely so that you can line yourself up with a maneuver node (which is the only node that really moves as you rotate around a planet) and then still be lined up with it when you come out of warp.\n\nHowever, don\u0027t be fooled. Those holds merely disable the rotation with the planet, and will not stop the ship from spinning. I have found this out the hard way as I\u0027ve tried to rotate my massive station to line up the right way and then time warp only to realize that it kept going.\n\nIt seems that the momentum override does nothing, as whenever I\u0027ve tried to stop something rotating by typing in 0 RPM or 1 RPM or any other number, it continues moving.  This has been extremely frustrating as sometimes when constructing things in orbit they will break loose of the grip of the arm I\u0027m moving them with, tumbling away from the station.  No matter what I try to do, I cannot slow their rotation to grab hold of them with a tug. \n\nSpoiler\n\n![screenshot301.png?width=717\u0026height=449](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/306437807650635780/531602694109134851/screenshot301.png?width=717\u0026height=449)\n\nIn this instance, a solar panel truss got loose when I was attempting to remove it from a shuttle\u0027s bay with the aptly named \u0022Krakenarm\u0022 canadarm analog.
