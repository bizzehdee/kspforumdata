Specifically, rule 3 says that a part with crossfeed disabled will return an empty list of parts (but will provide fuel via fuel lines coming into it by rule 2). If your nosecones do actually provide fuel when set to crossfeed=false then this rule must be wrong in some way (not surprising this has been missed if no stock parts are set up like this). It sounds like some more experiments will need to be done with modified parts that contain fuel but have crossfeed disabled...\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I guess that having a fuel tank with crossfeed disabled doesn\u0027t really make a lot of sense so it probably does make sense for your parts to be changed...\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKasuha has now updated his rules to correctly account for fuel tanks with crossfeed disabled and I have implemented the required changes in KER.

When creating a craft from scratch, using say a Procedural Part Fuel Tank of servicemodule type things work just fine. However, for example, when using a craft from parts from say one of my realism packs, which set default tank amounts, like the Apollo command module. The type is ServiceModule, IF a default tank amount is present, it overrides EVERYTHING from the TANK_DEFINITION, including utilization, pressurization, boil off, the whole enchilada. Well, if I don\u0027t declare what utilization is then it defaults to 1, not what is in the TANK_DEFINITION section, which is 100. Same goes for pressurization, I didn\u0027t declare it to be pressurized, so instead of taking it from the TANK_DEFINITION, and pressurizing the tank, it doesn\u0027t. Leads to some pretty funky behavior, and one must remove all tanks and start over, and even then those values like utilization are still going to be 1 instead of the 100 that it should be. I personally never got far enough ahead to actually fly one and see what logs say, perhaps that is what I need to do today.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"amo28","CreatedById":82041,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-09T15:49:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the logs, fellas. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7pmxVerCUnWMUJka243NFJZbEE/edit?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ELink\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENever knew about the player.log, Starwaster.
