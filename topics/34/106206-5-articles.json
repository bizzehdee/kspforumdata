Let me show you how to make a simple MM config that preserves the current launch site list while adding a new one.\nUsing the previously posted NK launch site:\n\n    @KSCSWITCHER:AFTER[RealSolarSystem]{\t@LaunchSites\t{\t\tSite\t\t{\t\t\tname = kp_musudanri\t\t\tdisplayName = KP - Musudan-ri\t\t\tdescription = The Tonghae Satellite Launching Ground, also known as Musudan-ri, is a rocket launching site in North Korea.\t\t\tPQSCity\t\t\t{\t\t\t\tKEYname = KSC\t\t\t\tlatitude = 40.85\t\t\t\tlongitude = 129.66667\t\t\t\trepositionRadiusOffset = 1126\t\t\t\trepositionToSphereSurface = false\t\t\t\tlodvisibleRangeMult = 6\t\t\t}\t\t\tPQSMod_MapDecalTangent\t\t\t{\t\t\t\tradius = 20000\t\t\t\theightMapDeformity = 80\t\t\t\tabsoluteOffset = 1073\t\t\t\tabsolute = true\t\t\t\tlatitude = 40.85\t\t\t\tlongitude = 129.66667\t\t\t}\t\t}    }}\n\nIt is VERY IMPORTANT to add the \u0022:AFTER[RealSolarSystem]\u0022 line to your new config because Real Solar System stomps the launch sites config file to implement its own. This is why your launch site did not load. If using RSS, I highly recommend adding your own sites in a \u0022@KSCSWITCHER:AFTER[RealSolarSystem]\u0022 node within your own personal script, that way it will always be available to you.\n\nIf you are NOT using RSS, and want to stomp the launch site list to implement your own, use the following template and add Site nodes are desired:\n\n    @KSCSWITCHER{\t@LaunchSites\t{\t\t!Site,* {}\t\tSite\t\t{\t\t\t...\t\t}    }}\n\nYou may also want to change the DefaultSite to one of your new sites.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m not comfortable releasing the file without Cydonian Monk\u0027s and regex\u0027s permissions, and really it should be a modulemanager config, I just can\u0027t be bothered to look up all the syntax right now. But if anybody wants it and PMs me, I\u0027ll happily send it your way.\n\nFeel free to release whatever changes to my code/configs you want pursuant to the license.\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nOkay, so, I\u0027ve been away, neglecting all sorts of things. There are a few reasons why, namely having house guests for two weeks, general burn-out, it being summer, moving to a new team at work (and learning a new programming language, always a recipe for \u0022I don\u0027t want to look at code at home\u0022), and going through the motions of buying a house. Enough about me.\n\nKSCSwitcher has been updated to work with Kopernicus; there was an issue with the rebuilt target list still saying \u0022Kerbin\u0022 when \u0022Earth\u0022 was targeted, so the draw routine never thought the homeworld was highlighted. I have worked around that and also implemented a few minor changes that might help performance, if there were any problem in the Tracking Station from KSCSwitcher to begin with.\n\nI am yanking Aero Arrows because the hotkey is more convenient and doesn\u0027t clutter the list. Less things for me to update, too. I am considering yanking Thermal Helper, although you still have to go through the debug menu to get the detailed information, which I find handy, so I think I\u0027ll keep it.\n\nI am also yanking PID Tuner because I have never really had a love for it and it seems that crzyrndm has a PID plugin that is much better, although I haven\u0027t tried it. Contact me if you want the source for whatever (pursuant to the license).\n\nI am in the process of updating the remaining mods to 1.0.4 for CKAN. That should be done pretty soon today.

This would also make it a bit easier for people to add launch sites via ModuleManager plus I don\u0027t get blamed when something looks like crap because I really don\u0027t want to maintain launch sites.\nAlso, I made a change to Kerbal Renamer to support multiple \u0022cultures\u0022.
