It\u0027ll work fine in 1.7.1 with Making History, but hold off on using Breaking Ground with it.\n\nEdit: The problem this has with Breaking Ground is that the new ones are aimed at trickling science over time and this mod by default will give you the whole deal in one go, which is a bit over the top much.
