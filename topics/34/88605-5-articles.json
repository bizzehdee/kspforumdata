So I have a new module derived from MKSModule... and I need a little help from RoverDude to make MKSModule\u0027s GetEfficiencyRate to be a virtual function. That\u0027s the smallest change I could request from MKS/OKS and still do what I need to do in MCM. I do have a pull request pending. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Anyway, I hope to have the Homestead done later this coming week.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NihilRex","CreatedById":130956,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-29T02:47:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey Angel-125, just a note, the EPL costs of your Modules\u002BBase tends to be a bit lower than the equivalent MKS module\u002Bbase.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I have no clue how EPL costs are calculated, I can\u0027t guess as to why this is so.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"helaeon","CreatedById":101767,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-30T11:05:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESeems the IMEM doesn\u0027t want to switch between Workspace and Livingspace.
