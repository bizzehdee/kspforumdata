However, Jool is going to be problematic for you with or without Deadly Reentry. That\u0027s been a known issue since KSP 1.0 came out and the problem is mainly due to the fact its atmospheric density is the same as Kerbin\u0027s and coupled with high speeds and high pressure (if you make it in to any appreciable depth) ensures that you\u0027re going to have a very bad day.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s something that (I think) is getting fixed in 1.0.5 along with the other thermodynamics. You can also fix it by installing Real Heat, which makes Jool more like Jupiter, Duna more like Mars and Eve more like Venus. (though not nearly as much pressure)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
