Preferably a dedicated Textures folders the way Skyrim and pretty much any Mod friendly game does it. This helps the issue of having to repeat the same texture on assets that share it. As it is right now (I\u0027ve never seen an engine do such an inefficient and absurd method) each part must have its own Internals folder, and even if the same texture is shared, a copy of that texture must be in that internals folder, and a copy of that texture gets loaded into memory (I can\u0027t confirm that). That is absolutely absurd.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Texture and Asset memory management. Folks are already cutting parts and mods off. An argument could have made that all the Phases in the KSOS could have been separate. But guess what? The savings you would have received by having it separate wasn\u0027t that much since all the parts shared the same textures. However, because of the way that KSP is currently configured, you would have had to \u003Cem\u003Ere-download and install all textures used by the other phases shared by each other anyhow\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Internals should be treated like any other object. Allow us to specify directly where the Internal geometry\u0027s textures are located.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-A workaround for texture lookup could be a Unity KSP export tool that allows the modder to designate specifically the location of an object\u0027s textures. The asset will always look in those folders first and then check the default folders if it doesn\u0027t find its texture. Alternatively, KSP should use a Textures folder with a part subdirectory. Modders place textures here and point to them in their exporter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the end these suggestions help everyone:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Squad wins because it means more quality mods out there. It makes their own asset scalability and production cheaper and efficient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-KSP owners can have more mods installed in a game lacking content.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Modders have an easier time getting their mods to work on a variety of systems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have zero interest on further phases. That includes Phase III which includes the larger 2.5meter KSO, why? Because it shared assets from the first KSO and the other phases. Unfortunately that would mean having copies of the largest files (such as the cockpit textures) inside the internals folder of the Super 25. Same goes for the moon lander and pretty much any other IVA\u0027ed object I create. And as you all know, my goal is primarily IVA\u0027ed spacecraft and spacecraft components.

This current method makes it much faster to do all that (a mater of days instead of weeks) and when Nazari gets it to put it in game all he has to do is assign texture, do the plugins, and export.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Had the KSO been separate props, the size of the installation would have ballooned to near double the size. By having a single texture we can compress that (using the texture compression mod) or do what ever. Individual prop textures would have actually added up to much larger than a single 2048x2048 (keep in mind that what makes the large one look good with some loss of visual clarity are the shadows baked in).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-13T22:36:32Z\u0022 title=\u002203/13/2014 10:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 13, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by helldiver\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptRobau","CreatedById":41695,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-13T22:28:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Virtualgenius\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Virtualgenius\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ECan we throw in a complete lack of windows 64bit client and the fact that all parts have to be preloaded into memory first rather than accessing when needed seeing as I have been *****ing about this for a year\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe lack of a 64-bit client has to do with Unity itself not having a stable 64-bit Windows client and has nothing to with Squad.
