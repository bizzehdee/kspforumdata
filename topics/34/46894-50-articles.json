After switching many times between VAB and Launchpad, the game crashed with no Crashnotes, several times. I haven\u0027t used any KW parts on my ships. Even switching between ships in space and back to KSC made the game crash after a few minutes. After removing the mod, KSP is fine, for 5 hours now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t want to blame the mod here, just report my troubles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould there be a conflict between KSP 64bit and some configs of KW? Or could it be a game bug if you have many parts/items installed?
