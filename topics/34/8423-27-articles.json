I was unaware your intentions were to be exact replica \u0022like\u0022 or I wouldn\u0027t have asked the question. No problem at all with your intended plan for your shuttle Mods. I was just thinking for uses other than what was originally intended, like using it as a \u0022multi-purpose\u0022 deep space craft. I have built many ssto\u0027s, but I just love the look of the models you guys create. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThx for the reply, will be looking forward to the release.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs always man, thx for doing all this work for us \u0022uneducated in the ways of game creation\u0022 space enthusiasts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDren\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-22T20:57:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, this is a very accurate model, and I don\u0027t have any intentions to let it get \u0022kerbalized\u0022.

I know this would take serious changes so I don\u0027t know if this is out of line to request. One of the features of the Buran that I enjoy so much is the shuttles independent ability to use its main engines for orbital transfer, re-entry exc. With your current build, the engines are set in such a way that this is completely impossible. I know that is the purpose of the secondary engines, but it just doesn\u0027t seem to feel right. If its possible it would be great to see it work in the same manner as the buran, or many of the other shuttle Mods that have been released over the years. I know its a bit much to request such a thing, but I think the community would enjoy this over the long run a bit more. \u003Cp\u003Ebtw: Requesting how to handle bug reports was a bit lame, I know better due to the countless requests on \u0022how do I report bug issues\u0022.... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_lipssealed.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sealed:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThx for the build though, it is an impressive model.
