In game programming, quaternions can often deviate from that property because floating-point errors add up after successive operations. Regularly renormalizing them solves the problem, but it\u0027s additional computation time so it\u0027s rare that quaternions are \u003Cem\u003Eautomatically\u003C/em\u003E normalized. I\u0027m not certain that\u0027s what\u0027s happening here, but there\u0027s definitely some kind of drift associated with high rotation speeds.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NoMrBond","CreatedById":69263,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-13T04:03:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWould the accumulation of those floating point errors be a possible explanation for why some peoples MSI creations spontaneously explode after a minute or so of continuous operation?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-13T04:31:46Z\u0022 title=\u002209/13/2013 04:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 13, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by NoMrBond\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Majiir","CreatedById":7550,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-13T04:15:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NoMrBond\u0022 data-cite=\u0022NoMrBond\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWould the accumulation of those floating point errors be a possible explanation for some peoples MSI creations spontaneously explode after a minute or so of continuous operation?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbsolutely.
