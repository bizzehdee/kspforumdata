The answer is No. This is my design vision. There are plenty of examples on this thread and others of players using it as I designed it. It\u0027s a Kerbal designed shuttle. Not a copy of NASA or Buran shuttles or a shuttle built by large 5\u00278\u0022\u002B humans. As such it is Chibi, and designed for cargo less than 1.5m. Suffice to say the KSO Super 25 will have the same love and care the KSO had and may better suit your needs if you want that size of a cargo bay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Can you remove parts or separate them from the SST or the KSO?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo. A lot of them use complicated animations or are set up in a way that make it difficult to simply set up a node.
