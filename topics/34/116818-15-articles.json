I know everyone is eager to get a version that works with KSP 1.2! I still have a lot of work to do IRL but since Christmas is coming up I do have some more free time!\n\nSo a note on progress!\n\n1.6.0 is still on the way, still have to get round to totally rebuilding N-Body... and a tonne of other things... so in the mean time I have decided to work on a 1.5.3 patch just to make everything compatible with the new KSP. That being said I do not know when I will have this finished, or if there will be any new shiny features but I will try and keep you all updated!\n\nOne big issue is the changes to the Orbit Driver method in the new version, this \u0027cleanup\u0027 has made a great deal of errors, this has hampered pretty much everything to do with the Mascon code and my future N-Body code, so I will have to write a new function for this, derived from the other orbital elements... possibly causing slightly more lag for the next version... especially since as far as I remember the mean anomaly function in question requires use of the Newton Raphson method over many iterations just to get an accurate value! Other than this I should be able to release a test version asap!\n\nIf anyone wants to take a crack at the code before I can get a chance please do check out the Github, raise an issue and it will speed things up!\n\nKindest Regards!\n\nWhitecat106 ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"Drew Kerman","CreatedById":103177,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-08T03:41:33Z","Content":"That n-body stuff is really making things difficult it sounds like.

I really need to have a robust mission planner.\n\nSecond is a bit more personal but tied to the first, in that if KSPTOT can\u0027t include decay, my [Flight Tracker](http://www.kerbalspace.agency/Tracker/craft.asp?db=meeny) can\u0027t handle it either since it\u0027s based of KSPTOT orbital calculations and therefore the assumption that there is no decay in KSP\n\nThe mod is doing a great job now of modeling decay, and Whitecat106 wants to make it even more realistic with n-body perturbation, so I highly doubt he\u0027d want to go backwards as well and work out a very simple and mainly static model that approximates decay.
