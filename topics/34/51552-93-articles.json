I was looking for a button on the flight computer\u0027s interface to send other commands, I didn\u0027t realize that once you set the delay it applied to action groups and other commands. That means you have to setup action groups to activate or toggle the dish/antenna. I\u0027ve been setting up one just to activate the omni antenna because it\u0027s sometimes hard to find and deploy manually with the mouse and I don\u0027t want to forget to do it before getting too far away from the KSC.

The way it works now, when I send a command, it goes into the queue immediately and begins counting down the delay set. If I need to set multiple commands to go off in a specific order at specific times, I\u0027d like to set all of that up with the timings, be able to double check it, then transmit the command queue to the craft. It can be done now, but once the first command is set, you\u0027re racing the clock to get the rest of them plugged in, and constantly having to adjust the delay time to account for the time already counted down.

I was looking for a button on the flight computer\u0027s interface to send other commands, I didn\u0027t realize that once you set the delay it applied to action groups and other commands. That means you have to setup action groups to activate or toggle the dish/antenna. I\u0027ve been setting up one just to activate the omni antenna because it\u0027s sometimes hard to find and deploy manually with the mouse and I don\u0027t want to forget to do it before getting too far away from the KSC. I\u0027ve been setting it to only activate so I don\u0027t accidentally press it again and turn off the antenna losing control of the craft. I just tried to do it without action groups and don\u0027t think it can be done. In order to queue up an activate, the antenna or dish has to be deactivated first, because when you right click on it, the only option is deactivate.\u003Cp\u003EThis brings me back to my other feature request, to be able to set up the command queue before sending it.
