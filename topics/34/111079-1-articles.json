It unlocks all components so that you can explore the Kerbin system unhindered. The idea is to use science points as a scorekeeping device. Since the points do not have to be spent, you can track your progress solely from the perspective of exploration. \n\nEssentially this is a standard science game, I have a custom difficulty setting.
