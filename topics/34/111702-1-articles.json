If set to Clamshell, all vertical groups of the panel will be merged together when jettisoned\n\nI haven\u0027t included any tweakable options since I\u0027ve seen at least two other mods that already add that. Those will work just fine with this plugin.\n\n[Download from KerbalStuff](https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/878/Stock%20Clamshell%20Fairings)\n\n[Download from BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/xEvilReeperx/ksp_stockclamshellfairings/downloads/KSP-1.0.x-StockClamshellFairings-v1.0.zip)\n\nLicense: MIT\n\nSource: [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/xEvilReeperx/ksp_stockclamshellfairings/src)\n\nDonations are always welcome!\n\n[![btn_donate_LG.gif](https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_donate_LG.gif)](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations\u0026business=MXAVN7V4QFHJQ\u0026lc=US\u0026item_name=ScienceAlert\u0026currency_code=USD\u0026bn=PP-DonationsBF%3Abtn_donateCC_LG.gif%3ANonHosted)\n\n**Changelog:**\n\n**1.0 (June 1)**\n\n- Initial release\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-26T22:26:56Z\u0022 title=\u002206/26/2015 10:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by xEvilReeperx**"},{"CreatedByName":"ZentroCatson","CreatedById":143939,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T05:49:32Z","Content":"That\u0027s brillant!

You\u0027d still have to \u0022stage\u0022 to be able to activate engines and you\u0027d lose the aerodynamic advantage of the fairing the moment it\u0027s staged but if that\u0027s acceptable, I could investigate"},{"CreatedByName":"MetalChris","CreatedById":143760,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T14:28:31Z","Content":"Thank you for this awesome mod!
