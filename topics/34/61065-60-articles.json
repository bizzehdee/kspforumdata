I had chosen \u0022always\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut you are right. There were some silent changes. Registering for an event on awake when the AppLauncher is ready to install the button was not working for FF anymore. I think because FF awakens multiple times (it\u0027s on my todo list to change this) and the AppLauncher is already ready then. So my workaround was to check if its ready, just install the callback if its not and install the button directly otherwise. Works. Correct way to do this? I dunno.

Anyone else have this bug? Anyone know what is going on?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E***Update***\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just loaded up my game again and the last Kerbal I used (Valentina) lost the mission count as well.... now Only Jeb is marked as \u00221 Missions\u0022.

I do not plan to change this. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETop priority on my list is solving the lost ribbons and lost mission stats bugs. I think both are completely independent. The lost ribbon bug were introduced by using the persistent file for storing the ribbon data. Because lost ribbons are eays to detect (all ribbons were gone), the mission stats problem is of more importance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut still no idea here what could cause this. Maybe the way FF starts up (it starts again each scene change) has something todo with this. Unfortunately it is not that easy to change. I will need a few hours without work or other distractions in between to change this or to try it at least. I was never very satisfied with the current implentation of this part in FF. But prior to 0.90 all attempts to change this failed. In S.A.V.E I have tried a different approach succesfully. It starts and awakens just once.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFF is using some singletons to provide access to some kind of global data. Older versions of FF were not really thread safe in using them (but I don\u0027t think they need to). I have changed this a while ago, but well... no luck. Bug is still reported. It\u0027s very frustrating for me, because I have never ever seen it myself. Log outputs to check if the singletons were created multiple times were added, but again no luck. All logs are clean so far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI got a report of other things vanishing not related to FF in career mode. I\u0027m not playing in career often. Maybe the bug in FF is related to a strange bug in KSP that happens sometimes just in career mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe strange aspect is: I\u0027m doing quite a few strange things in my tests. I\u0027m using HyperEdit, changing orbits on the fly, quicksave, quickload, save, load, kill KSP, restart KSP, ... all this with only very few other mods (HyperEdit, KSP-AVC - nothing else most times). And there are no problems. But in a regular game (maybe because KSP runs for a while?) the bug seems to occur infrequently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry guys, but at this point I just need more information. We need a pattern, a hint in the log or a way to reproduce this bug at least more often. Or we will have to wait until I will face it myself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022UAL002\u0022 data-cite=\u0022UAL002\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ECould it be an issue with other mods.
