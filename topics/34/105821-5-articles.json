There are other features in RPM. Go take a look at some of Bobcat\u0027s mods (well, if they could be used in KSP 1.0.x), or the ALCOR landing pod, since that was updated a couple days ago. There is a lot in RPM, but it was originally written to be a toolkit for IVA creators. The IVAs that ship with it were intended to be hors d\u0027oeuvres, not the main course.
