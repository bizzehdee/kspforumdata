I went in and adjusted my nvidia graphics settings. Turned on triple buffering, Turned on LOD, and set anisotropic filtering to 2x. Ran through several ships in orbit, a couple launches, and the white glob is gone, hopefully for good. Anyway, not much around on how to adjust nvidia settings for KSP. Lots of experimenting.

Most mods with only parts shouldn\u0027t effect Kethane as they are mearly models, skins, and configs, but beware of mods with plugins.
