But not 2.1x, 3x, 4x, 1.7x, etc. Any other scale factor tended to do very weird things, and it didn\u0027t *seem* to be an issue with the tweakscale cfgs themselves that I wrote. Possibly something in the way tweakscale does exponents, or... something, but the same thing happens when explicitly defining masses/movement rates/whatever via TWEAKSCALEEXPONENTS{}.
