To keep you out trouble\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Contracts work very similar to finePrint now. If your doing contracts and switch vessels any green check marked objectives will be reset. This is to stop other vessels from completing objectives and contracts you don\u0027t want them to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Every single contract except repair contracts need to be done with a brand new vessel launched after you accepted the contract. Older vessels are no longer able to do contracts over and over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. In reality you should only do 1 contract at a time. Most mission controller contracts are very short and this should not be an issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. When doing civilian orbital contracts or contracts in general that have many objectives phases, it\u0027s important not to switch vessels in game while doing the last landing phase. If you do then your green checked objectives will reset and since you are no longer within the first objective parameters they won\u0027t go back to green when you go back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Number 4 is really only an issue for civilian contracts, and usually only the orbit contract. All other contracts either use orbit objective which can\u0027t be reset. Or docking and landing which also can\u0027t be reset when switching vessels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6.

You are completely free to exit flight scene during all these contracts at any time and your green check marks won\u0027t reset. They only reset when you use the switch vessel while in game.

Needless to say, I undocked it and completed the next skylab mission as instructed but MC didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t recognize my skylab. I went though the instructions to reset the skylab ID but it didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t work, I then tried to edit the config file but that didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t work either. I ended up going to the debug menu and doing exactly what Apollo13 did. Like he says, it aint cheating if you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve done it. I had to do the same thing for every skylab mission thereafter.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FlyMeToTheMinmus","CreatedById":133119,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-07T19:18:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022malkuth\u0022 data-cite=\u0022malkuth\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI have a debug feature that you can use to set any craft for the skylab vessel. Open up the debug menu (Has to be opened in settings) keep the window open (don\u0027t close it) go to the vessel you want to be the Skylab vessel (the window will disapear but come back when your in flight mode) and when you are in control of the vessel select the Choose as Skylab option button in debug menu..
