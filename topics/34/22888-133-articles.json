What does matter is how much RAM it takes up when loaded into KSP, which can be very different from the hard drive size. The reason that the SQUAD folder takes up so much space on the hard drive is that they use .mbm\u0027s for their textures, where FASA uses .tga\u0027s. .tga\u0027s are much smaller than .mbm\u0027s. However, I found out that the texture of the S-II stage can easily be reduced to 1024*1024 with no visible loss in quality in-game. This will free up 3 MB of RAM (less if ATM is used) with no noticeable consequences. I have reduced its texture to 1024 AND I am playing with half res textures, so it\u0027s equivalent to 512*512 on full res. So you can safely reduce its texture to 1024 without compromising texture quality.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"frizzank","CreatedById":57210,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-13T23:48:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy point was that I am sharing several textures between parts that give me some savings and efficiency at a really high quality level.
