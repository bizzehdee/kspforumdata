The tricky thing is the definition of \u0022as needed.\u0022 Who\u0026#39;s to say exactly what\u0026#39;s \u0022necessary,\u0022 here? Suppose there\u0026#39;s a part somewhere that generates heat, and the hotter it gets, the less efficient it is, so you want to keep it reasonably cool. But the exact efficiency curve as a function of temperature can depend on the part. So yes, you can spend electricity in your radiator to cool it down... but who\u0026#39;s to decide where the exact cut-off should be?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe more I cool it down, the more electricity I have to spend. There\u0026#39;s a tradeoff. And what the \u0022right\u0022 tradeoff is depends on the player: my ship design (e.g. do I have lots of electrical power generation to spare, or is it a precious resource that I have to dole out stingily?), my desired behavior (how much inefficiency of the hot part am I willing to tolerate?) and so forth. How much electricity am I willing to spend to accomplish a given amount of improved part efficiency? There\u0026#39;s no way for the mod to know that.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo I figured to [URL=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle\u0022]KISS[/URL] it and just make it a simple on/off switch that the player can toggle. This leaves the decision up to the player, makes the experience more consistent (it\u0026#39;s essentially what the folding radiator panels are doing already) and gives the player something to do.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThere\u0026#39;s also a philosophical issue at play here: I know that KSP play-style philosophy varies a lot-- some folks like lots of automation (KER, MechJeb), some folks like very minimal automation and doing everything themselves. I\u0026#39;m very much in the latter camp. So I prefer to write a mod that doesn\u0026#39;t actually do anything [I][U]for[/U][/I] you, it just gives you a choice about what you [I][U]can[/U][/I] do and lets the player take more action. \u0022Turn things on and off to manage ship behavior\u0022 is the sort of thing that I know seems like boring, tedious make-work to some people... but for me it\u0026#39;s actually a big part of the fun of KSP and I [I][U]want[/U][/I] to have this mechanic. I enjoy keeping an eye on my temperature and electricity and making control decisions about how to do it.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo anyway, that\u0026#39;s why. At some point I may circle back to add a configurable option to make the radiators draw an amount of electricity that\u0026#39;s proportional to the heat transfer involved, which would be a useful enhancement. However, I\u0026#39;m new to modding in the past couple of weeks, and there are so many exciting new things I want to do! :) So it may be a little while before I circle back here to add new features, I have another couple of mods I\u0026#39;d like to do first.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0026#39;ll be sure to post an update here if/when I add the feature.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-20T17:30:44Z","Content":"\nI did not know stock radiators needed energy.
