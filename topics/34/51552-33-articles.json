The X button should stay \u0022instant\u0022 for canceling i.e. ignoring any delay you\u0027ve set up, but obeying signal lag, or the flight comp should have a big friendly panic button saying \u0022stop everything right frelling now\u0022 that ignores manual delay. Having a button to send a delayed engine turn off wouldn\u0027t hurt though, but sending any % burn for 0s works alright. (just thought of something, you did mean the X-button in flight comp, not X-key on the keyboard, right? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E )\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. If you mean the ships throttle, then yes it should and it does. Well, after a quick test it appears it releases the throttle to what it is manually set up to, and you can change the manual value while RT has locked the throttle, so don\u0027t lean on your shift key while RT is burning. If you mean the burn-timer-power-slider in the flight comp should reset to 0%, then no, it shouldn\u0027t, and I\u0027m undecided on it reseting to 0% whenever I close the FC, but I can live with that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like it if we could get the queue as a separate window. The flight comp and queue together are a bit wide to have open on my monitor, stacking them vertically would solve it for me but probably tick off someone else, so being able to move them separately could be good. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DancingWind","CreatedById":94161,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-23T11:36:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think in this version of remote tech omni-directional antenna are broken.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a kerbostationary sat network set up with directional antennas and I am trying to construct a big com station for Interstellar probing.
