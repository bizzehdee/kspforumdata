The target beam scanning with its own scientific experiment has been added. It triggered when certain conditions met. Namely - the need to focus the camera at the subject (chosen target) and irradiate it. If the range (set in CFG) are within a given (it accordingly may require a rapprochement with the object) - will be carried out the experiment. if the conditions are not met - will not. The experiment has a limit of (4 times) and consumes resources (configurable in CFG). Further development - something to do with the system of contracts that can be ordered reconnaissance flights. \u003Cbr\u003E\n2. Saving screenshots has been added.
