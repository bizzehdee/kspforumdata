It has been made to be a \u0022Kerbalized\u0022 interpretation of Gemini. Also included is an appropriately themed parachute/ docking port combo, a service module, and a small in-line monopropellant engine. The pod features a unique IVA. A heatshield and decoupler have been added in the newest update.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Also, normal maps would be nice for the capsule seams and the engine textures.\n\nThe short answer is yes.\n\nThe long one is that I actually made this about six months ago and just recently came back to it. In that time we discussed a lot that could improve the whol system, such as turning the service module into more of a payload bay and making the engine dual mode to support both LFO and Mono prop. Check out the [dev thread](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/98063-Planning-to-start-a-collection-of-small-part-pack-mods-Dev-build-available-%28V0-1%29) for more details. \n\nTexture wise, it actually has a normal map, it just isn\u0027t a great one. But the whole system uses texture sharing in a way that I\u0027m unhappy with and strange mapping in a few places. (Again I made this quite a while ago and hindsight is 20/20) So a lot needs to be redone and it sort of needs to happen at the same time. If I find myself with a lot of free time I can look into improving the existing normal map, but I don\u0027t want to devote too much into fixing textures that will need to be remade anyway. \n\nHope that makes sense and isn\u0027t too disappointing."},{"CreatedByName":"ev0","CreatedById":116691,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T02:02:51Z","Content":"The windows on this pod are much larger than any other pod in the game... any chance of making them smaller?
