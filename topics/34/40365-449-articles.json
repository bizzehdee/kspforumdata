Very detailed and useful, I\u0027ll save this for future reference!But, may I ask a few questions? For example, why would you choose ground reactors over just ground relays? I would think all those antimatter and solar farms would produce so much excess power that you could afford the power loss from ground relays rather than going through the trouble of maintaining ground transmitter/reactor units. (Or do reactors not buildup waste when on-rails?)\u003Cp\u003EAlso, is it true that one relay satellite can handle unlimited power \u0022bandwidth\u0022? Or will having additional, redundant relays (e.g., those not intended for increasing area covered) help with power transmission?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMicrowave Thermal Receivers seem to have both a megajoule and thermal power gauges... am I correct in reading MJ as the power input, and thermal power as the produced output by the Thermal Receivers?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd one last thing: Does using tweak scale fudge up the numbers on the thermal tool? I\u0027ve scaled up some batteries, heat radiators, and solar panels to their maximum size, but it turns out my 1000 GJ sat is actually only transmitting 5 GJ... is this because it only transmits what the network demands and lets the rest go to waste, or is this power bottlenecking?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s worth noting that you can theoretically save game edit out old parts for new ones, which will be a pain in the butt, but it\u0027s not a catastrophic \u0022lose everything\u0022 savegame break.

As you noted, they do provide both forms of power, and are super useful for putting small things into orbit. Have a satellite you want up there with just microwave power, thermal rocket and plasma thruster baby.

This is just the procedure I used to establish a microwave power network, others are welcome to use, edit or not use, and improvements are welcome! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI started with the ground based rovers, they were fusion power plants with solar panels for a lil extra oomph (the OKEB 500 panel from Near Future Solar Mod) just to add to the mix. Each rover weighed in at about 300 tons (useless science module was just for giggles), so moving them was a task, but worth it. Each had the necessary reactor/generator/fuel/cooling necessary for a 10GW power plant (i always over spec the cooling), as well as 2 microwave transmitters (1 relay \u002B 1 transmit) ... oh and big wheels, lots of them! (Im at work now, but ill edit this post later to include pics)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Rover pic goes here)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022%5Bimg%5Dhttp%3A//i.imgur.com/H7IVbFf.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022H7IVbFf.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022%5Bimg%5Dhttp%3A//i.imgur.com/TtXYdXo.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022TtXYdXo.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(can you tell i like my spotlights)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce those were in place (4 around KSC), i sort of got lazy and pointed the rover right side up, thinned it down A LOT (like a serious amount), put my standard \u0022probe assembly\u0022 onto it stuck it to a rocket and put it into geosync orbit. Figuring out the nuances of getting a geosync orbit and the object where you wanted it took me 5 tries, so I have 5 power relays, fairly well spaced, each putting about 4 GW or so of Tokomak fusion power (reactor generated and solar) into the network, and relaying anything else they receive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(relay sat pic goes here)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022%5Bimg%5Dhttp%3A//i.imgur.com/t5tLN9A.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022t5tLN9A.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce that was accomplished i used as many thermal rockets (for atmosphere work) and quantum vacuum powered plasma thrusters as i could manage per craft, this helped alot with Delta-V requirements etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally I turned to the task of an anti-matter farm... I started by putting up my collectors. Each collector rack as i called them, had 50 collectors, attached with fuel lines (that bits important) to the anti matter tanks. Sent 4 of those up, with the big docking ring on the front. Once they were all up I began the task of sending up a 2.5m antimatter reactor, with a few of its own collectors and other necessities (radiators etc) and docking them... that was challenging, but worth it, because once done, I can max out any of my thermal turbojets or plasma thrusters in the greater Kerbin system. Going to Mun or Minimus is a breeze. Each of the below sats puts up about 1 TW of power, so i really have over killed it by colossal proportions, but again, this is Kerbin...anything goes \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Anti matter rack pic goes here)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022%5Bimg%5Dhttp%3A//i.imgur.com/nNNiH10.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022nNNiH10.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022%5Bimg%5Dhttp%3A//i.imgur.com/P33x8f0.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022P33x8f0.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Real FPS killer that rig - like trying to dock a moon, and yes all the radiators are necessary \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_lipssealed.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sealed:\u0022\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was going to send up my solar farm satellites but decided to hold off with the impending break of save game coming, but for their purposes i have designed an \u0022orbital tug\u0022 which happens to be warp capable.

You\u0027re the man.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs thanks, a few tips of my own, which you might find useful in the future:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Three relay satellites is the smallest number you can use to get full \u0022ring\u0022 coverage around an equator wherein satellites have full line-of-sight to all the others. This will probably be easier to setup around additional planets than your five satellite ring. (Although extremely low gravity planet(oid)s may require more, since very low geosync orbits reduce maximum line of sight. But it should work around most worlds).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- On-rails objects don\u0027t seem to build up waste heat. So it\u0027s a bit cheaty, but you can create solar with few to no radiators. Antimatter satellites too, if you suck power from other satellites rather than generating your own (thus allowing you to put it back \u0022off-rails\u0022 to pickup antimatter collected).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- You can probably save some FPS and weight by not using landing legs and modular girders on your ground relays. You\u0027re already using super-heavy wheels which are far tougher than the landing legs, so it\u0027s better just to use their brakes to stay still.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- For lowest possible orbit Kerbol (the sun) satellites, you\u0027ll need \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Ethousands\u003C/span\u003E(!) of tons of battery units to milk the maximum amount of power out of those regular\u003Cstrong\u003E OKWB-250 Blanket\u003C/strong\u003E solar power arrays (the largest ones from Near Future power). \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EEach\u003C/span\u003E of those requires\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E417\u003C/span\u003E of the \u003Cstrong\u003EBK-12K Rechargeable Battery Bank\u003C/strong\u003E (the largest battery, 12000 EC each).
