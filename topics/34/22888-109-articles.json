Some people just don\u0027t have any concept of tact or diplomacy when asking for things.

I for one am unbelievably grateful for the work you guys do, because I have zero knowledge about making mods. I have been doing soup kitchen work, outreach, swim lessons, and other various forms of charity since I was in my early teens. I can\u0027t say that every time someone complains about the FREE food it isn\u0027t shocking and disheartening but the people who are truly thankful far out number and outweigh the people who are extremely grateful. So I hate to callously segway back into modding but your analogy is perfect. There are tons of people on these forums who think they can do it better, expect things like they are paying you, and think they know best but those people are just louder and stand out more than the people who are truly grateful. Even the \u0022worst\u0022 mods on here amaze me because I don\u0027t even know where to start in terms of making a crappy mod. Don\u0027t get disappointed and unmotivated just remember for every jerk that is out there are ten who truly appreciate what you do, that doesn\u0027t just apply to modding.
