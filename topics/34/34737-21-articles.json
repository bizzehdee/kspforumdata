Minimal interface for control, with the option to expand the gui or open/hide another box for the fiddly input stuff that you really only need during tweaking.\u003Cp\u003EAlso, being able to set the speed per part instead just just per group would be nice. One of the robot arms I\u0027ve tinkered with I had to resort to stacking 2 rotating pieces in one joint so it would extend that part twice as fast as the rest of the arm. Being able to set the speed differently, or even as a ratio compared to the base group speed, could come in handy.
