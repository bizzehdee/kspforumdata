Those compression algorithms are built into DirectX 10 and later. They are also built into OpenGL 4.x.

The bigger concern is that unlike DTX1 and DTX3 there are some minor differences between the OpenGL and DirectX implementation of these algorithms. The Direct X algorithms are named BC4 and BC5, but the OpenGL algorithms come in 4 different varieties, two each of of RG Compression and LA Compression. To make matters more confusion BC5 and BC4 are differentiated by the varient of each of these two algorithms you call, the RG and LA version determines if they use color space rotation.

However, since so many clueless programmers use Unity presuming it would automatically port to OS X and Linux without any changes, and at the release date of 4.0 most OS X systems were running OpenGL 3.x, I suspect it simply hasn\u0027t been implemented to prevent problems with twice as much video memory being used \u0022for no reason\u0022 in porting. I\u0027ve seen several people on the forums and Q\u0026amp;A boards attempting to use compression methods incompatible with their target platform to much the same effect.
