Getting anything into a 64k orbit with 1.25m parts is very difficult without asparagus staging.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe whole \u0022coast to apoapsis\u0022 doesn\u0027t really happen as much with the larger kerbins. A good launch will see the core stage burn out just as the orbit circulatizes. So after the initial boost (twr of 1.5ish) you don\u0027t much care about thrust ratio as you have plenty of time to orbit (4\u002B minutes). In the early game the 1,8m tanks are great for those longer-burning cores.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELater, the 1.8 size fits perfectly inside 2.5m fairings. That really reduces drag, allowing for shallower/more-efficient launches to low orbit. The 64k kerbin requires 7000-\u0026gt;7500m/s to get into orbit. But the atmosphere ends at only 92km, not much higher than stock. If you are aiming for a low/efficient orbit prior to transfer or rendezvous with something higher, you need a shallow assent. That means lots more time accelerating through the upper atmosphere rather than in vacuum. Aerodynamics really count. Not resorting to an oversized fairing makes a big difference.
