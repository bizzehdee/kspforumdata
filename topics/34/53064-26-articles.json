Hydrogen takes up a lot of space for the same mass. 1 ton of fuel for 6 tons of engine is not going to get you much delta-v. You need very physically large (but not very massive) tanks to use nuclear engines efficiently. The balloon tank also helps since the regular one doesn\u0027t have a good full/empty mass ratio for hydrogen.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-31T00:03:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi, jumped into try 18c with KSP 0.23, small issue though.
