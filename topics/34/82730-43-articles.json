You can either change the part\u0027s properties to allow part clipping, or move the offending nodes around.

The FTT tank however weighs almost 4 times this fraction.. Lastly during the life of the shuttle approximately 10 tons was shaved off the weight of the external tank, so that represents about an extra 40% weight on top of the 16%, a low tech LH2 tank therefore might be approximately 22% dry weight. For comparison most of the liquid tanks in KSP are around 10% dry weight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the 75k LH2 tank might weigh between .800 and 1.2 tons.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-07T14:25:15Z\u0022 title=\u002205/07/2015 02:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MarcAFK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T14:45:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMarcAFK - feel free to log a github issue with your findings and I can take a look.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MarcAFK","CreatedById":142340,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T14:58:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t be sure about using real world values though, liquid hydrogen is hideously difficult to contain and boils off significantly when stored, the extra mass might include refrigeration and other advanced storage technology that prevents this from occurring.

But the problem is no matter how efficient your engine is you can\u0027t get significant delta-v if your empty tanks are too heavy.
