I \u003Cem\u003Ethink\u003C/em\u003E so anyway. I haven\u0027t actually gone through the process of merging Toadicus Tools 5 into my real game folder yet to confirm that it works in a live setting. But if you carry out the above recipe using that Toadicus Tools instead of the bundled one the result is as expected, so I\u0027m pretty confident that it\u0027ll work in a real, modded game.

I \u003Cem\u003Ethought\u003C/em\u003E the combination of T.E. 1.8 and Toadicus Tools 5 (both downloaded from kerbalstuff) worked, but I got it wrong somewhere.
