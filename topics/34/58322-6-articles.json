You would be flying a plane - or driving a rover or tank, I suppose - with some kind of projectile weapon mounted on it. Select a target that you want to destroy. An aimpoint or crosshair, something showing where your weapon is currently aimed, and an aiming reticle, showing you where to aim your gun so that the bullets strike the target, appear. It doesn\u0027t aim for you, or do anything automatically, other than constantly re-compute the location of the aiming reticle. All you have to do (and it isn\u0027t really as easy as it sounds) is maneuver your air/spacecraft (or slew and elevate your turret, as the case may be) so that the weapon\u0027s sights or crosshair is pointed at the aiming reticle, and fire. Also, if there is no target selected when the Gunsight is active, the aiming reticle should display the current impact point of your rounds if you were to fire. This would allow, for instance, much more accurate strafing of multiple ground targets. Of course, if your gun is aimed at an object or surface that is too far away, i.e. out of the range of the gun or 2km I would think, whichever is more applicable, then the aiming reticle would stay coincident with the gun\u0027s sight/crosshair/aiming method. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis should still satisfy the \u0026lt;Skillful\u0026gt; requirement, InfiniteDice, but also make it a bit more likely to hit one\u0027s target. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, keep in mind, all of the above is simply a request/brainstorm that I\u0027m throwing out. I don\u0027t know if any of it is actually possible to do, or implement in-game. Like I said, it\u0027s just something I\u0027d like to see. Ideally (to me), it would be an independent component, able to be used with any weapons system that fires projectiles with ballistic trajectories. Meaning guns, artillery/tank shells, etc. Which is exactly what this mod is about, that\u0027s why I\u0027m mentioning it here.
