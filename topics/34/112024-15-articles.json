My only suggestion is a nice way to ditch that adapter piece. But that can just be done with your little sepetrons. Because If it were me id want a way to get that adapter out of the way for docking then possibly deorbit.

And in real life gimbal ranges far surpass KSP so any asymmetric thrust can be easily countered. Now im not sure, but the Castor SRB\u0027s may also gimbal too. However that asymmetric SLS configuration baffles me. The only thing i can think of as to why that woiuld be nessesary is because you can have two engines on a static mount and just one to gimbal?

I have 2 installs, 1 with stock-ish balance and another with RSS and RO. And this mods balance is quite far from both of them. It\u0027s parts are considerably heavier than realism overhaul parts. FASA comes closest in terms of weight but its parts are still lighter and more consistent: while heat shielded components are heavy, aerodynamic elements, even big ones, don\u0027t weight several tonnes there. \n\nWhat mod author says - that parts are intentionally heavier than their real life counterparts to compensate for stock Kerbal system being easier kinda makes sense i guess. But is also somewhat strange: surely someone who wants to play with realism, see those huge rockets etc will play with RSS? And if they want to stay on Kerbin theres a 10x scale version of vanilla solar system.\n\nRight now mod requires you to want realistic challenge when building launch vehicles, but at the same time keeps you in slapsticky and miniature stock solar system. It\u0027s just a very unorthodox choice for balance. It also means that this one doesn\u0027t play nice with other mods. \n\nSome very nice parts here, but the balance is just weird."},{"CreatedByName":"Tristonwilson12","CreatedById":136353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-14T15:36:31Z","Content":"![9f69bf4e23.png](http://puu.sh/jBnbS/9f69bf4e23.png)\n\nmy biggest payload yet!!"},{"CreatedByName":"_Augustus_","CreatedById":115084,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-14T15:42:05Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E [http://puu.sh/jBnbS/9f69bf4e23.png](http://puu.sh/jBnbS/9f69bf4e23.png)\n\u003E my biggest payload yet!!\n\n What is it?"},{"CreatedByName":"Budgie","CreatedById":13840,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-14T16:08:15Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E could work neatly, the problem would be the ICPS though... what if, in the case of these variants with a payload area, you made them just with the EUS and just the core, Jupiter-like?\n\nI agree that a secondary payload, in addition to the Orion, looks best and looks more structurally sound with the EUS.
