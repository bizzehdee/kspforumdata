In 0.19 I had some major performance issues with an aircraft of about 350 parts and with a lot of mods. KSP ran at about 8 frames. A bit annoying, but I knew I had lots of mods installed and things like that were to be expected. With 0.20 I decided to see whether FAR had anything to do with this. I installed 0.20 and ran it completely vanilla. I opened the craft and launched. Dispite the thing barely flying I could tell performance was a lot better, around 25-40 fps. After that I installed the mod manager and installed FAR. Sure enough, 8-9 fps. Okay, that is a bit disappointing, but hey, complex calculations are not free.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is where the weirdness starts. In flight, the number seems to vary between 8 fps and a perfectly playable 25 fps. Without a reason it seems to switch from one to the other with not much in between.

I\u0027ve been playing in Windows to avoid the scroll wheel bug, and it has happened in Windows almost identically on three different machines of varying power (from a mobile i5 to a high-power overclocked i5 to an overclocked Phenom II 955 with a GeForce 560Ti). I had occasion to start up KSP in Linux in spite of the current bugs, and FAR appeared to be working just fine, and timewarps appeared to run smoothly, even in relatively low orbits.\u003Cp\u003EHTH\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@ferram4\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve done some more rigorous testing and I think I\u0027ve narrowed things down. This looks to be the fault of disk access during flight. I typically play off a thumb drive; it\u0027s USB3, but still not the fastest around, and the laptop I often use doesn\u0027t have USB3 ports, so I\u0027m sensitive to disk-intensive processes. When FAR is installed, KSP.exe thrashes the disk while timewarping.
