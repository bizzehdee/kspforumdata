With MJ on it\u0027s all over the place though, It feels like mechjeb is making a half-hearted attempt to steer it.

Topheavy means you\u0027re stable (CoM in front of CoL). It\u0027s like a dart or paper airplane--the heavier the nose, the more stably it flies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, here\u0027s how to fly an ascent with FAR/RSS (Other than turn end, this applies to Kerbin as well). With FAR, you must learn what a gravity turn actually is. Protip: it\u0027s not \u0022fly up to 10km, pitch over 45 degrees.\u0022 What a gravity turn actually is, is letting gravity pitch you over (hence its name). The way this works is that, once you reach a decent airspeed (100m/s or so, say--less if your TWR is KSP-normal rather than real-life-normal) you pitch over about five degrees \u003Cem\u003Eand then don\u0027t touch pitch again\u003C/em\u003E. As gravity pulls your velocity vector downwards towards the horizon, aerodynamic forces will keep your rocket aligned with the velocity vector, and your rocket will pitch to follow. Your aim is to be horizontal at apogee.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that as it stands this can\u0027t actually be done with MechJeb, since MechJeb manually controls pitch all the way and keys it to altitude. However, you can set MJ to fly a decent approximation. Here are the steps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*First, set your \u0022turn start\u0022 to \u0022the altitude at which you reach ~100m/s.\u0022 This will be something like 1km if you have a 1.5TWR at liftoff, 1.5km if 1.2TWR, or something like 0.5km if 1.7. If you have a 2\u002B TWR at liftoff (from solids, say) you probably want to start your turn at 0.01km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Second, you want to set your \u0022turn end\u0022 altitude and your \u0022turn shape\u0022 such that deviation from your velocity vectory (the surface prograde indicator) is minimized. For your average two-stage rocket with a decent second-stage TWR (i.e. starts around 1, ends at maybe 3 or 4--that is, like Titan II rather than modern LVs) you might want to set turn at at 150km and turn shape at 50.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Third, you fly a test ascent with \u0022show ascent path\u0022 turned on. Watch how close the purple target (and your rocket\u0027s nose) is to the velocity vector. If it gets out of line by more than 5 degrees when below 80km, adjust turn end and turn shape.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Fourth, if you find yourself circularizing after apogee (very common with low-thrust second stages), once you reach apogee you need to play with \u0022end angle\u0022 to keep your vertical speed zeroed. Don\u0027t touch it until after apogee, mind. Then raise it until your stage is pointing vertically enough to offset gravity; as you speed up you gradually lower that angle until it reaches 0 (no up-thrust needed) at circularization.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jethro Bodine","CreatedById":105385,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-09T18:50:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sarbian\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sarbian\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWith the help of Padishar I tracked why the dV stats and mass where different while in the editor and in flight.
