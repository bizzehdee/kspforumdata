A: how does making small hull adapters contribute to designing Stayputnik when it\u0027s actually the largest of the early probes, and B: What\u0027s the point of tiny rocket parts before you can get a probe core? Miniaturization also includes things like the miniature stack decoupler, even though the actual stack decoupler only becomes available at Compound Rocketry. That should probably wait till Miniature Avant-Garde Rocketry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding seems a tad expensive (especially as you kinda need it if you\u0027re going the aviation route, and its the opposite side of the tree), and the Electrics link seems a bit off too. I can see why, but I\u0027d think it might flow better from Miniaturization: wheels have to be strong but made small and fit in little compartments. Landing struts have to fold up small on the side of rockets, etc. Perhaps it should require both, but be 10 sci cheaper.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProcedural Fairing bases appear a fair bit before the actual fairings which are at Composite Materials, while KW\u0027s fairings start appearing allongside their bases at Aerospaceframes.
