The thread for that mod has another person bringing this up, but no solution except to downgrade. I tried to see if I could find a configuration change that would fix the issue, but had not luck. My best guess, is that there is something in EPL that is wrong, since the concrete base from KIS, the pylon from KAS and the peaceable light from MKS/OKS all work correctly. However, even changing the Survey Stakes to have the same settings as known working parts, it still doesn\u0027t function.\n\u003E \n\nFigured out [the problem](https://github.com/KospY/KIS/issues/108). On EPL side it may be fixed by adding an attach node to the part. On KIS side it will be fixed by relaxing requirements check for the ground attaching parts."},{"CreatedByName":"taniwha","CreatedById":57176,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-07T11:31:35Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, IgorZ said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Figured out [the problem](https://github.com/KospY/KIS/issues/108).

KIS works with KSP parts at the very basic level, and IR does some advanced stuff. An investigation of IR is needed to support it in KIS. It\u0027s in my future plans but the priority is low for now. If anyone would do the investigation and let me know what\u0027s the problem is it will greatly speedup the fix.\n\u003E \n\nLast week I built a number of cranes in EVA with KIS/KAS and Internal Robots Rework and was able tondonso without too much issue.  \n\nThe main problems seem to related to which node you use when attaching (top vs bottom) and you definitely should never use surface attach.  I had to always use the \u0022bottom\u0022 node.\n\nI also found that it was best to reload the scene between attaching each part (basically switch to another ship not in physics range than switch back) - I think IR does some advanced node position tracking, which doesn\u0027t seem to get setup correctly when using KAS to attach - but does get setup during scene load.  What would happen if I tried attaching multiple parts witout scene switching, was that hinges would attach in the middle of the hinge instead of on the attachment nodes, or extenders would extend through attached parts instead of moving them.  Lots of weird behavior.\n\nHope that helps."},{"CreatedByName":"Felson","CreatedById":135649,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-08T18:09:36Z","Content":"@IgorZ  \n\nAwesome. Thanks.

The descrption said I could attach it to the ground and I was like, nice this could be handy. So built a station on Kerbal that had with ground bases at their ends and launched it to the moon. Now I realized, that I cannot attach the ground bases to the ground together with the station. I first have to detach the ground base from the whole structure, then I can attach it to the ground. The only problem is, that then the other parts are not connected to the ground base.... so please guys, don\u0027t tell me I have to reconstruct me whole base on the Mun again, simply because it\u0027s not possible to attach a ground base to two nodes simultaniously or simply attach the whole base to the ground... This is a major flaw in the mod if you ask me.  \n\nHere some pictures:  \n[http://imgur.com/a/PBrvr](http://imgur.com/a/PBrvr)\n\nedit:  \n\nno srsly, I can\u0027t even imagine base-building without being able to attach 2 parts together that are basically touching each other. You should be able to attach without being in \u0022grab\u0022 mode. That would make so much more sense and the mod would become incredibly good.  \n\nLike how are you supposed to attach parts that weigh 12t that way? You could easily bring them in on a rover so that they are really close to the point where you want to attach them and voil\u00E1, just grab a wrench and to just that.

All parts in the game are organized into a tree structure that can have exactly one root part. When you attach anything to ground it\u0027s always the root. That said, there is no way to have more than one attached ground base in the structure. You may add many bases as support structures but only one of them can be attached to the ground.

In the new inventory system grappler parts loose their grip on kerbal\u0027s model and go afloat after trying to grapple anything. Happens both with magnet and the grappler. Probably because they try to become docked to the target (become part of the target vessel) I\u0027m trying to grapple. I don\u0027t know if making this grapple cling to the target in an undocked mode will be a fix.\n\nI love current constraints, they bring realism to the game and a feeilng of achievment when assemling something in orbit.
