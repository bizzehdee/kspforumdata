Still needs an official run-over from the author though. The KF tracks definitely would benefit from the dust effect, and the repulsors might even be able to use them (especially if we can combine the repulsor code to detect when hover over water, which needed a lot of extra functionality added to work correctly without sinking, and produce dust that resembles water spray).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pizzaoverhead","CreatedById":26349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-13T15:20:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022eeveelution\u0022 data-cite=\u0022eeveelution\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe dust doesn\u0027t work for me, I\u0027m on 0.90 and I\u0027m using the latest version (2.2).

I\u0027ve managed a completely and utterly successful extraction of the dust generation code under a new module that I called (not in a very unique way) DustFX. It includes the ability to adjust the minimums/maximums for dust strength and emissions, and the multipliers/divisors for the equations used in generating the dust based on speed, all through module parameters. This also allowed me to scale the strengths along with the part size using TweakScale. Though not extensively tested yet, it hasn\u0027t caused any overly negative effects. Also untested is an extension to the settings to allow for a sandy color dust on Duna. i wanted to export all of those color settings to an external settings file, perhaps through a new node, but I\u0027ve been struggling with the logic behind the code required for that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the grass around the KSC, it\u0027s the grass that\u0027s part of the modeled landscape which causes the sparks/non-dirt-colored dust.

A few months ago I began working on the CollisionFX source in the attempt to expand the dust system into its own class and also expand the dust color definitions for other worlds and biomes that the hard-coded values are not set up to handle. Primarily, the goat was to gear this new module towards wheels... specifically \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EKerbal Foundries\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E wheels, but any object with a collider which is meant to scrape (or roll over, in the case of wheels) the surface, of a planet or object, will in fact work. In this I have been \u003Cem\u003Ecompletely\u003C/em\u003E successful, thanks to a lot of long, painful, headache-laden days and the some out-sourcing to other modders.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe result is a new plugin I call \u0022DustFX\u0022 which, I am sorry to say, is not \u003Cem\u003Equite\u003C/em\u003E ready for release. What\u0027s holding me back? Excellent question; intelligent question... you\u0027ve got a good brain in there somewhere... indeed, there are a few things to work out still. First off, I have yet to configure good color settings for all of the planetary bodies and their appropriate biomes for \u003Cem\u003Eevery\u003C/em\u003E body in the Kerbol system. Secondly, there is the issue that, at the core, this mod is mostly code from its parent mod \u0022CollisionFX\u0022 and I am unsure if I can release it without approval and/or permission from the author of the original code that this is derived from.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is also the fact that I would like to apply my enhancements to the original mod so that dust can be emitted from collisions in the same enhanced manner. Other enhancements that I have made are that you can now customize the strength, speed, and every single one of the variables used to calculate the emission of the dust, all from the module parameters in the part config. Every one of these values has a default, so you can still reference just the module name and be good to go, but you can also specify each and every value if you so desire. New body and biome settings can be defined in a complex, but easy to get the hang of, configuration file which I will define once I merge the code over. This means that a new planet added by a mod pack, if the modded planet is able to return a value from the isPQS system, or if the original methods to determine the body SOI or \u0022landedAt\u0022 methods are returnable with this new planet\u0027s name, this system can be expanded to define a custom color for the dust of the new world. If no color is defined, the default for all undefined situations will still be used.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther miscellaneous updates include new ModuleManager patches that correctly identify what should and shouldn\u0027t be emitting sparks, dust, or other emissions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELimitations: There are a number of things which cannot be worked out without overhauling how the particles are emitted in the first place. The first is only an issue when moving very fast over the terrain, or when there is a very \u003Cem\u003Ethick\u003C/em\u003E cloud being thrown up. When moving from one color-defined region to another, the trail of dust changes color as a whole. This means that dust which is still dissipating in the distance will suddenly change color to match what is being emitted at the source. I have countered this by changing the alpha values for the colors so that the dust is not a giant cloud, but a rather subtle effect that, under some circumstances, is hard to even make out if you\u0027re not specifically looking for it. Another issue is that certain areas do not have correct biome settings. For example, if you launch from the KSC runway, turn around, and travel straight out towards the darker green terrain just outside the flat-space in which the KSC is placed, there will be a moment or two when the dust will turn very white. This is because the vanilla biome definition, for a small area of land within the flat KSC land-plot, is tagged as a \u0022tundra\u0022 area. It is rather beyond the scope of this mod to detect errors in the biomes and adjust accordingly. For that, you\u0027ll need a plugin that aims to overwrite and/or expand the biome definitions, while still allowing the vanilla method of returning biome names intact. If a viable and widely accepted plugin comes along which does this in a way that makes the old biome name definitions obsolete, I\u0027ll gladly look into hooking into a better method of gathering the biome information.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe merger of this new power with the old CollisionFX source is underway and, I\u0027ve gotta admit, it\u0027s pretty powerful. I\u0027m still unsure if the best plan of action is to merge DustFX back in with CollisionFX or if it should be released separately. If released as a major overhaul to the original mod, then only one configuration file for planetary body and biome settings needs to be created. Otherwise, the end user would need to make sure both mods have similar definitions so that everything stays consistent. A third option would be to have a separate directory with the configuration file in it that both mods reference separately, which eases the continuity issue, but still ends up loading up the entire configuration set into memory twice. A fourth option would be to create a dependency to a separate DLL which would be responsible for retrieving the configurations for any mod that wants to use this data, and then have both plugins reference that separate DLL. That way, configurations get loaded into memory once, and any other mods made in the future can tie into it to make use of the same data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am open to thoughts and suggestions. Anyway, I wanted to give you all an update on what\u0027s been happening behind the scenes and, hopefully, attract the attention of the author so that I can start working out the best way to get this stuff out to the public. I\u0027ll return to post an update on the merger into CollisionFX when I have more to show.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Joshwoo70","CreatedById":111345,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T06:12:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Gaalidas\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Gaalidas\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ELONG WALL OF TEXT!\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eokay I have a patch for KF that was merged a few hrs ago.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Enot sure what you mean but I heard of KF word.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI made a patch a few moths ago.
