I\u0027m inclined to err on the side of fewer parts than more, and this seems to provide a good list of candidates for changing passable states.\n\nFurther, I\u0027ve added an option to enable or disable this feature, leaving it disabled by default so that existing behavior is preserved. If you enable/disable the Passability customization feature, a game restart is required, as the RMB info for each part is loaded when the parts are loaded at startup.\n\nOnce enabled you can enable passable on certain parts and alter surface passable states on any parts with passable enabled.\n\nSo, the planned behavior is this:\n\n1. Customization is off by default. This emulates the existing behavior of CLS prior to the new version. \n\n1a. If a part is passable, you can change the passable and surface passable states via a tweakable on the part during assembly of your vessel (new Behavior). \n\n1b. if a part is Non passable by default, no info is show in the Tool selector on RMB\n\n1c. If a part is Non passable by default, the part does not contain any CLS module, unless the part had an existing CLS MM config (existing behavior).\n\n2. If customization is ON, then non passable info is now shown in the Tool Selector on RMB. (new Behavior)\n\n2a. Non passable parts included in the default part MM config filter now contain a CLS module and passable is off by default. (changing the part\u0027s persistence, but no change to part\u0027s original behavior)\n\n2b. Included non passable parts can now be enabled, allowing passabllity through the part. (new Behavior)\n\n2c. parts that have passable ON, can have the surface passable state change vis tweakable (same as 1a, above)\n\nFinally, with the addition of another option, it made sense to include a options window and remove the options from the main CLS window, making for a cleaner appearance, I also now save the CLS window position, so it will be remembered between scenes and games.\n\nThoughts?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-15T17:01:47Z\u0022 title=\u002207/15/2015 05:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Papa\\_Joe**"},{"CreatedByName":"codepoet","CreatedById":73449,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-15T22:40:25Z","Content":"When do we get to play? ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Papa_Joe","CreatedById":10788,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-15T23:30:58Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E When do we get to play? ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nAs soon as I can figure out how to get my pull request to merge... ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nScreenies of changes follow:\n\n![bvMvgsJ.png](http://i.imgur.com/bvMvgsJ.png)![geZLiYq.png](http://i.imgur.com/geZLiYq.png)![7o3X0qh.png](http://i.imgur.com/7o3X0qh.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"Gryphon","CreatedById":58513,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-17T16:01:00Z","Content":"I like.

Since there is literally nothing between the top-facing-upwards and top-facing-downwards nodes, they should logically be connected. They aren\u0027t.\n\u003E \n\u003E As a partial fix for this problem I wrote a new cfg:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E     @PART[mk2CargoBayS]:HAS[!MODULE[ModuleConnectedLivingSpace]] {    MODULE    {        name = ModuleConnectedLivingSpace        passable = true        impassablenodes = bottom , bottom2    }}@PART[mk2CargoBayL]:HAS[!MODULE[ModuleConnectedLivingSpace]] {    MODULE    {        name = ModuleConnectedLivingSpace        passable = true        impassablenodes = bottom , bottom2    }}@PART[mk3CargoBayS]:HAS[!MODULE[ModuleConnectedLivingSpace]] {    MODULE    {        name = ModuleConnectedLivingSpace        passable = true        impassablenodes = bottom , bottom2    }}@PART[mk3CargoBayM]:HAS[!MODULE[ModuleConnectedLivingSpace]] {    MODULE    {        name = ModuleConnectedLivingSpace        passable = true        impassablenodes = bottom , bottom2    }}@PART[mk3CargoBayL]:HAS[!MODULE[ModuleConnectedLivingSpace]] {    MODULE    {        name = ModuleConnectedLivingSpace        passable = true        impassablenodes = bottom , bottom2    }}\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E ...but this only fixes the top end and not the bottom end.\n\nInteresting. in the photo above, the configuration should be non passable, as the docking ports are really open to space... the fact that there is a cargo bay does not ensure an atmosphere... so it would really be an eva for our kerbals don\u0027t you think?\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The docking port I\u0027m using is the stock clamp-o-tron.\n\nI see a Clamp-o-tron Jr, and a Clamp-o-tron Sr, but no stock clamp-o-tron. maybe you can post a screenshot of the part in the VAB?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-21T01:57:57Z\u0022 title=\u002207/21/2015 01:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Papa\\_Joe**"},{"CreatedByName":"Grumman","CreatedById":76014,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-21T01:56:47Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Interesting. in the photo above, the configuration should be non passable, as the docking ports are really open to space... the fact that there is a cargo bay does not ensure an atmosphere... so it would really be an eva for our kerbals don\u0027t you think?\n\nYes, which is why I was asking about making the leftmost two nodes connected - so that you can transfer from the cockpit into a shuttle docked in the cargo bay, for example - but not connected to the rightmost two nodes. In that screenshot I posted the leftmost docking port should be yellow (indicating a passable part that cannot be occupied)."},{"CreatedByName":"Jivaii","CreatedById":75048,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-21T02:33:07Z","Content":"[Link](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Clamp-O-Tron_Docking_Port)of the part from the wiki, my game isn\u0027t wanting to boot up right now, and I\u0027m getting ready to head to bed.\n\nHere\u0027s a picture of the vessel, it\u0027s docking ports, the Ship Manifest screen, and the pop ups.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

The config for the part in question does not allow radially attached parts.\n\nHowever, the upcoming update will allow you to \u0022tweak\u0022 your vessel designs to allow these kind of activities and to see that they are correct while in the VAB/SPH.\n\nRead up in the earlier posts about the new VAB/SPH tweakables..."}]}
