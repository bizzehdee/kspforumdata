KAS de-orbited my station tug today :/\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was trying to place an electromagnet onto a module of my station that I was decommissioning. But when I plugged the connector into the electromagnet, for some reason the electromagnet suddenly became 35km away.... Or at least, the winch cable was extended by ~35000. I started retracting it (looked like that was going to take about a year), but it was pulling my tug with some crazy force. Then I realised that the direction it was pulling the tug was considerably towards the mun. I unplugged the connector, but it didn\u0027t stop my tug getting pulled along. I decided to try and point in the direction of the cable and just burn, which started working... after a while I was building up some good slack, about 5-10km of it, then using the instant cable stretch to yank it all back in. But then I wasn\u0027t really paying attention to my velocity, and I overshot its vector, and it started getting tight again. So I tried to turn back and correct it, but by then my orbit was wrecked, my horizontal speed was too slow, and I was falling towards the Mun. I managed to get the cable to within 6 km before I scattered 3 Kerbals across the surface of the Mun. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKAS 1 - Space Program 0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedit: spelling is hard\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KospY","CreatedById":33868,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-07T09:29:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks to zzz, struts end point now look good \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xED1rGL.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022xED1rGL.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is how it look when linking strut\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1QEEaxW.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00221QEEaxW.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-07T09:47:14Z\u0022 title=\u002209/07/2013 09:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 7, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by KospY\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Athlonic","CreatedById":57996,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-07T10:02:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOutstanding !!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\\o/\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
