Not something to do manually. To my knowledge the best fix is to reconnect the parts in the editor. And if you have vanishing nodes then try to solve the exceptions first.\n\nAn exception literally means that the program comes to a situation where it can not continue, and the only safe thing would be to crash. Then it skips code until finding a \u0022catch\u0022 statement, hoping that this has not left an inconsistent mess behind.

Could you try to reproduce your issues with the version from before and after that change? (you only need to replace Scale.dll) If you can confirm that this change broke your crafts I\u0027ll revert it and push out a new version.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E before:  \n\u003E [https://github.com/pellinor0/TweakScale/blob/a346b6a2191cc8c0cb94fc194ac1b63804ecb7de/GameData/TweakScale/plugins/](https://github.com/pellinor0/TweakScale/blob/a346b6a2191cc8c0cb94fc194ac1b63804ecb7de/GameData/TweakScale/plugins/Scale.dll)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E after:  \n\u003E [https://github.com/pellinor0/TweakScale/blob/f9a730b17723558469d5b8d634cb10750ed0af49/GameData/TweakScale/plugins/](https://github.com/pellinor0/TweakScale/blob/f9a730b17723558469d5b8d634cb10750ed0af49/GameData/TweakScale/plugins/Scale.dll)\n\u003E \n\nI cannot confirm that changes between 2.2.11 and 2.2.12 broke anything. I did some more testing and this is what I found with Tweak Scale versions 2.2.11.0 and 2.2.12.0 (the same behavior is seen with either version installed):\n\nUsing stock tanks and engines, single stage w/MechJeb .\n\nScaling down, the same delta-V is listed in MechJeb on the pad as in VAB. However when returning to VAB it shows I have the amount of propellants I am supposed to have, but can add much more fuel and oxidizer to bring the total up to the original without the mass changing.  Now going back to the pad I have a huge delta-V available, larger than the original (because fuel mass doesn\u0027t go up but the volume available to burn does).\n\nScaling up doesn\u0027t preserve what you do in VAB.  I upscale my tank and note the delta-V in MechJeb.  Now go to the pad and my delta-V shrinks terribly.  Looking at my fuel at the pad it resets it back to stock values while the tanks are apparently full, but the mass is that of the tweaked tank with the mass of the increased fuel even though it won\u0027t burn it.  Basically this is the opposite of the downscale.\n\nIn the latter case, returning to VAB changes nothing.  But if I now tweak the tank back to stock size the propellants re-scale to much smaller than stock.\n\nI have a heavily modded install, so this may take some time if there is some unwanted interaction going on.  But I have to ask the naive question, can a different mod interfere with Tweak Scale on this level even though it is apparently not being used with such a simple test on stock parts?  I know that some mods bundle other mods with them and often not up-to-date. I have of course checked for that and appear to be clean.\n\n**Update:**  **This is not Tweak Scale**, it may be an interaction though, so I am trying to figure it out.  I started clean with Tweak Scale and MechJeb as the only mods and the tanks, propellants, delta-V all turned out ok.  Sorry if I worried anyone.  If I take the time to figure out what went wrong I will let you know.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-24T23:34:40Z\u0022 title=\u002205/24/2016 11:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 24, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Parallax59**\n  \nupdate"},{"CreatedByName":"pellinor","CreatedById":85299,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-24T22:59:02Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, Parallax59 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I cannot confirm that changes between 2.2.11 and 2.2.12 broke anything.

There are many modules that can end up on the same part with TweakScale, and will manipulate the same things. For example FAR, modularFuelTanks/realFuels, a variety of fuel switches, or even kOS (which also modifies part mass). Also, exceptions can cause code to be skipped (see my post above), which could in principle also cause all sorts of \u0022reverting\u0022 problems.\n\nCould you upload a minimal craft file that reproduces the bug for you? A one-part craft would be enough, just so I can see what modules are on that part in your install.\n\nA game log would also be helpful.\n\nSo, to sum up the most obvious symptoms from your report:\n\n\\* downscaled tank: launch, revert to VAB  \n\n  =\u003E fuel amount is ok, but maxAmount is reverted\n\n\\* upscaled tank: just launch  \n\n  =\u003E maxAmount reverts (rest might be a consequence)\n\nSounds very much like a new interaction problem with one of the fuel tank mods. Which of course does not mean it\u0027s their fault.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-24T23:15:37Z\u0022 title=\u002205/24/2016 11:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 24, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by pellinor**"},{"CreatedByName":"Parallax59","CreatedById":157935,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-25T15:54:59Z","Content":"I found the culprit, it was something called Cryo Tanks, which is a subfolder of the Cryogenic Engines mod version 0.3.2.
