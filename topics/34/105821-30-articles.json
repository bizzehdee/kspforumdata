I understand that there is a PAGE object of some sort that you define for the monitor, but how do you do that for a specific IVA? For instance, I have defined four camera transforms: cameraTransformFront, cameraTransformLeft, cameraTransformRight, and cameraTransformBottom. I know that the IVA has PROP definitions for RasterPropMonitorBasicMFD. Do I need to add a part module to the IVA to define the pages for the cameras? Are there tutorials on that? I checked the Wiki but couldn\u0027t find what I needed. For reference, here is the RPM version of my Backseat\u0027s IVA flight controls:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E (snip pic)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Thanks for the help. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\u003E \n\nThe short answer is that you\u0027ll have to do at least one thing -\n\n1) Mark the transforms with [JSIExternalCameraSelector](https://github.com/Mihara/RasterPropMonitor/wiki/Part-modules#jsiexternalcameraselector) modules in the part config(s) that contains them, and give them a \u0022cameraIDPrefix\u0022 of \u0022ExtCam\u0022 - this will allow them to work automatically with the existing prop, although the user will have to configure which transform belongs to which ExtCam ID number in the VAB.\n\n2) If you don\u0027t want them to fit in with the default ExtCam functionality, you can give them different camera ID prefixes, but then you will have to make your own prop configuration. You can recycle the existing configuration, give it a different name, and change the name of the external cameras selector in the config file (which is in [GameData/JSI/RPMPodPatches/BasicMFD/MFD40x20.cfg](https://github.com/Mihara/RasterPropMonitor/blob/master/GameData/JSI/RPMPodPatches/BasicMFD/MFD40x20.cfg#L229) )"},{"CreatedByName":"Angelo Kerman","CreatedById":106975,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-14T16:53:50Z","Content":"Thank you, that\u0027s exactly what I needed. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"Radioknopf","CreatedById":158859,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-18T13:31:47Z","Content":"![iGe8Pty.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/iGe8Pty.jpg)Hi,\n\nI have a probplem with all never RasterProp builds.\n\nIt looks like this.\n\nand the log shows a lot of \u0022cannot find internalprop:XXX\u0022\n\nNo mods except this one and it goes for all IVA\u0027s.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-18T13:52:39Z\u0022 title=\u002202/18/2016 01:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 18, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Radioknopf**"},{"CreatedByName":"MOARdV","CreatedById":60950,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-18T20:51:04Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 7 hours ago, Radioknopf said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [![iGe8Pty.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/iGe8Pty.jpg)](http://i.imgur.com/iGe8Pty.jpg \u0022Enlarge image\u0022)Hi,\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I have a probplem with all never RasterProp builds.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E It looks like this.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E and the log shows a lot of \u0022cannot find internalprop:XXX\u0022\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E No mods except this one and it goes for all IVA\u0027s.\n\u003E \n\nIt looks like an installation error, but without additional info, all I can recommend is to completely delete the JSI directory in GameData and reinstall with the latest version of RPM."},{"CreatedByName":"terminator1128","CreatedById":157295,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-21T22:19:03Z","Content":"raster prop monitr is stuck on RasterPropMonitorBasicMFD any help with this?"},{"CreatedByName":"MOARdV","CreatedById":60950,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-22T03:14:10Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 4 hours ago, terminator1128 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E raster prop monitr is stuck on RasterPropMonitorBasicMFD any help with this?\n\u003E \n\nNot without additional information.
