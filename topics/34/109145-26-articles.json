I don\u0027t know if the reactor is spooling up or not, I can\u0027t tell. Still no thrust after more than 15mins of waiting. I threw some nervs on my ssto to test if they had the same issue.. They produce thrust and do not have reactors on them. \n\nAnother thing that seems off that may be related is that the info for the reactor in the context menu is all blank. This doesn\u0027t happen on the near future electric reactors or the USI reactors by rover dude. It seems specific to your reactors, so this is likely going to point us to the cause of the problem. Can you install NFE, if you don\u0027t have it, and test it yourself please? Should I post on nertia\u0027s thread for support?\n\n[![screenshot1.png](http://i1084.photobucket.com/albums/j408/chmurrayjr85/screenshot1.png)](http://s1084.photobucket.com/user/chmurrayjr85/media/screenshot1.png.html)\n\nEdit: While I am posting here, I might as well make some suggestions that come to mind every time I use your parts. \n\nCan you please add attachment nodes to the interior of the service bay, so that it is like a 1/4 size cargo bay? I like the size of it for a battery bank, but like to have more options than the included batteries. \n\nCan you add fuel and fuel switcher options to the mk2 tail connector like the spade tail has? \n\nCan you add fuel switcher options to the stock mk2 liquid fuel tanks like the rocket fuel tanks have but also include the options the service tank has like mono and xenon? The textures on the mono and service tanks bug the crap out of me (yellow lines). I feel like the stick out like a sore thumb on my crafts lol. I guess I am being too much of a perfectionist, because even the rocket fuel tanks black lines make me wince some times.\n\nI get the impression adding fuel switcher options isn\u0027t very hard. I will probably do it myself, but I hate to have to redo it every time you update. Maybe if I get around to it before you do, you can over look my work and include it in the next update.\n\nAlso while I am posting here, I might as well say thank you for all of your hard work!

Testing the issue on a minimally modded copy of KSP with a freshly downloaded copy of NFE (0.7.4) with the Pluto, Rontgen, Nerv, and various Kerbal Atomics engines all using NFE NTR configs, I got the same result with all of them; the engines would only properly start when staged, action menu nor action groups yielded engine activation sans thrust, reactor stats.

It breaks physics on the runway. As soon as the wheels hit the ground, the front gear lifts off of the ground. The plane then slowly increases pitch until around 90 degrees. Then it starts levitating into the sky. Engines will not propel the craft forward, even though the are generating thrust. The only thing that appears to have any control over the vessel is SAS. Reverting to the VAB and removing the spade tails returns everything to normal.\n\n [![screenshot0.png](http://i1084.photobucket.com/albums/j408/chmurrayjr85/screenshot0.png)](http://s1084.photobucket.com/user/chmurrayjr85/media/screenshot0.png.html)\n\nI made it to 100m in the time it took to write this post.\n\n[![screenshot2.png](http://i1084.photobucket.com/albums/j408/chmurrayjr85/screenshot2.png)](http://s1084.photobucket.com/user/chmurrayjr85/media/screenshot2.png.html)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-30T20:15:27Z\u0022 title=\u002205/30/2016 08:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 30, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Mr\\_Breeze**"},{"CreatedByName":"THE HOLY BLUGER","CreatedById":162983,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-30T20:39:08Z","Content":"It is fine now. i was not putting the .thumbs into the game data."},{"CreatedByName":"SuicidalInsanity","CreatedById":143878,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-31T00:00:04Z","Content":"@Mr\\_Breeze: Craft file and modlist?  \n\nI ran a series of tests with forward spadetails on a clean copy of KSP (Squad\u002BMk2Expansion, InterstellarFuelSwitch, CommunityResourcePack, ModuleManager 2.6.25) with forward spadetails in various configurations and placements, as well as a replica of your craft (except with stock wings); I was unable to replicate the physics break. ![x0WiU6t.png](http://i.imgur.com/x0WiU6t.png)\n\nIt\u0027s possible some other mod isn\u0027t playing nice with them, but by themselves I\u0027m fairly certain forward spadetails aren\u0027t the problem.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-31T00:06:29Z\u0022 title=\u002205/31/2016 12:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 31, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by SuicidalInsanity**"},{"CreatedByName":"xD-FireStriker","CreatedById":137214,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-31T04:42:03Z","Content":"hey [@SuicidalInsanity](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/143878-suicidalinsanity/) i am rounding up fav mods to install to 1.0.5 and am wanting to know what version would is compatible with 1.0.5 i dont know if v1.7.07 works for 1.0.5 or not and dont know how far i need to go back\n\nLove the mod keep up the good work\n\nThanks FireStriker\n\nxD"},{"CreatedByName":"SuicidalInsanity","CreatedById":143878,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-31T19:26:18Z","Content":"[@xD-FireStriker](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/137214-xd-firestriker/): 1.7.XX is for 1.1.
