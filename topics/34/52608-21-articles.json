To get properly positioned in 3D space, the cameras of RPM need a Transform model element somewhere, they look for it by name. A transform is basically the term for a position of a named game object in 3D space. That transform needs to have a particular orientation - cameras point in Z\u002B direction, so that X\u002B is on the right of the screen. If you\u0027re making a model from scratch, it\u0027s easy to include a transform in it, but in case you\u0027re using a model you didn\u0027t make, you can\u0027t exactly edit it\u0027s orientation. You also can\u0027t exactly rename it, because if you do rename it, you will have problems finding it by name later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo get around this, JSIExternalCameraSelector creates a \u003Cem\u003Echild transform\u003C/em\u003E -- i.e. it creates another transform model element and sticks it beneath the \u0027cameraContainer\u0027 in the hierarchy, so it can be turned the way RPM camera module likes it and named the way RPM camera module wants it to be named.
