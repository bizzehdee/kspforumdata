The real world moon is supposed to have a bit, all be it in still very small concentrations. I still have concerns about this - Mun would make life just a little bit too easy in my opinion. Mun of course also doesn\u0027t have to be an exact analogue of our own, so maybe this idea would work but use it on other bodies. Maybe Tylo would be a perfect place to have some, still making He3 something of a challenge. I also think cloud harvesting is a brilliant fun engineering challenge (far different from yet another \u0027land a base on X and press extract\u0027) and thus should still be the best source of He3. Perhaps this is exactly what Fractal had in mind? The best way to make this more relevant is an quantity increase in Jool. 10x Would make large harvesters like my own able to fill a tank in 12 minutes instead of 120 - a good upgrade. It could even be increased further to allow for higher atmosphere dives to pull in small quantities and deep dives to rapidly fill many tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe bigger issue still remains - what the hell is the point of it in Fusion?
