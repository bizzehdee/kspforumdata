(Now using a custom VersionInfo object).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP-AVC now supports GitHub release checking. By having the remote version file contain GitHub information, the version checker can do a release check to see if the latest release is the same version as the version file. If there is a release to check with, and it\u0027s not the same version as it states in the version file, no update notice will be displayed to players. The check is done against the tag given to releases and does a regex removal of all characters other than numbers and points, so please bare in mind that \u0022v1.0.0\u0022 and \u0022v1.0.0-alpha\u0022 will both come back as \u00221.0.0\u0022, and \u0022v1.0.0-alpha1\u0022 will be \u00221.0.1\u0022.

The game crashed for unrelated reasons. restarting I had the notice to update AVC to 1.1.3. I hit the download button, installed AVC and restarted KSP. At the point where the Version check usually runs, the loading hangs requiring an end-task. I let it set for about 10 minutes once. Normaly the full load cycle takes about 1.5 minutes. I removed the AVC folder from GameData and the game started normally, including firing off a miniAVC notice for one of the plugins. Dropped AVC1.1.3 back in, no joy.
