So you don\u0027t reset habitation like you would if you entered a new ship, instead you keep your current time-in-ship.

With this problem in mind, I\u0027m not sure how to design a ship that travels far and does not stay in one big piece. Out of curiosity, if this is the case, how do other people go about making landers for ships on long-duration missions?\n\nEdit: I think I figured it out! DStaal, you were right, it seems to totally be about the staging. From what I\u0027ve tested, it seems to be dependent on what the root of the spacecraft is. If the root of the craft had not been on the return capsule when I had staged, it would have counted as another spacecraft when it jettisoned and everything would have worked as expected.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-10-03T19:01:16Z\u0022 title=\u002210/03/2017 07:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 3, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Orbnu**"},{"CreatedByName":"rottielover","CreatedById":73403,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-07T14:09:27Z","Content":"\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E Tools is causing 1.3.1 to crash after the load screen just prior to the Menu screen coming up.
