The nuclear propulsion parts do not have to be military at all, quite to the contrary it would be nice if they looked like the [N.S. Savannah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NS_Savannah) or other such civilian nuclear powered ships.\n\nGood question. Here\u0027s my opinion:\n\nWhen I chose to circumnavigate Eve by rover, I had a number of options for propulsion. I finally settled on some screw drives from Kerbal Foundries which are electric powered. Then I had to decide on how to get electricity to those screws. I chose two methods, the primary being Karbonite with a generator that converted Karbonite to electricity and the secondary being solar. I could have put a nuke on the rover from Interstellar and not have to worry about it, but I chose not to.\n\nNow, why am I mentioning that?\n\nIn my [challenge to others](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/113778-The-Elcano-Challenge-Ground-based-circumnavigation)to circumnavigate planets by ground, I disallow \u0027infinite\u0027 fuel sources. The reason is, I stress over and over and over again on that thread, that the challenge is not about the destination, it\u0027s about the journey. \n\nOne thing you learn about KSP if you play it long enough, is that you eventually run out of things to do. Until such time as I can \u0027create\u0027 something that gives you unlimited things to do, giving you more things to do while on your present journey delays the inevitable fact that you will run out of things to do.\n\nTherefore, I shall never, ever create a part, vessel or power plant that runs without some user interaction. If you choose to use such power supplies from other mods, that\u0027s up to you. My mods will never have that.\n\nMy solution is:\n\nI mentioned before and I\u0027ll re-mention it here. The sub I\u0027m working on will have electric engines. And there will be a large battery pack that I\u0027m anticipating will give about an hour to an hour and a half submerged time before the battery runs flat (at full speed). Also on the sub will be a liquid fueled engine that is primarily a generator (uses the alternator in it\u0027s config and produces almost 0 thrust.) to create electricity. The caveat here is that all air intakes on the sub will close upon submerging (thus shutting down the generator) and reopen upon surfacing. Therefore, you\u0027ll have to surface to run the generator and recharge your batteries. Is that a pain? Yes. But, I\u0027d rather you have to plan and think about how you\u0027re going to use my parts rather than just blindly setting the throttle to full and not having to worry about when and where you have to stop.\n\ntl;dr - Nope."},{"CreatedByName":"Lord_Potato","CreatedById":95321,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-22T00:34:40Z","Content":"Don\u0027t know if this has been asked before, but does anyone know if this will be made to work with Better Buoyancy?

I had landing legs getting constantly stuck making the rocket fall over or hang up when trying to launch. The other issue is the connection nodes. In order to reproduce the \u0027vessel\u0027 I pictured, you\u0027d likely spend a LOT of time connecting struts around the edges just so that it doesn\u0027t fall apart.\n\nThe nice landing you made on the boat is because each hull is a single mesh and you managed to land on exactly one of them. Making an adaptable platform, would require multiple meshes and most likely, something with a much larger center section that I have there.\n\nI\u0027ll revisit this, play around a bit more and see if I can\u0027t come up with something that works a bit better though."},{"CreatedByName":"gomker","CreatedById":141269,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-29T02:26:01Z","Content":"Forgive me if I am being dumb, but is the rudder supposed to act like a control surface?

While I did go through all of his parts and I did get all the nodes lined up so the parts will connect, another painful issue arrived. Dice has a rather... ummm... unique perspective on how parts should be positioned (rotated) in the hangars. As a result, once all of the nodes lined up, it created a nightmare for parts may need to be mirrored. This pretty much means that Dice is going to have to go through every single part in Unity, figure out which way they need to be rotated to achieve proper symmetry in mirroring and then, rotate every part, export them back to KSP and then, double check them. Most painful and time consuming. As I learn more, I\u0027ll be sure to update you guys."},{"CreatedByName":"crasher925","CreatedById":44578,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-07T16:42:07Z","Content":"sails?

(10 char)\n\nFunny you should mention that:\n\n![sailtest1.jpg](http://www.datainterlock.com/Kerbal/Shipyard/sailtest1.jpg)\n\nBefore I got into the sail plans, here\u0027s an update on other stuff.\n\nThe tugboat/barge. Before I began, I knew attempting to dock a boat to another boat via a standard docking port wasn\u0027t going to work. Yes, it does dock but if you\u0027ve ever tried to dock large land vehicles, you know the problem. I refer to it as cracking the whip. The instant they dock, the vessel gets lifted into the air, often 20-30 meters or more and then slams back down. So, the plan was to use the mechanics behind the claw. Well, that worked, I was able to dock. But then individual pieces of the barge began floating in the air. I mean the boat separated and parts began floating but the boat didn\u0027t break apart. Ohhh kay. So I\u0027ve made adjustments and no matter what, I can get the claw to grab, but it simply doesn\u0027t want to release properly. I\u0027m still working on that.\n\nThe submarine. That\u0027s been somewhat on hold waiting on Dice and his new float code. But, if you guys have been following this thread, you know I don\u0027t like to be dependent on other mods. It\u0027s getting to that point waiting on the float code. Here\u0027s what I do have working on it.\n\n1. If you try to fly with the sub, the throttle shuts down. You\u0027ll still be able to punch out of the water but once you reach 2m above the surface, your throttle goes to 0.\n\n2. Air intakes shut down. The main engine will be electric but it will have a LF fueled generator. The way stock physics works, you can be 600m under the water and air intakes work. Ummmm right. Well, if you put an air intake on the sub, the instant you dive, it closes. You\u0027ll still have the air stored inside the intake but, it won\u0027t bring in any more till you do surface... and that includes any attempt to add a stock intake, they all close.\n\n3. Diving and surfacing. It does work using Firespitter\u0027s buoyancy but it could be better. For now, it works.\n\n4. Underwater camera. I have that working. You can fully rotate the camera around the sub. The problem is, it\u0027ll pass right through the terrain. My attempts to fix that have been... strange.\n\n5. The lack of a visible water surface when underwater. I have that working. Thanks to Dice, he\u0027s allowed me to use the code he created to solve that problem. And I\u0027ve tweaked it a bit so that the deeper you dive, the darker it gets.\n\n6. Animations. I\u0027ve coded in an animation for the Sub Bridge so that when you do surface and you click the button to open the air intake, an animation plays. When you close the intake, the animation reverses... Yep, animated air intakes.\n\n7. Throttle based animations. For now, I have a set of \u0027butterfly\u0027 shaped covers over the generator exhaust (which is currently also the deck of the sub) and they open and close based on throttle percentage. Set the throttle to half, the animation plays half way. It also adjusts the animation speed so that if you hit X and slam the throttle shut, the \u0027butterfly\u0027 covers don\u0027t slam, they close smoothly.\n\nProblems: For some reason the cargo bay wants to explode when I open it. Hummm, mesh problems.\n\nSo, the sub is almost ready for some testing. I\u0027m gonna go ahead and work on that and when Dice gets his code done, then I may switch the buoyancy over to his code.\n\nFor the past week though, I\u0027ve been off on another adventure. I\u0027ve been back on my 32 bit install of Windows where I have my Pascal programming language, Delphi, installed. Now that I\u0027m both trying to notepad edit .cfg files AND search through the log for the ever present nullReference, I got fed up and created a solution. You\u0027ll note the new \u0027button\u0027 in my signature.\n\nSo, that\u0027s the status... now... for your question\n\n**Sails**\n\nI have very, very rudimentary sails working. I am able to apply a \u0027wind\u0027 and make them push a boat. In the image above, you\u0027re seeing some funky lines. Those are showing the thrust transform for the sail so that I can visually make sure I have them pointed in the right direction (I don\u0027t in that image). So... yes... sails will be eventually forthcoming.\n\nHere\u0027s my ideas on how they should work and you\u0027re free to comment or give me other ideas.\n\nWind should not be a constant. The only other mod with \u0027sails\u0027 that I know of uses solar power. As long as they face the sun, they push the boat at a constant speed. Wind should not work that way.\n\nNextly, wind should not always be from the same direction. If you look at wind patters on the earth you\u0027ll see near the equator they flow east to west (generally) and in the upper and lower latitudes they flow from west to east. There\u0027s also some \u0027bending\u0027 of the wind direction near land masses.\n\nWhat I envision is a table of various latitudes and longitudes on every planet that has water. I\u0027m ballparking that at 100 locations. Each location will have a wind speed and direction assigned to it. When you drop a boat with a sail in the water, it\u0027ll look through the list of locations for the 3 closest ones. It\u0027ll then (based on some serious trig) guesstimate the wind speed and direction at the location of the boat. And, there should be also other random forces at play, like gusts and doldrums (break out the oars).\n\nI also envision this table to be dynamic so that you\u0027ll never know exactly what to expect from the wind. It\u0027ll change based on other nearby wind conditions and will save those changes. Once you start sailing, your wind environment will be unique to you.\n\nFinally, the sails should be linked to the throttle. As you increase the throttle, the sails lower and you get more \u0027thrust\u0027. As you decrease the throttle, the sails raise and your speed slows.\n\nWhat I have accomplished toward this goal.\n\nI have wind... matter of fact (I\u0027ll show this in a video eventually) I\u0027ve sailed off Kerbin and right past Jool. Lots of wind.\n\nI have wind directions and speeds applied to the sails. Currently it calculates a bearing to the closest 3 known spots via an averaging. [Here\u0027s a PHP version of the math I\u0027m using](http://www.weatherapi.net/calculate-average-wind-direction/).\n\nI have a very small table of lats and longs and it\u0027s calculating local conditions (get this, it calculates the distance to the wind lats and longs via the [great circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_circle)calculation... ooomf, more math.)\n\nI have a thrustTransform so that anyone can make their own sails and, via the thrustTransform, show KSP where to apply wind.\n\nSo, that\u0027s the status of things. I bet this is the LAST time you ever ask me a one word question again.\n\nTL;DR - Yes.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-08T01:39:08Z\u0022 title=\u002210/08/2015 01:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fengist**"},{"CreatedByName":"crasher925","CreatedById":44578,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-08T19:56:50Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E -the god of all snips-\n\n![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) YAY! now all we need is a wooden hull ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Fengist","CreatedById":78435,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-09T04:48:22Z","Content":"![SubSeaTrials.jpg](http://www.datainterlock.com/Kerbal/Shipyard/SubSeaTrials.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"TUKE","CreatedById":119239,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-09T11:49:04Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E [http://www.datainterlock.com/Kerbal/Shipyard/SubSeaTrials.jpg](http://www.datainterlock.com/Kerbal/Shipyard/SubSeaTrials.jpg)\n\nLove the texture style, gives a decidedly civilian look."},{"CreatedByName":"tjsnh","CreatedById":108021,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-09T12:23:20Z","Content":"I hadn\u0027t seen this parts back before but it looks like it might have some great utility value.
