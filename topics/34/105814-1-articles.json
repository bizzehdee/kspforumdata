Many people have talked about the weird heat shields and pods flipping over. I have created a ModuleManager patch that fixes this. The Heat Shields are set to be physicsless by default, and even though KSP now adds their mass to the root part, it doesn\u0027t shift the COM. So, by disabling the \u0022physicsless\u0022 flag, they should move the COM and act properly during reentry. I haven\u0027t personally been able to test this yet, so, even though my name would imply otherwise, I need you guys to test it. Tell me how it goes!\n\nInstallation:\n\nKSP 1.0.1 fixes this itself. I appreciate the 1,200\u002B downloads, but this mod is no longer required.
