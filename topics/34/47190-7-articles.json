These textures are re-inflated to a size commensurate with their textures squared. For example, a 1024x1024 230kb .png and a 1024x1024 4mb .mbm are seen as the same size by the KSP program when playing, both will use 4MB of RAM (give or take depending on other factors). The size you see in the folder on your hard drive may or may not have any bearing on how many resources the mod takes. Generally it doesn\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 - Kethane, like many mods and models, uses freshly Unity dumped ,mbm files. This is ok in some cases, but Unity really likes to make mountains out of mole-hills in most cases. Normal maps often don\u0027t need to be near the resolution of the texture they\u0027re enhancing, but they use the exact same amount of resources as a 1024x1024 texture like in the example above. With very flat colors on the textures (monocolor schemes, for example), this level of detail can be dumped easily in favor of performance for those that desire it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDropping just one level down, say 1024 to 512, often doesn\u0027t have any impact on visuals, but it cuts RAM usage by 75%. Another 5% can be saved by removing unnecessary channels if they can be pared without killing the texture entirely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3 - The B9 creator also went to great pains to consolidate his parts using the MODEL command set, which means that sometimes 3 or 4 parts share the exact same textures, basically giving you \u0022free parts\u0022 in some cases, and certainly impacting your hard drive space.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-06T20:08:55Z\u0022 title=\u002210/06/2013 08:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 6, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by PolecatEZ\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Majiir","CreatedById":7550,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-06T21:31:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PolecatEZ\u0022 data-cite=\u0022PolecatEZ\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat does bring up an interesting question though, is it license violation if one were to make wholly new textures to patch over an existing mod?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E an interesting question. I don\u0027t think it would violate the license of the textures as long as you\u0027re not blatantly copying the visual appearance. However, it might violate the license of the 3D model, since the texture is by necessity a derivative of the model and its UV coordinates.
