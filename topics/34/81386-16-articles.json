By pure stats alone, the Eclipse looks weak as well, but it has that high TWR that at least makes it \u003Cem\u003Efeel\u003C/em\u003E noticably different from the ion thrusters. Still, both of the monoprop engines suffer from the fact that they basically lost most of their Isp while still having the same power draw, and gained little in return.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is perhaps best illustrated by comparing the electric monoprop thrusters to other options in the same form factor. Like your \u0022Mighty\u0022 mini-nuke.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe electric engine consumes a little over one third of a gigantor array in power, so let\u0027s add some 0.11 ton to for example the Eclipse. You end up with 0.32t mass, where the Mighty masses 0.32t. They\u0027re equal. And for that, the Eclipse offers 3.5 kN thrust at 875s Isp, while the Mighty does 6.0 kN at 750s. Objectively, the Mighty is simply better - and that\u0027s without factoring in that it costs a mere third of the Eclipse\u002Bsolars, and doesn\u0027t lose output as you move away from the sun like the Eclipse does (because the solar panel loses output, requiring you to throttle down the resistojet). Or the fact that the higher TWR probably weighs up the lower Isp, making the Mighty probably equal or better in absolute dV on a vessel that has the same overall TWR. There is only one thing in favor of the Eclipse right now, and that\u0027s the fact that there are no 0.625m pure LF tanks to go with the Mighty. Other than that, there\u0027s little reason to go for the Eclipse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd in a direct comparison, the Eclipse is better again than the Umbra. A 16% dV advantage doesn\u0027t really weigh up a 60% loss of thrust, especially if some of that thrust can be traded for extra dV and still give you higher TWR. It\u0027s also more expensive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth of these things are practical manifestations of the ephemeral \u0022Engine Rating\u0022 stat in the table above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, this math is just there to offer guidelines, and isn\u0027t the rule to end all rules. The monoprop eletric engines stray a bit in the territory of hybrid electric/chemical drives, and the formulas are not really suitable for chemical engines. Not to mention that stock KSP has grossly overbuffed the Dawn. If you simply went and tried to buff the Umbra to an ER of ~3k, like the Dawn has, you\u0027ll end up giving it 7.3 kN thrust. Which ends up walking all over the mini-nuke. And well, technically the Dawn already walks all over the LV-N, and most other stock engines... it just doesn\u0027t matter because you\u0027d have to cluster so many Dawn\u0027s and solar panels to reach a LV-N\u0027s thrust that you start killing your framerate with part count, so only very few people do it. So stock KSP is kind of saved from screwing up their engine balance here. Unfortunately, you don\u0027t have that luxury, because you introduce a 0.625m nuke that tries to stay close to the LV-N\u0027s style. As a result, a trio or quad of Dawns utterly destroys the Mighty in all possible categories except price, and your mod even delivers the convenient 0.625m adapter to do it! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo ultimately your problem is that your electric engines are trying to straddle the line between the LV-N (by proxy of the Mighty) and the Dawn, which is an endeavour doomed to fail because the Dawn is just better, period. At the same time, you can\u0027t really make them objectively a lot worse than the Dawn, because they literally sit in the same tech node as it does. So you need to give it niches. The Sunrise does okay, it lost a lot of thrust but gained a lot of Isp. Not enough to bring it up to par, but enough to feel different. The Eclipse has its own niche with high thrust, but unfortunately the Mighty beats it handily at that for a third of the price, so the Elipse needs a buff. The Umbra though... it has nothing. It needs a complete revamp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy recommendation:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Sunrise: 8.2 Ec/s power draw, 1.0 kN thrust, 5900s Isp. Small buff, underlines the \u0022higher Isp for less thrust\u0022 niche. Also, since this is the thematically most similar engine to the Dawn, it has the most similar performance rating to the Dawn. (Engine rating: 2617, up from 2507)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Eclispde: 4.7 Ec/s power draw, 5.1 kN thrust, 875s Isp. Much higher thrust, and new niche: an engine for situations where there\u0027s less power available. (Engine Rating: 2003, up from 1291). Yes, it now has more TWR than the Mighty... but it is also a lot more expensive. And still massively weaker than the Dawn, objectively. Buffing it more would create problems for the Mighty and the other monoprop engines, though. See, this is why Near Future nerfs the Dawn \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Umbra: 7.3 Ec/s power draw, 2.4 kN thrust, 2100s Isp. Buffed all across the board, it\u0027s now a jack-of-all-trades engine that doesn\u0027t particularly excel at anything... honestly, it\u0027s either this or axing it, because I don\u0027t see a unique niche for it anywhere =/ Even this will probably make people pass it over 19 out of 20 times in favor of the Dawn. (Engine Rating: 2003, up from 572).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, swap the prices for the Umbra and Eclipse, so that the former has the lower cost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a math balancing approach. It\u0027s best if you tested how it feels ingame, and if feels off, then tweak it with your gut feeling. It\u0027s really hard to not render the low-thrust chemical engines irrelevant with these because the Dawn is just so absurdly good, and these need to at least go a little ways towards meeting it, else they don\u0027t make sense in the same node. At least the price point will ensure that for example the Ant will always have its niche. Career mode is nice like that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Free bonus: ER 2000 is actually the tier 1 balance target for Near Future.

Buffed all across the board, it\u0027s now a jack-of-all-trades engine that doesn\u0027t particularly excel at anything... honestly, it\u0027s either this or axing it, because I don\u0027t see a unique niche for it anywhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: You could also move the Mighty out of harm\u0027s way a little by doing, say, 12 kN at 0.65t weight\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT2: Potentially you could also make the Umbra the engine with the smaller power draw. I just thought it felt a little odd because the word \u0022arcjet\u0022 literally makes you think \u0022a lot of electric power\u0022 \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the post I was waiting for!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirstly, death to the Dawn. The buff Squad made to that has been such an enormous headache that I kinda of gave up on balancing the electric engines before now, and is the reason why the Eclipse and Umbra lost their Xenon modes, they just could not compete on any level. People didn\u0027t use it because it\u0027s a pain in the ass to fly anything with low TWR, and people always build huge spacecraft and try to use engines totally unsuited for things of that size. Increasing the thrust and decreasing the power draw just made the Ant the least useful one, it just moved the problem elsewhere since people still build bigger and bigger craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway.\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_lipssealed.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sealed:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Umbra has always been in a bit of a weird spot, between the Dawn and the Eclipse and so kind of iffy in its purpose. Right now it\u0027s the high ISP option for monoprop vessels but it may not be enough as your analysis shows. Removing it seems like the better option since buffing it to such high levels isn\u0027t something I\u0027m keen on doing. It\u0027s ISP is already higher than a comparative hydrazine one (in real life), and of course its thrust is but it has to be to be competitive. Maybe an absurdly good hydrogen arcjet could hit those numbers but there isn\u0027t really a hydrogen analogue in game (LF doesn\u0027t really count).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll look at trying the low-power approach for the Eclipse as well. And as for the Mighty, because of the lack of pure LF tanks (and lack of tank fuel switch) that thing is going to be a nightmare to set up right. Need more thoughts on that subject, and on heating. Would people try to use the Mighty for smaller probes? Or would it be used on larger probes and using 1.25m and bigger LF tanks? What about clustering it? If people want to use it primarily for bigger vehicles leaving the other engines for small probes then that\u0027s great, it can have more thrust\u002Bmass for that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn other news I may also cut the Puffin (0.625m solid upper stage) since it can\u0027t really compete with the other options in that size with the exception of cost. The 1.25m solid upper is okay since it ends up with marginally higher dV than similar mass and thrust of tank\u002BTerrier. (And similar mass monoprop\u002BNimbus has a bit more dV than both, but less thrust and costs more.)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-27T23:03:23Z\u0022 title=\u002207/27/2015 11:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by hoojiwana\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
