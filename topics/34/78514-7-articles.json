Dolas has the same mass as Kerbol but is about 10 times smaller in diameter, so it would be somewhat of a white dwarf star. Of course these settings could all be changed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat would make sense physically is that planets at the same temperature would be closer in around the lower-luminosity star and farther out around the higher-luminosity star. Luminosity depends on the square of a star\u0027s radius and the 4th power of its temperature. So a planet at Kerbin\u0027s distance in orbit around Corbo would be much hotter than Kerbin, and a planet at Kerbin\u0027s distance around Dolas would be much colder than Kerbin (since in this case Corbo is much bigger than Kerbol, even if it has a slightly lower temperature, and Dolas is much smaller than Kerbol, even if it has a slightly higher temperature). But a Kerbin-like habitable planet could still exist if it orbited farther out around Corbo, or closer in around Dolas.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-22T01:57:21Z\u0022 title=\u002207/22/2014 01:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 22, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by metaphor\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"braininator","CreatedById":78003,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-22T01:56:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy current pack that I sent in has one habitable terrestrial planet, how I imaged earth to be like before more than unicellular life evolved.
