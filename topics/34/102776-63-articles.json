This pack has grown so much over the last year that i view it as more than just my pack, with the amount of players using it, and the amount of people who have helped out i view it more as a community project. I\u0027m in the middle of some work on RSS atm, so changes wont happen until I\u0027ve finished with all that and I can\u0027t promise how long it will take to complete either, but I\u0027ll keep everyone posted on the details.

HOWEVER many issues cause it to be held in contempt by myself. These issues drain my motivation to work on it and leave me with a general hate for the pack these days. I\u0027d like your opinion on how best to deal with these issues.

Although this is the pack you all know and love, it frustrates me a lot and my motivation to improve it is at an all-time low. Don\u0027t get me wrong though, support is still there, and planets are pretty much scope-complete.*\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOption 2\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E *Rework the bodies visuals to be better in line with stock \u0026 my other packs. If you have a look at my other packs, such as [UL](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/120111-105kopernicus-uncharted-lands-v03-13feb16-beta-than-ever/), or [KASE](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/132008-105kopernicus-kase-v01-13feb16-tentative-alpha/) you can see how much detail i can get onto these planets while staying in the realms of stock (compared to the hyper-realism NH has). Bringing in these changes will take time certainly, however they will add a better visual to the pack, and fit in better with my other packs and also other people\u0027s packs too. With this option i would also throw a lot of better changes to the planets, such as terrain variation, improved surface textures, lighting, etc.*\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOption 3\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E *Rework EVERYTHING. There\u0027s plenty about the terrain that annoys me also, however the pack has been going on for so long that I\u0027m extremely hesitant to touch it as it can be game-breaking. This would involve remaking everything from the ground up, so theres no guarantee how it would turn out or how long it would take.*\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Please feel free to voice your opinions here, as I\u0027d love to hear them, just please don\u0027t argue with each other about the outcome/their opinions.
