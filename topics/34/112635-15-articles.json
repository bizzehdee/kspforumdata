It\u0027s apparently less dense), so I decided not to use tweakscale on the hull. Plus it seemed to be exaggerating the bouncing around that happens when hyperedit places you on the water.\n\nI will look into this. However, in the near future the entire method of flotation for the pack may radically change. More on that later.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I thought that resizing root part thing was just me, I will probably look into that more after I finish delivering some cargo out to the north pole.\n\nApparently, it\u0027s not just us.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Hm, is the Yacht superstructure cockpit supposed to have the bathysphere IVA while in space? It shows three kerbals, but theres actually five onboard. I\u0027m not sure if it happened because I launched from the VAB or has something to do with my configuration, I didn\u0027t notice until I was already in space. It\u0027s my Laythe circumnavigation craft btw.\n\u003E Edit: I checked in another save this morning and yeah the Yacht superstructure \u0027pod\u0027 does have the bathysphere IVA from the start.\n\nUmmm yes. The IVA for the yacht is a placeholder. And KSP even produces an error in the log stating it\u0027s 3 vs 5. Should I ever get over my aversion to creating IVA\u0027s, that\u0027ll get fixed.

So, here\u0027s a long answer.\n\nIn the many hours of research I\u0027ve done on this lil project I\u0027ve come up with a gazillion ideas. Since there\u0027s only two of us actually working on ship mods, the field is wide open so there\u0027s gobs of parts that could be created. And yes, all of the things you have mentioned have been investigated and considered. However, I know first hand that InfiniteDice isn\u0027t creating any new parts. His RL obligations are making it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to maintain his own mod (Boat Parts). So that means, at the moment, I\u0027m the only person actively working on anything maritime for KSP. I can sum it up this way...\n\nSoooo many parts... Soooo little time.\n\nSo, here\u0027s how I prioritize what I\u0027m doing next:\n\n1. I have fun. If I cease to have fun, you cease to get parts. If you cease to get parts, you cease to have fun.\n\nDice told me that one of the issues he had with Boat Parts was that he ceased to have fun because he was spending more time filling requests rather than bringing to life what was in his head. I took that advice seriously. So, I\u0027m trying to balance what I want vs. what everyone else wants. \n\nDon\u0027t get me wrong. I LOVE suggestions and hope they keep coming. But, that being said, the core of Maritime is complete and the Clipper is just that. And already, with the paddlewheelers (something I wanted \u002B a very early request to transport lots of Kerbals) the core pack is over 40 parts. So, I have to consider fun factor vs increasing the pack size as well.\n\nNext, I have to consider function vs need. Yes, I\u0027d love to add in some more superstructure parts and that\u0027s in the idea book. But right now, the boats work without them. Adding in superstructure parts or stealth hulls would only be eye candy. While I like cool looking ships, I\u0027m trying to focus on functional first. So, to answer in turn:\n\n1. V shaped hulls - Using stock physics, it\u0027s not gonna happen. Flotation works on the amount of surface area contacting and below the surface. V hulls end up akin to balancing a pencil on it\u0027s tip. But a fix is being worked on.\n\n2. Superstructure, specifically military - I love blowing people and things up. Just not in KSP. I know others do. I spoke to the guys who are creating the new guns based on the Maritime Pack hull size and offered them the opportunity to have one of my models to base their designs on. I suggested that they focus on military while I focus on civilian maritime pursuits. They have not gotten back to me. I know they were considering working on boat hulls. I wish them luck in that little endeavor.\n\n3. Stealth - While a lot of the new boat designs out there look really cool, like stealth, for the moment, it would just be an eye candy part since there\u0027s no radar to avoid. Sorry, not real high on my priority list.\n\nSo, now that I\u0027ve basically tossed all of your suggestions into the proverbial garbage, let me hopefully cause you to raise an eyebrow with what has become my latest inspiration for the Maritime Pack.\n\n![MIGALOO_Private-submersible-yacht-by-motion-code-blue-21-1418x519.jpg](http://www.motioncodeblue.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/MIGALOO_Private-submersible-yacht-by-motion-code-blue-21-1418x519.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-01T11:23:53Z\u0022 title=\u002209/01/2015 11:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fengist**"}]}
