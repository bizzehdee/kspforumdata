But I have found a potential problem in the hall of fame loading method (the method is, well, a bit quirky because of some feature requests I have included in FF in later development - FF was not designed at first for custom ribbons and such things).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not really sure, but maybe this happens: FF prefetches all kerbals at startup from the roster. Then it loads the game. If a kerbal gets not prefetched (yet), the loading skips this log entry (a log entry is any action in a hall of fame entry (=kerbal) that is related to any FF data, such as begin a mission, end a mission, ribbon reward,...). At later time, the kerbal is found in the hall of fame, and things like ribbons gets loaded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would be clearly a bug, because the prefetching is not required. But I remember that I have changed some getters for the HallOfFame and it seems in this case the entry is not created (it should, it\u0027s a bug).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis could cause missing ribbons, too. It seems we have found at least one potential quirk, that could cause this. And because I do not really know when exactly KSP loads a kerbal in the roster...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT2: hmmm... to be honest, this cannot causing this. But I will add some log outputs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT3: But there is another issue... if FF loads its data, there is no running game yet. So there is no crew roster at all. The loading operations were done for the old halloffame.ksp and just gets recycled for loading from the persistence file. This is suspicious at least.
