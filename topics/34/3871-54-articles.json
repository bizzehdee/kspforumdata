When you do end up updating the file structure of the download for .20.x, can you also edit either the amount of fuel contained in the 3.75 meter tanks or the rate at which the 5x Bearcat engine burns fuel? It is far and away overpowered at this point, as I can complete my gravity turn with just my first stage when using 1 full-size and 1 half-size 3.75 meter tank from this pack along with the engine, pretty much regardless of payload.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
