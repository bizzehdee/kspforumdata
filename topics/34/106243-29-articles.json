(0.5: at 50% resource the animation is at the last frame.) }\n\n**What does it?**\n\nThis Module allows you to link an animation with the amount of stored resources on a part. Now we can visualize the tank-status directly on the model.\n\n**Details on how the resources are linked**\n\nWithout the \u0022resourceName\u0022 node defined all resources stored in the part will be taken into account, except resources without mass (EC, Megajoule). This is very usefull for tanks that hold 2 fuels at the same time or use FuelSwitch setups with lots of different setups.\n\n**Examples**\n\nOne example is the IFS Inflatable Storage Tank that uses this module. As shown in the picture below, the spherical tank grows with the amount of stored Air. This is an example that uses \u0022maximumRatio = 0.5\u0022. When the tank is half full, the sphere has reached its max volume (end of the animation) and filling the tank further is not animated anymore. To animate pressurized gas tanks for example.  \n![ftynQoB.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/ftynQoB.jpg)\n\nAn example with bars indicating the amount of fuel can be found on most of the new tanks. You\u0027ll notice some blue (or red) little bars that show how much content the tank currently holds (blue=full, red=empty).  \n![PnxyCfU.png](http://i.imgur.com/PnxyCfU.png)\n\nA big THANK YOU to [@FreeThinker](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/117389-freethinker/) who realized this new module.\n\nI hope this explanation is somewhat usefull and you guys have as much fun with it as I did.
