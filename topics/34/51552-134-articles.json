I have looked through the posts and can not seem to find out how to do this. Many of the parts from, say AIES still work even though they have no connection. And on the other side I have antennas and dishes that dont have the ability to become disconnected. I have found posts saying to add ModuleSPU to the parts but cannot seem to figure out how to do so. I have gone into the parts that do work and tried to copy the code out but can\u0027t seem to get it to work. One of my main problems is that for some reason my RT Reflectron DP-10 is not working.
