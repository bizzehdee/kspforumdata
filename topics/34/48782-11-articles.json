From this TreeLoader can warn the user if they are about to use a tree they don\u0027t have mods for and also, I think more importantly, can read a message from the author about the tree itself.

Also, since only those tree.cfgs that the player downloads will be scanned into the list, it ensures that the list remains short and easily handled by the player even if everyone and their grandmother starts using TreeEdit. For mods who do not currently have their tree hosted, this greatly simplifies the installation process (they no longer need to ask their users to go through the clumsy process of creating a game, existing the client, manually placing a file into the save folder and reloading).
