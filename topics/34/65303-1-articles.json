Since the flag becomes a large banner hanging in the hangers, these could hang adding a cool image versus just the plain flag. Don\u0027t forget to switch it though before flight if you don\u0027t intend to plant that picture in the soil haha.

All I would need is the emblem or symbol of said companies. Often there are OLLLLDDD companies, now defunk\u0027d that have great emblems to manipulate or even barrow in their entirety. There are also TONS of emblems and symbols on the public domain created by people past and present. A quick google search will provide them. An example is the Scorpion tail symbol I made into one of the flags. I just typed \u0022symbols\u0022 into image search and many many sheets of random symbols and emblems were brought up. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst thing though would be someone willing to compile a list of every company, then the creators of said company chosing or providing an emblem.
