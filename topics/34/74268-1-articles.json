The WheelCollider system is slip-based, which means the friction force depends on the amount of slip (in m/s), and does not follow coulomb\u0027s laws.

Then i realized that along with a tweaking mod, this can be useful for tuning race cars in challenges like Formula K. I don\u0027t plan to release any significant updates to this now, it already does its job pretty well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd i was going to upload the source but i forgot, thanks for reminding.
