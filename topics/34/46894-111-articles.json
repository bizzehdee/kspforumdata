It is to my understanding that 1.1 will basically break all mods including just simply part mods? So I think we need to wait for 1.1 since that very much can be seen on the horizon. If and only if a substantial amount of time has passed without hearing word from K\u0026amp;W then we can discuss this mod being dead. Even then as it was stated this mod has an optimal license that will ensure its survival long past K\u0026amp;W. Patience is something that is sorely missing from this community along with appreciation.

In my opinion this mod is being abandoned slowly (There are more important things in life than modding, I understand that). Since 1.0.5 is coming we should wait and see what changes are made and then adapt the mod to the new release.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FalconB","CreatedById":139205,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-12T04:26:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood night, sorry for the question , maybe answered but couldt find the answer in the thread ...but i hope you can help me\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis version of rocketry works correctly on ksp 1.0.4 ? because with me crash in the atmosphere\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[h=1][/h]\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nicogusuarez","CreatedById":137898,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-12T14:11:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022FalconB\u0022 data-cite=\u0022FalconB\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EGood night, sorry for the question , maybe answered but couldt find the answer in the thread ...but i hope you can help me\u003Cp\u003EThis version of rocketry works correctly on ksp 1.0.4 ? because with me crash in the atmosphere\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt should work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MalevolentNinja","CreatedById":150038,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-20T20:31:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow I came here to comment on just how awesome this mod is and fell into a pit of drama! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI seriously hope the mod authors still read comments here, not because I expect anything from them (btw it works 100% fine for me with the community fixes patch), but because I want them to know that every single time I launch a rocket with a Griffon Century engine I get a huge smile on my face.
