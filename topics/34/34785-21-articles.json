Also, since I am on Linux, tried right-shift\u002Bh. (right-shift is of course the default mod key for KSP Linux.) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do have a pretty nice keyboard and it might be the issue. It is a razer BlackWidow ... I love the thing. (I\u0027m a software developer by trade, so I spend a LOT of time with my keyboard as I know you understand ... this thing just has a fantastic touch.) But perhaps it is the issue. I will give it a try. Don\u0027t think I have any exotic drivers on this rig ... but it is a dual monitor setup. Maybe I should temporarily un-install the second monitor? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDrivers ... I am running the NVIDIA accelerated graphics drive version 331-updates. I\u0027m using a Galaxy GE Force GTS 250 graphics card ... an older unit but well supported on Linux and while a fairly nice card it is by no means exotic. I have a Thrustmaster 7-axis joy stick but I configure it through KSP ... just use the standard jstest-gtk package for calibration and to null the axes before game start. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just repeated the experiment ... cleaned out my KSP local data, removed all the leftovers and re-installed from steam. Made a clean KSP tar ball so I can get back to that state quickly in the future. The dropped in HyperEdit ... still no luck. I\u0027ve tried both 32 and 64 bit programs with the same results. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd, as near as I can determine, I am one of the few if not the only Linux user experiencing this issue. So it HAS to be something with my setup. There are NO errors in the log file. I\u0027m pretty determined to run this to ground, tho ... I want to use this tool to accelerate my lander testing and it looks to be just a fun thing to have, If I don\u0027t get any clues soon I am going to start subtracting hardware (second monitor, joystick, sound, etc) until it either works or I am down to bare bones. When I figure it out I will definitely let you know. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks again\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ezriilc","CreatedById":34556,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-08T23:56:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022BadScientist\u0022 data-cite=\u0022BadScientist\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E I\u0027m pretty determined to run this to ground, tho ... \u003Cp\u003E...\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EI\u0027ll say!

I use it for testing / proofing design concepts and learning how to use new/different things in my sandbox game save before recreating the design in my career mode. I got sucked down this path because I was starting to add a couple of mods to the stock game. I found HyperEdit while looking for something to quickly put ScanSAT\u0027s into orbit so I could learn the mod. After bouncing satellites around all over the system (and learning HyperEdit at the same time) I started playing with Karbonite mod. That was the first time I ran into the explosions (a rover design). Just a couple of them, really couldn\u0027t figure out why they were ack-ploding so I put it on the back burner and started playing with OKS/MKS. I was trying to design a U shaped ground rover to ride up to the different modules and scoot them into place around the runway using the expand-o-tubes in the mod. The modules have bases with integrated lander legs and they kept blowing up when I HyperEdit them to the runway coordinates. The Rover design was to attach to the module base while the lander legs were extended, then fold up the lander legs and have the rover move the module to it\u0027s new home, preferably without tipping over. I can certainly come up with different ways to do things .. but yeah .. that was what led me here! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E I was trying to figure out if it was my designs or the mod or just KSP doing weird things.

I spent some time POKEing around KSC with some different designs today. The explosions happen with rover wheels as well, but not all of the wheels do it right on the Launchpad (using VAB instead of SPH for consistency with testing lander legs / rover wheels). So just for the fun of it I started PEEKing under the hood at the part.cfg files for the Rovermax XL3 wheels and changing values. I put 4 of them on a Mk1 lander can using symmetry. A couple of hours later (I do love a challenge!) I have 3 observations:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.) Changing the mass value to something stupidly low (0.0005 if I recall correctly) stops the instant explosions. The craft simply spins around the center of mass a few times and then settles down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.) Changing the angulardrag value to something around 50.0 (with the mass still at low value) stops the majority of the induced spin. The craft still rotates approximately 45-90 degrees and stops on its\u0027 own.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.) Changing the same values on the lander legs did not stop the explosions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course changing the mass value broke some other things with that particular part .. for instance the lander can slides up and down *inside* the area between the wheels. The wheels didn\u0027t move up and down. So yeah, it breaks other things pretty badly. I have no idea why these certain parts are doing this while something like the girder XL doesn\u0027t. I\u0027m guessing the math within KSP behind how the parts are attached/massed/angled/ all combine to calculate spin forces so vast that the instant application of them is literally spinning the ship apart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry, all this rambling is much longer than I expected it to be.

I GOT IT WORKING!! I can now get into HyperEdit on KSP/Linux. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the background. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt looks like the default mod key for KSP on Linux got switched to ALT instead of RIGHT-SHIFT at some point. Well, I noticed that, after I successfully performed a REAL clean download of KSP from Steam, I couldn\u0027t access any functions involving the modifier key. In the past, right-shift had been the modifier key but reading through the forums that had changed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E ALT-F12 and other mod key combinations (and even mod key-right click) just don\u0027t work on Ubuntu 12.04-LTS. I compared my backed up settings.cfg to the one that came in with the clean install and noticed that difference, and found some discussion of the problem on the forums regarding this. The speculation on the forums was that the Unity user interface (not the game engine) picks off ALT ... this is true! ALT brings up Ubuntu\u0027s HUD display. (I never use that thing.) So I edited settings.cfg and set it back to RIGHT-SHIFT, and was able to access the debug screen, named saves, etc again. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis what I have now (after editing it). This restore KSP itself to normal modifier key operation. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMODIFIER_KEY\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E{\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E primary = RightShift\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E secondary = None\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E group = 0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E switchState = Any\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E}\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut HyperEdit still wouldn\u0027t come up. So ... I found a way to disable the Ubuntu HUD. The procedure that worked for me: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Install Compbiz Configuration Settings Manager.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E( sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager )\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Under the Desktop Section, click the Ubuntu Unity Plugin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Disable the ALT key to show the HUD (It\u0027s the very first setting.) - You can set this to one of the other three key options if you\u0027d like.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Taken from this discussion thread on another forum: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://community.secondlife.com/t5/Second-Life-Viewer/Alt-key-in-Ubuntu-12-04-Unity-window-manager/td-p/1511257\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://community.secondlife.com/t5/Second-Life-Viewer/Alt-key-in-Ubuntu-12-04-Unity-window-manager/td-p/1511257\u003C/a\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, the ALT key is not being picked off by Ubuntu.
