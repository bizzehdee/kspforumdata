The experiments make similar amounts of drag, the landing legs don\u0027t make that much, but that\u0027s counterbalanced by their distance from the CoM.

Remember, the point of rotation (pivot) is the wheel. If the gear are too far behind the CoM, then it takes a very large of control surface action to get your craft to rotate for takeoff because all the weight is sitting out in front of a fulcrum like your arm outstretched carrying a 50 kg weight. This initial action may far exceed what the craft needs once its airborne. So the result of this action is that the craft refuses to pick itself up no matter how hard you pull on the stick, then as you hit a critical airspeed, control surface acquires enough force \u0026gt; the aircraft picks up \u0026gt; and lurches back before you can ease off the stick and you throw yourself into a stall almost off the runway. Putting canards on the front in this situation provides lift and control surface action out ahead of the center of mass to pick the nose up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, if your wheels are too far forward, you risk a tail strike. However, if your aircraft suffers chronic tail strike issues, then the problem may also be landing gear that are too short, or insufficient lift for your mass requiring a steep angle of attack (And the resultant engine smack.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you suffer roll stability issues, try checking how high your center of lift is. I\u0027ve not skimmed much here to know if it\u0027s covered. So far I see CoL covered as far as how forward or back it is. But for getting the hang of things and producing a stable aircraft, try raising it. Note a lot a stable aircraft have wings that are high (Cessna Skyhawk, C-130 where the wings are on top), or a lot of aircraft have upward canted (V-shaped) wings. Raising the center of lift above the CoM helps. Of course, the mental image of a pendulum comes to mind, but that is incorrect. For more on that, just hit up Wikipedia and read up on relaxed stability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I have my own set of problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have an aircraft that likes to fly SOOOOO much, that it refuses to come down without pitching a fit... and half its parts down the runway in a flaming ball of glory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt can\u0027t/won\u0027t \u003Cem\u003ESLOW DOWN.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://smg.photobucket.com/user/admiraltigerclaw/media/TDX1_zps746849c5.jpg.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v430/admiraltigerclaw/TDX1_zps746849c5.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022TDX1_zps746849c5.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://smg.photobucket.com/user/admiraltigerclaw/media/TDX2_zpsec5baf7d.jpg.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v430/admiraltigerclaw/TDX2_zpsec5baf7d.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022TDX2_zpsec5baf7d.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWonderful aircraft.
