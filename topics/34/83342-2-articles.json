Makes new ships take over 30 to 50 Kerbin days to build and makes them not take less time until several builds have used the same parts, but makes the inventory have a bigger effect. Works pretty well for pushing reusability as hard as possible. I\u0027m trying to upgrade my SPH so I can try using space planes for the first time, since they have such fast turn arounds (2 days probably, compared to 40). After a year I have yet to even attempt a Mun run. Did put up a satellite but forgot any science instruments.

You can then go into the editor and take one of those launchers, throw a payload on it, then build it for basically just the cost of the payload. Alternatively, after the launcher is built you Edit it (press the asterisk button to get to the edit/scrap options) and add the payload on there.

Often the output_log.txt file is more useful than the KSP.log file (which honestly is totally useless for modders which makes me sad, same with the in-game debug log. Neither of them print stacktraces so you can\u0027t find out anything about errors, just that the errors happened) so you should generally include that one if you can.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vayir","CreatedById":103529,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-03T06:47:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the x64 version does not appear buttons construction and simulation.
