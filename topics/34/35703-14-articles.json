In 0.90 you can now vertical snap in increments, but you can\u0027t have a consistent starting point, which... is bad. You can snap onto a random position then move in consistent increments up or down, but the starting position has an infinite level of variation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI get it if the mod will be retired (though I do hope it won\u0027t).
