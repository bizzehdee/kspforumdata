The older versions had issues with config interpretation, made some textures unreadable that shouldn\u0027t have been (specifically Interstellar resource maps and rasterprops images), resized images that shouldn\u0027t have been, and had major bugs in memory use due to copy paste issues. Due to these, there is some actual extra memory use in the new version in some cases, but it is necessary for some mods to work. I\u0027m pretty darn confident in this iteration though.
