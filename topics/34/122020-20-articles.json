Meanwhile, of the probes there that are of interest to us, say, Vanguard, Pioneer, we run into the same issue as we had with Explorer: The probe would be too small and too oddly shaped to be used in a wide range of capacities. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0026#39;ve been wishy washy on doing a version of the Ranger probe bus, seeing as Lack already has a fantastic one.

I was able to devote a couple hours tonight to making a couple new probe parts. The first is (finally) finishing up a part I started working on back in September, the engine module from a Lunar Orbiter probe. It is basically a tiny self contained propulsion section for probes - fuel, a small mono engine, and 4 RCS thrusters to keep two-axis control. To demonstrate, I launched a probe into lunar orbit aboard a custom launcher.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[imgur]Ejke2[/imgur]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe second thing, I know a lot of people want RCS thrusters that can also be used for some manuevers here or there. So I made a 3-way corner RCS, for use with cubesats or really anything. There are two flavors - normal, and one with an enlarged bottom thruster. This second one has an overdrive feature on the bottom thruster. Controlled via the throttle, it still functions as an RCS thruster. To demonstrate, I launched a weather satellite into high orbit over Kerbin. The thing on top is a DMagic GOREsat module.
