This unusual planet seems to be a super-terra, an incredibly dense planet with a thick atmosphere. While preliminary analysis shows a thick oxygen-rich atmosphere, it appears that the temperature at the planets surface would be far too cold to sustain any viable life. Politicians have already begun discussing plans on the viability of a surface colony, seemingly unaware of the crushing pressure generated not only by it\u0027s incredibly thick atmosphere, but by it\u0027s surface gravity which appears to be over twice as strong as our homeworld. While the probe itself is preparing for it\u0027s descent into the body\u0027s ring system to run experiments about it\u0027s composition, initial observations already spot at least one shepherding moon in it\u0027s outer layers. The body itself only has one noticeable moon, however KSC scientists argue that there could be more that are simply too small to detect with the on-board sensors. As always, more information will become available once the glorious KSC finishes it\u0027s experiments.\n\nSpoiler\n\n![SKgJfOO.png](http://i.imgur.com/SKgJfOO.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"ibuckshot5","CreatedById":144026,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-13T23:53:34Z","Content":"Titanus 2?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-16T19:35:24Z\u0022 title=\u002205/16/2016 07:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 16, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by ibuckshot5**"},{"CreatedByName":"BashGordon33","CreatedById":163808,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-15T01:12:59Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 08/05/2016 at 5:50 AM, KillAshley said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E OK so before the situation goes further, yes sub-satellites are possible, but they are very VERY rare as the orbits they have would be inherently unstable. I was given the suggestion for a sub satellite over a year ago during the first few months of NH\u0027s creation, however it\u0027s something that i wont do given it\u0027s instability. The compromise i made was to create a \u0022new Minmus\u0022 and have it relatively easy to get to, which is how Aptur came to be. Although I will be juggling things around to create a more stable structure to the system, adding a moon to Kerbin, or considering any other sub-satellite idea, isn\u0027t on the agenda.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Also in regards to the suggestion by [@Therlun](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/133436-therlun/) about the \u0022normal start\u0022 principle, this has been asked for in the past and I have always said no, as the main challenge for NH was the starting point, and having to re-balance everything to adjust for a normal Kerbin start position is more work than I\u0027m willing to do ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif \u0022:P\u0022)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Also one more thing;\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E **Breaking News!**\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E While coming into the gravity well of Jool, one of the KSC\u0027s prize probes spotted a glimpse of one of the more unusual moons of Jool. It has been reported by scientists all over Kerbin that this newly-discovered moon would be made up of almost pure ice with a lot of impurities the further down into the terrain you go. Although Scientists are unsure of the composition of the subterranean chemicals present in the moon, as the probe was only able to get a distant, passing glimpse, they are only certain of one thing; it\u0027s pink color is VERY pleasing to the eye. While current information is till very limited due to the distance at which the probe passed the moon, it appears that would resemble deep tectonic cracks run across it\u0027s surface. Scientists hypothesize that these cracks are not from internal planetary activity, but merely crevasses formed due to the constant melting and movement of it\u0027s glacier-like surface.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Hide contents\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E ![rMVU9tq.png](http://i.imgur.com/rMVU9tq.png)\n\u003E \n\nAaaaaaawwwww yyyeeeeaaaahhh EUROPA CONFIRMED!!! \n\nAlso, the top of the forum says NH is compatible with Outer Planets Mod.

And theoretically sub-satellites are possible, but they require a large planet, really far away from the sun, and a large moon, really far away from the planet. This way the planet acts like a surrogate sun. When you think about it, the sun orbits the Srgt A\\* black hole, and we orbit the sun, and the moon orbits us. When you make the sun a planet and the black hole a star, the moon is a sub satellite. The reason this can exist is because the influence of Srgt A\\* is virtually non existant. These conditions are extremely finicky, and require exceptional circumstances, so in reality it never really happens"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-15T11:54:29Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 6 hours ago, BashGordon33 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027ve been trying to modify NH configs forever, but when I do and launch KSP it finished the loading bar, goes to the plain black loading screen and stays there.

Large crystalline areas of land containing a thick layer of ground salts show that while the planet is dead now, a thriving ecosystem used to exist with large oceans surrounding continents just like Kerbin. Many artisans like to paint what Serran used to be like when it was life-bearing, and the majority of them paint blue vegetation across the planet. It is unknown why they chose this specific color. One thing for sure is that despite it\u0027s current situation, the body seems to hold a rudimentary oxygen atmosphere, breathable by Kerbal-kind, however the pressure is too low for extended exposure.

I\u0027m going to be reworking them to the same standard as my KASE pack, so they can be played side-by-side. Size and mass will be staying the same for MOST bodies, however some of the smallest bodies (astid, ete, oree, etc....) have been made from scratch, so they will be completely different (I\u0027m super happy with Ete ^o^ )\n\nhopefully theres nothing a little hyperedit can\u0027t fix for the players, however it will break everyones game in that regards ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif \u0022:P\u0022)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-21T08:31:00Z\u0022 title=\u002205/21/2016 08:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 21, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by KillAshley**"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-21T08:50:01Z","Content":"I see.\n\nWhat does that mean in terms of replacing planet textures?

Love KSPRC though, cant say that enough! but I work on making planets look the best they can with only kopernicus, and I get pretty awesome results. For a long time I\u0027ve focused on purely stock features only for planets (although i basically ignored NH) even going so far as to only use ground textures found in the assets, trying to make it look great without scatterer, without EVE, without anything else. If you check out KASE in my sig you\u0027ll see what I mean by the look NH2 will have."}]}
