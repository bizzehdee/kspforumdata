What I have now adds 3 tanks in the current sizes, a variant of the large tank with 3.75m endcaps, and a 7.5m diameter toroidal tank with 2.5m connectors. I also have cfg files set up for each of the tanks containing LFO, Monopropellant, LiquidFuel, Kethane, and Oxygen (For Ioncross Crew Support).

I haven\u0027t been happy with my models for adapters, so I made variations of the large and small tanks to go into the set. The large will now be available with either 3.75m or 2.5m endcaps, and the small will be available with 1.5m or 0.625m endcaps. The size of the endcap will not affect the capacity of the tanks, just the connections on the ends. I tried making versions of the medium sized tank with 2.5m or 0.625m endcaps, but they didn\u0027t look very good. IIRC, the two variants that I made were the most requested adjustments. The half-tanks will be available in all variants as well. By request, I\u0027m also including monopropellant tanks in the large sizes as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Talisar","CreatedById":62035,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-29T22:23:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy new, optimized pack has been released.
