KSP\u0027s math isn\u0027t perfect during high warps. The little simplifications add up. Geo-stationary may look pretty, but just isn\u0027t worth the effort. Anything that requires maintenance defeats the purpose. And if you are playing under career mode, the low-power engines necessary to perfect an orbit aren\u0027t available when you need them. The molniya orbit\u0027s I described are very simple, do not require exact positioning, and survive decades of warping without degradation.\u003Cp\u003EWhether one describes an orbit in terms of dimensions (altitudes) or periods is wholly a matter of preference. I prefer dimensions because apoapsis\u002Bperiapsis provides an exact description, whereas two very different orbits can share identical periods (ie a molniya orbit with a 6h period is not properly geo-stationary).\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m thinking I\u0027m going to be looking at doing your moniya type setup.

They now have a very low periapsis (80km\u002B/-) and high apoapsis (3000km \u002B/-). Their orbital speeds vary from around 560m/s at apoapsis to 3000m/s at periapsis. This means most of their time is spent loitering high over Kerbin, where they are best able to act as relays to the KSC. I have also left a couple sats in their initial 700km orbits to act as links between the Molniyas. Because orbits are stable in KSP, there is no clumping. Each relay remains clearly separated in its respective orbit.
