I mean, yeh, fancy \u0022balancing\u0022 options are good, but enabling \u0022transfer out\u0022 on a bunch of tanks on a refueling station will lead to the same behaviour. But allow more different solutions. Probably a \u0022rank\u0022 of this options can be added, like tanks with \u0022transfer out\u0022 of higher rank than some other tanks with lower ranked \u0022transfer out\u0022 will be able to transfer fuel in them despite the \u0022transfer out\u0022 flag.

This can make a great advantage of this mod over the TAC balancer. The problem with TAC is its inability to quickly select the right tank and remember the state. All other functions it has already. Not to sound rude but I think it is the only missing part in TAC and a different mod that do the same (or lesser) thing as it isn\u0027t more than a clone. Now, when many people are already accustomed to TAC, few of them will chose something new if it doesn\u0027t provide some really needed new functions. Of course all is up to you, but I guarantee you will get more downloads for such improvements.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I should have really done some testing \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Ebefore\u003C/span\u003E judging...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, you\u0027ve already done the \u0022out\u0022 part. Good. I see numbers of the highest tank blickering if it isn\u0027t set to be drained first. Not a big deal, but is means that the engine still drains fuel from there, and then the mod quickly moves new fuell in it again. Probably would be beter if the engine drained fuel from the specific chosen tank and then in order set in the mod (like with stock fuel pumps), instead of the stock way \u0022from up to down\u0022, but, once again, I\u0027m not a modder to know how difficult it can be to implement. So, how about the \u0022in\u0022 part? Can be useful. Also other thing- \u0022balance in\u0022 and \u0022balance out\u0022 of each level can be added, also often useful with staging.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-01T17:21:42Z\u0022 title=\u002202/01/2014 05:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 1, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Absolute Human\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaius","CreatedById":66495,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-01T22:51:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust to clear up a misconception (it\u0027s in your greyed out text, but it\u0027s still there, and worth addressing I think): the tank selection issue wasn\u0027t my main issue with TACFB. What TACFB doesn\u0027t do that I most wanted is fill my tanks \u003Cem\u003Eautomatically \u003C/em\u003Eas soon as I dock with my refueling station, or fill the fueling station automatically when I dock my tanker, or let me set up balancing in the SPH and have it saved with the craft so \u003Cem\u003EI don\u0027t have to remember\u003C/em\u003E to monkey with it. In short, this is designed to be used by the kind of person who forgets what he was doing after chasing kids off his lawn and doesn\u0027t notice until he\u0027s stranded another poor kerbal somewhere that he forgot to fill his tanks before undocking (for the umpteenth time today). I wrote this to do that for me automatically, and, as I noted previously, I still have TACFB installed and I still use that as well. For me personally, this is meant to \u003Cem\u003Eaugment \u003C/em\u003ETACFB, not necessarily entirely replace it, although for some people it might do that, if the only things they were using TACFB for are things this does as well. Fine by me either way, but it\u0027s not a goal of mine to make this a complete TACFB replacement. Should TAC add these features to TACFB, I\u0027ll be overjoyed and stop using my own mod. TAC has permission to merge my code into TACFB, but I can\u0027t say for certain when or even if TAC will incorporate these features. Just sayin\u0027... not my goal to do everything TACFB does, there were just a couple things I wished TACFB did that it doesn\u0027t, so this handled that. I\u0027ve since added some configuration options to make different use cases easier, and plan to add at least one more, but ultimately I\u0027m not interested in extending the functionality of this mod beyond what it currently does, just in refinements that make sure it does what it does as well as possible without overly complicating it. Being a complete TACFB replacement is outside of my scope, and pointless since I still have TACFB installed and quite like it, I just wish it did a couple more things that it doesn\u0027t (currently) do. That\u0027s where this comes in, and probably where it goes out, if/when TACFB gains these features, hopefully making my own mod entirely obsolete.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Surefoot","CreatedById":89084,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-01T22:58:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah the possibilities of this mod along with TAC FB are mind boggling.
