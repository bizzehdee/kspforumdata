Kerbals, being fairly small, obviously have shorter digestive tracts than humans. That means that, like Earth cats, they have more stringent requirements on what they can and cannot eat \u2013 particularly I\u0027d expect less tolerance of non-digestible stuffing (because they can\u0027t process it away). Things really depend on details (rats are pretty good at being highly adaptable omnivores, but they\u0027re also very small), but I wouldn\u0027t be surprised at all if they were obligate carnivores.

There are three stock parts, one for each of these.  The hitchhiker is just a big can with lots of space.  The cupola is pretty and works as a multiplier.

I can see the point in having the Hitchhiker NOT having the recycler, though... partially it\u0027s the fact that there are only the 2 deep space parts (non-aircraft) that have seats at all, so you have basically no choices to work with (the mass of the recycler equipment is totally more plausible within the huge science lab, I \u0022get\u0022 that).

Will there be stand-alone recyclers?\n\n2. Is the cupola supposed to be the only part with a hab multiplier? If so, what\u0027s the design rationale so that it can be added consistently for mod parts?

I can even get that the \u0022rec\u0022 area of a \u0022cupola\u0022 might increase wellbeing, but the lab as a \u0022crash pad\u0022 is *vastly* superior to 2 crew sleeping/eating/making mulch in their Mk1 pods, yet they have identical habitation values when both have the cupola. Note that the MPL and supplies MINUS the cupola is rated as 4 times LESS habitable than 2 mk1 pods with the little cupola. This makes no sense to me.\n\nWhile the mass is about 4X larger, the volume (I made a stacked blob of mk1 pods), the volume of the MPL is on the order of 15X that of the Mk1. Somewhat counterintuitive.\n\nSo your baseline assumption in the early versions was that the pods, etc are good for 15 days, then extra supplies needed past that. The hab value and recyclers extend this idea, which is great. \n\nYour code remarks say:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Quote\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E //For dedicated hab parts (no other generators, etc.):  \n\u003E \n\u003E //  Kerbal Months should equal mass \\* 5  \n\u003E \n\u003E //    ReplacementParts = 100 \\* crew capacity \u002B 100 \\* Kerbal Months.   \n\u003E \n\u003E //  \n\u003E \n\u003E //For parts that act as hab multipliers (dedicated or bundled with other functions/converters),  \n\u003E \n\u003E //a multiplier equal to the tonnage works well.\n\u003E \n\nSeems like the hab multipliers should be less based upon part weight, and rather more just what you (or related, compatible mod authors) think seems right based upon frankly subjective factors to get the right balance. What would happen if a part got a fractional hab multiplier? Perhaps areas that are just \u0022cockpits\u0022 get a 0.75? \n\nThe MPL is about 18m^3^, and the HH is about 12m^3^. The cupola is about 5m^3^.

The IVA doesn\u0027t show it as filled, however, it\u0027s 3 floors of fairly open volume (certainly compared to a mk1 pod).

My point was that I think that the multiplier in particular is oddly determined. My post right after yours shows the real issue. 2mk1 pods are exactly as habitable as the MPL. The usable volume of the mk1 pod is basically the blue seat you see kerbals on in the MPL IVA, and the MPL\u0027s volume is vastly larger. \n\nWonder if it could get a hab multiplier?\n\nI just added a MM patch making a hab multiplier equal to the cupola for the MPL. With 2 crew the hab value goes from 30 days to 82, which is still less than 2 mk1 pods attached to a cupola. Using the whole mass would be too much I think (assuming that a chunk of the upper and lower decks have the recycler stuff taking a lot of the room). Call the recycler nearly half of each of the 2 (unseen) other decks, then maybe use a hab multiplier of 2.5 (out of the mass of 3.5).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-28T20:29:55Z\u0022 title=\u002201/28/2016 08:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 28, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by tater**"},{"CreatedByName":"Fraz86","CreatedById":90101,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-28T21:03:40Z","Content":"[@RoverDude](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/105198-roverdude/) I\u0027m concerned regarding the current balance between parts that add a HabMultiplier (e.g., the cupola) vs those that add KerbalMonths (e.g., the Hitchhiker). Due to the nature of multiplication vs addition, there will always be a vessel hab rating threshold, above which the addition of a HabMultiplier part yields a greater increase in Habitation time for a given number of Kerbals, and below which, parts that add KerbalMonths are superior. That\u0027s fair enough.\n\nThe problem is that this threshold is currently very low. If a vessel has at least 5 capacity (a total hab rating of 150d for a single Kerbal), the addition of a cupola will yield a greater increase in hab time per unit mass (((5 original capacity \u002B 1 seat added by cupola) \\* (1 default multiplier \u002B 1.76 HabMultiplier) - 5 original capacity) / 1.76 cupola mass = **6.5682 KM added per ton**) than a Hitchhiker (((5 original capacity \u002B 4 seats added by Hitchhiker \u002B 12 KM added by Hitchhiker) \\* (1 default multiplier) - 5 original capacity) / 2.5 Hitchhiker mass = **6.4 KM added per ton**).\n\nBasically, adding a cupola turns out to be the best choice for increasing hab rating, so long as you\u0027re starting with at least 5 crew capacity (e.g., a Mk1-2 pod and a lab). It seems to me that this threshold should be significantly higher.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-28T23:57:21Z\u0022 title=\u002201/28/2016 11:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 28, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Fraz86**"},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-28T23:57:51Z","Content":"I\u0027m fine with the threshold as-is, especially given the MKS changes and it\u0027s expected effect on base size.
