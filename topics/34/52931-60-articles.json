I\u0027m pretty sure it\u0027s Chutes though, as whenever I try to use a re-sized stack/radial chute, the chute icons won\u0027t appear in staging on the launch pad. Attempting to reload and edit the craft, lead to out of memory crashes or freezes. It may be a conflict with some other mod on the list, but...

Not sure that the other behavior I\u0027ve experienced is memory related though. Sorry I forgot to mention it in the initial post, but there\u0027s more going wrong than just the icon not showing in staging when that happens: I\u0027ll launch the rocket, and it won\u0027t move. Oh, the clamps have released, engines are fired, \u0026gt;1.2 TWR/SLT on the pad. Just won\u0027t move. Can\u0027t even make it tip over. Just sits there, engines going. Other times parts mounted before/above a stack chute will just fall off as soon as physics finishes loading on the pad. I\u0027d been trying to re-create that event when I got a memory crash, which is the log I uploaded. Should I try again and just post the log if I manage to re-create on the pad, without a memory crash?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for chopping down the mod list... I still haven\u0027t gone as far as removing parts I don\u0027t use (career mode game, haven\u0027t maxed the tech tree yet), but once I know what I don\u0027t actually use/need(re-size dependencies of parts I do use in some cases), that should help with the memory crashes a bit. Though even then, I\u0027ve learned that memory crashes are just a fact of playing with this large a mod list. So I save a lot and only do three or four scene switches at max, before closing out of the game and reloading the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOtherwise, great mod, it\u0027s really added to the overall depth of designing a payload that\u0027ll survive re-entry.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
