Instead of \u0022Tanks\u0022 the folder is called \u0022Parts, and I also have one \u0022CTT.cfg\u0022 file and a text document ChangeLog.\n\u003E Ways in which my experience was different than the video above when trying to replicate the exact same thing:\n\u003E \n\u003E - I did not see a message that the Kerbal had died (maybe slick50 has CausesDeath = true?).\n\u003E \n\u003E - When I EVA while looking at the mod window both timers start counting down (the pod and the Kerbal), not just the pod as shown in the video (Although the Kerbal data briefly flashes in his).\n\u003E \n\u003E - My Kerbal didn\u0027t eat his greens and jump to the North pole.\n\u003E \n\u003E Otherwise than that it was the exact same. I could EVA and control as much as I liked with starved Kerbal. I also changed the mission time to MET to see I was well past 15 days, and used the reaction wheels to see I had control of the ship.\n\u003E \n\u003E Others notes:\n\u003E \n\u003E I have MM version 2.6.3, he has 2.6.2.\n\u003E \n\u003E The only mod I have in common with him (other than this) is Stage Recovery, I did try once without it and seen no fix.\n\nKerbals can Eva forever while starved I believe. They won\u0027t suffer any effects until they enter a ship at which point they will either eat, or go on strike if no supplies. That\u0027s the way I understand how it works. They don\u0027t take any supplies with them. Of course if you have death on they may die while out there I\u0027m not sure. But I\u0027m pretty sure there are no supplies used on Eva, because they don\u0027t take any with them like how TAC LS does.\n\nAs far as the kerbal flying off into some location I\u0027m not sure that is a life support issue, I suppose it could be caused by it but I\u0027ve seen weird things like that happen before.\n\nso is the issue that they don\u0027t go on strike while on Eva? Or is there another issue you are having? You talked about Eva then about controlling ships so I\u0027m not sure.\n\nre: the video posted above, did Roverdude implement LS similar to TAC? Because TAC LS would not start on launchpads. Only once the craft was launched did the LS function start.

But if they are brought back aboard a ship and have been starved (and can\u0027t find a hot meal waiting) they will promptly go in strike, and begin their self imposed vacation immediately.\n\nHowever, if they have reached the point of strike already that should stop them exiting (this is an assumption from me), so it\u0027s a way to test the functionality. Other things I did were wobble the controls and turn systems (SAS, lights, etc) on and off to check. The issue I\u0027m having is there is no strike action happening in pods or anywhere, they continue as normal.\n\nI considered that there may be a safety for when on the launch pad or Kerbal in general, so I did boost into a 500,000 KM orbit a few times (So I could use highest level of time-accelerate up there)."},{"CreatedByName":"Gristle","CreatedById":60589,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T04:42:22Z","Content":"Could this mod be the culprit that recharges my spacecrafts batteries when Kerbals return from EVA?"},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T09:39:28Z","Content":"Kerbals under a 50km altitude on kerbin are not subject to life support penalties."},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T10:11:02Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Kerbals under a 50km altitude on kerbin are not subject to life support penalties.\n\nBut they still happily munch through their supplies! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nSo one greenhouse can keep up with one mulching kerbal - but without the addition of the Kolonization mod their is no way to make self sustained colonies or is there?"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T11:39:06Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E So one greenhouse can keep up with one mulching kerbal - but without the addition of the Kolonization mod their is no way to make self sustained colonies or is there?\n\nAm I mistaken in thinking that a Kerbal \u002B a greenhouse \u002B some food = infinite loop?
