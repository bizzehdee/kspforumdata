And it\u0027s only the advance amount that\u0027s affected.  \n\nI also fixed the exception by clearing finished contracts in alt-F12 - contract tools, so the vanilla contracts window works again. The clue was when I checked my contracts archive in the alt-F12 menu, and it broke the whole menu lol. Maybe from upgrading Orbital Science recently to the new version, or some other mod removal, but I\u0027ve never seen something like that break mission control before!"},{"CreatedByName":"Gazpachian","CreatedById":155579,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-31T19:29:40Z","Content":"So I sent out Nightingale on a wild bug hunt over his Strategia thread over this negative advance issue, since I didn\u0027t verify the display values that capcom gave me for advance amounts with the values presented inside mission control. Damn you DMagic for making mods I\u0027ve come to so unquestioningly rely on!\n\nAgain, the slot machine strategy triggers the bug and the bug appeared after upgrading Strategia from 0.3 to 1.1.1, so nothing new and exciting to report there. [I linked my savefile over in that thread, I may as well post it here for reference.](https://www.dropbox.com/s/k65hmpr902s6kjg/nightingale-capcomwtf.sfs?dl=0) With it being apparently only a visual bug you\u0027re free to ignore it by my reckoning, since you\u0027ve probably got more pressing matters with 1.1 coming up! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"Fwiffo","CreatedById":148084,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-07T04:45:11Z","Content":"Hi, I noticed when you reload the database by (from the space center) pressing **ALT-F12**, **Database**, **Reload All**, this mod adds an additional icon for itself to the toolbar.

I have a lot of mods and this is the only one doing it at present (others have in the past).  i know this isn\u0027t a high priority but maybe you could implement a fix.
