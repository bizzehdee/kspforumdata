It has made me want to play kerbal space program all weekend. and then I suddenly thought, it would be sweet if instead of just using resources to make fuel what about to fabricate steel and 3D print stuff in space. then USING KIS and KAS you could literally colonise very distant places very easily. even with one refinery and fabricator.

In a nutshell, Pathfinder lets you build a base using KIS/KAS and perform geoscience to improve your resource extraction rates. Here is the latest of what Pathfinder can do thanks to your fabulous mod:\n\nhttps://github.com/Angel-125/Pathfinder/releases/tag/v0.1.5\n[Get the latest here!](https://github.com/Angel-125/Pathfinder/releases/tag/v0.1.5)\nhttps://github.com/Angel-125/Pathfinder/releases/tag/v0.1.5\n\nCKAN/KerbalStuff update is on the way..\n\n**0.1.5: Bonanza**\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/mjdRgBAY278?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nOrbiting satellites are great for detecting resources from space, but advanced sensors take a long time to research. With this update, Pathfinder introduces resource scanning tech earlier in the game- assuming it works. Additionally, the Geology Lab can do things that the stock surface scanner can- and more if you staff it right. Finally, the new Outback gives you a handy way to haul small amounts of resources around without lugging the Buckboard.\n\n**New Parts**\n\n- Added the T.E.R.R.A.I.N. Geo Scanner. If it breaks down, you\u0027ll have to repair it. Don\u0027t want it to break? You can change it in the settings menu.\n\n- Added the Outback Extravehicular Support Pack (ESP). It\u0027s great for hauling a small amount of resources around, and it\u0027s EVA friendly. It can be attached to the exterior of a vessel by pressing the \u0022H\u0022 key, and detached using the \u0022G\u0022 key. Anybody can use it.\n\n*Ponderosa*\n\n- Cleaned up the Ponderosa right-click menu and moved a lot of functionality to the Ponderosa Operations window. Access it via the Manage Operations button in the right-click menu.\n\n*Pathfinder Geology Lab*\n\n- The Geology Lab is now controlled through the Operations window. Simply right-click on the Ponderosa, press the Manage Operations button, and press the Show button to manage the Geology Lab.\n\n- The Geology Lab can now perform a surface analysis of the biome if properly staffed.\n\n- If you have the Impact mod (I recommend it), the Geology Lab can lend its seismometer to the cause if properly staffed.\n\n*Templates*\n\n- Added the Prime Flux Battery template to the Buckboard and Outback, named after Prime Flux, who suggested the idea. Thanks Prime Flux!\n![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n*ToolTips \u0026 Settings*\n\n- Added a tooltip to remind players that the requirement to pay for redecorating/inflating the Ponderosa can be turned off.\n\n- The Settings window can now be toggled using the modifier key (which defaults to the Alt key on Windows) plus P instead of being hard coded to the Alt key.\n\n*Resources \u0026 Storage*\n\n- Added the PhotoMaterials resource for taking pictures.\n\n- Adjusted the Buckboard\u0027s storage capacity when not being used to store KIS items.\n\n- You can now access the Chuckwagon\u0027s inventory from inside the module.\n\n*KIS/KAS*\n\n- Updated the saddle to account for the latest changes in KIS.\n\n- Thanks to the latest version of KIS, non-engineers can attach the drill to a vessel with the \u0022H\u0022 key and grab it with the \u0022G\u0022 key.\n\n*Recommended Mod*\n\nImpact:\nhttps://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/114087-1-0-Impact%21-impact-science-and-contracts-v1-1-0-With-Asteroids-30-6-15\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/...eroids-30-6-15](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/114087-1-0-Impact%21-impact-science-and-contracts-v1-1-0-With-Asteroids-30-6-15)\nhttps://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/114087-1-0-Impact%21-impact-science-and-contracts-v1-1-0-With-Asteroids-30-6-15"},{"CreatedByName":"DavidHunter","CreatedById":102608,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T06:59:45Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Could you please implement a simple \u0022drop object\u0022 button, rather than making me try to attach the part to the Kerbal?

Simply slap the winch close to where you want the big part and slap a connector on the floating part, then attach the winch cable and slowly pull the winch. When the cable fully retracts the part will dock or not, depending on how wobbly it behaves. Either way you can bring the number of kerbals required by the part weight and attach the part where you wanted it in the first place.\n\nMy station now has docking ports only where I need them, everything else was attached via KIS. The node snap feature is awesome.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-27T15:40:06Z\u0022 title=\u002207/27/2015 03:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Enceos**"}]}
