I\u0027ve been drawn to planes like the Strugatsky.. and how cool it would be to be able to do controlled airdrops. Right now, you just have to pitch up and let things just kinda tumble out, but I thought maybe the B9 crew could make it smoother than that. The best I could come up with, as far as a way to do it, is to have a special node on the tail ramps, which you then attach a special airdrop part (maybe a pallet?) to. The airdrop part would then have its own special node (kinda like how KW does fairings) that would let you string airdrop parts in sequence, and you could build your payload on the airdrop part. Now, sure, you can already do that with decouplers, but the real cool part (which I have no idea how you could possibly do) would be to have the airdrop parts move to the tail node before they actually decouple/stage, which would let you do parachutes and whatnot. Like I said, I have no idea how you could pull that off... but it would be pretty cool if you could. It would also have some pretty interesting applications in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust thought I\u0027d mention it.
