By the way, I have OPM installed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a set of short-range satellites in geosync orbit. Outside of those, at about 68,000KM\u0027s, I have a long-range satellite in polar orbit that has three 300Gm dishes, called KerbSat. KerbSat also has short-range antennas to connect to the geosync sats. All short and long range satellites connect to one another so that no matter what, there\u0027s always one way to get to mission control. This works well at this point. I can send probes with long-range antennas to Jool and Sarnus without issues when the KerSat is set to target \u0022Active Vessel\u0022, or even targeting my active vessel manually.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow here\u0027s where things go wrong. I sent a relay satellite probe to Jool, and one to Sarnus. These are called Juno 4 and 5. Each of the Juno probes have three long-range antennas (300Gm) and short-range ones for local ships. I dedicated two of KerbSat\u0027s long-range antennas to each point directly to the 2 Juno probes. One of the dishes on each Juno probe point to KerbSat, and vice-versa. This works well at this point. I then used a dish on each Juno satellite to point at eachother. Now I have links between Kerbin-Jool, Kerbin-Sarnus, and Jool-Sarnus, forming a triangle. This is a redundant system so that the Jool probe can still reach Kerbin via Sarnus if it has to, and vice versa.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I see all the connections and everything works. But, if I disconnect the link to Kerbin on ONE of the Juno probes, I get a \u0022No Connection\u0022 displayed. This shouldn\u0027t happen because it should automatically relay through the other Juno satellite shouldn\u0027t it? It seems to work this way within Kerbin\u0027s SOI no problem. But I can\u0027t get the Juno probes to relay eachother if the direct connection to Kerbin gets cut off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey are all well within their maximum ranges on all sides. The only thing I can think of is that there\u0027s too many paths to get there and too many branches? Should I maybe have more Kerbin-based long-range satellites to reach the other planets and dedicate one sat per planet?
