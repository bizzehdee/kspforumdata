It seems like the default volumes and unit masses are the primary culprit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComparing the volume units of the Small O2 tank to the stock small monoprop, I estimate that the volume of the tank should be closer to 80 (units/kerbits/whatever). O2 could be kept as either a cryogenic liquid (problematic for long term storage but dense) in O2 candle form (solid, long lasting but not as dense), or under pressure (the higher the pressure the better). The Quest Airlock on the ISS stored it at 900 psi but later Apollo suits had small tanks at \u0026gt; 1600 psi.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we assume that high pressure tanks is the way to go and use Quest Airlock type tanks then O2 per kerbit should be 0.0004371. The current default of 0.00000143 giving us a 305x increase (but divided by 5 since 80 is 1/5th of the default 400). A small 900 psi tank of 80 kerbits volume would then hold ~35kg (0.035) of O2. Space station humans go through about 1kg of O2 per day for about 35 days of O2 for a human. Kerbal O2 utilization is up in the air. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus, the problem as I see it is not really with tank size but one of units currently used.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
