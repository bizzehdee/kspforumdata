I had two different ships on the surface of Minmus- (BS1 \u0026amp; BS2). I put a winch on one and a port on the other. Then I connected them in docked mode. I then undocked a third ship (BS3) (connected via winches and ports) from BS1 \u0026amp; BS2. At some point during this process, the connection I made between BS1 \u0026amp; BS2 failed and the winch connector was laying on the ground. The connector got into some weird sort of connected but not connected state. I couldn\u0027t retract it, eject it, grab it or anything else. So I figured it might reset when I stuck it in my Kerbal\u0027s inventory.
