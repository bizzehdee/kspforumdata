You should start your turn somewhere between 50 m/s and 100 m/s for TWRs around 1.4 - 1.7, but if you want to keep a TWR of 2 and not throttle down you can try giving it a slight kick right off the pad. If you\u0027re still having stability problems, the fairing might actually be the issue; fairings are very low-density, but do add a lot of surface area, so that can help make the rocket unstable; you can try putting whatever service module you have for the payload at the top of the fairing (upside-down, so the heavy engine is at the top) or you can try counteracting it with fins on the first stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd most non-wing parts are already FAR compatible, it\u0027s only the ones that are very, very different from stock that tend to be a problem.

For wing parts, those need a FARWingAerodynamicModel or FARControllableSurface module, and the documentation for that can also be found in the README.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E I\u0027ve been having some progress with better gravity turns.
