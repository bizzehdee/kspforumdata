It is very light, use a self-generated propellant to simulate an abundant electro-magnetic energy harvested from the body itself, ideally it should work better in high altitude in space, but for now it use atmosphericCurve to do the job, which mean on Kerbin and high density atmosphere, the engine can not really be used on its own at sea level and need some help to climb up (5000m minimum, depending on the total mass and the total thrust of the vessel) and become really useful. Warning: this engine has \u0022virtually\u0022 an infinite dV value (MJ or other will not show it, as propellant is generated while running).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELPMEMES\u003C/strong\u003E: the same as above but stackable as other engine, at the expense of not being a true low-profile engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edownload \u003Ca href=\u0022http://beta.kerbalstuff.com/mod/49/Low%20Profile%20Misc%20Engines\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Efrom kerbal stuff\u003C/a\u003E or \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download/922s2fyhvibfety/Low\u002BProfile\u002BJet\u002BEngines\u002B0.5.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Emediafire\u003C/a\u003E (\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download/zfdnv9lbsx4bvs6/Low\u002BProfile\u002BJet\u002BEngines\u002B0.5\u002Bpatch.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Epatch 0.3-\u0026gt;0.4\u003C/a\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Elicense included in archive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA further release will include custom sounds and FX, experimentalMotors will also be change to something more accurate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Echangelog:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E0.1 14/07/2014 early release\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E0.2 30/07/2014 LPXSE added, LPMJE texture improved with more details, some words here or there added here too\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E0.3 28/08/2014 MEME \u0026amp; MEMES added\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E0.4 11/09/2014 fix surface attach nodes of the 3 stackable engines\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E0.5 12/09/2014 fix experimentalMotors node name\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave fun.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-13T10:42:16Z\u0022 title=\u002209/13/2014 10:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 13, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Justin Kerbice\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E0.5 added\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nli2work","CreatedById":106805,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-01T07:22:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethat duna lander command pod looks cool!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BinaryBad","CreatedById":117229,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-09T22:59:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELiked the idea of this, but when I downloaded it, only 2 of the engines showed up in the tech tree.
