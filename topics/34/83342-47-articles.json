I like discussing ideas for how to handle procedural parts because I\u0027m not 100% sold on the current method. It still allows for flexibility, but doesn\u0027t really promote any sort of standardization. A hybrid system where you can recover procedural parts as-is and use identical ones like you would with the normal inventory, but then also break them into procedural scrap to make other parts (with a longer time requirement). So you could recover a 1.25 by 5 meter fuel tank and then use it as a 1.25 by 5 meter fuel tank for 1/100 of the \u0022effective cost\u0022, or you could scrap it and turn it into a 1.25 by 2.5 meter fuel tank for 1/10 of the \u0022effective cost\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027d require a rework of the inventory system, which I\u0027ve actually got a working model that I can use as a base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022icedown\u0022 data-cite=\u0022icedown\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe ability to turn off RT during simulations would be awesome.
