At low altitude or high speed, the deflection we have may be too high causing excessive G loadings, but we can\u0027t reduce it because at higher altitudes we need all of that deflection to keep the nose pointing forwards. Currently, the tools we have for this problem focus on changing input scale (fine control, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s dynamic control authority (DCA) helper, etc.) which isn\u0027t always what is needed. Dynamic Deflection approaches this from a different direction, altering the maximum deflection individual control surfaces can use according to the current dynamic pressure.\n\n**Features**\n\n- Maximum control surface deflection varies with dynamic pressure, keeping the vessel response behaviour consistent for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E (ie. less wobbles) and reducing the chance of unexpectedly blowing yourself up with too much input\n- Each control surface is individually configurable in editor and flight scenes (UI has a button to copy the setup across all modules on the vessel)\n- Default configuration that can be reverted to at any time (or updated)\n- Graph to visualise setup and current state\n\n**Editing the deflection variation of a part**\n\n- Hover the mouse over a control surface part\n- Press \u0027K\u0027\n- In the window that opens, the left column of numbers is the dynamic pressure (Q) in kPa, and the right is the percentage of maximum deflection to allow at that level of Q\n- There is also a revert button to reset your changes, a save button to set your current setup as the default, and a dropdown button to reveal a graph of the % deflection\n\n* * *\n\n[**(Semi-)Saturatable Reaction Wheels - Download/Source**](https://github.com/Crzyrndm/RW-Saturatable/releases)\n\nIntroducing a (not particularly realistic) saturation mechanic to reaction wheels. As reaction wheels exert torque, stored momentum increases saturating the wheel and decreasing torque output. Over time the stored momentum decays and torque slowly increases back to it\u0027s original level.\n\n**Features**\n\n- Reaction wheels accumulate momentum with use, torque output is modified based on the current stored momentum\n- Stored momentum \u0022magically\u0022 (ie. no basis in real physics) slowly decays over time, recovering the parts torque capabilities. The rate is configurable in the part configuration files (ie. you can turn it off, decrease the rate, or increase the rate to suit your play style)\n- Stored momentum can also be discharged at the expense of propellant. Not enabled by default, change the file extension of ResourceDrain.txt to .cfg to enable\n\n* * *\n\n**[Variable Thrust Limiter - Download/Source](https://github.com/Crzyrndm/VariableThrustLimiter/releases)**\n\nAdds a second thrust limiter to engines with a locked throttle (eg. SRBs). Thrust interpolates between the default limiter and the new limiter based on the % fuel remaining\n\n* * *\n\nLicense for all of the above - GPLv3\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-07-26T08:06:17Z\u0022 title=\u002207/26/2017 08:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 26, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Crzyrndm**"},{"CreatedByName":"Jivaii","CreatedById":75048,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T19:56:19Z","Content":"Pics or more info?"},{"CreatedByName":"Crzyrndm","CreatedById":92871,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T20:02:58Z","Content":"Search for the old threads, I\u0027ve got another two mods to verify before I clean this up (sorry for being blunt, just trying to get everything working first)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-27T20:15:39Z\u0022 title=\u002204/27/2015 08:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Crzyrndm**"},{"CreatedByName":"Crzyrndm","CreatedById":92871,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T21:57:07Z","Content":"Alright, some more details added to the OP.
