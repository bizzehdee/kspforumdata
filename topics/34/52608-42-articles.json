Buttons in this case are components (more specifically, MonoBehaviours) attached to specific transforms.

If, for whatever reason, the component does not get attached, there would only be a brief error message during the initialisation of the whole mess and then complete silence, because RPM can\u0027t from then on tell if anything is wrong.
