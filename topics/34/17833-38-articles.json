This is true for any body with an atmosphere not just Kerbin. To isolate the problem I made a clean KSP install with only KER installed but it persists. Obviously with FAR the atmosphere would change completely but thats not the case here. Its hard to tell how much faster than terminal velocity my crafts are on average due to the fast changing numbers but I\u0027m estimating around 10%.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas anyone else noticed that?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the moment I believe KERs calculations are actually correct since my formulas which I calculate in-game using kOS show exactly the same numbers as KER. Nevertheless I\u0027d like to understand whats going on here since I need those numbers to match my actual terminal velocity as experienced in game for a lander script.

The terminal velocity isn\u0027t any sort of hard limit, it simply tells you at what velocity the gravitational pull on your craft is balanced by the atmospheric drag on your craft (assuming vertical motion). So, when you are at terminal velocity straight down, the drag is balanced by your weight and you will not be accelerating or decelerating. As you descend the atmospheric drag increases due to the higher pressure and hence the drag becomes higher than you weight and you slow down a bit more but this doesn\u0027t happen instantaneously.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you are moving at an angle to the vertical the situation is more complex. The drag force acts directly opposite to the direction of motion but gravity still acts directly downwards so you will need more drag to balance gravity. As the drag force is the only force acting non-vertically, this causes your horizontal speed to drop and only a part of the drag force is working against gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes this clear up your confusion?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
