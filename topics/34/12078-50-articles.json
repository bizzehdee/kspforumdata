I know they redid how the command pod parameters work when they redid the SAS functions. I\u0027ll play around with the configs a little and see what I can come up with. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d really like to use this ship a lot! I\u0027ve been trying to build a good interplanetary transfer vehicle with stock parts, and it just doesn\u0027t work that well. So I\u0027m limited to sending one way missions... or return missions where only 20% of the ship comes back.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
