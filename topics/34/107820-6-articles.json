And, the Boeing 787 for example is part electric; meaning it\u0027s like a flying Prius. I don\u0027t think its OP at all, except maybe on Duna. It weighs quite a lot compared to stock jet engines, can only be radially mounted, requires a sufficient power source, and are limited to subsonic speeds.
