If so do you plan any compatability patches?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, as long as Fire Crew Mod does not change the names of the kerbals, there should not any problems. If you remove a kerbal in flight, he would not end the mission of course. If there are any problems please tell me and I will see what I can do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I\u0027m using the names of the kerbals, because I didn\u0027t find any persistent unique id for a kerbal.

It would be only a matter of including one file, I could write it for you if you can\u0027t be bothered. It would be super-cool to have \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENice idea. I will give it a try.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome post are complaining about the summary window now conflicting in position with the stock KSP summary window. I have noticed this, too. Currently there can\u0027t be done much about this (maybe I will change the position of the FF summary window). But a question: Does anybody know about a mod that uses the stock summary window in some way? If I get any example I would try to integrate FF therein.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nereid","CreatedById":68815,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-11T11:33:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Hannu\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Hannu\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI have occasional errors with this mod. Sometimes a mission do not get recorded at all. It have happened at least with two Apollo -style missions to Duna and Eeloo. Kerbals did not get more mission numbers and mission time. Sometimes Kerbals get false ribbons. At least somebody have \u0022launch of heavy vessel\u0022 -ribbon much larger than any of my manned launches during current thread. One guy got about 6000 days too much mission time. Can this be conflict between Mechjeb and FinalFrontier? I use 32 bit Windows version and some other mods. I have also thought that is it possible that moving kerbals with Ship Manifest mod causes false behaviour.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think there is a conflict. Moving kerbals wont do any harm, too. I do it myself often.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the first report of 600 days to much mission time or something like this. If somedody has an issue with mission times way off, please send me the halloffame.ksp\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere seems to be an issue with the heavy vehicle ribbons, which I have not analyzed yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd just a tip: If you don\u0027t want a ribbon, because you don\u0027t like it or it works not properly, just remove the corresponding png-file in the ribbons folder. In the current version of FF this will disable this ribbon (in previous version it will crash FF).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately I haven\u0027t played much KSP since 0.24.2.

RAM is inexpensive and saving RAM is a waste of money in todays development most of the time. KSP is a little different because of the 3.5 GB limitation, but changing this would cost me about 2 days of work (the workflow has to be changed completely). And unfortunately FF stores the texture for each ribbon in the Ribbon class. Without changing this, you will use more RAM. So another day for changing this and the tradeoff would be more cpu usage and some potential hard to detect bugs. Not a good idea. Always choose correctness over performance or resources, if performance or resources are not a very big point. And they aren\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the main argument here is devlopment time and therefore costs - even if I won\u0027t get payed for this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I have checked this: In its current state FF will cost about 10MB to 15MB RAM without ATM. Using you optimization may save 5 to 10 MB RAM (maybe much less). Its not worth the effort at the moment. Technically you are right, but you can\u0027t really justify a time invest of two days of work (if you know the price for two days development, you will surely agree) by saving this amount of RAM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a bit more annoying that KSP takes a few seconds longer to load because of the amount of files.
