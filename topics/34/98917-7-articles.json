The plugin works from there. Ablation still happens, but it isn\u0027t extremely severe. I think your planes should be able to survive with a decent reentry trajectory.

Went from rockets made of clusters of Kerbodyne tanks perhaps 30 tanks wide at the\u00A0base to rockets of only 3 cores. Greatly enabled future exploration and really helped my frame rate. If you have already tried this and prefer SMURFF, or just don\u0027t want any extra mods, I believe SMURFF allows you to make your own config for the engines and tanks. If possible, just make the engines heavier and it will reduce their TWR to a middle ground between real life and KSP, which should be right for SKY. Might have to check on the SMURFF configs though.
