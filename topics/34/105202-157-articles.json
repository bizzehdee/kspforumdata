Even the opposite, I like and use almost all of your mods. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022) I just think modded KSP has some glitches here and there and cause of that I personally don\u0027t like to use any life support on \u0022dead\u0022 mode.\n\u003E \n\nI\u0027ve seen this a few times too, but it\u0027s worth pointing out that it seems to only be the LS window showing the wrong status, rather than the game actually treating them as if their life support timer had run out. I have never actually had my kerbals experience the negative effect when this little bug surfaces. \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-02-26T00:44:08Z\u0022 title=\u002202/26/2017 12:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 26, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Merkov**\n  \nTypo"},{"CreatedByName":"panarchist","CreatedById":63336,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-26T03:45:26Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 3 hours ago, dlrk said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I haven\u0027t had any Kerbal\u0027s killed by life support bugs, and I\u0027ve been using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS set to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Killed in action\u0022\u003EKIA\u003C/abbr\u003E for a while.\n\u003E \n\nI haven\u0027t either, except through short-sightedness.  \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS has been a rock-solid LS mod.
