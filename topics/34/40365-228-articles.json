It uses small quantities of antiprotons to cause fission in Uranium nuclei, this fission then induces fusion in a pellet of Deuterium/Helium-3. It is essentially another type of fusion reactor - it always uses the same four fuels though, there is no option to swap between fusion modes, it\u0027s a nice reactor that produces comparable output to the 3.75m tokamak fusion reactor but, as it\u0027s D-He3, produces 80% charged power, which is great for efficient power generation and, crucially, \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Eit doesn\u0027t require any input power.\u003C/span\u003E It is also much lighter than the similar sized and output Tokamak (less than half the mass) and doesn\u0027t have any kind of minimum output, meaning operational lifetime can theoretically be huge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConvenience comes with a price, however, and that price is resource availability - Antimatter, even in tiny quantities, and Helium-3 are far more inconvenient to need for your reactor compared to the Tokamak\u0027s Deuterium and Lithium.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JGDpwmE.png\u0022 alt=\u0022JGDpwmE.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the ATTILA (Adjustable Throttle Inductively Afterburning Arcjet) and its designed for people who want a higher thrust (lower specific impulse) electric engine. Specific impulse is ~3.92x lower than the MPD (that\u0027s 2,854s for LiquidFuel), the thrust is consequently higher by the same fraction. It\u0027s particularly useful for those earlier periods of the game where you want a different range of thrust performances from your nuclear electric rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is, however, a little less efficient than the plasma engine and, because it\u0027s electrothermal, it doesn\u0027t get to use propellants like Lithium.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow to demonstrate why it\u0027s better when I don\u0027t make models, we have this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/h3SDLL7.png\u0022 alt=\u0022h3SDLL7.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA 2.5m inline refinery - it doesn\u0027t come with all the resource extraction parts of the larger model but it does all the processing stages, that crucially includes the Sabatier process, so you can land this on Duna/Eve and use it to refuel with Methane.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-25T17:09:01Z\u0022 title=\u002201/25/2014 05:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 25, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Fractal_UK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Espelling\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Boamere","CreatedById":68058,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-25T16:47:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow looks awesome!
