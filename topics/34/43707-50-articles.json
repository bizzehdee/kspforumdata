If it didn\u0027t know the ground height, it would look up the body stats for the planet to obtain its terrain peak height, and take a guess that the ground height might be about half that. It wasn\u0027t perfect but it gave better approximations to use than what\u0027s there now (and once it got lower it stopped having to approximate and it could use the real data for the final landing).

The current situation is that the problem is solved neither IN *NOR* OUT of the game. I agree with a portion of (but not all of) those reasons for why solving it Out can be better than In. But since NEITHER solution exists, it\u0027s not a good reason to claim that solving it inside the game is a bad idea. To make that claim you have to compare to what exists NOW. Comparing a proposed solution for a real existing problem it to an imaginary solution that doesn\u0027t exist and is far less likely to be implemented isn\u0027t fair.

This makes it more accurate for the question \u0022will my script run\u0022. We\u0027ve seen lots of cases were we have to change the KOSscript program because despite the program syntax being correct, the game engine has bugs in how it interprets it and it doesn\u0027t understand it.

The current situation is that the problem is solved neither IN *NOR* OUT of the game. I agree with a portion of (but not all of) those reasons for why solving it Out can be better than In. But since NEITHER solution exists, it\u0027s not a good reason to claim that solving it inside the game is a bad idea. To make that claim you have to compare to what exists NOW. Comparing a proposed solution for a real existing problem it to an imaginary solution that doesn\u0027t exist and is far less likely to be implemented isn\u0027t fair. It\u0027s the perfect being the enemy of the good.\u003Cp\u003EHowever, that being said (that either solution, the In or Out solution is better than the one we have now which is NO solution), if you are going to enter the red herring side topic of which of the two proposed ideas is better, there is one VERY good thing to put in the PRO column for the in-game solution - it would use the same code, bugs and everything, as will be used when really executing the program, rather than code someone else wrote outside the game. This makes it more accurate for the question \u0022will my script run\u0022. We\u0027ve seen lots of cases were we have to change the KOSscript program because despite the program syntax being correct, the game engine has bugs in how it interprets it and it doesn\u0027t understand it.
