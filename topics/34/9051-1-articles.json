We have many promising students who have participated in this research and are in search of internships(read: free labor for you tuition checks for us). With our students as part of your space program you will have no problems getting your feet off the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://bitbucket.org/jhultgre/ksp-plugins/downloads/v08screen.png\u0022 alt=\u0022v08screen.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I wanted to try my hand at a plugin and having no desire to try to compete on the auto pilot front, I thought I would see what was possible from within the VAB.

There are currently two stat modules included. Basic stats includes things like mass, fuel amounts, and thrust. Advanced stats includes thrust to weight ratios, Isp, and deltaV. I make no guarantees on their accuracy and will probably be wrong on any stage that includes both solid rockets and liquid engines. Adding new modules should be pretty easy now and actually brings me to the secret feature slated for v1.0. With the way the code has been structured and how the UI is now functioning other mods should be able to add stats modules to the Engineers interface. This would be useful for mods that add life support or other fuel types where knowing how they will function before lift off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EExtending Engineer\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027m calling this new extendibility the Consultant System. I\\\u0027m using the KSPEvent system to find any Consultants that want to be added to the Engineers stats window and provide them with the information that Engineer has already calculated. To add a Consultant to your mod you will need to extend the class KICOITConsultant which extends PartModule then add that to your part.cfg as a module. I plan on uploading an example project here pretty soon but for now look at the KICOITConsultant, ShipData, and StageData classes for the information I\\\u0027m provided and use KICOITBasicLogic and KICOITAdvancedLogic as examples.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Consultant system in its present state works well for what I am currently doing with my stats but I realize it might not be perfect for what other people want to do.
