I\u0027m not sure if there\u0027s another one out there that already does this or if anyone will even like it. I also want to say thanks to the people on the forum who were a big help with some of the questions I had.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith that said what I created was a plugin that goes along with a part that currently is using the RCS Block model. For each of these parts that are put onto the ship a box spawns that has two sliders. The first slider controls the amount of thrust upwards and the second slider controls drag which help to stabilize.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/wygtjag0eXQ?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a bunch more that I want to do with this plugin but I don\u0027t know how to do all that I want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThings I\u0027d like to add or fix-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.
