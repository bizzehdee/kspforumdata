FAR/NEAR is used by B9 and many others, and RSS practically makes KSP a whole new game (Realism Overhaul is built on it). IMO, people complaining about it are justified, as 64bit locking by certain modders also locks out the mods that are not their own, with no better justification than their own personal whims. For example, I have this issue with RealChute and Component Space Shuttle. The latter requires the former, but I want to allow people to use the mod in 64bit, too. I\u0027m therefore screwed through no fault on my own. I can tell 64bit users to just fly the pre-Challenger configuration (it had no parachute), but I want them to get full functionality, and this is impossible because of this stupid 64bit locking practice.

In most cases it was from getting so fed up with bogus support demands that stemmed from 64bit. in some cases it was getting to the point where the developer was reaching a point of either locking out 64bit or walking away.
