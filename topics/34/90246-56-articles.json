On top of tracking metadata logs, what should be alowed to delete and what not, you could keep track data what kind of mods is using particular submod to keep main mod runing properly. I mean, metadata is OK for current version of mod, but in next version of some mod, files that should be alowed to delete/overwrite could change it\u0027s behaviour.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut if you have another table in repository that keeps track of data for other related mod needed for main mod to work properly, it will be possible to know if it is safe to delete non empty folder from some mod or not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, you install FAR and deadly re-entry mod. Both mods require modular flight integrator to work. For some reason you uninstall FAR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModular flight integrator need to stay because it is still needed for deadly re-entry. So, on uninstall procedure, CKAN need to check that new table and see if there is still active mods installed in game to see if it is safe to uninstall it or not. If there is still there listed mod that require modular flight integrator, CKAN should warn that is not safe to uninstall it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you uninstall both, FAR and deadly re-entry, CKAN can know that modular flight integrator is no longer required and ask user to uninstall this one as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis feature could be helpfull also when user try to uninstall modular flight integrator only, without knowlage that this one is essential for FAR and deadly re-entry.

I understand concerns that something that user have add in that folder could be lost, but in most cases, there is no such super high important data in mods folder anyway.

In this case, an issue with a folder. I have ignored the message before and paid the price. No body to blame, but me. Now, I have issue with wiping out the folder via CKAN. Maybe I put files in there for a specific purpose. Maybe the mod did and has settings in the file I need. Let me go in and look and handle it. I don\u0027t want CKAN making that decision and changing CKAN to give me all the ability to research what I want to do is not feasible. Plus, personally, make people learn!!! Forums are for asking questions and people are willing to answer them. I know I am (not that I have many answers). But, let\u0027s quit forcing developers to make their programs more complex and convoluted because people don\u0027t want to \u0022learn\u0022 how something works. Because KSP has issues, because mods have issues, I have asked questions, talked with people and Googled (lord have I Googled) and learned a lot about part CFG files. So much so that I\u0027ve been able to make minor repairs to craft files so I can migrate them from .90 to 1.0 until some parts/mods are fully updated.
