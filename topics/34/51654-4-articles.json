I don\u0027t find profanity particularly funny or clever, and I certainly don\u0027t think it has any place in the KSP universe. There\u0027s a time and a place for everything, but really I don\u0027t see any reason for there to be profanity in this particular game. It\u0027s nothing about children--heck, they\u0027d find it entertaining I\u0027d bet.

I used it when I was a kid. But when people watch World War Z they \u003Cem\u003Eexpect\u003C/em\u003E language like that (I use this movie specifically because someone commented with it in the file). One of the things I like about this game is that it can be a good game without the need for kerbals to jack off or eat each other\u0027s ****. I like that I can play a game and have it be a good game and not have to expect the kerbals to cuss each other out. I like that the focus is on being a fairly realistic physics simulator with characters who are funny and love-able because they are genuine, not because they are dirty. And I think a lot of other people do too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t see this as a defining factor in this debate, but as far as easter eggs go, some people want to find them on their own with as few hints as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sigma52\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sigma52\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell if someone else has the time, please set up a google doc where we can all work on it again.

However, if someone wants to do different messages for high and low space, it should be on the list. Also, the general \u0022CelestialBodyName\u0022 Location without situation filters is used in some experiments in the original file, so this should be included as well to allow a message pool that is used anywhere in the bodies SOI if no more specific entries are found.
