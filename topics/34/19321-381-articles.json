Its damned near a 1.0 release of a new mode this update was so significant.

Far has issues because it\u0027s not running full fluid dynamics, be happy, it wouldn\u0027t be a slide show, it\u0027d be a picture frame that might update hourly if your machine is powerful. Approximations have costs, usually in the form of things they ignore, and sometimes you have to build those things in a less intensive manner, which means improperly, but close enough, and that means more edge cases.
