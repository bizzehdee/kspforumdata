I have been able to design rockets that complete the stock missions within budget no problem. My issue is that the removal of individual pricing of components means that putting a few metal panels into orbit costs as much extra as putting up a large satellite. This is because the new model does not take into account if the object is a solid hunk of metal or a flight computer, it just charges for the \u003Cem\u003Emass\u003C/em\u003E of the object rather than for the object itself.
