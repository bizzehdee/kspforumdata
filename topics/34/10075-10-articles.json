The panel can be covered in sunlight, But as long as the base of the panel isn\\\u0027t in sunlight then it registers as 0 efficiency. As soon as i align a spacecraft to be in the perfect position as to give sunlight onto the base of the panels it snaps up to 100%. Is this just something with the kosmos panels or is this something new you added in?
