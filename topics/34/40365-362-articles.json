First I built a simple Fusion SSTO with a small radial scoop and dove it into Jool at 40k, then left it scooping while I took a shower and worked a bit. In one hour it mined, uh, something like 0.05 He-3.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I built a second SSTO. Two fusion thermal turbojets and six large scoops. I dove it deep to 4k and ran it. It mined one unit of He-3 in 190 seconds. To get a full reactor\u0027s worth of (1000 units) He-3 would have taken 52.78 hours. Real human hours, because you can\u0027t do atmospheric flight under time acceleration. (Even if the plane was stable at 4x physics warp, that\u0027s still 13 hours).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd, having invested that time, my returns would have been very low. I could have used it to generate about 27% more power from a fusion reactor for one kerbal year. That would never, ever be worth it: very little would require that extra power, and if I did need the extra power I would be much better served by either adding another reactor (for a heavier vehicle with minimal extra time) or by setting up a microwave power network (which would benefit me for a very long time, not just for this one ship). So, with the current He-3 resource constraints, I conclude that He-3 fusion is useless.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only other thing it would allow is used of the AIM reactor. The AIM has a fantastic power/weight ratio - far better than fusion, but still worse than antimatter. However, its raw power generation is actually still lower than pure fusion reactors, and you have to manage creation and storage of antimatter. Ignoring He-3 availability, Fusion is better from a convenience standpoint and from a raw power standpoint, and antimatter is way ahead in both regards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow it is interesting to consider the gameplay options that open up if He-3 was available in the VAB. You would have an actual choice to make with your fusion reactors: you could eliminate their utility as a thermal rocket to gain higher electrical production. That\u0027s an interesting design choice to make, and the optimal choice changes based on how you design your craft. That seems like a well-balanced gameplay option, one that requires no additional code and gives the player more options. It also opens up the AIM reactor as a viable choice for some ship designs. It requires the player to manage acquisition/production of antimatter, and produces less electricity than a fusion reactor, but it will be excellent in some designs because of its superior power/weight ratio. There\u0027s the lore question of where the He-3 is coming from, but we\u0027re talking about a society that is building antimatter reactors and preparing to build a frickin\u0027 warp drive. Maybe they figured out how to make He-3 in a particle accelerator or found a fission chain that leads to abundant He-3 byproduct.

He-3 collection is just depressingly grindy and painful. Realism be damned. Your ideas for it being a mined resource on certain moons/planets is a pretty great one. He-3 mining is actually a possibility for our own moon, come to think of it. It\u0027s far, far, far, far, far from practical at the moment, but who knows, maybe in the future. We need a way of getting large payloads to the moon and back that\u0027s way less costly. Maybe a space elevator would fix the issue. ... Okay, I\u0027m on a wild tangent now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIIRC, at some point, Fractal or WaveFunction made mention of it being possible to simply make the parts tweakable, like He-3 and AM tanks. Someone asked about it a few pages back. So it should be possible to make He-3 available in the VAB. Part of the issue there is that career mode is far from done, so the ability to balance that ability with high cost per unit isn\u0027t here yet. (He-3 in reality is a spectacularly rare resource. We\u0027re actually having serious problems keeping-up with global supply. Not that realism should rule KSP. Ever.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for harvesting rates on Jool, I think you might have some options there.

The number of radiators you use is pretty much determined by the equipment you\u0027ve already selected to use. The aerodynamics aren\u0027t much of a factor unless you are using FAR, and even then if you are using thermal nozzles/jets you don\u0027t have to worry about it much. In that configuration, most of your power demand and thus waste heat production is both created and consumed by the nozzle during operation. You also have the option of using the atmospheric radiators for that duty as well. COM issues will be present with or without the radiators.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll contrast that with payloads. Payloads on the face of it simply means that you need to fulfil a requirement (the dv for your mission), so you design a launcher to do the job. However, you have a wide variety of options to choose from to complete that goal. Lots of interesting decisions about staging and part selection and placement. Keep in mind, this is a contrast, not an analogy to waste heat management.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith waste heat, you simply put whatever number is needed. The only real consideration is where you are going to place them and like any part, how much it will effect DV. It\u0027s not as deep. Stating that EC isn\u0027t any more interesting than waste heat doesn\u0027t somehow justify that we need to have another system equally as uninteresting. And to be frank, EC management at least has the fortune of being straightforward to understand.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe limitations of generators to be placed directly to the reactor, while more realistic, basically removes a design choice. A similar thing can be said about the penalty to mismatched sizes. Maybe I don\u0027t need a lot of power generation, but I need some. Well, I have to place another small reactor somewhere else on the vessel and place a generator on that reactor. The generator limitations aren\u0027t making that an interesting decision (the power requirement is doing that itself), they reducing the possibly space. If you add a requirement, you want it to change the possibility space, not reduce it. True, games are about arbitrary rules, but removing possibility is something you want to try an avoid in a game. Removing the ability to throw the ball in american football doesn\u0027t make the game more interesting, however limiting the conditions of when and where the ball can be thrown does. Just as requiring a generator to be placed directly on a reactor removes possibilities, whereas having placement of the generator on the ship effect max power generation, thermal or particle efficiency or reactor temperature would be much more interesting by changing or even increasing those possibilities. The point is that a gameplay element should be interesting in this particular fashion or it should be removed unless absolutely required to make the gamespace small enough to be understandable and therefore, playable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t worry, I didn\u0027t take your tone offensively, as I hope you do not for mine.

But then they cannot be used for thermal nozzles and you still need at least six of them to power a Vista. And I can\u0027t imagine where else you would need to have all power produced in CP. As in, in which scenario are you going to need more than 300MW (D-T) but less than 450MW (pure He-3)? If you\u0027re going to use it as a power source for a probe, the D-T mode should still be an absolute overkill.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe-3 in Laser-confined reactors = sort of viable, saving a little bit of weight, at the cost of heavily (6x) increased part count and a really awkward ship design. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIMO, the biggest downfall of He-3 is the power drop in Tokamaks.

And when you finally get some of it, it shouldn\u0027t be pretty much useless, as it is right now... 0.7GW of usable power out of 60ton reactor sounds more like a giant RTG than fusion\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E... rant over, have some pics\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/B4P7J\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
