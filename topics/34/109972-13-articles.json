After I docked a second module to my space station, I was suddenly unable to transfer crew from my first module: [http://imgur.com/a/6wd8X](http://imgur.com/a/6wd8X). The first module is the lander at the bottom in the image, the second is the orbiter with the orange ring on top.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I get the notice that \u0022this module is either full or internally unreachable\u0022. I have tried undocking both modules and testing them individually, but the living space still won\u0027t connect up. I\u0027ve triple checked that all my ports are open and tried almost every combination of settings.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Furthermore, if I initiate transfers via SM, I\u0027ll occasionally be able to transfer from the lander module to the capsule on the left connected via struts, but it\u0027ll tell me I have to EVA to transfer in the reverse direction until I click around on other modules, and then the EVA button sometimes decides to swap back to Xfer (I can\u0027t seem to replicate it reliably).\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E If this info is useful, my SM settings are:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E - Realism Mode On\n\u003E - Crew XFers On\n\u003E - Stock Crew Xfers On\n\u003E - Crew Fill and Empty Ops in Pre-Flight Off\n\u003E - Override Stock Crew Xfers On\n\u003E - Enable CLS On -\u003E I\u0027ll probably just disable this temporarily so I don\u0027t have to EVA every time I want to transfer.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Any help is appreciated, or maybe I\u0027m just using the mods wrong?

I just opened up my station core in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E to double check this, the Clamp-O-Trons are all listed there in the CLS window.\n\nEDIT2: Never mind. The docking ports are all attached to nodes, so they are open by default.\n\nEDIT3: [http://imgur.com/a/Iaxef](http://imgur.com/a/Iaxef) This is the overlay provided by SM with CLS enabled in options. If I actually try to transfer crew this way, I\u0027m told that CLS is preventing crew transfer, even though I have Allow Crew Unrestricted Transfers enabled in CLS options.\n\nEDIT4: Here\u0027s something even weirder. I undocked the module on the end and redocked it, now it refuses to connect its living space.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-09-14T00:50:26Z\u0022 title=\u002209/14/2016 12:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 14, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by LemonSkin**"},{"CreatedByName":"Papa_Joe","CreatedById":10788,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-15T06:29:03Z","Content":"KSP 1.2 pr update:\n\nI\u0027ve recompiled CLS into KSP 1.2.  have a couple of minor issues, but overall looks good.
