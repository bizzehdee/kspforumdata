I design my rovers with a KAS winch and some dismountable connector ports, as well as Quantum Struts pointing in multiple directions on the outside of the rover. I also add some KAS connector ports throughout the interior of the ship. Drive your rover into the ship where you want to park it, put the brake on. Go EVA and connect the KAS connector to a connector port on the ship in docking mode. This will essentially dock the rover to the ship, engaging all the Quantum Struts and connecting them to the interior walls of the ship. You rover will NOT move AT ALL! When you want to take out your rover, go EVA, and disconnect the connector. Then the Quantum Struts will turn off, essentially undocking, and you can drive the rover out (sometimes you need to repair wheels first). Using this method, there\u0027s no need to reconfigure the interior of your ship, ever, as long as whatever you\u0027re putting in it has the KAS/QS combo. No messing around with docking ports, and makes things REALLY easy!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EISSUE #2 : The forward engine is very underpowered, even the triple engine, which makes it hard to circularize with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWORKAROUND #1 : Use the vertical lift rockets to do it by tilting it forward 90 degrees from the Prograde marker.

The drone pod set up like this will also allow MechJeb to properly land your ship vertically with the Landing Autopilot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWORKAROUND #2 : Remove the rear engine, add a few more fuel tanks, and mount 2 of the vertical lift engines on the tail facing backwards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EISSUE #3 : On vertical takeoff, the ship rocks back and forth using lots of RCS to keep it level even when well balanced and throttling down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWORKAROUND : Use MechJeb\u0027s \u0022Kill Rot\u0022 instead of ASAS/SAS.

Can\u0027t get this to stop no matter what I do. Ideas welcome!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EISSUE #6 : Sometimes this ship will not make contact with the ground of a planet and will just go right through, and down a few hundred more meters and explode. Unfortunately, I have no idea why this happens. It doesn\u0027t ALWAYS happen, but it does most of the time. It happens on the Mun EVERY time and I\u0027ve been unable to land on it so far without going right through the ground. I\u0027ve tried this on a clean install with ONLY this mod and it still happens. No clue with this problem...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EISSUE #7 : The floor of the interior is like ice and everything slides around easily, especially Kerbals who tend to fall down for no reason and can\u0027t get back up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWORKAROUND : Strut/Dock everything to the interior. To get Kerbals back up again, do a quick timewarp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESUGGESTIONS:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst thing I have an issue with is mounting RCS thrusters. It works like it is for just flying around and take-off/landing. However, I take LONG trips, and once I get into orbit, I like to top up my fuel and monoprop at my orbiting fuel station. But with the way thrusters are mounted, it makes docking this thing absolutely horrible because the RCS thrusters are angled. So using translation makes you do all kinds of crazy things, even with SAS or MechJeb running. I would REALLY like to see some texture-matched angled wedges that you can place somewhere on the ship that will let you mount the RCS thrusters in such a way that they are nice and level. I\u0027ve tried levelling them using SHIFT\u002BWASD but it looks ugly because they\u0027re not flush.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe forward engine, like I mentioned in one of the issues, we need a more powerful one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpdate the IVA. The outside of the cockpit looks awesome but the inside is kind of disappointing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake rotating vertical engines. I understand from the game mechanics that you would need separate left and right engines that would make it fine with me. It would make the build easier as well if there were circle markers on the ship skin to show exactly where to mount them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, to Devo, please PLEASE update the WT-51, but for 0.20 and NOT for 0.21 because 0.21 is still too buggy to use.

The drone pod set up like this will also allow MechJeb to properly land your ship vertically with the Landing Autopilot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWORKAROUND #2 : Remove the rear engine, add a few more fuel tanks, and mount 2 of the vertical lift engines on the tail facing backwards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#ff0000;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EYep, it does need some more power. When I balance my ships (which let me count.. PegasusX1, X2, Space Eagle, Freelancer, WT-51..etc) are all craft that take off VTOL and convert to horizontal flight. When you engage the rear thrusters, alot of these craft do not have aerodynamic surfaces, so in the case of the WT-51 if I put too much thrust in the rear, even if I create a set vector for the engines they will inherently push the nose of the craft up or down. Now, you can combat this with some more RCS thrusters sure, but essentially I try and make them safe enough that they dont blow up or go out of stupid control when you increase throttle to maxiumum. That being said, the triple engine was supposed to be alot more powerful but I had issues in testing. The WT-51 is due for a new texture pack soon, so i might re-visit that issue then also.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EISSUE #3 : On vertical takeoff, the ship rocks back and forth using lots of RCS to keep it level even when well balanced and throttling down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWORKAROUND : Use MechJeb\u0027s \u0022Kill Rot\u0022 instead of ASAS/SAS.

Unfortunately, I have no idea why this happens. It doesn\u0027t ALWAYS happen, but it does most of the time. It happens on the Mun EVERY time and I\u0027ve been unable to land on it so far without going right through the ground. I\u0027ve tried this on a clean install with ONLY this mod and it still happens. No clue with this problem...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EISSUE #7 : The floor of the interior is like ice and everything slides around easily, especially Kerbals who tend to fall down for no reason and can\u0027t get back up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#ff0000;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENot sure either, the floors are standard convex colliders, they should function as normal but on the odd occasion kerbals will slide a bit.

To get Kerbals back up again, do a quick timewarp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESUGGESTIONS:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst thing I have an issue with is mounting RCS thrusters. It works like it is for just flying around and take-off/landing. However, I take LONG trips, and once I get into orbit, I like to top up my fuel and monoprop at my orbiting fuel station. But with the way thrusters are mounted, it makes docking this thing absolutely horrible because the RCS thrusters are angled. So using translation makes you do all kinds of crazy things, even with SAS or MechJeb running. I would REALLY like to see some texture-matched angled wedges that you can place somewhere on the ship that will let you mount the RCS thrusters in such a way that they are nice and level. I\u0027ve tried levelling them using SHIFT\u002BWASD but it looks ugly because they\u0027re not flush.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#ff0000;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAdmittedly was a little drunk during it\u0027s production... if you see the RCS 6 and Hex 12 RCS thrusters, you can see I went a bit crazy... and did not really think those out too well. It\u0027s like the ASAS computer.. I just started modelling something and that\u0027s what came out hehe.. so apologies for that one, there is no problem making some new more practical RCS for it.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe forward engine, like I mentioned in one of the issues, we need a more powerful one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpdate the IVA.
