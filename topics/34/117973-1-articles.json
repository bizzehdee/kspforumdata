It weighs 250 kilos more than the stock ISRU and fits one Kerbal but does not function as a command module. It also has no hatch; you\u0027ll have to get in and out of it by crew transfer, or load the engineer in the SPH/VAB. The IVA view is the same as the old 0.90 Mk1 Inline Cockpit--which in this context, finally makes sense!\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
