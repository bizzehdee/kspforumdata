When I have time I am exploring creating a separate mod for use with dual monitors. It will likely require drawing of custom screens as I do with the keyboard. Unity does not support rendering 3d to a second monitor. I have been successful in rendering from cameras onto the G19 but to do this I had to do a capture of the rendered 3d which is slow and resource intensive (think taking a screenshot). Due to the heavy cpu usage any 3d view on the second monitor would have to be limited to only a couple of frames per second or KSP would grind to a halt.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll continue to explore and post an update here when I reach some conclusions.

This is clearly not an issue here as nobody stays there for extended times, but it is almost as noticeable when panning in the KSC scene or even in the VAB/SPH.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOut of curiosity I took a look at the code, and you really aren\u0027t doing much when there is no flight active, but you do clear the screen every time and write the waiting for flight message. Maybe doing that only once until there is a flight in progress again would be enough to stop the stuttering? If it doesn\u0027t you\u0027d probably have to really check what\u0027s taking so long to cause\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also kinda got a bit curious now if it\u0027s possible (and easy) to detach the LCD updates from the full frame rate (as that\u0027s certainly overkill). So since I wanted to check out the basics of KSP plugin development anyway I\u0027m just gonna play around a bit. Mainly out of curiosity though, but something might still come of it...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"42undead2","CreatedById":47664,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-19T23:09:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m assuming not much changed from the G19 to the G19s, which means that when I get my new computer...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes...\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
