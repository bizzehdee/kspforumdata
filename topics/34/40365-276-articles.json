Its also not the number of mods that leads to memory issues but more the part count/texture size in the individual mods. B9 is a monster of a mod and KSPI is starting to get up there too these days. I can think of quite a few mods that you could take 7 or 8 of them together and end up with a memory footprint smaller than the pair of B9 and KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill for trouble shooting purposes I\u0027d recommend trying a fresh stock install of KSP and add only KSPI to it. If you still see the texture issue there is either something seriously wrong with your system itself or files are somehow getting corrupted during download or your somehow installing something improperly(but I\u0027ll assume you know how to install mods at this point). From there if it does not manifest add your desired mods until it manifests or hopefully fails to. While adding mods be careful if one overwrites module manager, make sure its not replacing with an older version. If adding B9 to KSPI does make it come back I\u0027d recomend trying a texture compressor like Boa recomended or the B9 texture reduction pack and see what that does.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fractal_UK","CreatedById":61595,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-19T00:36:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Lazermaniac\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Lazermaniac\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhat\u0027s the deal with the white nuclear reactors?
