Squad is constantly trying to balance initial playability versus realism, and they have messed that a few times. They come up with gameplay mechanisms like thermal loading, then they tweak everything so the only thing it really does is blow up a few batteries and solar panels. They add a lot of heat to a nuclear engine that WORKS BECAUSE OF ITS HIGH HEAT and people complain so much that they cut the heat back and back and back until basically you can just use it as a regular engine. They add a whole system for distributing heat all through the ship, and then when people get confused they add magic radiators to just let you completely ignore the heat system by sticking them anywhere. They keep trying to make re-entry deadly without actually being deadly, so they give this skin heating mechanism but then they up the heat tolerance of the parts so much that you can still drop a capsule straight down onto Kerbin from Munar altitudes and it will survive with no heat shield.\n\nI want some mods that are more than just extra parts. I want them to add some interest. I think the NF stuff does that. I like the heat control system and don\u0027t want it abandoned just because Squad got wishywashy on the gameplay like they usually do.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-23T20:43:57Z\u0022 title=\u002206/23/2015 08:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by mikegarrison**"},{"CreatedByName":"Psycho_zs","CreatedById":137644,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T20:43:56Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Well now.\n\u003E Surprised at some of the hostility, insults, and veiled (and not-so-veiled) accusations in this thread.

That\u0027s progress after all. I just think the implementation the stock game lacks too many things that are integral to this mod\u0027s functionality and converting to the stock system would feel like a step backwards to those of us already acquainted with it. I am, and will continue to be, preferential to HC\u0027s methods because I got to work with experimentals and have become adept with it. I prefer that extra precision with my heat management.\n\n**Not so civil me:**\n\nI originally said this:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Nertea just finished the update on NF Electrical, also splittng off the universal radiators into a new mod, [Heat Control](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/124391-1-02-Heat-Control-Manage-your-ship-s-heat%21/page4), which literally does everything your talking about.\n\u003E Following that release, Roverdude actually said in the NF thread he planned to [take that as a dependency](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/52042-1-02-Near-Future-Technologies-%28All-packs-updated-to-1-02-Finally%21%29?p=1998606\u0026viewfull=1#post1998606) (no point reinventing the wheel). For the above reason I highly doubt that he\u0027s pushing it into stock (more importantly, that\u0027d be highly unethical between modders; I dare to assume Roverdude is not the kind of person to do that).\n\nThen 1.0.3 came out and made a liar out of me.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ...\n\u003E \n\u003E Lastly. Believe it or not, I actually made certain design considerations specifically to make life easier for Nertea to integrate stuff (tho I was under zero obligation to do so).\n\nIgnoring the overall modestly hostile tone, that parentheses comment was wholly unnecessary and is salt to the wounds for us defending Nertea. And I *was* trying to defend you both.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Please remain civil in this thread. You claim that what you\u0027re posting is from your perspective but the rest of the post is written as though you\u0027re stating fact.\n\nLots of the people in this thread, myself included, have already put the stock radiators through rigorous testing (Streetwind definitely being the most thorough). Most of the same people also experimental\u0027d HC and have extensive experience there. THe assertions we are making about stock radiator system vs this are not based on opinion. They are very much rooted in empirical evidence.\n\nKasper, you come down here and your statement sounds as though you expect we know the truth, but are ignoring it. This is not true. We\u0027re working with the best picture we can develop, but when you, Squad, and everyone involved with 1.0\u002B is being unnecessarily cryptic.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E and Roverdude is not at liberty to discuss all aspects of the process. I\u0027m sure you mean no harm but it\u0027s often very important to take a look at how we phrase things.\n\nTHe information denial has to stop. Here\u0027s what I see:\n\n1.0.3 comes out with radiators to fix the problem of NTR heating, patch solution to a poorly planned problem, while also stepping on the functionality of this mod.Then, after the angry mob forms, are we told these have been in the works since pre-1.0.\n\nIts crap like this which has to stop. There needs to be some transparency in the development process, that is assume you want people to not react adversely when the empirical evidence available to us does not line up with whatever the truth may be. We shouldn\u0027t have to be analyzing the linguistic details of your phrasing. If you want us to know or assume something, you need to come out and say it. I imagine yall get tired of putting out the fires created by the lack of info. Why it continues boggles my mind.\n\nNertea, I apologize for being this scathing, but I\u0027m really starting to get tired of Squad and associates fighting fires like we\u0027re the only ones in the wrong when the whole thing could be eased by sharing some insight into some of the development process.\n\n**Progress:**\n\nIf you had been aware of this, what would be your plan for moving to a global heat system? If there\u0027s a shell of a plan here, knowing it might make some of us consider option A acceptable.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E it looks like his reactor mechanics will work with the stock radiators, which covers that dependency issue for my mods.\n\nWhile it covers your needs, stock radiators definitely will not work well with the Near Future package as a whole and that that will inherently take priority. Radiators have to keep the reactors below nominal temp (which we expect stock radiators to struggle with due to lack of refrigeration). THey also have to cool the engine(s) too. Since the engine can be allowed to run hotter than the reactor, and the stock radiators don\u0027t multi-task fantastically well (they cope with NTRs but when ur running 3 reactors and 3 MPDTs . . .) I expect there to be problems. Obviously I cant confirm any of this until there\u0027s a working build of NFE for 1.0.3."},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T22:15:08Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Well now.\n\u003E Surprised at some of the hostility, insults, and veiled (and not-so-veiled) accusations in this thread.

It\u0027s an unfortunate truth that you just can\u0027t please everyone. At some point you have to make the call and decide how you want to do stuff. You made your call, and I just happen to be in the not-pleased camp this time (I\u0027ll deal). Besides, I\u0027m putting this ball as much (if not more) in Squad\u0027s court. You work on the game, but ultimately the decision of what mechanics to implement and what to do with them lies with a higher power. It\u0027s Harvester and Maxmaps and co. who need to decide what they want - an abstract representation of thermodynamics, in which case the current stock heat system is (in my opinion) vastly overcomplicated, or a detailed representation, in which case they need to actually start giving the player details and let them do something with the heat system. Doing this whole skin heat thing that ratchets the complexity up another two notches while simultaneously saying it\u0027s okay to greenlight a set of radiators intentionally built to be abstract, all in the same patch... I\u0027m sorry, but as much as I try to put myself into their shoes, I just don\u0027t understand the intent from my vantage point as a player-slash-amateur-mod-dabbler. Maybe there\u0027s \u0022future plans\u0022, who knows, but I have to base my opinion on what I can see.\n\nI appreciate that you went the extra mile to set things up for Nertea to come and take advantage of, I really do (though I won\u0027t pretend I understand how, I\u0027m not as good with the under-the-hood stuff as the two of you), but please note that it\u0027s not the technical side that has us worried or disappointed. It\u0027s the conceptual side, because these radiators have invalidated the reason for this mod\u0027s existence from a conceptual standpoint. Heat Control is all about routing heat around the vessel, but the new radiators don\u0027t care where the heat is. So for those of us who like the idea of purposefully routing heat around the vessel, having these parts in stock is akin to a death sentence to any sort of depth in this regard. If Heat Control wants to continue existing and offer this kind of gameplay and have it make sense ingame, it needs to nerf or remove your radiators. Either that, or Heat Control completely changes what it is and does. That\u0027s just the consequence of things.\n\nNear Future Electrical may work well with the stock radiators. I say \u0022may\u0022, because as mentioned, NFE\u0027s balancing is really quite sensitive to radiator mass, and without a test build of the mod, there\u0027s no telling of how many stock radiators you actually need to mount to achieve 12 MW of radiation flux without exceeding 900K reactor temperature (the high watermark test for NFE). But this is the Heat Control thread, and we\u0027re largely disappointed about losing Heat Control.\n\nEDIT: woops, a lot of people have posted since I started typing this. Sorry, Nertea, I\u0027ll let this be the last thing I say on this topic in this thread. I just wanted my thought processes to be clear.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-23T22:29:02Z\u0022 title=\u002206/23/2015 10:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind**"},{"CreatedByName":"Master Tao","CreatedById":110410,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T22:34:25Z","Content":"Let\u0027s keep it on topic, folks.

Are both realistic, but just different?\n3. **Which is more powerful in terms of raw heat-removal?** Is there even a significant difference? Or do they both prevent explosions equally well in practice?\n\nI ask all this because I think it provides some much needed perspective on the whole A,B,B1,C question. Also if both are merely different, yet equally realistic and powerful, then I think it might slap some perspective into people who are getting too invested in the stock-vs-HC debate. It might not be as big a deal as some are making it out to be. How significant are the in-practice consequences of one system versus the other?\n\nAlso, I think answering these questions would help some players figure out if they even need/want to use HC given the stock options now. A lot of us were brought to HC by sheer necessity to avoid engines exploding. And some people try to balance their functional needs with RAM consumption. Nertea\u0027s models are great, and I love the insulator parts and heat pipes, but if stock radiators prevent explosions just as effectively, it would be nice to know."},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T22:46:22Z","Content":"Entropius,\n\n1) Stock radiators are generally easier to manage.\n\n2) Realism is highly dependent on how accepting you are of abstractions.\n\n3) Nertea\u0027s radiators are currently better in terms of heat rejection/area, while stock radiators are better in terms of heat rejection/mass.\n\nUltimately, conclusive tests cannot be run until we can work with Near Future Electrical, which means we\u0027re waiting until Sat/Sun for Nertea to get a hotfix out."},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T22:54:04Z","Content":"I can answer for what stock does.\n\nRegarding management - passive panels conduct heat and radiate it - no code, just static parts. \n\nThe active panels will look for parts across the entire ship and identify those past their individual heat threshold (which can be configured at the part level). They then attempt to distribute this energy across all active, deployed radiators (similar to RCS, heat transfer is all-vessel). The amount of transfer is configurable, and the saturation point of the radiators are configurable. \n\nIn both cases, heat is dissipated through stock radiative mechanics.\n\nSo to answer specific questions (regarding stock):\n\n1. For active radiators, attach and go. Location does not matter. Also the deployable active radiators are assumed to have insluated bases so as to not heat up what they are directly attached to.\n\n2. Passive panels are direct attach, active panels work with the assumption/abstraction that there is a network of heat pipes throughout the vessel for heat transfer. There are no separate heat pipe parts.\n\n3. Stock just moves it around from part to part and depends on stock mechanics for dissipation, so nothing like dumping coolant, etc. (not sure what all mechanics HC uses).\n\nWith sufficient panels you can run clusters of Nerv engines indefinitely. Well, pretty much any heat problem is solvable with enough of the stock radiators - if you\u0027re willing to pay the cost in terms of added mass."},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T23:07:04Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E -snip-\n\nWhat I want to test is how it interacts with a reactor, which needs to be kept below a certain nominal temperature, and an engine which can run way hotter and be safe.
