I can\u0027t figure out WHAT is causing the game to crash, but it\u0027s clearly pWings-related. Whether it be while I\u0027m pressing \u0027G\u0027 to change the shape of a wing, or just swapping between the scenes, when I\u0027m dealing with a pWing on my craft it has a tendency to crash. The problem is it\u0027s a hard crash, straight to desktop with just a KSP stopped working. The log doesn\u0027t show anything useful beyond showing me placing pWings and the part count changing. The crash folder doesn\u0027t even have all the normal files, just error.log and report.ini. If other people aren\u0027t experiencing these crashes I have to assume pWings isn\u0027t playing nice with one of my other mods and the only thing I can think of, since I\u0027m in the editor, is maybe the latest version of editor extensions. I\u0027ll try to wrangle a better bug report out of this but it\u0027s just frustrating that no one else seems to be having these crashes and the logs aren\u0027t turning up anything useful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: So, after a two hour flight and multiple trips to the SPH I forgot about the bug. I removed editor extensions and the game hasn\u0027t crashed yet so hopefully that was the offending mod, but as for why it conflicts with pWings I cannot say.
