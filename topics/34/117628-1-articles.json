(Please see change log in README for more details)\n\n**RECOMMEND YOU MANUALLY REMOVE THE OLD FILE FROM GAMEDATA**\n\nA Back to the Future Mod that adds a Flux Capacitor kerbalized. What does it do? Well it travels you BACK IN TIME! No Really, it loads any quicksave you desire in a spectacular and fun fasion. Set the speed required for the Time Circuits to fire (39m/s default [88mph]). As of now the effects are missing. They should return next update.\n\nINCLUDES:\n\n1 MYCRAFT Inc. Flux Kapacitor\n\n1 MYCRAFT Inc. Mr.Kusion\n\n1 DeLorean Time Machine (made from stock parts excluding the Mod parts) [Available in Sandbox or whatever save you put the file in])\n\nFuture Plans:\n\n- More Parts (DeLorean Frame [May be on hold indefinately unless model is provided or I have a LOT of free time])\n- Sound Effects, Graphical Effects, EXPLOSIONS!\n\nKNOWN BUGS: None ATM, but I\u0027m sure they are plentyful.\n\nOVERSIGHTS: -If the save that is supposed to be loaded doesn\u0027t exist it will not properly inform you. (CASE SENSITIVE) -Destination will reset every time the vessel is loaded. If already moving fast enough when activated, the game will instantly start the time travel routine and give you no time to input anything\n- DOWNLOAD:\n\nThis plugin follows the guidelines of the MIT Licence.

I could only reach a rough 40m/s if I used KF repulsors.\n\nFor this to work like the original, you\u0027ll need to be able to specify an exact date/time to travel to, even if you\u0027re only changing the universal time value, going both forwards and (if possible) backwards.

And making it require a surface-speed of either 88 mph or 88 m/s (to make it Kerbalized and way faster) to work.\n\nOnly issue, would the whole game jump forward, or would it just vanish until the said date? Maybe make a feature for both? Also, the Delorean jumps forward in time which is no biggy, but since it maintains the same location in space which is another problem, Kerbin will have moved in its solar orbit by the time it comes out of (for the lack of another name) Temporal Gap. So we\u0027d have to make sure the mod understands it maintains the same location on Kerbin, no matter where Kerbin moves. \n\nlastly, I say we reduce the speed of 88mph, to 60% of that value and make it ~25m/s. The idea is to be traveling at very high speeds, and due to that the highest speed a rover can reach (in the stock game) is to be going downhill and or with rockets, so we reduce the number to 60% of its value and voila, we have 25m/s, a high speed in KSP, and a decent point of departure for this mod.\n\n(please PM me how to add spoilers, I\u0027d like to spoiler that upper portion as to prevent ocular traumatization for those who don\u0027t want to see that bit)\n\nAs per my ideas of the mod, **I absolutely** ***LOVE*** **it!!!!** This is by far, one of my favorite mods (and I use a LARGE number).

Gravity wells distort time as well, so there would probably be some connection between them. If we treat this like a temporal wormhole, so to speak, then that puncture through space-time would create a sort of anchor between the two time-space coordinates.\n\nNow, the situation of it disappearing until the time that is specified is a valid way of doing it, especially if the activation is done from a remote console, or a swap of crafts is performed while the requisite speed it being attained. If, however, you activate it in person you would likely have to put everything on rails temporarily (including your craft at the exact time the requisite speed is attained) and then have the simulation warp ahead the specified time, taking into consideration where all the orbiting objects will be when the time has passed. Upon reaching that time, the craft should then resume it\u0027s previous planetary-relative direction at the speed it entered the space-time warp at, roughly 88mph.\n\nWe could then grab the source for the upcoming DustFX feature of the as-of-yet unreleased 1.9 update of Kerbal Foundries and modify it to output a flame-trail to be emitted post-warp. The challenge will be how to handle the external travel of the time machine... that is, how to spit out the craft at that velocity and vector when you are not currently in physics range of that spot.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-04T22:34:44Z\u0022 title=\u002208/04/2015 10:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Gaalidas**"},{"CreatedByName":"ZooNamedGames","CreatedById":103726,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-04T22:34:33Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Actually, the spacial problem is not an issue because the time distortion follows the gravity well that it is attached to.\n\nIn reality, but this is KSP.

It does seem like it might be possible. Like I said I accidentally brought the past to the present while debugging the code. What that actually means is I loaded the quicksave on top of the current one. I have no idea when it took effect (perhaps when returning to the Space Center) but it did merge the saves. The issue being that the crafts from the current save did not get removed. If that can be figured out in real time as well it could be done.\n\nFor now, however, I will say it is unlikely. I do plan to add a GUI menu if possible to modify the time circuits (chose any save, not restricted to the main \u0022quicksave\u0022). I also plan to add scenarios to the download which will be saves disguised as locations in the movie, however this will likely be a while before it is an included feature.\n\nI think next will be some simpler things like making a Mr. Fusion and moving the 1.21 Gigawatts to that as well as actually make the Gigawatts needed for the revert, not just the effect. I also want to bind the effect to the same action as the travel and add a flame effect for the wheels and/or create a slightly modified wheel (although I don\u0027t really know how to do animations proper at the time)."},{"CreatedByName":"MYCRAFTisbest","CreatedById":149304,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T07:12:09Z","Content":"**VERSION 0.95 HAS BEEN RELEASED**\n\n**NEW FEATURES:**\n\nTime Circuit Mechanic (chose desired save file to load)\n\n**Minimum Speed Required to Time Jump (configurable to any speed between 0 and 120m/s)**\n\nAdded Mr.Kusion part (required to generate the 1.21 GigaWatts for the Time Jump to activate[ships launched in 0.91 might not apply])\n\n**RECOMMEND YOU MANUALLY REMOVE THE OLD FILE FROM GAMEDATA**"},{"CreatedByName":"MYCRAFTisbest","CreatedById":149304,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-18T03:54:25Z","Content":"**VERSION 0.96 HAS BEEN RELEASED**\n\nCHANGELOG(0.96)\n\n-Fixed bugs minor bugs with KSP 1.0.5 compatibility\n\n-Flux Kapacitor Time Circuit GUI now is only visible when the Time Circuit is enabled\n\n-Can No Longer Stage Flux Kapacitor in staging\n\n-Time Circuit GUI now displays in MPH both the target speed and your current speed\n\n-Minimalistic Feedback added to GUI, if time travel doesn\u0027t work check that you have a full Mr.Kusion, are maintaining the set speed long enough, and have the destination correct (CASE SENSITIVE)\n\n-Updated Descriptions\n\n-Updated Tolerances\n\n-Removed effects, sound and visual (these will likely be re-added soon but the way I was doing was very unprofessional and I opted to pull it (If you want it in the new version just use the old config file from last build)\n\n-Fixed bug where failure to time travel caused travel not to work (NOTE: If you are experiencing the opposite problem where failure to time travel makes it impossible to stop the device please let me know)\n\n-Minor Changes to Improve Quality (Bug fixes, more helpful debug log, ect.)"}]}
