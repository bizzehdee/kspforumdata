If you\\\u0027re going for realism, then I would definitely draw from a design like this. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way it works (in a nutshell) is that a fusion reactor aboard the ship would superheat the hydrogen fuel (in spherical tanks \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E), creating a plasma which would then be ejected through an exhaust port (=thrust).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\\\u0027s an article about how that works in greater detail: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://science.howstuffworks.com/fusion-propulsion2.htm\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://science.howstuffworks.com/fusion-propulsion2.htm\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurthermore, a ship designed like this could eventually be made to self-replenish its fuel. Hydrogen is the most common element in the universe. Eventually, something like an electromagnetic funnel could be made to channel gas into the engine, effectively making it so that you could go like hell for as long as you wanted. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI look forward to seeing this mod later on, because what you\\\u0027ve done so far looks great. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S.
