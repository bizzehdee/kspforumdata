Basically, to fake the volume, usually particles are used (eg. KSP rocket exhaust) however, if we did it that way, the effect would fail very quickly as the particle would always face the camera, and therfore look like it is spinning around as you move the camera around it. To avoid this, we use a custom tri-planar particle shader that renders three different textures depending on where you are retaliative to the particle.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-13T19:15:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOkay I hate to just repost my old post, but since it got buried in reaction exclamations and never got answered I\u0027ll give it one more shot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been experimenting with the parameters in the Alt\u002B0 UI, but some of them don\u0027t seem to do anything, in the map or in flight, at high or low altitudes.
