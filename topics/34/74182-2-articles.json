Going over the resource consumption is a priority. I want for it to go by O2 mass with humans as a base but scaling it to 1/3 - 2/3 as I see Kerbals as having a comparable metabolism as humans but with much less tissue mass. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPreviously I had a custom config file for Ioncross that I played with but I don\u0027t have it around right now... if I can dig it out of my old computer I\u0027ll probably use it as a base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing is that the CO2 threshold will get a lot lower. IRL, CO2 concentration starts getting dangerous at 10%. From the looks of things, that\u0027s what Ioncross was aiming for except that would be 10% of the capsule\u0027s volume of air, and not its storage. And 20 O2 would surely have to be how much it has in its tanks, not how much is floating around the cabin. So CO2 will get lethal if it builds up at all, but for that to mean anything, then we\u0027d have to go by some sort of cartridge (resource based) and if you run out you can\u0027t scrub CO2, or else you better have lots of greenhouses. Turns out that plants aren\u0027t really that great at removing CO2 for us, there has to be a LOT of plant mass per human.

The good news is, the code that handles EVA resources being returned to the ship is all mine, so it shouldn\u0027t be too hard to figure out where the bug is. I suspect it\u0027s an error in conversion because EVA resources (as handled by Ioncross) are virtual resources, not real ones. O2 was removed from the ship but it didn\u0027t move to Jeb, it just got deleted. Then the system converts that into a percentage. 1 unit of O2 is 100% EVA O2. It\u0027s not the way I would have done I had designed the system but that\u0027s what it was and so I kept it that way. After this I might go back and make it real resources.
