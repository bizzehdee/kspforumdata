I did this because in KSP 24.2 partModules had an annoying habit of losing data and reverting to default values when partModule order on parts changed due to adding/removing mods. As AGExt stored its actions in partModules at the time, this resulted in players randomly losing the actions they had assigned on their vessels.

It looks like the group membership settings aren\u0027t being recovered. So, if a key is defined on ship A and not on base B, and A is launched from B, then the name and the parts associated with the action do work on A (correct), but the group memberships (i.e. Action #X is in group 1,3,5 and not 2,4) seem to revert to being Action #X in all groups of groups (is there a better terminology for these groupings?). This is something I\u0027ve noticed but haven\u0027t heavily tested so I may not have the details perfectly accurate, but I have been losing at least some group memberships for sure. Could it be that base B\u0027s memberships for the action which in their default, unset state would be in all groups, are being overwritten into A\u0027s action?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks again for all your great work.

When you launch a new vessel at the pad, EPL first makes the new vessel and spawns it, then it docks it to the lauch pad. So AGX\u0027s docking code runs when you spawn a new vessel and undocking code runs when you \u0022Release\u0022 the new vessel from the pad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll also add Karborundum to the list to look into.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I\u0027m going to have to get rather wordy here as I\u0027m going into terminology.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAction: The actual action. This is assigned to an action group on a per part, not a per vessel, basis. So if you assign a Solar Panel\u0027s Extend Panels action to group 3, anytime you are controlling the vessel with that solar panel attached, activating group 3 will Extend that solar panel. Docking, staging, the part breaking off due to accident, none of that matters as the action is assigned to the part and will always be present until that part is destroyed (or you remove the action yourself).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAction Group (or just Group): The numbered action groups, from 1 to 250. These groups are not saved, but rather they recreate themselves automatically every time from the Actions assigned to parts. So there is no saving of \u0022Action Groups\u0022 directly, rather Actions are saved to parts and any Groups used in those Actions automatically make the current Groups list.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGroup Names: This is saved on a per-vessel basis and does not require an Action assigned to a Group in order for that Group to have a Name. As this is saved on a per vessel basis I have to compromise. When two vessels dock (this includes EPL spawning a vessel at a pad) the list of group names is combined so that if a group is named one on vessel and not named on another, the group will be named that on the new, larger vessel. If a group is named on both vessels, the group name on the vessel being docked *to* will be the group name on the new, larger vessel. 90% of the time, the vessel being docked to is the vessel you are not controlling, but sometimes it is and I can only blame KSP weirdness for that. When you undock, both of the new vessels will have the same group names that the larger vessel did before undocking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKey (Group Key, KeySet, KeyCode): Anytime I use the word Key, I\u0027m referring to the key on the keyboard bound to an action group. A KeySet is the current profile of Keys assigned to the vessel. There are 5 KeySets provided, but by default all 5 KeySets have Groups 1 through 10 bound to the 1 through 10 keys across the top of your keyboard. KeyCode is the string representation on the screen, so the 1 key above Q is shown in game as the \u0027Alpha1\u0027 KeyCode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToggle State Monitoring (or just Toggle): If you enable the Toggle Monitoring (Toggle Grp. button), in flight mode, an action group will display in green text if activated and red text if deactivated as opposed to just in gray text that is default. Note this is saved on a per-vessel basis but not affected by docking. So if you dock Vessel B to Vessel A, making Vessel C, Vessel C will use Vessel B\u0027s toggle state monitoring, but when you undock, Vessel A\u0027s toggle states will return. This is different then how Group Names are handled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGroup Visibility (or just Visibility): In flight mode, you can only show specific action groups in the flight window if you wish. This works the same as the Toggle State and is saved on a per-vessel basis with docking overriding your settings, but those settings coming back when you undock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, rereading you post I\u0027m unclear what you mean by \u0022group membership\u0022.

Docking, staging, the part breaking off due to accident, none of that matters as the action is assigned to the part and will always be present until that part is destroyed (or you remove the action yourself).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAction Group (or just Group): The numbered action groups, from 1 to 250. These groups are not saved, but rather they recreate themselves automatically every time from the Actions assigned to parts. So there is no saving of \u0022Action Groups\u0022 directly, rather Actions are saved to parts and any Groups used in those Actions automatically make the current Groups list.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGroup Names: This is saved on a per-vessel basis and does not require an Action assigned to a Group in order for that Group to have a Name. As this is saved on a per vessel basis I have to compromise. When two vessels dock (this includes EPL spawning a vessel at a pad) the list of group names is combined so that if a group is named one on vessel and not named on another, the group will be named that on the new, larger vessel. If a group is named on both vessels, the group name on the vessel being docked *to* will be the group name on the new, larger vessel. 90% of the time, the vessel being docked to is the vessel you are not controlling, but sometimes it is and I can only blame KSP weirdness for that. When you undock, both of the new vessels will have the same group names that the larger vessel did before undocking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKey (Group Key, KeySet, KeyCode): Anytime I use the word Key, I\u0027m referring to the key on the keyboard bound to an action group. A KeySet is the current profile of Keys assigned to the vessel. There are 5 KeySets provided, but by default all 5 KeySets have Groups 1 through 10 bound to the 1 through 10 keys across the top of your keyboard. KeyCode is the string representation on the screen, so the 1 key above Q is shown in game as the \u0027Alpha1\u0027 KeyCode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToggle State Monitoring (or just Toggle): If you enable the Toggle Monitoring (Toggle Grp. button), in flight mode, an action group will display in green text if activated and red text if deactivated as opposed to just in gray text that is default. Note this is saved on a per-vessel basis but not affected by docking. So if you dock Vessel B to Vessel A, making Vessel C, Vessel C will use Vessel B\u0027s toggle state monitoring, but when you undock, Vessel A\u0027s toggle states will return. This is different then how Group Names are handled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGroup Visibility (or just Visibility): In flight mode, you can only show specific action groups in the flight window if you wish. This works the same as the Toggle State and is saved on a per-vessel basis with docking overriding your settings, but those settings coming back when you undock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, rereading you post I\u0027m unclear what you mean by \u0022group membership\u0022. It sounds like you mean an action is assigning itself to a part somehow. Is this happening only on groups 1-10? I\u0027ll run some experiments tonight myself to see if I can recreate what is happening.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ED.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry, I guess I wasn\u0027t really clear. What I meant by group membership is that every action group can be in zero or more of 5 groups (identified by a small 1 2 3 4 5 in the dialog). All the action groups on a ship can be categorized into those five groups of groups, which you can also name. They act as a filter to what action groups are displayed as buttons. You choose these groups individually per action group by clicking on the numbers 1 - 5. Maybe what you refer to as \u0022Group Visibility\u0022 is what I\u0027m talking about? So what is happening is that I set those in VAB, but when the ship is spawned and then released on a launchpad (the base has no actions tied to any of the action group numbers used by the ship), all of my actions are reset to being in all 5 visibility groups, even though the action groups, the actions, and the group names are all correct.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this more clear?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Diazo","CreatedById":81549,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-21T01:11:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, those are the Visibility Groups you are talking about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose are saved on a per-vessel basis and what should be happening is that when you spawn the new vessel, it immediately docks to the launchpad and so the lauchpad\u0027s group visibility settings are applied.
