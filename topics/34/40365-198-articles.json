Your radiators\u0027 temperatures are now dependent on the level of waste heat, meaning the more waste heat your ship accumulates, the hotter the radiators get and the more heat they radiate. This means that in almost all setups, waste heat will now go up at least a little bit before stabilizing at some value. If your station has only a single 62.5cm reactor and all those radiators, you shouldn\u0027t have to worry about overheating, as it should stabilize just fine.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"forsaken1111","CreatedById":2703,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-27T15:27:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Shadoworgon\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Shadoworgon\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI have a quick question. Has the amount of heat produced by the 62.5cm reactors changed? because ive never had a problem before with waste heat until i put one on my space station. I have 2 normal sized radiators, 4 small radial radiators , and 6 small radiators and my wast heat is still going up! (keep in mind nothing is upgraded yet)\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour waste heat is always going to go up. It will rise until it stabilizes. If you have enough radiator capacity it will stabilize somewhere below the reactor\u0027s maximum temperature.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is, as I understand it, part of the reworked thermal system. You will never have zero wasteheat any more, but instead your craft will reach an equilibrium point between heat producers and radiators. Your electrical generators will be more efficient if you can keep this equilibrium point low by including more radiatiors.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Konnor","CreatedById":95430,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-27T15:58:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2VvXCTU.png\u0022 alt=\u00222VvXCTU.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess it is a reference.
