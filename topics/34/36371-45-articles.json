This is why Fuselage Fairings were moved to the Structural tab: to reduce the chances of users confusing them with Payload Fairings, which remain in the aerodynamic tab. Fuselage Fairings are inactive, non-jettisonable parts to make neat, aerodynamic containers for non-payload parts such as batteries, RCS tanks etc etc. They can be used, for instance, for creating completely customised Service Modules, rather than depending on various less-flexible SM mod parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I remember it the order of development was:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EPayload fairings and fairing bases.

But now in 0.23, and I\u0027m using the latest version of PF (2.4.3), I\u0027m absolutely sure that the payload still got decoupled (i\u0027ve done that just yesterday night) when i was using an interstage adapter with fuselage (not fairings) installed, the payload was connected to the floating top node, not the fixed node on the interstage adapter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was feeling strange at that moment, but later I became pretty satisfied with such result. Because i can control whether the payload will go or not by adapter\u0027s decoupler control, while these fuselages won\u0027t split and fly away like fairings (less debris yeah...).
