I found the active texture handler mod which got the game launching stably.\u003Cp\u003ETrying this out with a new career mode, and have to say that the higher difficulty in the early game is pretty fun so far. I\u0027m actually using SETI only for contract and tech trees, since others had minor issues with the parts packs I\u0027ve installed. The progression seems to be distributed correctly with the interstellar, modular, spacey, realchutes, near future, and stationscience mods, so this may be the tech tree I\u0027ll go with for the next while.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the quick help though!\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are short on available RAM, besides ATM and DDS converter you can try to force DX11 or opengl, whatever works better for your graphic card.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m using this for target (open properties on your shortcut):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u0022E:\\Kerbal Space Program\\KSP.exe\u0022 -force-d3d11\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat gives additional 1GB of RAM that can be used for mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOpen GL have similar but different command, can\u0027t recall from top of my head, but you can find it if you search KSP forums.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Yemo","CreatedById":114412,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T20:06:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI m currently making a new ToDo list for SETIctt, any recommendations/mod requests are very welcome!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also added \u003Cstrong\u003ETakeCommand, TweakScale and VenStockRevamp\u003C/strong\u003E to the recommended mods for SETIctt.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETakeCommand should also make the manned Kerbin Lander contract much easier, since you can use a command chair.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#ff0000;\u0022\u003EDoes anyone know of a relatively lightweight engine mod, I m really missing RLA Stockalike for variety?\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E0.9.1 Current plans:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- TechTree rework (mainly Propulsion/Fuel area, TAC LifeSupport special node)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Procedural Fairings (checking)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- ProceduralParts (major rework based on old BalanceMod, though not everything might make it for 0.9.1)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- RealChutes (checking)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditional plans in order of general priority (but the smaller the mod, the more likely it can slip into an earlier spot)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHigh Priority:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- RLA Stockalike (as soon as it is updated for 1.0.x)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Landertrons (as soon as it is updated for 1.0.x)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- CargoTransportationSolutions\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Karbonite\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- KipEngineering docking ports and hubs\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Dr. Jet\u0027s Chop Shop\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- OSE Workshop (checking)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMedium:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- HGR (especially for those 1.875m sizes)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Mk2 Expansion\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- NearFuture (some more checking together with KSPI Extended installed)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- UniversalStorage (works, but calls for a rebalance, which I m hesitant to do atm)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- USI Exploration\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- USI Survivability\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELow:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- B9 Aerospace (so great, but so big)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Tantares (big and needed a serious balancing pass last time I checked)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- QuizTechAero (waiting for VTOL parts without attached engines)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Kerbonov (needs update, as far as I know)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Mk2 Essentials (needs update, as far as I know)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- -
