I have been working on this for quite a while and can now release this mod after I finally had a break through in the code - as a result of months of tinkering! Some mods in the past have come so close to this but none actually produced a viable working version... well until now...\n\n**What does it do?**\n\n- On rails and off rails orbital decay for any vessel around any celestial body, this decay is determined by various factors, such as atmospheric drag, radiation pressure drag and more!\n- Estimated impact times are given for each vessel.\n- Station Keeping for active and non active vessels. Supports all KSP Resources.\n- UI interface for predicted decay times and vessel information.\n- The above work during time-warp!\n\nThis is the full release version of the in-development mod featured [here.](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/126308-1-0-4-Orbital-Decay-V0-0-1-%28DEV-Help-Wanted-GitHub-repo-now-up%21%29-10-07-2015)\n\n\u003Ciframe frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EInitial Dev Video: \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoeHIbgr-wo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoeHIbgr-wo)\n\n\\* Note this video shows the V0.0.1 Dev version, the features of this Release version differ slightly. \n\n**Notes:**\n\nFor information on how to use the mod check out the wiki below!\n\n**Orbital Decay Wiki :             | [Wiki](https://github.com/Whitecat106/OrbitalDecay/wiki/Orbital-Decay) |**\n\n**Known Incompatibilities: (Major, Minor)**\n\n- \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E Extrasolar - Sagitarius A\\* causes problems with the coding of the mod, use at your own risk.

How does it deal with orbital rendezvous and interplanetary transfer? I\u0027d hate to lose a Dres encounter during the long journey from LKO.\n\u003E \n\nThe decay rate rapidly decreases the further from a planet you travel, so from a really low Kerbin orbit to Dres (literally less 75km) could cause some minor perturbations (you may need say 5m/s extra) to reach Kerbin escape velocity, but once you reach the orbit of the Mun the \u0027drag\u0027 from Kerbin falls to a very very small value until it stops (at 10x the planetary diameter distance (currently)) so the very worse case scenario would be a tiny RCS burn after leaving Kerbins SOI. There is currently no drag or decay around Kerbol so interplanetary space is the same as the stock game to traverse. Since Dres has no atmosphere and moderately low gravity, drag around Dres is low and it could take many in game months or even years before a satellite decayed.\n\nThe biggest issue I can foresee would be a really low orbit around Jool, at this point the rate of decay may be many meters per second at perihelion so an escape may be hindered, however this provides some minor benefits for aerobraking without the heat of the atmospheric friction.\n\nThanks for all the comments everyone, I appreciate the support!\n\nIf anyone would like to help out with development a GitHub port is available [HERE](https://github.com/Whitecat106/OrbitalDecay). The main brickwall I have run into recently has been resource handling (one of the only things holding back the full release version), and my own messy code!
