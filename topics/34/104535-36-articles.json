I slightly remember this already happening before 1.1, so it probably doesn\u0027t have anything to do with the update.\n\nBasically the Gantry Rail moves everything attached to the second side-node just as it would move anything attached to the moving node. [This webm](http://i.imgur.com/uDWWy0O.webm) shows this on a small test model. Premiere Pro decided to render it awfully (but still really big), however it should be clear what I mean.\n\nAm I misunderstanding the concept of the Gantry Rail or is there actually something wrong?"},{"CreatedByName":"Ziw","CreatedById":135292,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-18T19:41:49Z","Content":"If I remember correctly Gantry is meant to be connected by the anvil-shaped middle point\n\nAnd there is also a Gantry-variant or something like that, that is the opposite.\n\nI never use Gantries, so you\u0027d better wait for someone knowing them better to answer."},{"CreatedByName":"mr.smiley","CreatedById":157903,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-19T02:30:29Z","Content":"Greetings All,\n\nWhilst mucking around with rototrons for a tilt rotor style craft, I found something that might interest modders and players alike.\n\nIt seems that the flexing about the rototron caused by the thrust could be reduced by making the vector for a given engine pod pass through the rototron\u0027s attachment node - the node closest to the root part. Basically, reducing the torque about the rotortrons attachment node. Obviously the next part along starts to bend now, but struts sort that out. Does that make sense?\n\nIn my case I just clipped the engine into the rototron, something I suspect will cause problems later. Granted, this was built and measured by \u0027calibrated\u0027 eyeball, but my flying machine was definitely less floppy.\n\nAll this got me thinking, what if there was a IR joint that had the nodes positioned so that the thrust from an attached engine did not create a torque about the other node on the part? Or is there one already, hiding from me.\n\nHopefully the pretty picture works. Each side of the tester is identical, except that the less bendy one has been clipped into the rototron."},{"CreatedByName":"theJesuit","CreatedById":122369,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-19T10:48:14Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 17/04/2016 at 5:43 AM, sabreheim said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E ok so im gonna just come out and say my issues could be due to no sleep since about noon yesterday (its 1:30pm now)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E That said im now running into the issue of: [![Hr5iO3i.png?1](http://i.imgur.com/Hr5iO3i.png?1)](http://i.imgur.com/Hr5iO3i.png?1 \u0022Enlarge image\u0022)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E These are the IR files I have installed: ![oPcuuBJ.png](http://i.imgur.com/oPcuuBJ.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Have i done something wrong that you may know off hand?\n\u003E \n\n~~I hope that this is also dumb or silly question.~~\n\n~~The IR icon for actually using the parts doesn\u0027t come up whilst in flight.

With the stuff I had crossed out it turns out it was a conflict with slightly outdated Precise Manoeuvrer which caused the same loss of icon with the newest KER.
