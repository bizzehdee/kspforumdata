That is, the mod should exist as a single GameData level folder and specify its dependencies separately. That has advantages (dependencies can be updated independently), but has one key disadvantage: I have to maintain not only several download locations, but two distribution models, one with dependencies packaged and one without. That\u0027s a fairly large amount of work to maintain the~10 mods that I work on. It\u0027s basically double the workload whenever a release happens.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn addition, because of this dependency structure, this forces me to maintain metadata for the subpackages that I have that are technically dependencies, but should never exist in the wild outside of my mods.
