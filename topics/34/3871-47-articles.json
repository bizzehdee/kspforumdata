All IMHO of course!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The TD-5001 tank could have more fuel. As it is, it contains slightly more than the FL-T3000.

Geometrically, if you calculate the volume difference from the FL-R1000 tank, the ratio would be (5/3)^3 or 4.26. So a scaled up R1000 should have 4.23 * 6255 or 26458 units of fuel.
