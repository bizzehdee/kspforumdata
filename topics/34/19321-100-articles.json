Besides that, the assumptions used in that analysis are violated by stalling anyway; they\u0027re intended to prevent stall. It looks like the main cause of Xw being wrong is that you have so many intakes; basically it indicates that it makes less drag at a slightly higher angle of attack than at the angle of attack it\u0027s currently at. That\u0027s the one deriv that does have a \u0022correct\u0022 sign, but it\u0027s okay if it\u0027s wrong. Temperature is best found by flying a sounding rocket with a thermometer attached; take a look at the display, and that will tell you the temp at that altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the static analysis, it\u0027s not Cm that you\u0027re really concerned about, it\u0027s the slope.

Control lag is a classic instability in control theory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: Variable control effectiveness - the impact of control surfaces (and the outside forces being corrected for) varies over the flight envelope based on speed, altitude, AOA, etc. The SAS algorithm scales based on a few items (based on how it behaves on rockets) but can\u0027t account for the dynamics and isn\u0027t robust against having a bad (i.e. poorly understood) plant model.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3: SAS responds poorly to cross-coupling, which all aircraft suffer from to some extent. The most basic example is roll-yaw coupling, where a rolling causes a yaw, or yawing causes a roll. SAS detects and reacts to deviations from the desired attitude and tries to correct all of them and exacerbates the problem. FAR\u0027s controls operates on a per-axis basis with tuning for each which helps to suppress coupling. Additionally tools like the pitch and yaw damper don\u0027t try to return to a set pitch, instead they try to zero their respective rates.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn short, SAS isn\u0027t tuned for aircraft unless you are careful in your design (i.e. its fairly stable to begin with) or you get very lucky.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"spudcosmic","CreatedById":64598,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-20T03:04:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs the Control Axis Choice feature now mostly redundant now with .23, or does it still serve some purpose/is better than the stock one?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SFJackBauer","CreatedById":82269,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-20T03:52:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBug report - Control surface when assigned also as a speedbrake, the deflection taken into consideration when the brake is applied is the control surface deflection, not the flap/brake deflection.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, when trying to configure a split-rudder brake, attaching a control surface with symmetry makes it behaves weirdly when the brake is applied - either the deflection is inverted, or both surfaces deflect to the same side.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ferram4","CreatedById":21328,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-20T04:52:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E@SFJackBauer: \u003C/strong\u003EThat happens in all regimes; one line is increasing AoA, the other is decreasing.
