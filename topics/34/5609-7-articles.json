This \u0027Big Gemini\u0027 Is coincidentally the same style of parts I wanted to make, a modular small to large man capable capsule with a habitable zone and cargo space. If you don\\\u0027t really want to muck with this mod anymore and I were to take it apart and use the textures and stuff to add on to it and make Big Gemeni, could I release it?

I\\\u0027m just saying if you were to make all these parts (habitation and cargo holding) it would make your Gemini mod like 10 to the 37 times more cooler. Maybe even be a challenge?
