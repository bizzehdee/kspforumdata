This is logical, because inflation is an animation that, in principle, could deform a mesh in any way; and as the mod can\u0027t know anything about it, it could not track the movement of a surface. The adapter, on the other hand, has mathematically defined surface (it is a solid of revolution of a straight line) and any object attached to it may be moved when the mesh changes. This is something that ProceduralParts do; and my algorithm is partially adapted from PP code.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe issue you describe is caused, as I remember, by some random errors in calculations that resulted in NaNs in surface-node position vector.
