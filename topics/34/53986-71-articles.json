Since RSS changes planet size (and thus the ratio of height above sea level to radius) and terrain (therefore *directly* changing the topography), simply scaling the original scaled space planet mesh won\u0027t do; it has to be recreated to match the new terrain.

So we\u0027re talking about actively controlling the vessel from the moment it touches the atmosphere up until it lands, constantly trying to keep it at 90-100km until it slowly bleeds off its velocity. Without budgets, I\u0027m not willing to deal with this compared to a simple pod reentry. The feeling of getting a plane in orbit is incredible though, definitely worth the effort just for that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-15T21:17:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022AndreyATGB\u0022 data-cite=\u0022AndreyATGB\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMy only problem with SSTOs in RSS is that reentry sounds like a pain. You\u0027d need a high AoA to slow down and stay in the upper atmosphere as long as possible, which starts at 180km.

I am considering a SSTO vertical launch and lander like the Grasshopper project. But the fuel use on landing is just stupid and the need for a throttlable rocket engine only adds to the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JT2227","CreatedById":33932,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-16T05:03:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone have the remote tech config files for this?
