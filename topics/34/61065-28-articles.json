So 250 tons would be easy to accomplish but not an everyday task. I have not tested my personal rockets so far - only some hacked vessels in my development KSP, but 250 tons seems to be an reasonable mass for the first ribbon. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emaybe I reduce the tons for the landing ribbons, because landing 250 tons may be quite a thrill....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd remember: these ribbons and the rover ribbons are fresh.

FF depends on the celestial body names at the moment and RSS changes them. But FF doesn\u0027t do anything with your save file, so it\u0027s hard to believe it gets corrupted because of FF. FF uses the Game.Updated() method, maybe there is a threading issue or its not intended to be used like this. But it never has corruped any of my saves (and I save/quit/reload often while I\u0027m testing FF) and it works for others well, too.
