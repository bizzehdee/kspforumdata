It\u0027s still good practice to build rockets to take thrust both directions axially. Mostly what I\u0027ve used the quantum struts for on launch vehicles is to stop sway of upper stages, and if I do mount them on side boosters I also use standard struts from them to the core to hold the side boosters against putting upward pressure on the quantum struts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far I\u0027ve not had a problem using the quantum struts or strut guns to reinforce docking connections.

The ship\u0027s rotation in all axes will lock and various other odd things may happen. On a test vehicle I built, I mounted quantum struts onto the little girder cubes.

The source of the issue is the same thing that caused the massive amount of wobbling in stock KSP pre-0.23.5; the maxAngularVelocity was clamping the torque that should have been applied through joints to counter angular deflections. However, raising that value doesn\u0027t help if the inertia tensor of your object is low as all hell. How heavy are those structural elements? Do they have any mass at all? How heavy are the decouplers? Do they also have absurdly low mass compared to the other parts?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is what happens when you add more parts than you need to and place lots of lightweight parts together with heavy parts on the either end of the lightweight assembly.

AdmiralTigerclaw is listing values in kPa, but is missing the prefix for his units. And you\u0027d be surprised how little dynamic pressure it takes to tear something apart; you need to remember that static pressure is quite often felt on both the inside and outside of the vehicle, resulting in a net force on the structure of 0, but dynamic pressure results in different forces across the vehicle (measured using lift and drag coefficients), resulting in bad times. And 20 kPa with a rocket sideways at supersonic velocities are more than enough to cause it to break up. For an SR-71, it\u0027s even worse, because that has lifting surfaces to toss it around.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
