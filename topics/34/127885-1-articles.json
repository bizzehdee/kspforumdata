I don\u0027t think the node-size that\u0027s part of the attachment node factors into it, but I could be wrong. It\u0027s also possible that distance between the nodes, or bounding box size for the part gets factored in, but I\u0027m not sure about that either. I ended up cranking up the breaking strengths to ridiculous numbers on most of the SpaceY parts, but I\u0027ve really been wanting a stiffness-multiplier or something. With fuel tanks it\u0027s usually good enough, but the current system really falls short when you\u0027re using thin and lightweight parts, such as stack decouplers, docking ports, non-fueled size adapters, stackable probe cores, etc. Cargo bays have some added complexity since they can contain other things, and some of them just seem really flimsy. Unless we\u0027re given more control over the joint stiffness for parts that need the extra help, really all we can do is point people to KJR.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Reiver","CreatedById":148134,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-02T10:30:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is fantastic!
