I found that if I had less weight on the joints (i.e. stacking just the bays without anything in them) I could usually get somewhere from 10-15 of them before self destruction. I\u0027ve had similar behavior when trying to stack a bunch of cubic octagonal struts together - sometimes it is stable, but other times it will vibrate itself to death.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@ Paul Kingtiger - It looks like there is no mass at the top of the stack - maybe that\u0027s why you were able to get so many? I had at least an adapter, probe, and a few other things on top.

Would it be possible to apply this to the cores? You could choose how many bays you want vertically and the part would adjust the height and number of nodes. Then it would be treated as a single part instead a stack of parts.

Also, the incredibly minute size of the bays also limits their usefulness for any actual storage purposes (I only managed the armatures for the KAS winch and Karbonite Drills because I ruthlessly TweakScaled them down to 32.25cm size, which is insanely small for a craft which is supposed to be an industrial miner. Sure I could have made bays out of enlarged legacy Infernal Robotics book hinges, but I like your bays more; they look much nicer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the record, the entire bay is rotatable 360 degrees via rotatrons above and below and is supported down the sides using those supports you can see with the solar panels on.

One other minor gripe however is that in terms of TAC-LS, the amount of oxygen for example in one of those radial tanks is insane. I installed something like four of them on this miner because they are small and cheap, only to discover that it enabled breathable air for over 5000 days!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EForgive me for saying, but if a lifetime that long can be achieved for so little effort, doesn\u0027t it make the whole consideration of life-support a little negligible?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: After looking back through some of the posts here, it seems this issue *could* be related to the PhysicsKraken Daishi mentioned. Basically, On my first attempt to launch the rotating utility bay design, when rotating the bay, the entire ship would react. Not in the way of rotating in the opposite direction to the bay (as one might expect if all holds true), but as though the centre of rotation was at some point off to the side of the bay in space. The entire ship would then move around this arbitrary point when the bay was rotated as though it were the ball on a giant swingball set. The issue with the camera drift and the PhysicsKraken could be related to phantom impulse? I cannot suggest any more than that. For the record, and again it could be related, if you have a bay open and then reload the ship, the bay is closed on load but registers as open.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit2: The Kraken kerploded it and the command pod was launched out of the kerbol system.
