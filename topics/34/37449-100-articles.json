One of the config (there are 2, the other one modify kerbal consumption) balance the amount of life support stored in universal storage bag, so that there wouldn\u0027t be \u003Cem\u003Etoo much\u003C/em\u003E of it inside each wedge, as that would be basically space compression for its size. A wedge is pretty small. You can just remove that config if you want more, even if a little bit unrealistic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can\u0027t compare the storage capacity between a whole giant tank of life support vs the wedges \u002Boctocore realistically, considering the core itself occupy a large part of the space, and it stores nothing. There are also walls between each wedges, cutting down storage capacity. What the universal storage system offer though, is its flexibility. For the same amount of space, you can fit a \u003Cem\u003Elot\u003C/em\u003E of different tools and things around a core, and the wedge fits many different sized rockets depending on the core.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, if you are trying to pack a lot of life support for your craft, grab a tank of it from TAC-LS. But if you are trying to fit things to your multi purpose lander, play around with universal storage. Another reminder is that, while life support tanks from TAC-LS is balanced so that everything runs out on the same day, universal storage is different. A food wedge can last a kerbal for ~51d, a water wedge for ~77d, and oxygen wedge for ~146d. This is to play along with other generators and converters that universal storage offer.
