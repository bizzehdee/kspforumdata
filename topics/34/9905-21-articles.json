How many meters is it between the updates?

In the case of teleportation the maximum teleport-out range is currently slightly over 11km. You may have noticed that this is about the same range the hit markers for lazor vision will go. The reason for the limitation is simply that lazor system use the colliders to detect hits and beyond 11km they seem to be removed by the game engine. The maximum teleport-in range is 95km since this does not require the lazor hitting anything. The reason your kerbal ends up on the ladder is because that is the default teleport-out spot when the lead lazor hits nothing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETeleportation was designed as a means of bringing lost kerbals back to the vessel, either because they had drifted too far away in space, fallen off the plane or walked too far away on a planet.

In the case where you are using one tractor beam system to lift a craft. It\u0027s weight will be proportional to the amount of tractor beams you need and 2. The more tractor beams you have on a vessel, the harder the controller will have to work in order to keep the craft at altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the case where you have two tractorbeam systems operating. I.e. one system for hovering and another to lift something, both systems will affect eachoter. The total weight of the vessel, craft \u002B lifting load will determine how many beams you need to hover. And the accelleration of the lifting system, will also affect how much the hover system has to work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Oicani","CreatedById":15361,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-08T15:32:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERomfarer, you mentioned that VAB part thing I was asking people to do on the IRC, but I went afk in the middle of it.

You mentioned to make split the system into different parts.

It\u0027s again my personal opinion, but I will say that you need to get rid of the big animated red button cluttering the UI (even if it was really cool \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E ), and replace it by something more discrete and less Noisy. I also think you need to do something about the floating button beside the lazor system UI.
