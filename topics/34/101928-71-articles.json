If you click on a part and then mouse away the part doesn\u0027t get selected, you have to keep the mouse over the part for a moment (a noticeably longer period than you\u0027d normally expect) for it to register selecting the part.  Same for dropping parts, if you try to drop the part on the list, but immediately mouse away from the list then it won\u0027t drop it.  The longer you play (and keep launching and reverting) the longer you need to pause when selecting or dropping parts.  After a while it gets quite frustrating.\n\n**Debugging steps taken:**  \n\nI had a bunch of mods so I gradually narrowed it down by removing mods a few at a time.  When I removed KAS and KIS the problem went away.  I then created a fresh 1.0.5 install (with just my settings.cfg and the 100% stock craft I was using to test imported) and installed just KIS.  After launching and reverting the craft several times the delay was apparent again.  \n\nThis issue has been mentioned in [this thread](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/109592-part-select-delay/#comment-2319420) BUT the OP of that thread doesn\u0027t appear to have KIS installed and another user suggests that KSP interstellar may have been the cause for them.  So it is possibly not just a KIS problem, maybe something from the core game that is used by KIS and other mods. But with just KIS installed in a fresh install of KSP I can reliably recreate the problem. I cannot recreate the problem in a stock game or with a number of other mods installed.  \n\nMy other mods:\n\nSpoiler\n\nAdjustableLandingGear,  \n\nAviationLights,  \n\nB9,  \n\nB9-props,  \n\nB9AnimationModules,  \n\nBDAnimationModules,  \n\nCollisionFX,  \n\nCommunityResourcePack,  \n\nCrossFeedEnabler,  \n\nDMagicOrbitalScience,  \n\nEVAManager,  \n\nEnvironmentalVisualEnhancements,  \n\nEnvironmentalVisualEnhancements-HR,  \n\nFirespitterCore,  \n\nFirespitterResourcesConfig,  \n\nHyperEdit,  \n\nInfernalRobotics,  \n\nInfernalRobotics-Sequencer,  \n\nKAS,  \n\nKIS,  \n\nKerbalAircraftExpansion,  \n\nKerbalAlarmClock,  \n\nKlockheedMartian-Gimbal,  \n\nMechJeb2,  \n\nModuleManager,  \n\nProceduralDynamics,  \n\nQuickScroll,  \n\nQuickSearch,  \n\nRasterPropMonitor,  \n\nRasterPropMonitor-Core,  \n\nSCANsat,  \n\nScatterer,  \n\nSmokeScreen,  \n\nStockBugFixPlus,  \n\nThrottleControlledAvionics,  \n\nToadicusTools,  \n\nTweakScale,  \n\nTweakableEverything,  \n\nUSI-EXP,  \n\nUSI-FTT,  \n\nUSITools,  \n\nUniversalStorage,\n\n**Steps to replicate problem:**  \n\n- setup a fresh install of KSP 1.0.5 with just KIS 1.2.3 installed.  \n\n- Go into SPH and load up a simple craft.
