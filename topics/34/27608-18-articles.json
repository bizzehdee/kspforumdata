So first lemme say I love these wings; I\u0027ve created some truly breathtaking spaceplanes using them so I figured I better let ya know what\u0027s goin on so you can fix this awesome mod if possible, or at the very least advise people of the work around! So here ya go: Apparently, when you have a PWing/pair of PWings selected and \u0022lifted\u0022 (i.e., not placed yet) the game shows one Center of Lift, and after placed it moves and shows a different center of lift. The problem is that the first center of lift is the accurate one, the second is NOT. Here, pics to demonstrate: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://puu.sh/6bjdf.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00226bjdf.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote the green (lifted) wing shows the center of lift ahead of the center of mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://puu.sh/6bjeG.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00226bjeG.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter placing the wings, the center of lift jumps aft, to be in line with the center of mass. Now, attempting to FLY the plane at this point results in it attempting to permanently do loops, because its center of lift is ACTUALLY too far forward. The work around, then, is to design your CoM and CoL according to the indicated CoL when you have the PWings selected. I\u0027m not sure how this will work with multiple PWing craft, so I can\u0027t help you there, but aligning the CoL/CoM BEFORE placing the part will work correctly, even if the CoL jumps after placing the wing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, for those of you having problems with your wings bouncing around and causing crashes on the runway, you can limit that by strutting the wings to the body of the plane. The reason it occurs is that with normal wings in KSP, you\u0027ll likely attach larger wing bodies to multiple sections of the fuselage, whereas PWings only attach to one and then stretch. This is great for a visual effect, but the physics engine still thinks the wings are attached in just one location, causing severe instability when your plane is fairly heavy (as a good deal of mine are.) In the pic below, the 4 small grey blocks on the wings and fuselage are invisible struts; a part included in B9, but any strut will do. Hope this helps guys! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://puu.sh/6bjng.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00226bjng.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bloodbunny","CreatedById":67274,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-06T06:47:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat is one sweet spaceplane, though I would place the radiators inside a cargo bay for dem aesthetics .. in RL the wind would rip them off even undeployed\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dreadp1r4te","CreatedById":98426,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-06T08:49:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bloodbunny\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Bloodbunny\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat is one sweet spaceplane, though I would place the radiators inside a cargo bay for dem aesthetics .. in RL the wind would rip them off even undeployed\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI totally agree with you, but I don\u0027t have a cargo bay on that plane; it was designed to retrieve some crew from one of my LKO stations that I\u0027m decommissioning (read: planned lithobraking) because its a filthy lagwho-- it has too many parts. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E I was also testing out using KSP Interstellar\u0027s nuclear-powered thermal turbojet, which functions as a fuel-less turbojet in atmosphere, and a high-efficiency fueled rocket in vacuum.

The indicated CoL was some distance behind the Center of Mass, which meant it should have flown nose-heavy, if at all, but it actually flew very slightly nose-light (it wanted to pitch up when no control input was given / SAS-off).

Extreme wing-wobble with very high lift, unfortunately, seems to be a feature of the stock game- and might be part of why the designers only give us such puny stock wings to work with... Since the lift coefficient increases exponentially (I think by a power of 2) with wing surface area in the real world, you\u0027re going to end up with a lot more lift on that craft than you might otherwise expect- if P-Wings follows real life patterns...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(2) With that many engines, you have rather high TWR at takeoff. Combine that with high lift coefficient, and you\u0027ll have extremely high lift forces at takeoff, also not good for plane stability- especially with large P-Wings...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(3) Like was mentioned earlier, you have very little aerilion surface area (if any). Your roll-dampening control surfaces need to increase in size in proportion with your wings, or you don\u0027t have a prayer of maintaining stability. High SAS force may somewhat alleviate this problem, as what you have is essentially uncontrolled rolling (with bouncing back and forth as the air pushes the wings back when they move up/down)- but what you really need is some aerilons. Use wing-mounted landing gears with high clearance to protect them from runway/terrain impacts if necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(4) You really, really need to keep in mind how screwed-up the stock aerodynamics module is. In stock, drag is proportional to mass- so those heavy nuclear reactors on the wings are generating a TON of drag despite their small profile, and the extra drag on the wings really isn\u0027t helping with stability either...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(5) Last, but not least, MechJeb seems to have an especially hard time piloting vessels with large P-Wings. I\u0027m not sure if this is due to the size factor, or them being P-wings, but if you\u0027re using the ASAS in surface-mode, or some other autopilot functionality (such as the one from Firespitter), it has a very difficult time piloting craft with very large wings near sea-level, and tends to over or mis-correct for roll. This tends to generate 90% of the flapping-motion observed in my experience: especially with very low angles-of-attack. Even the stock SAS has some problems with the really large-winged craft. Your best bet is probably to launch the thing all-manual, and only switch over to autopilot after reaching at least 3000-5000 meters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(6) If all else fails, don\u0027t forget you can always launch your plane at reduced thrust. Often, I find that in these situations it helps to start the thrust at full to accelerate on the runway, then dial it back just before takeoff. Don\u0027t forget that the wing-mounted thrust itself can also destabilize the craft- especially with KSP-I thermal turbojets: which have no thrust-vectoring capabilities to help counteract this and steer the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope all this helps. Also, don\u0027t forget that P-Wings seem to have several annoying tendencies based on the game only processing wing attachments as \u0022point-attachments\u0022 occurring at just one location: usually halfway between the ends of where the wings contact the fuselage (this applies to stock as well as P-Wings).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis same rule also seems to be responsible for the annoying tendency of P-Wings to show CoL as too far forward with procedurally-designed swept-wings attached: as P-Wings are apparently not compatible with generating lift displaced from the attachment point more than a certain (small) amount... CoL will always show up right near the attachment point with P-Wings: no matter how far they are swept back...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S. You can see quite a bit of detail on my SSTADBK designs on my Mission Reports long-thread... I\u0027ve used P-Wings for almost all my later aircraft designs, so I had to work through a lot of associated problems that introduced. Even when I don\u0027t explicitly discuss problems I encountered, sometimes I hint at them, or you can catch glimpses of how I dealt with them from the screenshots of my flying and the designs themselves...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/57509-Kerbin-and-Beyond-a-Maturing-Space-Program\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/57509-Kerbin-and-Beyond-a-Maturing-Space-Program\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-08T06:32:27Z\u0022 title=\u002201/08/2014 06:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 8, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K3-Chris","CreatedById":61664,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-09T23:20:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERoot and Tip thickness tweakables seem to do bumpkins.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kaa253","CreatedById":68628,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-11T07:48:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tex_NL\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Tex_NL\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThey are not.
