This allows the player to simulate what real-life probes do when something unexpected happens: they try to re-establish a connection with home! It\u0027s handy for...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nRetracting antennas during aerobraking and extending them when you\u0027re done!\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nRecovering from mistakes (whoops, Comsat1 just blew up!).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAdding RemoteTech to an existing game (since when you load them up for the first time, all the probes have their antennas turned off).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBesides making it more forgiving, activating and pointing antennas without a connection is also (arguably) more realistic. In real life, probes have low-gain omni-directional antennas that allow space agencies to easily send simple commands across the solar system (like, \u0022point your main dish over here\u0022) and probes generally have the intelligence to attempt to re-establish connection if they lose it. In some ways, standard RemoteTech is less forgiving of simple mistakes than real life interplanetary networks! That was my reason for creating XF.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt also fixes the issue RemoteTech has when being added into games that are already in progress. Specifically, since antennas on pre-existing probes are deactivated, these probes end up dead in space, even if you set up a interplanetary network later! Again, the simple act of allowing the user to activate antennas without connection to KSC fixes this! You\u0027ll need to set up your network, but once it\u0027s up, your existing probes can connect to it!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EInstallation\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E1.

But basically it lets omnidirectional antennas get a lot more range when they\u0027re communicating with more powerful antennas (like real life!). I also run with the power consumption halved on my game. Especially in the early game, when you just have the static solar panels, the dishes consume way too much juice. Oh, and unless you want to use MechJeb or KOS, you probably want to turn off speed of light. There\u0027s a lot of impossible stuff in Kerbal Space Program already, so I don\u0027t think it\u0027s a stretch to say that in their universe, light moves infinitely fast. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EQ: \u003C/strong\u003EWhat does XF stand for?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EA: \u003C/strong\u003EI\u0027m not sure.
