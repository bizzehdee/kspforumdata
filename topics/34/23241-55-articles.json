That flight could have gone better...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt does this regardless of having the cargo bay start open or closed, though starting with it open does at least cause it to shield parts outside of the cargo bay immediately, which saves some time and frustration. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I\u0027m mostly posting this so people are aware. It\u0027s not really a bug with B9, and it\u0027s not something I expect Bac or Taverius to fix. FAR just doesn\u0027t like the way these cargo bays are implemented. Due to the extreme popularity of B9, I have to imagine these FAR incompatibilities will be patched in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m wondering if the fix might be as simple as placing some part like a thin plate at the front wall of the bay, and telling FAR that part is a aerodynamic nosecone.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"verikosto","CreatedById":59405,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-03T10:52:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone willing to explain to me how to install this mod? im bit confused :s\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Temeter","CreatedById":58056,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-03T11:08:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022verikosto\u0022 data-cite=\u0022verikosto\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDoes anyone willing to explain to me how to install this mod? im bit confused :s\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust unpack the Gamedata-folder into your KSP-Directory.
