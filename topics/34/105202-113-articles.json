Among other things, I am experimenting with making some parts into dedicated life support recyclers, or combination recycler and storage. However, the \u0022Supporting MKS in your mod\u0022 part of the MKS wiki doesn\u0027t list any recommendations for this sort of part. The formula for life support recyclers only applies to parts like the Kerbitat that are meant to be habitation and recycling together.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E So I only have one part to base it on, which is the RT-500... and that seems to be deliberately made as a clunky early-game part, that is really heavy for what it does. \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027d welcome suggestions!\n\u003E \n\nThe RT-500 actually follows the formula given: 0.6 tons of mass / 1 kerbal = 0.6 recycle percent.\n\nNote that the guidance in the wiki uses \u0027number of kerbals\u0027 in this section not to mean \u0027number of kerbals that fit into this part\u0027 but to mean \u0027number of kerbals this part recycles supplies for\u0027 - those Kerbals may be in that part or in another part entirely.  To quote the wiki:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Quote\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Crew capacity is different then seating capacity; it is the number of crew that this part can recycle (at 100% of rated recycle rate) for. That may be higher or lower than the seating capacity.\n\u003E \n\nSo the fact that the part has a *seating* capacity of zero doesn\u0027t mean that it\u0027s *crew recycle* capacity can\u0027t be 1, or 5, or 10, or whatever, and the guidance should apply to that.\n\nIf the part is multi-purpose, you should decide how much mass is dedicated to each part of the purpose and calculate based on that.  So, if your part is combination recycler and storage ideally some of the mass should be dedicated to handling the \u0027storage\u0027 and not included in the formula.  For example a 2.5 ton part that includes a storage bay might decide that 0.5 tons is dedicated to holding the storage, and then if you decided that it had a crew recycle capacity of 5 it\u0027s percent would be 0.4.  (2/5)\n\nI hope that helps and clears things up.  If you have suggestions on how to clarify the wiki I\u0027d be glad to hear them.  ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022;)\u0022)"}]}
