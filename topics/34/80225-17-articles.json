I\u0027ve noticed that when I use the rovemax structural body, it always wants to have it be vertical, might be because the part is spawned vertical. VAB or SPH makes no difference since you still have to use a probe core to get it facing the right direction.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Errol","CreatedById":118622,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-28T16:33:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been trying to store landers in the hangar that have two 1.25m outriggers on either side of a mk1 lander can.
