They start off flush against the ship, and when I\u0027m in orbit/landed, the hinge rotates, the beams now stick out from the ship, my panels extend, and voila, huge solar plant.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Now this all works fine... except when I load the ship back up. Some kind of physics \u0027wobble\u0027 occurs, making the hinge (I think) spin clockwise and counterclockwise wildly. This makes the metal beams and the solar panels spin all over the place, eventually tumbling the ship over and breaking everything.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E For now I\u0027ve just removed the IR hinges, but it makes me sad because I loved that setup. Anyone know if there\u0027s some tweak or setting that stops IR hinges from spazzing out like that when I load the ship?

I have found that if you limit the number of Gigantor arrays to a maximum of 2 attached to each metal beam part then the wobbles do not start up. It also looks like I can join beam segments end-to-end with each segment carrying two arrays with (so far) no wobbles attack. So for example with [@ZodiusInfuser](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/76163-zodiusinfuser/) rework truss segments I can join 3 RoboTruss Pro - 2.5m beams together to give a 7.5m long truss and then mount 6 Gigantors (2 each) with (fingers crossed) no wobble out.

And if you have any more questions ask away.\n\u003E \n\nTrue.\n\nBut O.K., i actually have one more question: how to cope with the uncontrollable dive into which the craft plunges when i change the position of the rotors from helicopter to airplane? And vice versa.\n\nSo far two things quite worked: first - the rotors are balanced so, that the change of their position doesn\u0027t affect the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E and second - setting the speed and acceleration of the rotatrons as low as possible. But it still isn\u0027t quite enough."},{"CreatedByName":"V8jester","CreatedById":136093,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-04T04:43:38Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 7 hours ago, Salvator said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E True.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E But O.K., i actually have one more question: how to cope with the uncontrollable dive into which the craft plunges when i change the position of the rotors from helicopter to airplane?

The other trick I used was to clip 4-5 large \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E rings inside the craft with the offset tool.
