It still functions like the generator, burning monopropellant for electric charge. I guess you could head cannon it as hydrazine reacting with some kind of oxidizer that\u0027s inside the cell. Either way it\u0027s intended as an early game alternative to solar panels. \n\u003E The idea is to remove it from the service module, although I am worried about people not being able to click on it and action groups are stupidly not available in the early career. (The new service module has no doors just a hollow back end) I may put it to a vote to see if I should make it a stand alone part or not. If not this asset can still be used, I\u0027ll just add it to the inside of the service module. \n\u003E \n\u003E The foil not being stock-alike doesn\u0027t bother me too much. Mostly because it\u0027s such a common space craft element that it probably *should* be represented in some stock parts. It\u0027s on the engine mostly just to evoke a connection to the Gemini equipment module. Although, I\u0027m aware that Gemini had no engine propper.\n\nAs far as I am aware this is the only way we can get a monopropellan fuel cell into the game as a stand alone part. As it stands Universal Storage provides Hydrogen/Oxygen fuel cell. The stock game provides Liquid Fuel/oxidizer fuel cell. It would be nice to see the monopropellan burner as an option. \n\nAs a general rule of thumb when working out what should be available and where it fits. I would suggest people take a look at the FASA mod as it has a full sized conversion of Gemini. It does show that there is indeed engines and generators. The delta-v is just enough to de-orbit but that\u0027s all. However RCS maneuvering is good. \n\nAs it stands Corvus is a close match and very much more Kerbal stock-like. An especially useful feature is the size remains the same for all the parts. The addition of a service module with working sub-assemblies is great.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-10T14:47:36Z\u0022 title=\u002206/10/2015 02:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by nobodyhasthis**"},{"CreatedByName":"Orionkermin","CreatedById":91013,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T15:11:08Z","Content":"Yea I like the idea of having the generator as its own part, so I\u0027m sorry for the extra VAB clutter, but that\u0027s how it\u0027s going to be.

Great ideas.\n\nI do actually think the current chute/docking texture is perfect as is. In fact all the textures are good. Remember textures are always sacrificed later on for more RAM.\n\nThis how I currently integrate the Corvus into my game. For the aerodynamics add-on I already have a mini stack decouple and escape system on top. That gets ejected after leaving atmosphere. Just before orbital the insertion burn. Right now hitting abort separates my Corvus off the service module, fires the escape system and arms chute. Poor little pod gets violently thrown clear of a launch failure but the crew survive every time. \n\nI also currently like use my own service module which is a 1.25m service bay containing a FL-R10 RCS Tank, TAC life supplies, battery pack and a few early science experiments. If your are using Mechjeb or Kerbal Engineering Redux parts they can also be attached in there. It is a very rewarding experience to pack it all in and shut the doors. I can see me using the new service module like this.\n\nAs I don\u0027t have the generator as a stand alone. A Universal Storage section can be added instead. In the early game this activated through right mouse button context menu not by action group. It comes into play just before solar cells. In my game solar cells come later and are awkward to fit for a while. Eventually I get the proper folding ones but the generator stays attached as an emergency back up all the way through the rest of the career. \n\nShe sits as an important step up from the basic single man pod. A real workhorse in for the first half of the total career. Eventually she gets replaced with bigger and better pods but never completely leaves the space program.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-10T17:38:49Z\u0022 title=\u002206/10/2015 05:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by nobodyhasthis**"},{"CreatedByName":"JPmAn","CreatedById":121564,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T20:17:14Z","Content":"i don\u0027t want this to go dead!"},{"CreatedByName":"TaintedLion","CreatedById":137942,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T17:00:37Z","Content":"Is the Corvus docking port compatible with the Clamp-O-Tron Jr.?"},{"CreatedByName":"komodo","CreatedById":102065,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T17:09:21Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Is the Corvus docking port compatible with the Clamp-O-Tron Jr.?\n\nI think it ought to be; you can check the config files, if the size is the same between the two, they should mate up."},{"CreatedByName":"Orionkermin","CreatedById":91013,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T17:15:45Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E i don\u0027t want this to go dead!\n\nIt\u0027s not dead don\u0027t worry. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) I\u0027ve just been a little busy with other games/ projects this last week, so I haven\u0027t had anything worth posting.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Is the Corvus docking port compatible with the Clamp-O-Tron Jr.?\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I think it ought to be; you can check the config files, if the size is the same between the two, they should mate up.\n\nYup, unless something broke, it should be compatible with the clamp-o-tron jr."},{"CreatedByName":"Murdabenne","CreatedById":142825,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T05:00:44Z","Content":"Mark as updated for 1.0.3 so CKAN picks it up again?"},{"CreatedByName":"JPmAn","CreatedById":121564,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T23:51:46Z","Content":"What\u0027s planned for the next update?"},{"CreatedByName":"Murdabenne","CreatedById":142825,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T06:23:10Z","Content":"I\u0027ll toss in a version range in the netkan entry, that should allow CKAN to see this as compatible."},{"CreatedByName":"Murdabenne","CreatedById":142825,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T10:03:31Z","Content":"FYI, this mod (Corvus) plus the base HGR module of this was given an override as \u0022compatible\u0022 with 1.0.2 thru 1.0.4 on CKAN, let them know if that was in error."},{"CreatedByName":"Jarin","CreatedById":71395,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T17:40:34Z","Content":"So, I noticed something odd today.

Second pass was a full re-entry from about 5kKm, which would have normally destroyed pod components, but it went smooth as silk; the depleted and broken heat shield still providing plenty of protection from the heat.
