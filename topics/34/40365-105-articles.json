With 2 generators on one reactor I got 2 times the mj/s untill they used up the heat then it dropped back to the max output of the reactor. I don\u0027t remember which had priority but I have also done, for example, a reactor with a generator on one side and a thermal jet on the other. I will test again later today to see if I can still do this stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
