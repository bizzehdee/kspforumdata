Trust me, I know. A supernova pours out so many deadly forms of radiation, any nearby planets will be scorched. If Sonnah would be colored red by a supernova, it\u0027d mean that it\u0027s also being blasted with various different kinds of deadly radiation, because light and radiation are the same thing - electromagnetic waves.
