My testing of the CBM was not as thorough as it could have been as I set it up in the same manner as I did the Orion docking port, and didn\u0027t think that it wouldn\u0027t work. I did test docking the base of the PMA to a CBM (the PMA\u0027s 1.25m base is a docking port so it does not need a CBM attached to it to dock to a CBM) while the PMA had an Orion port so I could make sure that I could dock the PMA to a CBM and then dock the Orion port back to the PMA, which worked. I will do some more extensive testing on the CBM to see if I can find out what is going on."},{"CreatedByName":"Damminh Khoi","CreatedById":149396,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-05T13:29:32Z","Content":"en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuttle-Derived\\_Launch\\_Vehicle#/media/File:Saturn\\_V-Shuttle-Ares\\_I-Ares\\_V-Ares\\_IV-SLS\\_Block\\_I\\_comparison.png Perhaps some Anhur 5 and 4.

Like in the picture"},{"CreatedByName":"TheShadow1138","CreatedById":53694,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-05T16:10:56Z","Content":"**Docking Progress Report:** The issue with the CBM, reported by Sgt.Shutesie, has been identified. Apparently I did not set them up in the same way as the NDS Orion docking port. I did not set the \u0022dockingNode\u0022 gameObject to have its \u002BZ-Axis pointed in along the parts \u002BY-Axis as it should have been. Correcting this, as well as setting the \u0022acquireRange\u0022 parameter to \u00220.5\u0022, has made it much easier/possible to dock modules with CBMs. There does, however, appear to be an issue with the PMA docking to the CBM as it should. I did discover that the dockingNode of the PMA was also not set correctly in Unity, and it was corrected at the same time I corrected the CBM. In the succeeding tests, however, I launched a module (via the Shuttle, more on that in a minute) with two CBMs and a PMA attached to one of the CBMs to add to the test station in orbit. I docked the tug to the module\u0027s open CBM and successfully docked with the orbiter to temporarily remove the PMA to dock the module to the station. Once the module was docked to the station, however, the PMA refused to dock with multiple CBMs. I believe that the issue may be that the docking node is on the bottom of the PMA, so I have the dockingNode \u002BZ-Axis aligned with the part\u0027s -Y-Axis. I am able to decouple a PMA from a CBM and then dock the PMA back to the CBM using a docking test craft on the pad at KSC with \u0022Hack Gravity\u0022, but the CBMs also worked in that setup before the fix and refused to dock while in orbit.\n\nIf anyone out there has had experience with placing the docking node for a part on the bottom I would appreciate any advice. I will keep testing the PMA and once I have it working reliably I will release an update.\n\n**Shuttle Stability:** I am still experimenting with the Shuttle\u0027s ascent stability issues after SRB separation. I have rebalanced the mass of the orbiter by decreasing the mass of the OMS engines (as they had the same mass as the SSMEs, an unfortunate oversight on my part), and after further test fights added that mass back in as MonoPropellant in the OMS Pods. I also increased the mass of the Shuttle Docking System Airlock to try and keep the CoM forward of the CoL for landing.\n\nMy most recent flight, to deliver a second module to my test station, was much less of a headache than previous attempts. I turned the STS stack in the VAB so that the orbiter was already aligned nose-down to ensure that no roll or yaw would be needed to orient the stack correctly after liftoff. The reason for doing this was that when launching modules with the Setesh IV (Delta IV) that even though the vehicles were perfectly symmetrical, the SAS was still trying to cancel some small amount of roll. The only thing I could think of that the two vehicles had in common was that there was an initial roll maneuver after liftoff, and orienting the Shuttle to eliminate this maneuver did reveal that the SAS no longer tried to cancel out any roll. I also completely disabled the rudder for the ascent so that after SRB separation the SSMEs and the elevons would work for pitch and roll while only the SSMEs would work for yaw. I did need to do some yaw and roll correction, but I was able to get an orbit that was only inclined by 3\u00BA, better than the nearly 40\u00BA inclination I had gotten on some previous launches. I will also note that this was the first Shuttle flight where I was able to successfully land the orbiter and at KSC to boot. I will continue to work on the Shuttle\u0027s stability issues to hopefully make it more flyable even without a payload for shuttling crew to and from your space stations.\n\n*Edit:*\n\n**Updated to Version 1.2.2**\n\nChanges 1.2.2:\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\n\n\\* Corrected Issues with the CBM and PMA\n\n\\* Corrected an issue where the Serenity Service Module would lose all of its ElectricCharge when entering the flight scene.\n\n\\* Upped Delta-V of the Orion Spacecraft to about 1100 m/s\n\n\\* Updated Craft Files and subassemblies to account for the changes to the Orion SM\n\n\\* Very Slight update to the ShadowWorks-STS.craft that orients the stack to eliminate the initial roll maneuver.\n\n***There is a test engine part that I forgot to take out. You can remove the file \u0022ShadowWorks/Parts/SSME/SSME2.cfg\u0022 to remove the part. It is identical to the SSME except it uses \u0022ModuleControlSurface\u0022 instead of \u0022ModuleGimbal\u0022.***\n\nI seem to have corrected all of the issues with the CBM and PMA. They may sometimes take a little longer than expected to dock, but they will dock, but if people still experience problems please let me know. As stated in the change log and above, placing the Shuttle nose down on the pad does seem to have helped with what I have dubbed the \u0022phantom roll\u0022 that made the Shuttle so unstable after SRB separation even when it cares no payload. You may need to provide some roll and yaw input together, but it is much more flyable (in my opinion) than before. You will need to re-activate the yaw capability of the rudder before re-entry if you want yaw capability without RCS during the re-entry glide.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-01T02:18:47Z\u0022 title=\u002212/01/2015 02:18  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TheShadow1138**"},{"CreatedByName":"TheShadow1138","CreatedById":53694,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-11T22:52:41Z","Content":"I\u0027d like to run something by those who are interested.
