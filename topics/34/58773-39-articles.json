\u00A0For now, this is \u0022I\u0027d like some help\u0022. \u00A0Most of my mods are basically in maintenance mode at this point. \u00A0I\u0027ve got some bugs to fix in AntennaRange, a feature to fix and a feature to add in TweakableEverything, and the Scripted functionality to finish in VOID. \u00A0I\u0027m going to get those done one way or another -- probably on my own, hopefully next week. \u00A0But past that, the mods really just need some TLC every time Squad updates the game, and when a new player turns over a bit of untested code in a corner to find a bug or defect.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re interested, please e-mail me: my address is andy (at) wtribe (dotcom), and I\u0027d love to hear from you. \u00A0You don\u0027t need to be a C# expert, but programming experience seems pretty necessary. \u00A0I\u0027m happy to hold your hand through things and help you learn -- that\u0027s how I learned, and I\u0027m entirely willing to share what I\u0027ve learned with you. \u00A0Write me a quick letter -- maybe a couple of paragraphs -- so I can tell you\u0027re not a robot, and in the letter just try to convince me that you\u0027re right for the projects and willing to do what you can to keep these mods successful, and these threads positive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m cross-posting this on the threads for all my mods. \u00A0Thanks again for being awesome!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve sent a message to @toadicius about this mod, hope to hear from him soon\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLinuxgurugamer\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"linuxgurugamer","CreatedById":129964,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-11T17:21:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve heard back from \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/67745-toadicus/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002267745\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/67745-toadicus/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@toadicus\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s a go!!!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut it\u0027s going to take a few days before I can work on it\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Planet","CreatedById":134209,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-11T19:30:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/129964-linuxgurugamer/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022129964\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/129964-linuxgurugamer/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@linuxgurugamer\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0Cheers!
