Either it is my tree, or TreeLoader itself, but one or the other gives me some form of problems when I play, namely the vessel recovery problem I mentioned somewhat above this post, with subsequent workaround that works for me just fine, and which nobody seems to have noticed. Anyway, I was hoping to wait until TreeLoader or KSP itself could handle bigger trees before tackling another round of TechTree modding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHi Ackander,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was wondering if you have found a way to update the tech tree and if this mod will be continued eventually? Considering to use BTSM, but I dont really like how it doesnt integrate other mods. Your mod is much more appealing when wanting to add remote tech, more modules etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould love if you updated it!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ClLaw","CreatedById":112177,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-05T01:56:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETime to bump this. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the release of \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003ETechManager\u003C/span\u003E you\u0027re now able to play all the old tech trees as well as any new ones so I\u0027m hoping this gets updated as I\u0027m using it in a play-through now but so many nodes are empty or parts out of place.
