FreeEVA-0.2.0 and FirstPersonEVA satisfy my request perfectly. So, no need to waste your efforts there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do have another EVA challenge (far simpler, I imagine). When a Kerbal is on EVA and hovering about a station or vessel, I\u0027m constantly tinkering with the WASD keys to stay in place in relation to that vessel. That\u0027s because WASD/Shft/Ctrl is clumsy which cannot be fine-tuned, such as with RCS in docking mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy suggestion is to provide a toggle whereby the kerbals X/Y/Z velocity vector match those of the vessel. Thus, the kerbal isn\u0027t moving in relation to the vessel. When the player pushes the WASD/Shft/Ctrl keys, the Kerbal translates in that direction. Upon release of the key, the kerbal\u0027s X/Y/Z velocity vectors are then set to those of the vessel again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis assumes the vessel\u0027s roll/pitch/yaw (X/Y/Z rotation velocity vectors) are 0. It\u0027s incumbent upon the player to ensure that. It\u0027s a bit much to ask of you to take those in consideration as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf there are two or vessels in the vicinity, it would be nice if the player can select the vessel. Perhaps a simple solution is to match whatever vessel the kerbal was last in or attached to (via a ladder)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I mentioned, this functionality should be a toggle in the kerbal\u0027s context menu, so the kerbal can fly about without limitations, when necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, when/why would I use this? EVERY EVA I would go on. I would toggle the thing on as a default (maybe add that to a CFG file?) I use KAS\u0027s functionality a lot to relocate and replace equipment on vessels. So I currently have to tinker with the WASD keys while trying to place the item precisely. Your function would ease that pain tremendously. I also transfer kerbals between station parts and habitats via EVA instead of KSP v0.25 EVA Transfer function (yeah, I\u0027m old school. Using the Transfer function between modules that are not directly connected seems like \u0022cheating\u0022 to me.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethanks, again, for all your work to fix Squad\u0027s failures. I wish is that Squad would do a release whereby they concentrated ONLY on bug fixes (As Space Engineers and Prison Architect do). Players would be far happier to be able to play with the game they\u0027ve got instead of the bug-ridden PoS that Squad wants. In both SE and PA, players have universally applauded bug-squash/no-new-features releases.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-02T16:10:10Z\u0022 title=\u002212/02/2014 04:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 2, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Apollo13\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-03T03:16:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Apollo13\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Apollo13\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMy suggestion is to provide a toggle whereby the kerbals X/Y/Z velocity vector match those of the vessel.
