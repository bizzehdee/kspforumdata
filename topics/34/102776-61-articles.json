I tried it in sandbox mode, put a satellite in a 250km 0degree orbit, ran the timewarp as high as it would go and watched. It ran without problems with the vessel loaded for about 5 years. Then I returned to KSC and ran time forward and within 10 days got the SOI warning for the vessel and when I checked it, it was on its way to Jool.\n\nI put in a new satellite and tried again from the tracking station, First with the vessel selected, no problems. Unselected vessel, and within a few orbits I see the orbit shift around the Mun and it crashes after about 10 days.\n\nI then had a little brainfart and put 2 sattelites in orbit, one as active vessel, the other as it\u0027s target and both stay in their orbits in high timewarp. Unselect the target at 100000X timewarp and Titanus, here we come !!!!\n\nI don\u0027t suppose this little testing session will help a whole lot, I guess you would have tested the hell out of this bug yourself by now.\n\nMostly it stops me from doing contracts around the mun that require any orbital work. It\u0027s not a hoge hit but there are some very profitable StationScience contracts I have to pass on. And it stops me from doing a refueling operation on the mun.\n\nI checked the forum posts and there seem to be no more reports of this issue coming in the last few months, so are there any other people still seeing this happening?\n\nModlist:\n\n-New Horizons                 -KW rocketry\n\n-KSP Interstellar E           -Infernal robotics\n\n-KCT                                -tweakscale\n\n-KAS/KIS                         -KAC\n\n-TAC LS/FB                     -Station science\n\n-Orbital science               -Mechjeb\n\n-Scansat                         -and a lot of dependencies coming with these mods\n\nAnyhow, I absolutely love this mod and the challenges it adds, so KillAshley keep up the good work and thanks for still staying on this project. I can only hope you will continue when 1.1 hits because this mod deserves 64bits KSP.\n\nthanks"}]}
