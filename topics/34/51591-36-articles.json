This satellite has both a DTS and Communotron 16 antennas installed. The probe has only a 16.

Not even when the satellites are directly overhead is it able to go green. Only yellow ranges for this poor fellow. It tries to talk to Kerbin, and Kerbin is never visible. Curiously, the other probes, closer to the equator, either transmit directly with a fine green line or get helped by the sats when on the dark side. Not the polar one. All of them completely ignore the Relay I placed halfway there---just for them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll this time I thought the probes would take advantage of stronger antennas nearby and relay the info effortlessly back if Kerbin was too far/not within LOS.

I\u0027m guessing your polar lander is blocked from LOS to Kerbin by Minmus. There are a lot of reasons that this could be the case, but suffice it to say that polar regions are the most likely to suffer from a \u0022false positive\u0022 on the occlusion check. As you said, that\u0027s fine and why you\u0027ve got relay satellites.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, as to your connection woes with your relays: remember that link ranges are \u0022additive\u0022. It\u0027s geometrically additive, not arithmetically additive, so it\u0027s not as simple as 18 km \u002B 18 km, and in fact two Comm 16s have specifically sqrt(18*18)=18 km range to each other. That is why your satellites can \u0022phone home\u0022 on their own just fine, but can barely get a positive connection to each other. This is actually quite realistic; the surface-based radio antennas on Earth/Kerbin are huge and use ultra-sensitive equipment to convert the (literally microwatts of) power we get from e.g. the Voyager probes into a meaningful signal. The gain on the big DSN telescopes on Earth is something like 73 dB -- that means they effectively multiply the strength of the signal by 10^7.3. The gain on the Voyager radio dishes themselves is much lower (but still pretty high); if memory serves it\u0027s around 48 dB. I don\u0027t model gain explicitly in AntennaRange, but using the geometric mean the way I am, and the way I\u0027ve designed all the antennas, intentionally and more-or-less accurately models that behavior.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 88-88 has a really long range (read: high gain), which means connections from 16s to 88-88s will work at much greater distances: about 12 Mm. I think that\u0027ll be enough for the 88-88 to act as a relay for all your whips in the Dunan system, unless you\u0027re planning some actions well outside Ike\u0027s orbit. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope that helps.

The gain on the big DSN telescopes on Earth is something like 73 dB -- that means they effectively multiply the strength of the signal by 10^7.3. The gain on the Voyager radio dishes themselves is much lower (but still pretty high); if memory serves it\u0027s around 48 dB. I don\u0027t model gain explicitly in AntennaRange, but using the geometric mean the way I am, and the way I\u0027ve designed all the antennas, intentionally and more-or-less accurately models that behavior.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 88-88 has a really long range (read: high gain), which means connections from 16s to 88-88s will work at much greater distances: about 12 Mm. I think that\u0027ll be enough for the 88-88 to act as a relay for all your whips in the Dunan system, unless you\u0027re planning some actions well outside Ike\u0027s orbit. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope that helps. I\u0027d like in the future to make displaying this sort of information in game a little simpler, but it\u0027s unclear at this point whether I\u0027ll get to that before this behavior gets Stockified in 1.1, and what I do after that point remains very unclear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe README has a little more detail if you want to look into the maths of it all: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/toadicus/AntennaRange/blob/master/README.md\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/toadicus/AntennaRange/blob/master/README.md\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for your reply!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs it happens, the polar probe was not only placed on a difficult latitude but also sitting inside a crater.

That said, I will need some more careful planning on my next missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I understand correctly, the 88 will serve as a relay for the Dunan probes as they try to talk to Kerbin, but they will stay in the yellow while the 88 keeps a green line. Is this correct? The problem then is a matter of energy, not range. And that also means that my Eeloo probe, also en route, is doomed, since it only has a DTS. Not even the 88 orbiting around Duna will suffice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis raises even more interesting questions. How many relays can a \u0022comm chain\u0022 have without losing power/gain/range to be effective or useful? If I wanted to, in the far future, establish a base or station around Eeloo, how many antennas and where to place them? What if I wanted to have a full green connection all throughout the Kerbol System? Is this even possible? I\u0027m guessing an 88 at every major celestial?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a very fine mod, sir.
