With the latest update, the screwdriver in my Surface Experiment Pack mod became non-functional (it\u0027s supposed to be similar to the wrench, though only doing stackAttach, not surfaceAttach). Every time I hit \u0022H\u0022 with it equipped now, KIS states \u0022Tool Needed: This part cannot be attached without a tool.\u0022. Attempting to attach now results in the part being dropped. I\u0027m a little frustrated, since this basically breaks my mod. ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif \u0022:(\u0022)\n\u003E \n\nSo, that\u0027s what I\u0027ve figured out:\n\n1. \u0060toolPartAttach\u0060 is \u0060ModuleKISItemAttachTool\u0060 is a setting to say if the tool enables attaching (there can be tools that don\u0027t allow attaching, and serve for some other purpose). By setting it to \u0060false\u0060 you say it cannot. And that\u0027s what you observe with your current setup of screwdriver.\n2. The KIS code is fine. There was a bug with checking equipped tool: the check was omitted in some cases. And this bug you\u0027ve actually exploited in your mod ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022).\n3. The \u0022plug\u0022 in your mod is configured for static attachment which lets attaching it to the ground. It doesn\u0027t seem reasonable to me given the declared purpose of the plug.\n\nThat said, I\u0027d suggest you to do the following fixes:\n\n1. Set \u0060toolPartAttach = true\u0060 in the screwdriver to allow it attaching things. It will make this tool a full equivalent of the KIS electric screwdriver. I may guess this is a consequence you were trying to workaround but setting \u0060toolPartAttach = false\u0060 is not the right way to do it. The problem of attaching some parts with a specific tool needs to be addressed in the KIS at a more global scope. E.g. allow an item or part to be configured to which part(s) it can be attached, and what tool is needed for this. Let me know if this is the issue and I\u0027ll create a feature request.\n2. Set \u0060allowStaticAttach = 0\u0060 and \u0060allowPartAttach = 2\u0060 in the plug to allow this part be attached to another part when the tool is present. Btw, these are the default settings so, you can just drop them from the config altogether.\n\nAs far as I can tell these changes will result in what you need. Does it sound reasonable?"},{"CreatedByName":"sardia","CreatedById":149922,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-02T06:53:50Z","Content":"Note, for stable and strong connections, don\u0027t use the pipes.

The thread for that mod has another person bringing this up, but no solution except to downgrade. I tried to see if I could find a configuration change that would fix the issue, but had not luck. My best guess, is that there is something in EPL that is wrong, since the concrete base from KIS, the pylon from KAS and the peaceable light from MKS/OKS all work correctly.
