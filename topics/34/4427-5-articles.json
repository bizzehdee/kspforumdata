Its not the trouble of getting to the speed of light that is the problem... We could achieve that not easily... But we\u0027ve been capable of that for about 30 years. Theres already rocket designs avalible if you care to search them. The problem is the size of these space craft is mind blowing.. And we have nor the time or resources to build them including even if we did get to the speed of light... Hitting particles at that speed would destroy the space craft. So before we get to and probably past the speed of light, we need to devise a way to do it safely.
