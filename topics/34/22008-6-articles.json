On Kerbin, that\u0027s right above the bottom 25% of the atmosphere bar, or about 13km. Below that altitude, there\u0027s a point where buoyancy evens out against the weight of everything else that\u0027s strapped onto the envelope, i.e. the ship. Within this range of altitudes, envelopes can compensate for engine TWR being too low, but if I understand it correctly, they do not actually contribute to delta V. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeyond the higher of these two altitudes, it\u0027s straightforward lifting with extra weight, since we get no lift from envelopes anymore.

What I found them most suitable for, though, is replacing exploration rovers on Duna (and Kerbin itself) -- using a deployable envelope with an electric propeller from Firespitter mod makes the best means of transport for an atmospheric planet. You don\u0027t waste fuel, you don\u0027t run the risk of destroying your rover on a random bump in the ground, and you\u0027re still flying at aircraft speeds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI seriously clocked in well over 1000km over Duna with one airship, and once I can continue the save from 0.19 I have 800km more waiting for me. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ahappydude","CreatedById":458,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-26T20:42:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirespitters plane plugin and parts by snjo, dukes seasickness cure is good playing with this to \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hooligan Labs","CreatedById":45359,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-28T00:31:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETextures fixed!
