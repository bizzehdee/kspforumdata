It doesn\u0027t work very well in terms of scaling the mass or tanks of switchable-mesh/switchable mas/switchable tanks parts, however. So it can be used, but it will not produce what you are expecting in many cases. Essentially, the mass and tank capacity of switchable parts reverts to whatever its non-scaled state is every time you do anything to a part you\u0027ve scaled. So if you scale up a fuel tank, for example, it will appear at first to have scaled its mass/capacity correctly. If you pick up the part and set it down again, it will revert to whatever its mass/capacity is at 100% scale. I\u0027m not sure, but I think that saving/reloading ships can sometimes correct certain parts of that problem temporarily. I left a message in the TS thread about Firespitter switchy parts, but I assume Biotronic is busy with real life at the moment since he hasn\u0027t been as present in the TS thread recently as he has been in the past.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you don\u0027t want B9 parts to change scale at all, you can do one of two things:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Just don\u0027t change their scale in the VAB/SPH - if you don\u0027t, they will work fine and TweakScale won\u0027t break them or anything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Delete the .cfg that applies to B9 parts - probably B9_TweakScale.cfg in the TweakScale directory. Then you won\u0027t have the option of scaling the parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuestion for the authors: for those of us who love tweakscale, is there a way to hack together non-tank-switching parts based on the different meshes available without generating a whole bunch of work for you? E.g. a non-switchable RCS tank with the corresponding 2x1 or 1x1 part mesh so that we can tweakscale like crazy people?
