Objects like the Hubble telescope and the ISS have to constantly use reaction wheels or thrusters to counteract the gravity tidal effect trying to orient them like spokes on a wheel. The effect can be used to advantage for things like communication satellites by making them long enough and distributing mass towards the ends so they\u0027ll keep the antenna aimed down without needing constant attitude control.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"drtedastro","CreatedById":70911,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-10T21:34:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello to all.

Another landing test on Eve. Almost working.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince I\u0027ll be needing to do on-surface refueling, I got out the functional but pointless* drill rover I tested on Mun and added four more of the white radial mount engines, bringing the total to six.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst test it was going down nicely, almost down to the right landing speed... then it began to rapidly wobble back and forth with the engines at full throttle, eventually hard landing, breaking all four landing legs in the down position, breaking 7 of the 8 wheels and breaking off some of the engines and fuel tanks. It\u0027s built to jettison them with separatrons after landing. There\u0027s no RCS on it, just reaction wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond test I stuck on four radial mount parachutes on the fuel tanks. Comes down nice and stable... hey, is it going to light up or not? Gear down... engines? Hello computer? We could use some thrust about now! Hard landing at 8 meters per second after yet another too late burn at less than full throttle, only broke one landing leg which I was able to get rid of by driving forward a bit to make it explode. But still unsatisfactory because the design uses the legs for stability and if needed a bit of extra height to connect to the lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps using only a couple of chutes would keep enough vertical velocity to push MechJeb into starting the burn higher and harder to get the speed down to the requested .5 meter/second? Or perhaps going up to 1 would change things?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFuel tanks used are an X200-8 and four FL-T400. MechJeb is a miserly user of this supply. Without the parachutes it landed with over 70% of it left. It has enough engine thrust, it has more than enough fuel to make a safe one way trip down to Eve, but MechJeb is being too conservative on the final landing burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve had landers run out of fuel many times testing on Kerbin, Mun and Duna with MechJeb, so why can\u0027t I get it to burn it all landing on Eve? This is a situation where I\u0027d be happy if it\u0027d burn almost all the way down, as long as it\u0027d calculate the trajectory to leave just fumes in the tanks at touchdown.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen running out of fuel on other planets, the solution is to add more fuel, then add more engine if the additional weight makes it crash. Eve appears to need little fuel but lots of engine to land, but requires a supertanker\u0027s worth of fuel to get back to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt should be possible to put together a single stage orbit to surface to orbit Eve lander with a TWR greater than 1 in Eve gravity with full tanks. Give it just enough fuel to land with an aggressive burn profile then refuel on the surface, filling up all the tanks so the engines can run long enough to push the ship back up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*No fuel savings moving the heavy drills from the lander to the separate rover on Mun, but a bunch of work to get the rover\u0027s arm docked to the lander. Before I added the additional four engines I tried it as-is to see how bad it would fail with only 2. I don\u0027t consider that a test flight since it was known in advance it wasn\u0027t going to be able to land slow enough. If it had been able to kill horizontal velocity and hadn\u0027t flipped upside down after crashing it would\u0027ve worked for an intentionally hard landed stationary probe.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AbeS","CreatedById":80644,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-11T04:24:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022drtedastro\u0022 data-cite=\u0022drtedastro\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHello to all.
