My immediate reaction was to start pulling the source apart to work out how it can be used to to interstage fairings. In particular I am keen for an engine housing that has a baseplate (\u0022under plate\u0022) that engine clusters can be attached to, and the interstage fairings adapt to depending on the siza and shape ofthe engines, but also crutally the fairing/baseplate provide a bottom node to that the lower stage can be attached to the fariing and not the engine cluster that it is concealling.\u003Cp\u003EIf this is what you have in mind then I will sit back and enjoy your work, but if not then I hope you would be supportive of me having a fiddle with your code.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, I\u0027m going to make interstage fairings between two base parts (one flipped), with ejectable side fairings.

Yes you know for some complex situation, it\u0027s rather hard for the program to analyze the correct bounding box of the engine (or engine clusters) in the upper stage, and since it can be adjusted manually by users, that can be a good work-around. Oh, and for manually setting the diameters, if you can provide some preset diameters (like 1.25m, 2.5m, 3.75m and 5m etc) which is widely used in lots of popular MODs by pressing some sort of hotkeys that would be even finer.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"astropapi1","CreatedById":57507,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-16T02:37:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey, I\u0027m having a problem with your mod: The parts won\u0027t even show up on the part list.
