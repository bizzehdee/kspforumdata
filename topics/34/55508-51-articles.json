I found out since I asked about the NRM, I still don\u0027t understand a few things about applying the color map and the bump map... to exactly the same location on the planet.\u003Cp\u003E For some reason I can\u0027t get them to line up.

I tried flipping the image 180deg but that made them so they don\u0027t line up I guess I could draw the colormap with the height map above it and the game running in my second monitor but... what a pain. Is there something I can read somewhere that will explain how to line up the two images on the model?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eor would flipping the height map 180deg, then draw the colormap on it and save it as the colormap... would that work?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust yesterday when I was editing Pimp My Kerbals pack I noticed the diffuse texture (color map) is flipped left-to-right.

You gain nothing by converting to PNG, you only increase loading time. If a PNG has no transparency TR converts it from DXT5 to DXT1 (\u002B generates mipmaps), which takes some time.

The textures work and look awesome but there is obviously the issue with the terrain being default beneath the re-skin. The pack does contain the height maps as well but they are named specifically for the real solar system config ie. Mars_height.png.

Just to be clear I am not using rss, only the textures through texture replacer. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was also wondering if this is done through the real solar system config or is it as simple as finding the duna height map name and putting it in the default folder? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI apologize if this isn\u0027t very clear, I know absolutely zero about textures and how they work within the game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny info on this would be great, cheers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-04T19:15:25Z\u0022 title=\u002210/04/2014 07:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 4, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by AlMacTavish\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shaw","CreatedById":64788,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-05T12:18:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETR can only replace high-altitude planet textures, cannot change terrain shape or textures.
