I\u0027ve got too many probe experiments to get through for now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been toying around with some ideas for atmospheric sensors. I\u0027ve been working on a model for a microwave limb sounder. It measures atmospheric composition and temperature at very high altitudes. It is also part of a series of satellites that orbit just a few minutes apart, allowing their different sensors to scan the same areas at slightly different times. This would be an interesting idea for KSP. I\u0027m not sure how it would be accomplished, but I can imagine having some sort of baseline science level for each different scanner type, then an additional amount if the scanner is part of a constellation and they are in an ideal orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a schematic of the microwave limb sounder. The primary part is the large elliptical microwave mirror, there is another, smaller, sensor on the bottom left. I\u0027ve started working on this, but there\u0027s not much worth showing yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://directory.eoportal.org/documents/163813/398877/Aura_AutoC\u0022 alt=\u0022Aura_AutoC\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese are the various satellites making up the A-train constellation, though not all of them actually made it into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/67/A-train_2009.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022A-train_2009.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother idea that I\u0027ve been thinking about for a long time (and one that would prioritize sample return) is for a solar particle collector like Genesis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt has several collectors for solar particles, mostly passive, but one active (the ring in the center). It might also be interesting to give the part a command module, a little bit of power and a parachute (though maybe it would be a good idea to make the parachute somehow automatically deploy and not have to worry about power), to simplify sample return. I think the whole thing could basically be shaped like a nose cone that unfolds to reveal its collectors, then closes up for re-entry. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/Genesis_in_collection_mode.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Genesis_in_collection_mode.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve also been working on Universal Storage goo pods and materials bays.
