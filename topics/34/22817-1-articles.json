Using Hyperedit (Misc Tools -\u0026gt; Align SMA) I can easily \u0022fix\u0022 the previously launched satellites in an equal orbital length. This means no more slowly adding up of tiny drifts on super-long warp times (e.g. during interplanetary transfers) and suddenly losing contact because all your satellites clumped up their orbits, collapsing your entire relay network.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt.Joseph Kerbertson","CreatedById":57354,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-30T22:42:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022popeter45\u0022 data-cite=\u0022popeter45\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Edoesn\u0027t do anything when i press alt-h\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry ctrl alt h or ctrl h.
