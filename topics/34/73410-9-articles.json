It is \u003Cstrong\u003Enot\u003C/strong\u003E a direct port of the Raptor engine, and that is intentional. The XLS, which is set up by people much smarter than I, was implying that the thrust and ISP were \u003Cstrong\u003Eway\u003C/strong\u003E out of line with the rest of the engines unless the engine mass was substantially increased. Since that\u0027s not really in-line with what the Stockalike configs are (or at least what I want them to be), I chose to keep the thrust as initially designed, increase the ISP to somewhere near those numbers, and decrease the mass slightly. All of this is in the XLS, which is in the repo now. The calcs probably weren\u0027t set up to account for the staged combustion cycle that SpaceX is using, but even so, I just didn\u0027t like where it went with the reported numbers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, I\u0027ve been pondering a large heavy lift methane/LOX engine to fill that role in Stockalike. Most likely this would be a 3.75m engine with those thrust numbers (or at least closer). Probably will do a part-copy alternate config for a NovaPunch or KW engine to do so, or maybe the KX-2 stock one. Most engines in this class don\u0027t even come close to 8000 kN, and the only ones that do are boosters from NovaPunch (which I might nerf a bit).
