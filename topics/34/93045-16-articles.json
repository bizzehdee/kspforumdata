After upgrading RP-0, the octo2 was way too small, so I\u0027ve added a Able/Delta Avionics Package, which still is quite small, but uses 60 EC/min to control 8 tons of mass. What made me suspicious, is that the even larger ones for 12 tons (Agena Avionics \u0026amp; Agena D) again have just a power consumption of 15. But these are way to oversized (dimensions and power) for my satellite. While the smaller ones are far to weak to control a satellite with about 2 tons of mass, like mine. \u003Cp\u003EAlso 60 EC is quite a lot, at least for my taste. It\u0027s much more than any sattelite built by me so far consumes, even though I\u0027ve mounted 20 Commutron D and a dish-antenna on them. I\u0027ve had to unlock some none-RP-0 solar panels, so that six of them are just capable (1.2 times the output of the consumption) to feed the Delta Avionics Packes and the rest of the mounted stuff. If the sattelite has a bad angle to the sun, it\u0027s still not enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe even larger ones for rockets (Guidance Unit (early)) again use only 3, or 60 and 120 EC/min. But for those I dont really care much, since they are used in the ascent stages, which usually aren\u0027t carried around for hours or longer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor me it looks like an imbalance at the moment. But if you tell me, that they are balanced, or that this avionic packages even have some real counterparts with the same specifications, I\u0027m gonna live and play with it. But at least an option to deactivate the avionic units would be nice. The larger one could be used for steering and would be switched of, when the satellite reaches it\u0027s final orbit. While a smaller one keeps on working, doing the signal processing job for little EC/min.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW: We can continue this discussion in the RP-0 thread if you like.

Able is 1955-57 technology, Agena is 1960 technology.

I\u0027ve decided to send up a satellite to fill some contracts and, in the process, start testing parts for my eventual Saturn V launch. My launch vehicle is made up of the main S-IC stage , followed by the S-IVB, and finally an Agena so I can move the satellite around a bit. Yes, it\u0027s a hugely overpowered rocket for what amounts to a 1t satellite but I figured it would be a great way to test out the S-IC stage. Anyway, according to the parts, the S-IVB stage I\u0027m using comes with a built in avionics that supports up to 20,000t and my rocket only weighs in at 2464.125t so should have plenty of avionics. When I\u0027m on the pad, I show \u0022Local Control\u0022 as expected. However, unlike most unmanned launched I\u0027ve done since avionics was introduced, as soon as I actually launch the \u0022Local Control\u0022 line disappears in favor of the signal delay I used to see with unmanned launches. This in itself wouldn\u0027t be a huge issue except that at t\u002B0:35s, it suddenly switches to \u0022No Connection\u0022 and my engines shut down. I\u0027m only just above 3.2km which means the built in antenna on my satellite was what really controlled the ship up to this point. If I put on a seperate avionics package (even just the 1500t capacity \u0022Early Saturn\u0022 unit), then the rocket remains on \u0022Local Control\u0022 throughout the flight.
