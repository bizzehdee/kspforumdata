You shouldn\u0027t really need to be more than 5 degrees from prograde at any time - start your turn early (maybe 1-2km) and keep it gradual. For added stability, put some fins on the end of the rocket - this will allow you to deviate a bit more from prograde without flipping out. Finally, note that the CoL indicator is meaningless in FAR. If you want to know pitch stability, open the static analysis, run it for a particular mach number, and look at the slope of the Cm line - if it\u0027s negative, you\u0027re stable, if it\u0027s positive, you\u0027re unstable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rithaniel","CreatedById":146402,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-20T11:28:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:UICTFontTextStyleBody;\u0022\u003EAlright, so it\u0027s my flight skills.
