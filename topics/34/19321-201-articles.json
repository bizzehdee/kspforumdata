My rule of thumb for surface TWR is 1.2-1.6 at launch and no more than an ending TWR of 3. Anything faster and you\u0027ll cause too much drag loss. Anything less and you\u0027re losing too much to atmospheric drag to be decently efficient. Also make sure you start your gravity turn very early (anywhere from just past the tower with shuttle analogues up to 691 meters if I\u0027m using MJ for ascent). Also make sure your center of lift is well below center of mass to give you a solid amount of stability. Also if you know your upper stage will be inherently unstable (due to wide fairings producing a large amount of drag; use your first stage that has control surfaces to loft the rest of the rocket higher; see below for further information on that) \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis seems consistent with what I\u0027ve read on the topic. I\u0027ve been initiating my gravity turns at 60 m/s, usually with a TWR around 1.2. To that extent I am probably excessively paranoid; I try to never let the TWR exceed 1.6 until 30K (which has caused me to avoid solids), but it is good to know I have a little leeway here. Part of my issue must be over-correction. I am trying to break the habit of flying without SAS (especially since it now causes positive feedback), but I have to admit that my biggest problem is that I have no idea what I\u0027m doing. To have feedback of this kind is great, because for many of us, KSP is that game that makes us yammer incessantly about what we\u0027ve learned from it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Shad0wCatcher\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Shad0wCatcher\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs an example: My typical two-stage to low kerbin orbit puts a payload in position to circularize on its own anywhere from 75-100 kM. I\u0027ll go over TWRs and D/V totals shortly. This should give an idea as to what I look for when I\u0027m building rockets. First stage is around 1800-2500 D/V depending on payload size / mass etc. My typical burn time for the first stage without boosters is anywhere from 2:15 (two minutes 15 seconds) to 2:30. With SRBs mounted the burn time stays the same for the main engine; but the SRBs can vary wildly; I just look to end them with the main stage TWR above 1.2. My OCD dictates that they be a nice number but that is just for orderly purposes and has no bearing on functionality.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy upper stage starts off anywhere from 1.00 to 1.4 TWR; I sometimes run less depending on my flight profile. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this time, most of my rockets are fairly bulbous at the top (since I only have the 0.675 and 1.25 meter procedural fairings at the moment). It has therefore been my habit to utilize a single stage to get me suborbital; that single stage usually has around 3.2 m/s delta-V. The hope is that I can hold on to my control surfaces as long as possible so that I can use a second stage for orbital insertion. My upper stage is admittedly quite weak in these rockets (about 0.9 TWR), but the hope is that the tradeoff is that I will have substantially more time to perform my insertion burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Shad0wCatcher\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Shad0wCatcher\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I run a more vertical ascent I can more easily get away with a sub 1.0 TWR and still get into orbit so long as my apoapsis is high enough to get above 1.0 TWR before reaching it; that\u0027s more based on experience and I\u0027m sure there\u0027s mathematical formula to allow prediction of that; I just fly by the seat of my pants in that regard. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpper stage due to DRE and FAR typically starts off between 20-30 kM depending on ascent profile and takes the craft to my final apoapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I run a three stage engine the first stage can go as low as 1500 D/V; I\u0027m looking to loft the rest of the craft far enough away from the space center that when I decouple the first stage it lands in ocean east of KSP.
