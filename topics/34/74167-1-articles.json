You can pulse the brakes manually, but who really wants to abuse their keyboard that way? The engineers at ShureStop Industries put their heads together and came up with the Anti-Lock Brake System! Attach the computer to your vessel, and while flying, turn on the ABS and it will begin pulsing the brake action group.
