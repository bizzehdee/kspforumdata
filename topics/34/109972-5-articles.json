I\u0027ll post the proposed change log soon after this.\n\nBack in july I was impementing Custom CLS parts in the VAB/SPH. This is an excerpt from that discussion.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Okay, I\u0027ve taken another pass and here is the resultant MM config:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E     @PART[*]:HAS[!MODULE[ModuleConnectedLivingSpace],!MODULE[ModuleEngines*],~category[Engine],~category[FuelTank],~category[Propulsion],~stagingIcon[],~name[K?S_*],#node_stack_top[*],#node_stack_bottom[*],~bulkheadProfiles[size0*],#bulkheadProfiles[size*]]:Final{    MODULE    {        name = ModuleConnectedLivingSpace        passable = false    }}\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I added node stack top to further limit the scope.\n\u003E \n\u003E With this, almost all nose cones are excluded. I\u0027m inclined to err on the side of fewer parts than more, and this seems to provide a good list of candidates for changing passable states.\n\u003E \n\u003E Further, I\u0027ve added an option to enable or disable this feature, leaving it disabled by default so that existing behavior is preserved. If you enable/disable the Passability customization feature, a game restart is required, as the RMB info for each part is loaded when the parts are loaded at startup.\n\u003E \n\u003E Once enabled you can enable passable on certain parts and alter surface passable states on any parts with passable enabled.\n\u003E \n\u003E So, the planned behavior is this:\n\u003E \n\u003E 1. Customization is off by default. This emulates the existing behavior of CLS prior to the new version. \n\u003E \n\u003E 1a. If a part is passable, you can change the passable and surface passable states via a tweakable on the part during assembly of your vessel (new Behavior). \n\u003E \n\u003E 1b. if a part is Non passable by default, no info is show in the Tool selector on RMB\n\u003E \n\u003E 1c. If a part is Non passable by default, the part does not contain any CLS module, unless the part had an existing CLS MM config (existing behavior).\n\u003E \n\u003E 2. If customization is ON, then non passable info is now shown in the Tool Selector on RMB. (new Behavior)\n\u003E \n\u003E 2a. Non passable parts included in the default part MM config filter now contain a CLS module and passable is off by default. (changing the part\u0027s persistence, but no change to part\u0027s original behavior)\n\u003E \n\u003E 2b. Included non passable parts can now be enabled, allowing passabllity through the part. (new Behavior)\n\u003E \n\u003E 2c. parts that have passable ON, can have the surface passable state change vis tweakable (same as 1a, above)\n\u003E \n\u003E Finally, with the addition of another option, it made sense to include a options window and remove the options from the main CLS window, making for a cleaner appearance, I also now save the CLS window position, so it will be remembered between scenes and games.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m disabling CLS passability on them by default, so there is no change to the original behavior of the part. This only introduces the \u0022opportunity\u0022 for the user to enable CLS on a part they choose, and ONLY for the vessel they are constructing. So it is by design a benign change. So, in the end, the only thing we have been discussing with the filter is how big a net to cast on parts that we will allow the user to alter to allow crew movement.\n\u003E \n\u003E If a mod author later includes a config for a part that \u0022was\u0022 captured under this filter, that will override this modification, as this runs after all other MM configs are run, and does not alter any previous modifications.\n\u003E \n\u003E Finally, I\u0027ve been wondering if I need to return any details at all on part that is not passable. If I don\u0027t, then the only indication that a part can be altered would be when they open the tweakables. I\u0027m bouncing back and forth on that, as on one hand I see value in knowing what part can possibly be altered, and on the other hand, wanting to avoid any \u0022confusion\u0022.\n\u003E \n\u003E At the moment, I\u0027m thinking since I only show 1-2 lines max for a disabled (passable= false) part, that the former is preferred over the latter choice.\n\nThese images show how it looks in the editor:\n\nRMB clicked image in VAB for part in selector:\n\n![XrzI1yE.png](http://i.imgur.com/XrzI1yE.png)\n\nTweakable on part in VAB:\n\n![1k9umxt.png](http://i.imgur.com/1k9umxt.png)\n\nThis has been implemented and is pretty much ready.\n\nNow for the items discussed in my absence...\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I asked on add-on development but it might be a better idea to put a request here since cls is brilliant must have mod.\n\u003E It would be super if cls had a feature sort of \u0022next available space\u0022. Like in a large moon base I land a craft with 7crew and I need either to enter the closest hatch and transfer crew or move them to the following hatch and enter there until there\u0027s no more space on the part.\n\u003E \n\u003E Cool if we could get them all in through the same hatch and when that specific part was full they would be transferred automatic to the next available crew space!\n\u003E \n\u003E Great job for picking up on cls!\n\nThis is a feature beyond the scope of CLS, since CLS does not actually perform transfers. However, it is an interesting feature and might be better suited to ShipManifest. Do you use that mod? If so, then you might mention it there as a possible feature.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Added support for the KIS containers wich are accessible from the inside via ModManager. Created a \u0022CLSKIS.cfg\u0022 in ..\\Game\\ConnectedLivingSpace\\Plugins containig the following lines \\*link to pastebin\\*\n\nI will add this to the next release and credit you.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Is there anyway to combine CLS with Ubi Welding mod, in order to Weld/Merge IN-flight parts together using the colour selection CLS got? If it works, it would lower the part count for stations in orbit, and when docking a new module onto the station, CLS select them open gates etc, and the station \u0022model\u0022 is updated. And same goes in reverse, first close gates / CLS deselect, and then its 2 vanilla docked parts and then undock? \n\u003E Just spitting ideas, on the of chance nobody thought about it\n\nInteresting. This is most definitely beyond the scope of CLS. However that is an interesting Idea for a new mod, or for inclusion in ubi weld. You want the configuration to change \u0022in-flight\u0022?. it also sounds like you want it smart, meaning that it \u0022figures out\u0022 the passability based on existing nodes for the space vs the individual parts.... interesting... \n\nFinally,\n\nSeveral posts have been to add configs for various parts. Thanks so mch for those and I\u0027ll be sure to include those as well in the next update.\n\nAs I said, I\u0027ll be posting a proposed change log for the next release soon.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-14T18:12:47Z\u0022 title=\u002211/14/2015 06:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Papa\\_Joe**"},{"CreatedByName":"Fraz86","CreatedById":90101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-14T22:14:20Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E 1.

The central function of CLS is to introduce restrictions on passability - I don\u0027t really understand the purpose of installing the mod if you also want the freedom to negate those restrictions *ad lib*.\n\nBut to each his own - I\u0027m not opposed to Papa\\_Joe adding a \u0022customization mode\u0022 config option for those who want it.

I was always an advocate of the idea that the modder who produced the part in question should be the one to make decisions about what they intended to be passable.

There are things I would like to be different about the base game and loads of other mods, but that does not mean that is what everyone else wants."},{"CreatedByName":"Fraz86","CreatedById":90101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-15T23:12:29Z","Content":"[quote name=\u0027codepoet\u0027]I think this is a debate that has been had right from the first couple of pages of the first CLS WIP thread when it was being developed - balancing \u0022realism\u0022 with playability and providing options for player choice.[/QUOTE]  \n\nIndeed, [URL=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/68617-WIP-Connected-Living-Space-API-for-connected-habs-%28new-download-9-June-14%29?p=962248\u0026viewfull=1#post962248\u0022]I was part of the debate from the beginning[/URL].  \n\nI understand that there will always be differences of opinion regarding the balance between \u0022realism\u0022 and player choice, such as which parts ought to have passableWhenSurfaceAttached or surfaceAttachmentsPassable. Fortunately, anyone who feels strongly about it can simply make their own ModuleManager config.  \n\nHowever, the proposed change in \u00221a\u0022 goes far beyond merely shifting the balance - it enables passableWhenSurfaceAttached and surfaceAttachmentsPassable for ALL parts (through a tweakable). With that change, we really ought to make all nodes passable as well (why would all surface attachments be passable but only some nodes?), and - frankly - we might as well just not have any restrictions on passability at all (as in stock behavior).  \n\nFurthermore, this change effectively removes the ability to create your own rules for surface passability using a custom ModuleManager config, because the tweakable will always be there in the VAB, which means it would not be possible for me to recreate the restrictions I prefer.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-15T23:24:36Z\u0022 title=\u002211/15/2015 11:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fraz86**"},{"CreatedByName":"Papa_Joe","CreatedById":10788,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-16T06:34:14Z","Content":"Wow,  \n\nInteresting debate.  \n\nI certainly understand both sides.

A good debate always results in better understanding and often a better solution in the end.  \n\nTo your first point. I appreciate your goals and desires. However, if you look at the interface of CLS, there is an override switch, that disable CLS completely. Why include this? Because \u0022someone\u0022 will need it for some reason, and because I can.  \n\nI never use it, but I do know it is there. It directly undermines the reason for CLS. In the end, it didn\u0027t hurt to put it there.  \n\nTO the second point and implied concern, The feature will off by default. this means that no parts will be altered by CLS other than by what is already defined in the various configs. When the feature is turned on, parts will be \u0022given the ablility\u0022 to be make passable. The filter is fairly limited, and exclude almost all obviously impassable parts, tho not perfect (nothing is of course as it can be subjective). So, with it off, you get exactly the behaviour you had before the feature was added, and the tooltips will only show for those parts with configs. with the feature turned on, those parts added by the filter will have a passable flag in the VAB/SPH and in the tooltip display with RMB.  \n\nSo you really do get both worlds.

This managed to duplicate the rescue Kerbal so that I now have 2 of him.  \n\n[IMG]http://postimg.org/image/s57w052wz/[/IMG]  \n\n[IMG]http://postimg.org/image/442afb7un/[/IMG]\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-21T17:46:21Z\u0022 title=\u002211/21/2015 05:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by CompB**"},{"CreatedByName":"Papa_Joe","CreatedById":10788,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-22T22:33:57Z","Content":"[quote name=\u0027Kerbas\\_ad\\_astra\u0027]Thanks for the update!  \n\nIt looks like there are still some [B][URL=\u0022https://github.com/codepoetpbowden/ConnectedLivingSpace/pulls\u0022]pull requests[/URL][/B] for mod support that are unanswered.

Let me check my release and my code... there should be a new window that is activated by an options button at the top of the cls window (after you click the stock or blizzy toolbar button)\n\nif it looks wrong, then I have a blown distribution.

Off by default.
