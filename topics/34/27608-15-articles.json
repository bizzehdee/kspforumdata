I have a pure unmodded install on my computer an put the mod in that, it worked. So it\u0027s most likely one of the mods I have installed? The mods I have are Infernal Robotics, B9 Aero-space pack, boat parts, Firspitter parts, Roamfarer Lazor guided weapons and lazor systems, and finally robotic arms.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have discovered that the problems with the CoL arise when I have wings that are not connected. It even happens when you don\u0027t use the symmetry mode. I can place a procedural wing on one side and place any kind of wing on the other side and the CoL will act as though there is no other wing attached. It does show, what I think, is the correct CoL when the second piece is attached though...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DaMichel","CreatedById":93697,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-16T10:27:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGreat work DYJ.
