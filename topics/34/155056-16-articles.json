problem:\u00A0 the model needs to be fully in place before the PartModules can be allowed to initialize, and the model cannot change once the PartModules have run their init code.\u00A0 So as soon as the part is initialized the first time it is impossible to change the model, as it will cause all of the PartModules that reference any model tranforms to crash (as the transforms that it once referenced become null once the model is deleted).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is a giant hacky workaround that I could put in place -- rebuild all of the part-modules to allow for \u0027re-initialization\u0027 where they would re-find their transforms anytime he model is changed.\u00A0 But it is far too hacky for my likes (notably that it will only work if -every- module has been rewritten specifically with that functionality in mind), and would require re-writing each and every part-module.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe swap was in the editor only, and was originally intended as an automatic swap that would only work if the part was attached on the correct side that matched the default state.\u00A0 The other side would then swap to the other tread-direction and/or any other swaps for that sub-model.\u00A0 It was a similar thing to the model swaps in the B9-HX parts or the Firespitter texture/mesh swappers.\u00A0 No plans were made to allow this to happen on-the-fly in the flight scene from what I was able to tell.\u00A0 I\u0027ve yet to launch the game and investigate... but it sounds like you have an automatic switch system in place.\u00A0 Now you just need an override button added to the part that will override the automatic swap for that specific part (if not placed in symmetry mode of course, since parts tend to stay connected when symmetrically placed.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022

familiar with, as I\u0027ve seen no \u0027crawler wheels\u0027 in any release of KF that I ever played with.\u00A0 I\u0027ll take a look through the KF modeling/assets pack to see if I can find anything, but I don\u0027t remember seeing any new wheel types when I last looked through it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStill runs afoul of the problems of how to have such a large steering range on a wheel while still allowing it to be usable for normal purposes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe wheel is part of the medium wheel design if I\u0027m remembering correctly.\u00A0 If you look at that wheel model (I assume we\u0027re still shipping that model with the mod...) you\u0027ll notice it has a steering swivel that could, potentially, turn around full circle.\u00A0 In fact, If I remember correctly and it hasn\u0027t been reworked, that model also has a repulsor plate stuck in the middle of the wheel on the outer edge which was part of the repulsor-wheel transformable part.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat aside... the crawler wheel was one of the \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E first exotic steering systems lo-fi experimented with.\u00A0 \u003Cem\u003EWay\u003C/em\u003E before your involvement with this mod.\u00A0 In fact, the model wasn\u0027t even fully textured back then either and I don\u0027t think we even had a proper working model for the repulsors... or, at least, not the surface-attach repulsors.\u00A0 The vision, from what I was able to gather, was a wheel that would act like the normal medium-wheel for the most part but, upon switching modes, would synchronize the steering angle between all wheels of the same set (the entire craft back then, before wheel grouping) to face the exact same way relative to the front of the craft.\u00A0 That way the craft could move it any direction without turning.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s where the code stopped being worked on from what I understand.\u00A0 The problem with it was that, once switched on, the wheel could never be reset to center again.\u00A0 The relative steering system, which turns the wheels by differing degrees based on their position on the craft, wasn\u0027t turned off either.\u00A0 This meant that you could use the regular turning keys to turn the vehicle while the wheels were centered on a different angle.\u00A0 This was great, for the most part, but also made it difficult to reset all the wheels to normal center.\u00A0 In the end, your craft would never drive straight ever again due to the fact that you couldn\u0027t get them to re-center the crawler portion even when you turned off the crawler steering system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow... re-centering them seemed like trivial stuff... to \u003Cem\u003Eme\u003C/em\u003E anyway.\u00A0 However, I was not a coder back then at all and so couldn\u0027t do it myself.\u00A0 I also didn\u0027t have access to th repo back then.\u00A0 lo-fi was more interested in buffing his steering systems and making new models.\u00A0 He also wanted to incorporate tracks, which started with the RBI inverting track and the crawler track.\u00A0 It wasn\u0027t until I started coding and picking up errors in his code base that I got involved in the project and, by then, crawler steering was history.\u00A0 I still think the centering could be fixed quite easily if that module were to be resurrected.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe fact remains that, while in crawler steering mode, you wouldn\u0027t be using the wheels in any normal fashion.\u00A0 The best idea is to simply turn off other steering modes while the crawler system is active and then return it to the previous mode when finished.\u00A0 Re-centering the forward vector of the wheels should be optional, and possibly have a way of re-centering to a specific angle.\u00A0 This would allow one to make a craft that can drive backward without having to change the angle of control.\u00A0 All that means is that the steering system center itself on that new angle instead of the forward vector of the craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nControl is the next thing I want to mention.\u00A0 Originally he had the crawler steering always active, like I mentioned earlier, where the variable steering would still work even when crawler angle had been altered.\u00A0 The controls for the crawler angle were mapped to the alt-maneuvering controls (I forget which keys... the ones on the other side of the keyboard used for translation maneuvering when in rotational mode for standard \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E systems) but there was a nicer system discussed early on.\u00A0 The idea was to make it very intuitive by making the wheels respond to the relative direction, based on the craft\u0027s forward-vector, of the button pressed on the numpad of your keyboard.\u00A0 If you are facing forward, like you are when launching the craft, and you pressed the 1 key, your wheels would all turn to face back-left and then start moving that direction.\u00A0 Depressing the button would stop the movement but leave the wheels where they are.\u00A0 Pressing a different button, like 5, would cause them to reset but not move the craft anywhere.\u00A0 8 would reset the wheels to forward and move the craft, 7 would angle toward the front right, etc.\u00A0 I always figured you could add a precision mode based on the numlock state which would stop the movement action, but angle the wheels in the direction pressed, varying the speed of the angle change based on how far from the current state the button is.\u00A0 For example, you have numlock on and the wheels are facing forward.\u00A0 You press 7 and they slowly turn towards the left until they reach the preset angle and then stop.\u00A0 Lets say you hit 1 instead of 7, then the wheels would turn rapidly towards the 7 mark, then half speed towards the five mark, and then slowly towards the 1 mark until reaching the preset angle.\u00A0 Hit 2 instead of 1 and the wheels will either default to turning one direction, or they would approach the angle from the nearest side they are currently facing, again varying speed as they get close to the desired angle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s a lot of stuff that could be slowly implemented over time as long as the angle of the wheels could be made into a public variable accessible from the vessel-level.\u00A0 When vessel-modules made their mark on the modding community, I thought that, perhaps, such a system would be at home in such a place as a vessel module so that the wheels weren\u0027t constantly re-hashing the same commands individually.\u00A0 If the angle, and the angle changing methods, were usable from that scope, then one could also create action groups to fine tune things, and even set up wheel groups to crawl separately from the rest of the craft for some truly inspired creations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway... that\u0027s the whole story from \u003Cem\u003Emy\u003C/em\u003E point of view from the beginning onward.\u00A0 Yes, I\u0027m
