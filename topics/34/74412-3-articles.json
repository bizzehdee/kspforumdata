This one has tons of potential for fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, I noticed one inconvenient issue: The most obvious way to build with this part is to have a probe core facing upward. And that works great. But if you control via a probe-core that\u0027s attached radially, and is facing in the direction of the probe\u0027s usual forward, suddenly the forward/backward controls act like they\u0027re reversed. Here\u0027s an example of the radial probe-core placement: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/k7aXqzQ.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/k7aXqzQ.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re wondering why one would want to attach radial probe cores in such a direction, it\u0027s nice because the rover\u0027s navball faces you toward the horizon on flat ground (rather than pointing the navball toward the sky). And this is VERY useful for making it easier to see your heading while on steeply sloped ground (and this part seems especially suited for slopes). If you still don\u0027t get why this is useful, compare the navballs in these two screenshots of a crawler on a slope: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/mGhOX\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/mGhOX\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the first linked image, I\u0027m controlling from the radial probe-core on the front (not the big stacked probe core on top). The navball shows me facing North, but when I hit the forward key (W) it starts moving backwards. When this happens my heading lines up with the retrograde marker, which is pretty counterintuative.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut it\u0027s not a huge issue since one can always stop the crawler, switch to the radial probe core to assess the current heading, and then switch back to the stacked probe-core to resume moving. It just involves lots of starting and stopping.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote: Edited my post to add more screenshots to illustrate the issue better.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-09T01:02:29Z\u0022 title=\u002206/09/2014 01:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 9, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Entropius\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AccidentalDisassembly","CreatedById":110936,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-09T01:04:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NoMrBond\u0022 data-cite=\u0022NoMrBond\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe body looks like it\u0027s from \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/29031-0-23-5-Hollow-Structures-Hulls-(Updated-2014-04-09)\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAlskari\u0027s Hollow Structural Parts\u003C/a\u003E mod?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECool, thank you!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Entropius","CreatedById":104709,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-09T01:42:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s another example of when forwards-and-backwards gets reversed: External command seats\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2rfaPFJ.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/2rfaPFJ.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Robotengineer","CreatedById":104525,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-09T02:13:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022AccidentalDisassembly\u0022 data-cite=\u0022AccidentalDisassembly\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ECan I ask where the bits and pieces above the legs (like what appears to be the somewhat hexagonal vehicle body thing...?) come from?
