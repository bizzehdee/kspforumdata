It feels like being somewhere in the middle between RT \u002B SETIremoteTechConfig \u002B SETIprobeControlEnabler which is very simple and RT with some options which makes it very hard. Personally I prefer the extremes, either simple to fool around, or realism to go all the way. Was true for RT options as well, one of the reasons why I created the addons, to offer a very simple version/option. However I like the added features from commnet (map). Just my personal preference.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nTracking Station / Kerbin side of range restrictions seems to be intended to scale nicely with career, so that comm sats are only necessary for coverage, not for range (at least in stock, not really compatible with NewHorizon/OPM distances...). I do not yet understand the part balancing of the antennas, but I only took a brief look. Since I personally prefer (modded/customized) RT (flight computer, range model, etc., and because I m already very used to RT), I do not plan to touch/rebalance the stock antennas for CommNet/stock anyway. I definately like the fact that command parts now have an inbuilt antenna with useful range, so I m happy that this part of SETIrebalance modifying RT is now also in the stock game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom what I have seen so far, I think that it is a great new feature with sound implementation (especially due to the ingame documentation, ie part range shown for tracking station upgrades), which really enriches stock gameplay.

Since imho the main gameplay difference between UbM and SETIctt is the increased challenge at the career start (control/reaction wheels), I will just make a mini mod which can be added to UbM to alter that part of the progression and increase the gameplay challenge of UbM. While SETIctt adds more nodes, UbM has its science parts further down the tree, so gathering science is more difficult, which kind of cancels out. And when (if) things settle down and are thus more plannable, it can be revisited.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4) The other mods are either fine or depend on other mods to update, to see what changes are necessary.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nedit: So I will take SETIctt out of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Original Post(er).

That means you either need to transmit data with lower science value, or put data in science return capsule that have also penalty in additional weight you need to carry on craft. I don\u0027t find it too much gamebalance breaking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is often hard to implement a lot of customizable features in game that everyone is able to customize for personal usage and have simple job in terms to gamebalance tasks.

For example, I would move Sputnik one or two nodes earlier in tech tree, as you are able to quickly unlock next higher probe (I think it ius HEKS), making Sputnik quickly obsolete.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso I try to do everything this time without any additional ground stations except \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. If you choose to have more ground station, those are covering entire planet, polar caps too. That also removes need to have any kind of comm satellite in Kerbin orbit, you only need some in Mun and Minimus orbit to cover blind spots. Ground stations with only equators covered are something in the middle between having or not having ground stations at Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpeaking of it, might be a good idea, balancing wise, to create some mod that will allow you to use some ground station only if you have bought it tropugh some additional UI, similar to upgrade tracking station at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. So, instead of having all ground stations or only one at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, you might choose to invest money in some specific ground station on Kerbin, one by one, only those you need the most, to cover some necessary blind spots.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyhow, even with flaws, I found that 1.2. is much more balanced compared to 1.1.3 stock game only, without any mods. Those flaws could be more easy to balance trough customizations for personal preference. Parts upgrade system can be enabled/disabled trough advanced settings menu, for exaple. And we still have to wait what other moders will bring, once things become more stable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll in all, some significant progress is made from previous release.
