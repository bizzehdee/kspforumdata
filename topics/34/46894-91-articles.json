I\u0027d been using this mod since it came out, and from 0.25 on it had been working fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurther, mod developers do this with their \u0022free time\u0022 (like myself), and cannot always devote the time that many players might \u0022expect\u0022 of a developer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, the mod community here is awesome. So, many of us will \u0022step in\u0022 to keep mods current while the original author may be \u0022MIA\u0022. In most cases the licensing on most of the mods is in place precisely for that reason, so the the mod can survive beyond the original author.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know that you meant no offense, and I\u0027m guessing that you simply did not consider these points.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI too, look forward to the official release, but I\u0027m thankful for the efforts made by the commuity so far to keep KW relevant in a post 1.0 world. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe complaint might simply be that the dev hasn\u0027t changed the compatibility statement up to 0.90, at least, if not 1.0. Even if balance changes are needed (which they are), the parts working is the bottom-line basis for compatibility, and if they do, there\u0027s no reason not to advertise it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do get the time commitments, though. It\u0027s kind of a shame they haven\u0027t passed the torch if that\u0027s what\u0027s stopping them from giving KW some attention.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sampa","CreatedById":130079,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T17:20:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kickasskyle\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kickasskyle\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI was aware of the change and was going to mess about with it.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk, just wanted to make sure, looking forward to the update!
