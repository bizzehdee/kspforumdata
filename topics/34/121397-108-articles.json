Spending time scanning through the configuration files helped a fair amount. Even then, there\u0027s still a few things that elude me. That said, I can offer what knowledge I\u0027ve been able to glean (as will others when I prove to be completely wrong about something). Just ask.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomething\u0027s currently borked with Resource Distribution -\u00A0I\u0027ll say that much; when I have attempted to use resource distribution recently, inevitably I\u0027ll wind up without sufficient Equipment to inflate something. Not because I didn\u0027t bring enough Equipment, mind you, it\u0027s because it all evaporated into the aether while my back was turned. So, with the last few bases I\u0027ve built, I\u0027ve used the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E resource transfer station and a...oh, i don\u0027t remember what they call the damn thing now - the new excuse for a connector port. While putting up the initial facilities, I hook up the cable and keep it connected long enough to build stuff. If you ever go this route, \u003Cstrong\u003Edon\u0027t leave the damn cable connected\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003E- it\u0027s got its own bugs, and they\u0027re like a thumper to an Arakeen sandworm as far as ability to call down the Kraken is concerned. One of my first priorities with a new base is to build a Chuckwagon and stow whatever leftover Equipment I don\u0027t need right away in it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022qAdQM50.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/qAdQM50.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis base, Enchova Central (on Duna obviously), began as a Blacksmith Pondarosa, a Claim Jumper Hacienda, a Saddle and three Sombreros. These were all packed into 2\u00A0Buckboards and sent with a lander containing about 5000 units of Equipment. If you\u0027re really wanting to do \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E, you can\u0027t really go wrong with that setup; as you can see, it\u0027ll get you pretty far. Now, in order for the Blacksmith to work, you have to have the OSE Workshop mod installed, which does not play nice with the latest version of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E as of this post; stick with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E v. 1.16 if you want to use it. Get an Iron Works going as soon as you can. The other part there is to select your landing site very carefully; do your homework and get some narrow-band scanners overhead before you even land, and look for spots where you can use the Iron Works to make new Equipment on site. Beats the hell out of having to use the Blacksmith/Clockworks for the job, unless you like the notion of spending months on end building up a new base...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomething to consider with any of the efficacy of any module\u00A0is productivity, basically a measure of the competence of the people running it. Kerbals with a lower stupidity attribute will be more productive, as will kerbals with higher levels of experience. In your case, the scientist you selected may have factored heavily into why you didn\u0027t get more bang out of\u00A0your Research Kits. Another thing you should consider is packing a second Doc and configuring that Doc as a Watney; you can manufacture more Research Kits on site that way. Of course, for that you need Ore...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStart button on the Experiment screen is the one you want. Once an experiment is\u00A0running, if it says \u0022Needs Lab Time\u0022, just sit for a bit, maybe do some time warping. If the numbers go up, you\u0027re okay - you just have to wait long enough for the experiment to complete - assuming you\u0027ve got enough Research Kits, of course.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHopefully all this is helpful to you.

Pathfinder has three basic alternatives here - geothermal, nuclear fission and nuclear fusion. Whether or not you can do either of the first two will be dependent on what kind of resources are at the outpost site, so once again, \u003Cstrong\u003Escouting ahead is key\u003C/strong\u003E. You can bring along a SAFER reactor with whatever vehicle brings your base-seeding parts; only catch there is if you intend to make that vehicle part of your base or not. If not, you\u0027ll eventually have to attach the reactor to your base. Even an empty SAFER is 1.5 tonnes, so it\u0027s at least a two-kerbal job. Couldn\u0027t say about the mass full. You can print up SAFERs at a base, but then the trick is fueling them - Enriched Uranium can\u0027t be transferred between modules like other resources and (to my knowledge) Pathfinder has no converters for Nuclear Fuel. That said, you can transfer Enriched Uranium via Mass Driver and when you do that it gets relatively evenly distributed at the target site, so you can get it into your SAFERs by shooting back and forth between two sites. A SAFER doesn\u0027t have to be full to provide a constant stream of steady, reliable power.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll that said, I usually go with Sombreros when I\u0027m prepping a new base. At Kerbin, they have roughly the same efficiency as half a Gigantor (about 12 EC/s). I usually pack 3-6 of them to start; the number you want will depend on where you\u0027re going. Only had three to begin with at Enchova Central and I had power problems right up until I put the first Hot Springs in place. When you get the other stuff built, leave the Sombreros up - every little bit helps. One thing you might do though is orient your initial base running north and south; this way as you set up your Sombreros there\u0027s less of a chance of the shadow of one falling one of\u00A0the others and reducing your power as a result.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce you\u0027ve got power going, you can do whatever you want with your bases. I use mine as\u00A0remote launch sites, and they also support orbital space stations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat resources should you be looking for when you\u0027re scouting for base sites? Depends on your mode of play - in Classic Stock, look for good amounts of Precious Metals and Minerite. In CRP, you want RareMetals and ExoticMinerals, and ideally you want Minerals as well since that lends itself to Konkrete production and the better facilities later on down the road (in that sense, it\u0027s easier to use the mod in Classic Stock than CRP mode, since Minerite is also what you want for Konkrete). Now, my definition of \u0022good amount\u0022 is pretty loose - by it, I mean \u0022any amount other than \u0027zero\u0027 or \u0027unknown\u0027\u0022. Everything else is pretty incidental. Does lead me to one final piece of advice I\u0027ll offer for now since I should be doing my paying job instead of posting here:\u003Cstrong\u003E once you\u0027ve picked your mode, stick with it\u003C/strong\u003E. Changing modes on an established base is a good way to have it go from productive to worthless in an instant. Myself, I use CRP mode because that\u0027s what I\u00A0started with a few versions back. I\u0027ve fiddled with Classic Stock in my diagnostic build, and to be honest I kinda wish I was using it now - fewer questions, easier Slag production, etc...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote to CRP users: noted in the latest version of Pathfinder today that Slag production needs a staffed Geology Lab Pondarosa with positive productivity; this has changed from the staffed Geology Lab Casa from the last version or two of the mod.
