I typically do drogue pre-deploy at about 12km (give or take a few km). You have to have come in at an angle shallow enough to do a lot of aerobraking but not so shallow that you overheat. In your case it sounds like you need to be more shallow than you\u0027ve been coming in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, @stupid_chris, perhaps some more robust presets for DREC use? (or a warning in the preset description that DREC reentries may require alteration of the presets). Maybe also some MM 2.1.5 style :NEEDS to provide alternate configurations if DREC is installed.
