It\u0027s direct modification of the configs rather than a patch. Feel free to use as you please.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically adjusts the weight, and brings the tanks more inline with how much the EL and TAC containers can hold (well kind of, for TAC resourses it\u0027s around half so you\u0027d fit around as much resource, but no waste resource). Well my best guesses anyway\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a bug in TAC where if you add too much resources the Life support monitoring (and maybe the mod itself) breaks, due to number overflow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also noticed that you set basemass to -1, and then the tank mass to the density of the resource. The way I understand it, the mass of the tank, is the additional weight per tank, so it\u0027s a bit weird to see \u002B70 tons for a tank, and then figure out it doesn\u0027t factor in anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"taniwha","CreatedById":57176,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-16T23:02:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI just took a look.
