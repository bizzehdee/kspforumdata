If I have anything in the 2 slot though it keeps selecting and deselecting it which makes very goofy things happen. I\u0027m working around by not using that slot, but was hoping it could be disabled since I never use them for that purpose and it would free that slot up for inventory use without goofiness ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif \u0022:P\u0022)\n\u003E \n\nOkay, I got it.
