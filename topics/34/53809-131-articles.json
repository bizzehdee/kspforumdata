Right now I have maybe 7 mods installed and my performance takes a hit in a big way it becomes unplayable after like 30 minutes. I have troubleshooted alot of things but It just seems like the best time I had playing KSP was back in 23.5 and .24. I know with each update the game gets bigger but damn do I really need to delete the squad and nasa folders to get the game the way I want it. I also use alot of the parts in the squad and nasa folder. IDK I love I have tried almost everything people have told me over the last few months and nothing seems to work. So I am at a loss, thats why I am asking if the new ATM works on mac because thats the last thing I can think of that might be causing the problem.
