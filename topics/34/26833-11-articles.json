I\u0027m attempting to use B9 hull panels to plate the outside of my ship and the create a large hangar to dock another ship inside my ship (yo dawg).

Unless I\u0027m thinking of this incorrectly, the only way to attach things symmetrically is through surface attachment- your mod is entirely built for node attachment.
