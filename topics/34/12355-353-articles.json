Dark blue is optimal with respect to m/s dV, green through red is increasingly inefficient. However, note that sometimes the optimal flight can take twice as long travel time as only a slightly less efficient flight, so think about the trade-offs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClick on the part of the heat map you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want the optimal flight, then rather than trying to click on the darkest bluest bit, you can switch from porkchop selection to \u0022limited time\u0022 mode which will choose the best time to burn such that you arrive within a certain time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBear in mind you will need to brake once you reach your target SOI assuming you don\u0027t want to flyby. This can be very expensive in dV unless you can aerobrake. If you burn 5k m/s to do the faster transfer, in the example above, you will need to burn (or aerobrake), approximately, an additional 3k m/s compared to the optimal burn in order to decelerate and be captured in the SOI, for a total extra cost compared to the optimal transfer of about 6k m/s (3k m/s extra initial burn then 3k m/s extra deceleration needed).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, you may need a small correction burn to fine tune your intercept. I generally leave these burns until I enter the sun\u0027s SOI. They should cost from a few m/s to 50 m/s but rarely more. This will be for things like a small plane change or a radial burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: a cool feature that I didn\u0027;t realise about but read in a post above is that you can zoom in to the porkchop chart with mousewheel to better select.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-16T18:00:03Z\u0022 title=\u002201/16/2015 06:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by CorBlimey\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"albone20","CreatedById":129396,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-16T18:09:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks CorBlimey for the detailed post it is most enlightening.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LameLefty","CreatedById":57336,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-16T18:32:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile we\u0027re explaining new, rather obtuse options in the MechJeb dev builds ... can someone explain two new-ish items in the Ascent Guidance module?

Long Post. I wanted to test MechJeb again after being away from it for about what 11 days give or take. Here is what I did prior to starting the 6 tests you see below: I deleted MechJeb 2.4.2 from the game. Deleted its dev variant. Deleted the zip files as well. I then went and re-down loaded MechJeb 2.4.2 and placed it into the game as per install instructions. I also, will re-list the version of KSP for these tests below this introduction as well as mods that are installed. KSP and the mods as listed are the most up-to-date versions I can locate for KSP 0.90.0.705. I was attempting to see if my prior issues would occur. Those being: Failing to launch at the correct time, Pre-firing the Launch Clamps, Getting Locked into Auto-Warp. I was able to varify only a few of these, and two of the issues happened only ONCE out of 6 times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI want to go on record here, stating, that, there is an issue with MechJeb, as this was a fresh install of MechJeb and some of the bugs once again occurred. Below you will find: 6 Tests, their notes, and the related Output Log for that test. Below the tests and their respective logs, you will find a link to my vessel, a small imgur album OF said vessel. Below THAT, you shall find a copy of the persistent save file these tests were conducted in. Below THAT, you will find a copy of the MechJeb 2.4.2 that was used for these tests. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy request is this: Is my save itself borked or possibly the game? If it is either, a full restart of the save and or game would be sad, but, would be done. If 100% needed, I can ask Steam to provide me with a fresh copy of the game, and I can re-install my mods and go on with my life in KSP. If this is in fact an issue with MechJeb, I hope it can be found and repaired as it is my fear that this will propagate further down the road and perhaps become a big issue at some point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo those who would suggest I learn to fly w/out MechJeb, I state this: Why should I? I can in fact perform all the required actions for a mission, just not as smoothly as MechJeb, but, prefer to use MechJeb. To me, MJ is as vital to my personal enjoyment of the game as what ever mod\u0026lt;s\u0026gt; YOU see as vital components to YOUR space program. If your a fan of FAR and I asked YOU to learn to fly w/out it, you would rightly laugh me right out of the conversation. As such, my use of MechJeb is akin to your use of what ever mod\u0026lt;s\u0026gt; YOU prefer to use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond On Record Statement: I realize that my issues are exceptionally rare, with only one or two other players speaking up and saying they are seeing similar issues. Just because these issues are NOT replicating for you in YOUR save files does NOT mean they are NOT happening in MY save file. I am trying to provide all of you with as a detailed account of my findings tonight as I can, as well as provide all the relevant files to aid in coming to some sort of conclusion and action plan for resolution of this and its similar issues. I am seeing this happen, and it is frustrating as it is making the game unenjoyable and unplayable for me. I do not wish to be forced to wait for .91 to come out and then HOPE that these issues somehow are resolved when Sarbian or r4m0n upgrade MechJeb to 2.4.3 \u0026lt;assuming thats the logical numbers progression for the next update of KSP when ever that is\u0026gt;. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP 32 Bit for Windows. 0.90.0.705 BETA\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMods: MechJeb 2.4.2, Romfarers Lazor Docking Camera, NovaPunch, Procedural Fairings.

Second Test: Target P.O.S.O. Mission test MechJeb 2.4.2. Test Flight 500km polar orbit targeted to station. Launch into Plane of target. Results: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaunch into Plane proved to work...this time. Launched smoothly...for the most part...perhaps I was overzealous with my launch clamps, as it caused it \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eto buck wildly as it cleared. After Launch tower clear, launch went as expected and fairly smoothly. Discovered I need some RCS tanks on the test \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Evehicle, but, after 2 tests, with 1 full mission profile, I think, I will not add them in order to keep things all equal. Should be noted that with each \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eiteration I am shutting the game down completely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETest Two Output Log: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.filedropper.com/outputlog2\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.filedropper.com/outputlog2\u003C/a\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-----------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Third Test: Target: K.I.S.S. Mission test MechJeb 2.4.2. Test Flight: 500km equatorial orbit targeted to station. Launch to Rendezvous. Results as \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewas expected, MechJeb failed to perform a Launch to Rendezvous. I chose my K.I.S.S. which is in an equatorial orbit at 250km. To stay even with tests 1 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand 2, I launched to 500KM or rather, targeted that altitude. Of note: There is an issue with LtR command. In all prior cases before KSP .90 no matter \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe target a LtR command would alter the orbital inclination box to match the targets orbital inclination. Now, it is not doing so. Perhaps the issue, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eor atleast ONE is with the coding of that particular function of the 2.4.2 mechjeb? That i suppose is for the coders to figure out. Suffice it to say, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe next 3 tests will be interesting.

Results as expected, the LtR failed to alter orbital Inclination box. Ship did launch, and as expected got hung up on the launch \u0022tower\u0022 and flew oddly, but, MechJeb recovered and I allowed the \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eflight to go to stage sep and gravity turn, however launched into the prior tests inclination.

There is no denying this. The issue that I can confirm at this time, is this. In \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eprior KSP versions for MechJeb from KSP .21 thru .25 MechJeb would perform any flight operation you asked of it, regardless of what button or \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecombination of buttons pressed there in. It would, if you chose, any of those stations and orbital inclinations from my 3 tests above as targets for \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eorbital inclinations, would adjust the parameters for MechJeb accordingly. If I chose Launch to Rendezvous lets say, using the Polar orbital station, it \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewould adjust the orbital inclination to match the targets inclination and launch accordingly. Now? It does not. I think this is an error in MechJeb to \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Enot do this. Launch to Plane now, oddly seems to function as LtR used to. This begs me ask: If Launch into Plane now functions as LtR did, why still \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehave LtR on the mod as now, a launch to rendezvous requires some tweaks user side to work as desired. This isnt a big issue, but, it is something to \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etake note of never the less. Also, I have as yet to reproduce prior reported issues, but, I will continue to track and record as I go along. My test \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Evehicle is 100% stock with the single exception of MechJeb 2.4.2 being bolted to the side of the capsule. I have an RTG burried in the capsule itself \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efor power. I have now provided with this post, 6 (SIX) varying output logs, each is provided with its particular test. Included below this, is the \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Evehicle as well as the related persistent save file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I ask now is this: what can be done to repair this issue. Sadly, the steps to reproduce the Auto-Warp lock, are unknown to me, as with each test, I \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edid the same exact steps: Chose my launch vehicle inside the VAB, hit M, selected my target for the test, hit M to return to the visual of the vessel on the pad, hit the Launch to Rendezvous/into Plane \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(depending on which iteration of course) and then hit engage autopilot.

I have been told multiple times I am doing something wrong, that the issue does not exist. Well, riddle me this: if what I am doing is wrong, see: using a visible feature of the mod, namely: Launch to Rendezvous, Launch into Plane of target, Engage Auto-Pilot, of course not in any particular order other than how they came to me as I type, how am I doing something wrong? Further question is: IF, the following procedure has worked from KSP .21 thru KSP .25: Put rocket to launch on the pad, hit M, select a target, hit M to return to seeing the pad, then clicking launch to rendezvous THEN Engage Auto Pilot OR reversing those last two steps as either direction of button presses would work w/out fail for 6 versions of KSP/MechJeb how is this suddenly not viable now in .90? Further Further question: IF the button: Launch to Rendezvous is NO LONGER a viable function, why does it yet remain? Would not logic dictate that, if such a function no longer is valid, it would be removed? Its like building a car today with not only an electric starter but a hand cranked-wrist breaking starter. Granted that comparison is a bit over the top, but the point remains the same, why have an invalid function still there, still very visible?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe glitches I am seeing are varied, but, are happening. The glitches are in no particular order: Auto-Warp failing to disengage, Launching into an incorrect inclination regardless of what the ascent guidance states, Launch Clamps pre-firing \u0026lt;this usually goes with the Auto-Warp failing to disenge. I could list more, but, to do that, i would need to make this post far longer, so, instead, I will direct you to another post of mine: same thread as this, page 863 post number 8628 and page 853 post number 8526 for a FULL litany of the issues I am encountering. A word of warning, both of those referenced posts in this paragraph are very very long posts, and contain yet more links to files.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E A fellow player, who will remain nameless messaged me with the following message: \u0022I have the same issue as you do (or did). Mechjeb auto fires even if I do not hit the timed launch option. I also have a problem where my planned orbits move all over the place with larger rockets so it might not be entirely a Mechjeb issue but I do not know for sure. Anyway, did you ever find a fix? Didn\u0027t feel like reading where everyone was bashing you for a legitimate problem just because they don\u0027t have it.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have obviously removed this persons identifiers from this post out of respect for the player. IF said player sees this post and my use of the message they may feel absolutely free to state who they are. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith all this said, I seek anyones help on this. Please, I beg you, I know my posts are long, link infested things. I have been suggested to not use mechjeb, but, that is not going to happen, as it is a key mod to my game, and I am sure you would not fly w/out mods you see as key or vital to your game, so dont suggest the same to me. I am willing to completely delete my game and start from scratch with new mods and the like if the issue is in my copy of the game, or delete the save file and start again with that, but, both are drastic moves, and I hope for a more...easy solution. Also, if it wasnt clear, I am not a programmer, so, asking me to alter code isnt a wise thing, as that can lead to me screwing something else up lol. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am at my very wits end with this, I have been chided, derided and maligned thru the course of this issue.
