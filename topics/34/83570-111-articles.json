The reason is that thrust now falls off with atmospheric density, which it did not in 0.90. Thrust also increases with speed though, so you really just need to go faster to go higher.\u003Cp\u003EI will add that the way I have it set up right now, thrust falls off faster than in stock - in B9 it\u0027s linear with density whereas in stock it doesn\u0027t fall off that fast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETnx so much Blowfish for your answer. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever when I try now, im maxed at mach 1,2 at 5km, TWR is at 0.88.

It takes off like a bat outta hell. But by the time I\u0027m at 8500m it\u0027s just above 0.30. The CF34, being a subsonic engine, it would seem to need decent thrust at mach 0.9 or so, a typical cruising speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFull Throttle:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt 435m, I have a TWR of around 1, and about 178m/s in a modest climb.

I\u0027m flying pretty slowly at 10800m, so it\u0027s a low mach number, and my thrust is piddly. I can fly a lot faster at nearly ground level. In the past, up to abound 10000m, the lessening of drag overcame reduced thrust and I went faster. The opposite is happening here. I suppose it could be some drag problem, but that wouldn\u0027t explain the higher speeds at lower altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t say I have a good feel for the effects of a boost or change in the curve, but it seems like it should decrease maybe half as fast?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-BS\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
