I have a method that isn\u0027t too bad, but then again texturing gets the least of my time. With max what I do for simple models is make a multi-texture that has different elements/shades etc. then in the uvw mapper I just choose the faces flat mapped and break them into segments, then move/scale those segments over the part of the texture that is best suited to it. Some parts are broken down into separately mapped bits, that each use a different specific texture. So for the CIWS... the gun body uses a diffuse map. the barrels use a specular map. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you just need something metallic looking you could use a very simple metal texture @ 512x512 or whatever, then just quickly uvw map it and choose box mapping/spherical mapping etc. For something like a metal gun barrel that\u0027s all it really needs. Then in unity make sure it\u0027s a KSP/specular.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor more advanced parts with writing on the side etc... I export the mapped layout and edit that map directly. As I edit/save the image file, 3dsmax updates it with the changes. I\u0027m by no means a texturing guru, with doing everything myself I do the minimum to make a respectable appearance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the car world it\u0027s the 3ft rule... if it looks decent from 3ft away... it\u0027s good enough.... not looking to make show room parts.
