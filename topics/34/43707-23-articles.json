Which is exactly why I mentioned the continual checking as an important difference between this and having an actual ability to perform a check just once and potentially exit from somewhere that isn\u0027t in a loop. If the check is NOT true and does NOT trigger then the code keeps that continual checking going for the rest of the life of the program even though I didn\u0027t want to set up a continuous check like that, I just wanted to check once. It only stops the continuous checking over and over and over each cycle AFTER it triggers once. BEFORE that it does exactly what I said it does. It executes the check expression repeatedly to find out whether or not to trigger it.

If I change one thing in my code, even the slightest, pitch by 2 or 3 degrees, throttle by .2 or so, it gets way off, or in some cases it goes into Kerbin escape. I do have it changing the pitch (in 5 degree increments, depending on where the PE is) the closer it gets to circularized, similar to how it works when you set a node.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDecided to try a rocket with stages, and haven\u0027t yet figured out how to manage the stages (strap on liquid boosters).

That is with manual staging though and not getting it done fast enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProblem with auto staging is (at least in my current thinking), if the boosters are running at the same time as the main engine, the boosters will run out before the main engine does. I\u0027m thinking though if I set the staging so the boosters are on their own stage, I could grab the maxfuel for the boosters and put it in a variable. Then at launch, maybe have it stage twice to light the main engine, and right after grab the total fuel. Then compare maxfuel - boosterfuel to stagefuel (\u0026lt;= and \u0026gt;= would be handy in this case, but for now using \u0022and\u0022 will work I guess), at which point, if I\u0027m correct, the boosters should be empty, and I could stage.

If I change one thing in my code, even the slightest, pitch by 2 or 3 degrees, throttle by .2 or so, it gets way off, or in some cases it goes into Kerbin escape. I do have it changing the pitch (in 5 degree increments, depending on where the PE is) the closer it gets to circularized, similar to how it works when you set a node.\u003Cp\u003EDecided to try a rocket with stages, and haven\u0027t yet figured out how to manage the stages (strap on liquid boosters). I did manage to get it into orbit though, once AP and PE were pretty far about, but last few tries, AP ended up almost to the Mun. That is with manual staging though and not getting it done fast enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProblem with auto staging is (at least in my current thinking), if the boosters are running at the same time as the main engine, the boosters will run out before the main engine does. I\u0027m thinking though if I set the staging so the boosters are on their own stage, I could grab the maxfuel for the boosters and put it in a variable. Then at launch, maybe have it stage twice to light the main engine, and right after grab the total fuel. Then compare maxfuel - boosterfuel to stagefuel (\u0026lt;= and \u0026gt;= would be handy in this case, but for now using \u0022and\u0022 will work I guess), at which point, if I\u0027m correct, the boosters should be empty, and I could stage.
