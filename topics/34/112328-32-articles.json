I am adding mods into this build as I progress through a career progression (NOT RP-0, just community tech tree).

I plan to test in another throwaway game tonight, but I\u0027m curious if it is possible to move these unlockables to later tech tree nodes. For example, if the Mk1 1.25m single in line cryo part is available at the 160 science level, why would anyone bother with the greenhouses or other TAC reprocessing equipment? My thought is for a realisitic gameplay, these all should only be unlocked together around the 1500 science level. Can I manually change that in the cfg files without messing up the Community Tech Tree or corrupting Module Manager, etc?\n\n2.
