Anyway, Helium 3 is a result of the decay of Tritium, which has a ~12 year half life, it is at least stable though, so you once you have it it won\u0027t go anywhere. Mechanically this will function very much like real life: after 12 years, half of any supply of Tritium you have will have become Helium 3 but the decay process is constant and ongoing, so even after 5 minutes you\u0027ll have some tiny quantity.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pina_coladas","CreatedById":9346,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-15T23:01:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo how much tritium would you have to haul around to refuel a fusion reactor in any reasonable amount of time?

I\u0027ve added a few mods, and was wondering if I\u0027ve got something conflicting, but was going to wait till I unlocked bigger waste heat generators before mentioning it, but since you did...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fractal_UK","CreatedById":61595,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-16T05:22:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt depends exactly what you have done in terms of installation - you should end up with three folders inside GameData, those are HexCans, TreeLoader and WarpPlugin. If you do have those directly inside the GameData folder, you have installed it correctly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, you should be able to see if the WasteHeat is working by right-clicking on a solar panel, that will give you information about the amount of WasteHeat the panel is currently generating. If you don\u0027t see that, chances are there is something wrong with your installation.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pina_coladas","CreatedById":9346,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-16T07:31:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Fractal_UK\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Fractal_UK\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBasically, I think the trick to utilising the decay process is going to be to use Deuterium/Tritium fuel for an initial mission and just carry some He3 tanks on the voyage. By the time the mission is complete and you get whereever you\u0027re going, you\u0027ll have some kind of supply of He3.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh so there will be one fusion reactor that can change fuel modes on the fly? And you need a different type of generator depending on which fuel mode you\u0027re using at any one time, and thermal rockets will stop working when you switch to He3... I really like how you\u0027re fleshing out fusion but I hope for your sake that you make some really detailed patch notes, because there will probably be a lot of confused people in here next week!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr am I misunderstanding and the different fusion reactions have dedicated reactor parts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
