Everything else is from recycling fuel supply and crew ships.\u003Cp\u003EQuick question though. Does the collider code have a sanity check to see if the vessel hitting the recycler is the same one the recycler is attached to? Will I accidentally divide by zero if part of my station (like a manipulator arm) touches the recycler and it tries to eat itself ouroboros style?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, when a recycler eats a ship, is the crew transfered in like resources?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood to hear that the recycler is making life easy \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOroboro is something I had thought of while developing the recycling bins, so yes, there is a sanity check to avoid a vessel eating itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs of v3.7, boarded kerbals get recycled properly..\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Neowulf","CreatedById":75157,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-04T06:47:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u00225thHorseman\u0022 data-cite=\u00225thHorseman\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI asked just this question many pages ago (see, Vlad?) and was literally told \u0022no Ouroboros here.\u0022 by the author.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI skimmed the last 20 pages, but there\u0027s a lot to catch up on.

Poking the recycler from a kilometer out with 30 tons of vessel, LFO, and cargo is pretty unforgiving.
