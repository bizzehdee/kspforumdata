KSP handles that entirely and generally if part of the craft has reentry effects then all of it does. (the only exception I\u0027ve ever seen is if something detached from the ship is occluding it)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt doesn\u0027t matter because whether a part has reentry effects does not control whether it is taking reentry heating. What controls whether a part is protected is whether or not it can trace a line from its center (actually from its transform) along its velocity vector and be able to hit something within 10 meters. (10 meters is actually horribly generous btw). It doesn\u0027t matter if the part that is occluding the first part is part of same ship or not. If it can trace a 10 meter line down its velocity vector and hit something then it is shielded. It doesn\u0027t even matter if the occluding part is itself a heat shield, it still protects other parts from reentry heating. (though if it is itself exposed then it will obviously suffer heating)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are two other ways that parts can be considered shielded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003EYou have FAR / NEAR installed and the part has been determined by FAR or NEAR to be shielded by a fairing or cargo bay.

I can see you have it set to retrograde orientation but it\u0027s having trouble holding that. I\u0027d bet money (if I had any) that the pitch difference is enough that the sides are exposed. If NEAR is \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E fully shielding the enclosed parts then it falls back to raycasting and it\u0027s probably slipping right between the cracks... not much I can do about that except maybe write my own fairing shielding code and using a capsule cast instead of the bounding box.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuggestion: Try that reentry again but with a 45 degree roll angle so that the side of the fairing is definitely between the shockwave and the enclosed parts.
