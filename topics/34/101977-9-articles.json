I\u0027ve been slowly but surely attempting to optimize them, often times the colliders are stretched over the hatch thus not allowing entrance. The old KU cockpit is the two-seat variant (blue tinted canopy glass) and the new on has a gold tinted glass and will only seat one. This is due to the canopy design and the kerbal\u0027s enormous heads, they stick out of the glass when the IVA overlay is activated.. The old KU has a full IVA, the new one has a semi-finished IVA. Both are available on GitHub."},{"CreatedByName":"KERBALZ","CreatedById":168046,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-25T05:35:17Z","Content":"please help me. i am having massive trouble. every time i launch a craft with cockpit view is says \u0022JSIVariableAnimator INITALiZATION ERROR CHECK CONFIGURATION\u0022\n\ndose anybody know a fix? is their a fix?
