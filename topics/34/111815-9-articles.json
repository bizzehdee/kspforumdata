Also a screenshot of your GameData folder if at all possible (to make sure you dont have any install issues. Also im assuming your running the latest version of both mods and on 1.04 KSP right? Also is it a career game or sandbox?\n\nEDIT: saw your post in the KSPI forum and saw you were installing via CKAN, Tested the download on CKAN, appears to be the right version its downloading.\n\nSecond Edit: Tested on a clean install installing via CKAN, both KSPI and CivPop, and everything appears just fine.
