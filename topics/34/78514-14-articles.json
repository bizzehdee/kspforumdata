The black hole is in the background, so it is in interstellar space and theoretically there should be no lighting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso I have one more bug that I forgot to mention. The black hole doesn\u0027t seem to have a truly infinite SOI. When you get about 20,000 Tm from it, the skybox disappears, the camera breaks, and the velocity drops to 0.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso there is a visual thing that kinda irked me but it\u0027s not actually a bug. When you transition from a star\u0027s SOI to the black hole\u0027s SOI, the starlight very suddenly cuts off. It\u0027s not very realistic. I think that if the game lets you adjust a star\u0027s light output, you could pretty easily fix this by writing a script that makes the lighting level dependent on how far the camera\u0027s focus is from the star.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-28T20:09:23Z\u0022 title=\u002207/28/2014 08:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 28, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by FluffySilverUnicorn\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"coolmodi","CreatedById":25218,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-28T23:32:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t know if it\u0027s a problem with this mod, but after time warping from kerbin to the moon in a new game, my ship was suddenly on a kerbol orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso while making manoeuvres it shows the leaving Kerbin SOI thingy far before the mun, so i think the Kerbin SOI is for some reason WAY to small.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: The ingame map says the SOI is 2347km :/\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther SOIs also seem to be to small:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEve 2373\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuna 1336\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJool 68490\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-28T23:39:26Z\u0022 title=\u002207/28/2014 11:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 28, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by coolmodi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Teto","CreatedById":117072,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-29T00:26:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI possibly found a bug the planets are orbiting insanely fast while my spacecraft is orbiting at normal speed I don\u0027t know if I installed the mod wrong please help if you can\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Poryy","CreatedById":81075,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-29T03:18:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EShameless Bump\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OvenProofMars","CreatedById":114237,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-29T07:28:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022coolmodi\u0022 data-cite=\u0022coolmodi\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDon\u0027t know if it\u0027s a problem with this mod, but after time warping from kerbin to the moon in a new game, my ship was suddenly on a kerbol orbit.\u003Cp\u003EAlso while making manoeuvres it shows the leaving Kerbin SOI thingy far before the mun, so i think the Kerbin SOI is for some reason WAY to small.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: The ingame map says the SOI is 2347km :/\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther SOIs also seem to be to small:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEve 2373\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuna 1336\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJool 68490\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis might be an unintentional side effect of my latest fix.

As for mod compatibility, I don\u0027t know boulderco, kethane seemed to work on 0.23.5 for me and PF:CE corrupts stuff on 0.24 x64 which has been mentioned numerous times.
