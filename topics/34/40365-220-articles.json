I see A LOT of people launching massive nuclear power systems into space and setting them up around Kerbin. After figuring out how the microwave networks actually works I realized all I need to do is put a bunch of 3.75m reactors on the ground and face their transmitters to the sky and just put a relay directly above them. In under and our I went from 0MW to 12GW by simply putting a bunch of non-upgraded 3.75m reactors just outside the 2.3km range of the KSC Launchpad/runway and made them face the sky. I went from launching rockets to super crazy powered everything in an hour\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 Sort of killed the idea of progression and now I just feel crazy powerful. Honestly, microwave networks needs to be looked at because becoming super powerful so fast just kills any sense of progression. Make the atmosphere have a more negative effect on transmission power, make relays generate heat in the background if they are transferring a ton of energy without lots of radiators, make the power decay over large distances. In my opinion, it should be more rewarding to actually get a ship with an onboard reactor into space than just building a quick and dirty microwave network like I did above. Alternatively, maybe consider making microwave transmission its own special node later in the tech tree. As it stands now I can simply build a ship, point it at a relay and I have all the power I could ever dream of.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EISRU Refinery vs Resupply Ship\u003C/strong\u003E \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Currently the ISRU Refinery seems vastly weak compared to simply launching resupply ships at regular intervals. This might come from the fact I can send all the UF4 or ThF4 (ThF4 via tweakable in VAB) to my ships and actually sending a lander to the ground and returning with a refinery is more effort. Aluminum just doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t feel as useful as simply building ships with more fuel tanks or assembling ships via docking in LKO is always a better option, I couldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t ever find a time where it would actually be better to use Aluminum Hybrid Rockets for anything. Deinonychus 1D Liquid Methane/Oxygen Engine is very awesome on ground but because it only has a 368 ISP in space I was always using 390ISP LV-909 or 800ISP LV-N engines for any long distance trips. The LV engines usually give me plenty of mileage which made the idea of collecting fuel for the methane engine not worth it. As far as liquid fuel goes it is useful for it, but Kethane kind of defeats the point of it since I can find Kethane on almost all celestial bodies whereas LqdWater is only on a few locations. Side note, maybe it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s a bug but the Methane engine seems to sort of drift to the side like the gimbal is locked when using multiple engines in a circle around a ship. Maybe if science labs couldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t process nuclear fuel I would actually use the refinery, but as it stands now it just seems to be junk and I can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t find a good use for it compared to resupply ships or mining Kethane.

Keep up the great work!\u003Cp\u003EOne other question though. It seems pretty clear that Beamed Microwave is the direction I need to be going at the moment. Any tips for assembling a reliable satellite relay network? I actually did check the Wiki and there was very little information about how the phased array transceivers function. Are they directional? Do i need to use the Relay feature or have one receiving and one transmitting?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEasiest method to make a reliable relay network is to put 3 equally spaced relays in an orbit 120 degrees apart from each other and at least 700 km high. Technically you can go as low as 600 km (equal to Kerbin\u0027s equatorial radius), but going higher gives you some margin for error. In this configuration, any craft in an equatorial orbit can see at least one relay, and most of the time two. Each relay can also see every other relay, so this means a receiving craft can connect to every transmitting craft in equatorial orbit around Kerbin via the relay network. If you want perfect coverage for polar orbits you\u0027ll need to do something fancier, e.g. Molniya orbits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/DFkPjVr.png\u0022 alt=\u0022DFkPjVr.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for how the transceivers function: Transmitters and Relays are not directional. Since they are on separate craft, it is abstracted away and assumed that they rotate to provide optimal coverage. Receivers are directional, and must be pointed toward the transmitter or relay to get the best efficiency. As your angle increases, your efficiency drops, eventually going to zero at a 90 degree angle or above. I recommend putting several receivers on your craft and rolling just before any burns in order to find the angle that provides the most power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERelay satellites only need one transceiver, set to relay mode.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-17T03:43:00Z\u0022 title=\u002201/17/2014 03:43  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 17, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by RadHazard\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deredere","CreatedById":96253,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-17T05:10:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Jyro117\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Jyro117\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis mod is pretty awesome.

The only difference is you\u0027re upgrading from 200 tons of fuel to 5 tons. You say \u0022it kills progression\u0022 but first - if you\u0027re getting launch thrusts, you\u0027re just about at the end of the tech tree, so you don\u0027t have much further to progress. Second, after launching the 25 moon/minmus missions and/or spending the better part of a day navigating the whole solar system you need to max out the vanilla tech tree, you should be just about over putting together huge asparagus monstrosities. Third, late game goals like returning from the surface of Eve and getting to Eeloo are still challenging with microwaves going around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFourth, microwave power is very ill-suited for some applications.
