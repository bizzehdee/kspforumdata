This probably has to be the best solar system mod out there... absolutely no joke. This is Ay-mazing. One thing I was really happy about is that it still works with my other planet mods like OPM and Trans-Kuptunian. A lot of solar system mods make it so those planets orbit somewhere else... but this works like a dream. Anyway, I go an inspect the planets and boy-o, they\u0027re absolutely great! You did a terrific job modeling them, as well as texturing them. I did notice a few problems (like Crons\u0027s seam line) but other than that, they\u0027re great. The fact that you went into such depth to create realistic water (or lava) flow or chipping due to tidal forces is absolutely stunning.\n\nHere\u0027s a picture of the system and the difference between (my modded) Kerbol System and Cercani\u0027s.\n\n![fDMhw9O.png](http://i.imgur.com/fDMhw9O.png)\n\n![LarrEA6.png](http://i.imgur.com/LarrEA6.png)\n\nI especially love the Vassa, half ocean and half not. I think a small moon around Vassa would due justice. It would fit into the lore (after all, an asteroid/comet did crash into it). Would be nice to see some sort of weirdly shaped moon for it Maybe like a large chunk of rock. I think the only thing that I have a *problem* with would probably be Pequar\u0027s rings. They\u0027re way too bright and too wide. Maybe they\u0027re suppose to be like that, but it looks too... well, in-you-face. Especially for such a small planet. The planet wouldn\u0027t be able to hold such a well formulated ring system; especially with a mass of only 9.83E12m^2. Maybe the rings can be a bit spread out from each other... like Jupiter\u0027s. \n\nIf I could make a suggestion for a planet or two for the Cercani System (besides a moon for Vassa): I would really like to see a planet super close to the sun. Half of it super smooth and burned off; almost magma. Landing there would be super hard, especially with the new heat involved. \n\nFor your other systems (n2 and n3), I think a Hot Jupiter would be absolutely amazing to see. And if you feel ballsy, have a moon of that Hot Jupiter in a geosynchronized orbit so it\u0027s always hiding behind the planet, thus not getting burned to the touch from the sun. I\u0027d also love to see an entire planet covered in water, except the water is about a foot deep... kind of like the scene in Interstellar with *mountains.*\n\nAs someone who hates interstellar mods, this is gonna be fun for me to travel there using nothing but Stock!
