Nothing fancy, just a PartModule that receives a volume change message from procedural parts and than calculates costs based on volume and approximated surface area. It might be suitable for ProceduralParts too, depending on how you have planned to handle the cost generation. Heres my github \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/ItMustBeACamel/ProcAirships\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Erep\u003C/a\u003E if you want to take a look.
