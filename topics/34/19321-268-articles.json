impossible to make super-high-G-pulling planes? Because I\u0027m just starting to remake some of my past planes, and they can\u0027t survive the forces, and yes, aero-failures is disabled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah somethings changed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I am not sure what is happenning with your craft but I am still able to make aircraft that can pulled 10-15Gs subsonic and around 7-9Gs supersonic, with aero-failures ON.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-16T18:02:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022tetryds\u0022 data-cite=\u0022tetryds\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIIRC when you set them as spoilers they will deflect outwards, you just need to place them out of the plane of simmetry.\u003Cp\u003EPlease correct me if I am wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell technically they\u0027d be horizontal surfaces set up for yaw only rather than FAR\u0027s idea of spoilers - but horizontal surfaces don\u0027t deflect when set up for yaw like you\u0027d set up a vertical surface. You can\u0027t independently control spoilers as far as I can see, so you\u0027d have to have a flap on one wing and a spoiler on the other, which would be horrendous to actually use \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
