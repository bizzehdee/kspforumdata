I will see if I can fix it, though this bug won\u0027t give any real trouble.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou mentioned some sort of manual mode that both engine activation and shutdown require manual control. The design is a good one and similar ideas have been raised earlier (also in this thread).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile this might work well if you always control the rocket manually (it will still bring some trouble if you cannot shutdown the engine at accurate time), I\u0027m quite worried about that if used with autopilot system like MechJeb or RemoteTech\u0027s flight computer, the engine which has a non-zero minimum thrust won\u0027t be shutdown by the autopilot system and that will cause more trouble than benefit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne suggestion to you if you really worry about accidentally shutting down the engine, you can make use of the \u0022ThrustLimiter\u0022 feature introduced in 0.23. Say if you put your throttle at 10%, which i think is safe enough, you then adjust the ThrustLimiter to around 20%, you will now actually have 2% of thrust. And i think that can provide enough accuracy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S: Talking about engines that have non-zero minimum thrust, the \u0022Real Fuels\u0022 mod currently owned by NathanKell has lots of engines with non-zero min thrust. That gave lots of trouble for these autopilot systems so he implemented a feature that will reduce the engine\u0027s min thrust to 0 temporarily (not by shutting down though) when the throttle is totally 0. So yes it still turns the engine into NOT_IGNITED state when the throttle is accidentally set to 0, but perhaps there would be no perfect solution unless all these autopilot systems are designed to really shutdown the engines after the execution of a burn.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"gleedadswell","CreatedById":96615,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-19T03:22:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m thoroughly enjoying this mod, coupled with various other \u0022realism\u0022 enhancements.

Yes, I\u0027m using the Realism Overhaul. But looking back at it I think I see the problem. I had neglected to delete the .cfg from the root EngineIgnitor folder.

I deleted all of the .cfg files from the root EngineIgnitor folder (e.g. IgnitorAIES.cfg, IgnitorKW.cfg, etc.). But that made it just like I didn\u0027t have EngineIgnitor installed at all as far as I could tell - no ignition resources displayed in the right click menu for engines, no ignition needs listed in red when I hover over the engine in the VAB, no ignition info listed in the engine information in the VAB, seem to be able to ignite and shutdown until the cows come home. So I\u0027m not sure why the Realism Overhaul instructions say to delete those files. Am I misunderstanding the instruction? Was I supposed to delete a different set of files? Anyway, I restored those .cfg files to their originals. This once again resulted in the Wildcat-V (sorry, I said Maverick-V before but it isn\u0027t the problem) not being able to ignite (fuel flow lists as Very Stable, but even straight off the launch pad it won\u0027t ignite). So I redid my edit to IgnitorKW.cfg to switch the Wildcat-V\u0027s ignition resource over to hypergolic fluid and now it ignites.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-28T20:30:06Z\u0022 title=\u002201/28/2014 08:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 28, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by gleedadswell\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-28T19:51:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt depends on which set of engine configs you\u0027re using for RF.
