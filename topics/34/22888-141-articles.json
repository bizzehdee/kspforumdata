Gemini had the following engines. 16 RCS on the nose of the Gemini Capsule fueled by tanks contained behind the engines themselves. These provided 3 axis movement and used after separation of the equipment section. The retrograde section had 6 RCS thrusters fueled by the tanks in the equipment section. 2 were retro engines for -Z movement, the other 4 were for translation x and y. The retrograde section also contained 4 solid motors to provide the necessary velocity change to return to Earth. The Equipment section had 10 engines. 2 were facing backwards for \u002BZ translation. The other 8 were for X, Y, Z rotation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrizzank has done a good job replicating all these functions in his realistic parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt.
