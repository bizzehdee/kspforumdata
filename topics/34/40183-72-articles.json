You gave us the code ModuleParachute massCostMult = .25 for us to insert ourselves if we wanted (check your post #1385 back in April). It appears you later incorporated that in version .68, at least it\u0027s there in the ZIP file in my Downloads folder and I don\u0027t usually make changes to those files. I skipped version .69, but when I installed .70 I noticed the parachute prices jumped again to over 1000 each. Version .70 has parachute modules at costMult = .10, which doesn\u0027t seem to do anything (I tried changing that value... and nothing changed in game). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI remember the discussion about the Crater mission, and I though it was fixed too.
