Open that file with a text editor, and look around line 40 for \u0027refreshTextRate\u0027 and \u0027refreshDataRate\u0027.  Make the numbers next to those lines smaller: The text rate is 10, which means text on the MFD may only update every 10 frames (6x per second with common refresh rates).  The data rate is 20, which means 3x per second.  If you\u0027re running on a mid-range PC, you might set those both at 3 and see how that affects things.  You\u0027re welcome to change those numbers all the way to 1, which would potentially allow \u0022real time\u0022 updates.
