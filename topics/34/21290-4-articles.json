I installed the plugins in the VA pack as well as the VA parts into the parts folder. As far as I can tell, it\u0027s not my fault.\u003Cp\u003EAlso, on the top boosters, they engage like they should, but when they are spent, the sound and particle system doesn\u0027t stop for two of the boosters. When the nose separates, it doesn\u0027t start flipping or anything as if there were thrust, it just separates like it should. I pretty much did a LES testing rocket, and found this problem. I don\u0027t have the particle effects in the VAB for some of the other engines, so like I said, the plugins are installed correctly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m having precisely the same problems.
