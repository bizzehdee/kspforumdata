It\u0027s way more complexity than is modeled in game, so it is simpler just to think of a fuzzy lump of charge-storage device, and call it a \u0022battery\u0022, and the batteries in the game are, as I said, fairly close to real, and you were initially asking for higher capacity in lower masses, which is OP and not based on current scientific research.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, if I clustered 6 of the 40kVA units I would have 240kVA, but if I only had one set of control gear, I\u0027d have a 40kVA unit with an hour of autonomy.

What you\u0027re looking for in-game would probably acutally also require very high power throughput and therefore the cell to control system ratio would probably still be about the same. Even so, the volume ratio is about 60% batteries : 40% control, the mass ratio is about 75% batteries to 25% control, so even looking at just the cells, the volumes in game are on the small side, and the masses aren\u0027t a million miles off.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-23T16:28:16Z\u0022 title=\u002210/23/2013 04:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 23, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Crater\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"anaximander","CreatedById":22563,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-23T16:32:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe bug where the right-click menus are empty is back again.

A mere 1kg of excited Hafnium could provide 369MW for an hour. This is much less energy dense than actual nuclear fuel but its also substantially easier to handle, fission reactors produce a lot of neutrons that are hard to shield against, while an \u0022isomer battery\u0022 would only produce gamma radiation meaning shielding requirements would be much reduced and making the whole thing lighter.\u003Cp\u003EThis would be more like a reactor with a very short-lived fuel supply but it would be really neat for landers/aircraft that could regularly dock with a mothership/base because it might grant you ulta-high performance for short periods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESounds similar in concept to Star Trek\u0027s EPS conduits/grid.

Something that acts as a buffer for MJ. It would charge from any excess MJ production, possibly with some inefficiency/loss while charging, then discharge when the total MJ production doesn\u0027t meet the total possible demand. Slapping some of these on a probe with a small nuke reactor and a plasma thruster for example would give an option between long slow burns (using only the MJ production of the reactor) and short high thrust burns (tying in the capacitors and dumping their stored charge into the thruster).\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlywheels.
