English-speaking people at least seem to think once you hit a thousand, you should come up with new words for powers of a 1000 from that point, not powers of ten. (The word \u0022myriad\u0022 once meant specifically \u0022ten thousand\u0022, but that usage is archaic, in modern English it just means \u0022a large number\u0022.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs it stands, the SI prefixes exactly correspond to English words in common usage (\u0022deca-\u0022 means ten, \u0022hecto-\u0022 means hundred, \u0022kilo-\u0022 means thousand, \u0022mega-\u0022 means million, \u0022giga-\u0022 means billion, etc.) -- ten and hundred thousand prefixes would break that symmetry, extending to powers of ten rarely used enough that English-speakers don\u0027t even have individual words for them (archaic usage aside) and resort to compound names for the numbers. The SI system simply follows the established convention for what people over the years have determined to be the most comfortable level of cutting up large numbers into words.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you did insert new prefixes in there, you\u0027d end up with odd quantity changes translating back and forth into natural languages, e.g. \u002223 kilometers\u0022 = \u002223 thousand meters\u0022, a natural translation preserving the quantity, but if you had \u0022myriameters\u0022, then \u002224 myriameters\u0022 = \u0022240 thousand meters\u0022 -- notice here that the quantity has to change when expressing it in natural language.

It would be awkward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s probably not by coincidence that the standard convention for writing these numbers in decimal is to start adding commas (or periods in some countries) between the digits when the numbers hit 10,000 (you can also do it between 1000 and 9999, but it\u0027s optional there). That\u0027s the point when we start breaking digits into groups of three. And it\u0027s precisely at that point that we stop naming the powers of ten that aren\u0027t powers of a thousand. The SI prefix standard falls precisely into this same pattern.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-22T07:06:26Z\u0022 title=\u002210/22/2013 07:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 22, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Gaius\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SorensonPA","CreatedById":59038,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-22T06:44:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Fractal_UK\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Fractal_UK\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ERadiator upgrades are in experimental electronics, so they should be easier / cheaper to get than the upgraded reactors.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EErr, sorry.

Notice there\u0027s a word for \u0022ten\u0022, a word for \u0022hundred\u0022, a word for \u0022thousand\u0022, and a word for \u0022million\u0022, but no word for \u0022ten thousand\u0022 -- you have to say ten of the smaller quantity, and no word for \u0022hundred thousand\u0022, again, have to use two words, a hundred of the smaller word. English-speaking people at least seem to think once you hit a thousand, you should come up with new words for powers of a 1000 from that point, not powers of ten. (The word \u0022myriad\u0022 once meant specifically \u0022ten thousand\u0022, but that usage is archaic, in modern English it just means \u0022a large number\u0022.) As it stands, the SI prefixes exactly correspond to English words in common usage (\u0022deca-\u0022 means ten, \u0022hecto-\u0022 means hundred, \u0022kilo-\u0022 means thousand, \u0022mega-\u0022 means million, \u0022giga-\u0022 means billion, etc.) -- ten and hundred thousand prefixes would break that symmetry, extending to powers of ten rarely used enough that English-speakers don\u0027t even have individual words for them (archaic usage aside) and resort to compound names for the numbers.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re somewhat correct. English...doesn\u0027t exist. It\u0027s a language in the same sense that mutts are a dog breed or mulattos are a race, or mules are a species. Better to think of it as a poly-dialect or whatever term might more accurately be made up for it. But anyway...yes, numerical ideas like 10,000 and 100,000 are very common today. They weren\u0027t common in the past, and strangely that\u0027s why they had their own names...they were special enough. Some things are special enough, some things are common enough, and everything in between is just out of luck. That\u0027s how everything works. Everyday things get named because they\u0027re always in mind...and special things get named because whenever they do happen to be around, they\u0027re automatically in mind. Anything between those gets ignored as either beneath notice or otherwise unimportant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI happen to think that perhaps that point has shifted enough to warrant a couple of new prefixes. How often is the number spoken on a daily basis by non-nerd gamers, let alone all those who are nerds in general? But in the big picture, it doesn\u0027t actually matter, since the problem was with a graph that was listed in km with a scientific notation far out of the focus of the graph. Which turned out to be a problem with the graphing program rather than the person making the graph.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t actually care if it happens or not. I just think it wouldn\u0027t be a waste, and could be useful. But, I think we\u0027ve wasted enough time on it anyway.
