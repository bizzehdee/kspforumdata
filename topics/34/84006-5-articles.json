First and foremost, can this update? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are my thoughts (didnt read everything from thread). There should be 2 types of GN Particles, the ones generated by the Original Drives and ones by thr Tau Drives, Genuine GN Particles (Blue) and Tau GN Particles (Red) respectively. There should also be a required part for there to be a twin drive system. There should be 2 GN drives types specifically for the Twin Drive System, the Drive 1 and Drive 2 (0 and Exia line Drives respectively).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe real /1/ GN drives should always be first on the tree line (story wise to Gundam 00), /2/ then the GN Condensers with GN Particle-fed propulsion systems, /3/ then the Tau Drive with its Generator and also with Improved Condensers (with GN Particle-fed thrusters) and a Tau Condenser type with same function, /4/ and Improved GN Drives (ability to activate Trans-Am) for both types at the same time as the Twin Drive System (also Trans-Am Burst) also for both types.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 The first GN Drives should be both Generators and ones that can propel, easy peasy but are not efficient enough to keep half thrust without losing Particle Storage. In lower values of thrust it can still charge while it is on. That was how the Gundams before the 4 main Gundams from S1 were using their GN Drives.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 The First Condensers are supposed to act as batteries because the GN Drives at that time were not as efficient yet, and that is why the 4 Gundams from S1 each had one in their Torso. And since the condensers at that time were not as good later, Celestial Being put GN Particle-fed thrusters over the Gundams (easily seen in Dynames and Virtue) and especially large ones on the Ptolomaios/Ptolemy 1 and 2 (the large GN Propulsion System at their Rear Ends).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3 For the Tau Drive it should ONLY be a GN Thruster with only 80% more efficiency as the GN Thrusters but must use its own particles. So hence the need for the Generator which is dedicated for the creation of Tau GN Particles. Also, it should be WAY cheaper than a Real Drive and should have a Tau Condenser that acts as both a storage unit and a propulsion system. Real GN Particle Condensers should also have the same function as the Tau type but can only store and use real particles like how the Tau type can only story and use Tau Particles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4 By this time in the story (G00 S2) The GN Drives have become far more efficient than the Original ones and Tau ones (in the Anime they may be the same but for it to be easier to mod in there should be improved GN Drives and an extra function, Trans-Am). Both types are always the same when it comes to Thrust and Efficiency in using GN Particles, so both should use Particles 5% slower with a power output 80% higher. Tau drives\u002Bgenerators are cheaper but the real ones are SO COSTLY. The Twin Drive System should have 2 different drives and a part that makes using them to be available. Also, at this point in thr series EVERYTHING had Trans-Am so it would be best it could activate, glow red, and emmit particles 3x faster but accelerated consumption in Particles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the player should specifically tune the computer part for the Twin drive system according to the weight of the craft or else it wont work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETHIS IS ALL ACCURATE INFO FROM THE SERIES.
