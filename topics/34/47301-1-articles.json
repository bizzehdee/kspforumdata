Have a ship run out of fuel in orbit of the sun and need to refuel it? If so then you might have encountered the spontaneous rotation problem. In high orbits, floating point inaccuracy causes craft to experience spontaneous rotational acceleration (even after stopping everything by turning on and off time acceleration).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENormally this is not a huge problem, since small rotations can be easily corrected by the use of SAS. However, when you are docking it can end up making docking impossible because the target craft will be rotating no matter what you do, and there is no way to tell it to hold attitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnter RotationFreeze: a plugin which adds a simple toggle button which locks the rotation of nearby craft.

So for instance, if your target is in an equatorial orbit and pointed at the ground, as it orbits it will no longer be pointed there. This is how you would expect things to work with an object in space that is not experiencing any rotational acceleration. As long as you dock at a speed faster than ridiculously slow you shouldn\u0027t have much problem with this sort of rotation, unless your orbital period is very \u003Cem\u003Esmall\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem that is solved is instead a \u0027bug\u0027 in the game which causes objects to experience phantom rotational \u003Cem\u003Eacceleration\u003C/em\u003E, something which would not happen to a real object unless it was acted on by some force.
