Side Note: yes I can fix this issue by moving the wings back, but the normal flight characteristics suffer to significantly. I have done tests with canards and varying aspect ratio wings. the equation however still seems to be factoring the fuselage for aspect ratio so it still stays near 1.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tsuki","CreatedById":65519,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-29T15:00:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022tech_op2000\u0022 data-cite=\u0022tech_op2000\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFrom this point on it actually starts flying backwards, and does so quite well unfortunately.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA bit noncontributing post, but still: I can still very well remember how one of my first SSTOs could only fly backwards at reentry, and at that time I decided not to fix the problem, but to improve the flight characteristics in backward, resulting in perfect landings on the KSC landing strip... in reverse.
