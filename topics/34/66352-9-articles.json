Does anyone know what I am doing wrong?\u003Cp\u003EMany thanks\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: If I press escape, I can see all of the x,y,z co-ords and they all respond perfectly to the movement of the rift, but it is not translated into any IVA motion. I have enabled and disabled with Scroll lock to no avail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am dying to use the Rift IVA in KSP. Any help would be most appreciated\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake sure that you aren\u0027t using any other mods which affect IVA camera position such as KerbQuake. Check the game log for any exceptions, or make it available here via pastebin, dropbox or similar so that I can check it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RealTimeShepherd","CreatedById":22133,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-08T19:23:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMany thanks!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve shot a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/KcwqhEDLi1U\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Equick video\u003C/a\u003E of the head tracking working in the external view and not in the IVA view.
