Would you be willing to extend the formula for the rate at which unhappiness accumulates to allow for more complex behaviour? At the moment, your formula appears to be something along the lines of:\n\n**(monthly unhappiness) = NoOfKerbals / (Hab-months \\* BaseHabTime)**\n\nWhat I would like is if the rate was instead:\n\n**(monthly unhappiness) = (NoOfKerbals \u002B Offset) / (Hab-months \\* BaseHabTime) - Offset**\n\n...with Offset defined in the config file. If Offset = 0, unhappiness is accrued at the same rate it is now. But if someone set Offset to greater than 0, then it is possible to create a sufficiently large space station in which Kerbals could live indefinitely or even lose unhappiness without returning to Kerbin, with the threshold being ((1/Offset) \u002B 1) Hab-months per Kerbal. An offset of 0.02 (i.e. 1/50) requires 51 Hab-months per Kerbal, an offset of 0.05 (i.e. 1/20) requires 21 Hab-months per Kerbal, and so on."}]}
