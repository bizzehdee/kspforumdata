With Defcon Corp. Orbital Tech, you can slowly regenerate your depleted fuel! And not only does our innovative new regeneration technology produce fuel, but you can also resupply your craft with oxidizer, monopropellant, xenon, and now\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 Hyperium\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u017E\u00C2\u00A2! Hyperium\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u017E\u00C2\u00A2 is the Defcon Corporation\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s latest, and possibly most powerful discovery in the propulsion fuels research field! And because of it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s immense power, we have also provided you with a titan of an engine- the Genesis Reactor Engine!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe GRE\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u017E\u00C2\u00A2(Genesis Reactor Engine) provides upto four times the power of a regular large engine (with a maximum thrust of 5000)! A single engine allows you to lift monstrous payloads to heights that you never imagined possible with one engine! And, when used in conjunction with the Defcon Corp. HYG-3000 Hyperium Generator, you can travel through space at unimaginable speeds!
