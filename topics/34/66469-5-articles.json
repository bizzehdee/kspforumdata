ZIP at the OP...The AerojetKerbodyne project basically mimics the 200\u0022 (5m) Delta Cryogenic Second Stage. Best use will be using the larger tank for LH2 and the small tank for LOX. Since AerojetKerbodyne mod is made to work with SDHI, and the Taurus HCV, I\u0027ve updated both to approximate their use based on the Orion Spacecraft set to debut with the SLS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIMPORTANT!!!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E PLEASE DELETE THE SDHI.cfg found in the RealismOverhaul folder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs always, things will be improved, so any comments/suggestions/facts, please help me out.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Woopert","CreatedById":84274,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-18T18:09:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks, and sorry, can\u0027t give rep again.

To build the Orion SLS upper stages...Start with the Taurus pod, put one of the two docking ports on top. The IACBM is scaled to the real CBM size BTW, we should figure out a scale for the other docking port. Place the SDHI Boost Cover on top, followed by the LES from the AerojetKerbodyne pack. Now place the heat shield from the Aerojet Kerbodyne pack as it\u0027s built to match the Taurus (now Orion) pod. Now, place the SDHI Service Module, the whole thing, not just the avionics ring, which is scaled to match the Squad Mk1-2 pod as is the SDHI heat shield. Now place the AJ-10-190 based Orion engine, with the R4D-11 thrusters in a 8x ring around it. Outfit the service module with RCS pods and solar panels. Fit the AK (AerojetKerbodyne) decoupler, followed by the AK service module fairing. Now the The big LH2 tank, the adapter, the smaller LOX tank, and finally the RL-10 engine. Use either the 200\u0022 or 300\u0022 interstage to match the rest of your launcher. Hope this helps.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Woopert","CreatedById":84274,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-24T01:07:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks, I wasn\u0027t sure where the heatshield was.
