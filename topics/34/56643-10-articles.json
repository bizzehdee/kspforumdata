Integration with related systems is good, but requiring your users to install something else that they may not want is bad. When I use Ship Manifest to move crew around I assume that either the vessel was constructed with a way for crew to move between the crew spaces (crawl tube, etc.) or that Ship Manifest handled the crew\u0027s EVA between spaces so that I didn\u0027t have to.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the clarification.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you see in the thread, we are all in agreement on that point, so I think it is safe to say it will be addressed.

Therefore, you need to be sure the parts you use will allow crew to \u0022pass\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECLS achieves this by adding a passable flag to the part. It does this when it \u0022Knows\u0022 the part is passable (crewCapacity\u0026gt;0), or via the MM configs (many of which are included with CLS)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, it is not omniscient.

Like being able to transfer resources between vessels without a fuel line, or being able to fill or empty crew without using the current game mechanic of EVA\u0027ing the entire crew one at a time.
