It is reproducible consistently.\u003Cp\u003EScenario:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI use MJ\u0027s Rendezvous Planner to plan Hohmann transfer. I then execute it at the maneuver node. After that burn, I use MJ\u0027s Rendezvous Auto-pilot (RAP) to place me at 50 meters from target vessel (MSL). When rendezvousing with the first MSL and MJ\u0027s RAP, my active vessel (three modules) stopped at 200 meters from the MSL and would not approach closer. I tried this multiple times, same results. I then tried using MJ\u0027s Docking Auto-pilot (DAP) with Navyfish\u0027s DPAI, and DPAI would not lock-on to the target docking port I selected; indicators were bouncing all over the place. MJ\u0027s DAP would not lock-on to the docking port either. Even using MJ\u0027s SMART A.S.S. TGT (-Par) wouldn\u0027t successfully target it. As I watched, the MSL actually exploded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI then launched another MSL and attempted to rendezvous and dock with RAP and DAP. Results were similar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was not the fault of the active vessel, which had the three modules I wanted to install to the MEL. I tried rendezvousing and docking to a different target vessel with RAP and DAP. Worked flawlessly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is either something in the MSL or the Platform part that is broken.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esidebar: Don\u0027t really need the Science from these experiments, as my career tech tree is complete.
