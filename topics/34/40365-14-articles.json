Amount of generated points would follow your rule used for Science Labs, but there could be ways to increase it. For example placing probe near the anomaly would give huge boost - but i\u0027m not sure it can be coded at all \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E Another way would be adding more scientific equipment - yes, those cool but useless pieces from scientific tab in VAB. Each instrument installed on the probe would give bonus to SP generation, but they should not be stackable - ten thermometers or gravioli detectors shouldn\u0027t give any more SP than one. Of course your magnetometer should count too. Barometers should work only in atmosphere - it would cut their usefulness to Eve and Laythe only, but maybe it could be off-set by giving them larger bonus to SP generation. Oh, and probes shouldn\u0027t work at Kerbin and in LKO - it wouldn\u0027t be realistic to seed the planet with small rovers and get river of SP flowing from the get go \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kodemunkey","CreatedById":41146,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-30T13:34:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat crew size does the science lab need?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xentoe","CreatedById":80083,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-30T13:39:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E2, more fits not in\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DaveStrider","CreatedById":78109,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-30T13:39:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow do you read the magnetometers? i can\u0027t make any sense of them\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fractal_UK","CreatedById":61595,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-30T14:52:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DaveStrider\u0022 data-cite=\u0022DaveStrider\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHow do you read the magnetometers? i can\u0027t make any sense of them\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E|B| is the magnitude of the magnetic field strength, this represents its total strength regardless of direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB_r is the radial dependant component of the magnetic field, this varies with altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB_T is the azimuthal component of magnetic field, which varies with your azimuth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of these are measured in tesla.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EParticle flux is how much antimatter you will get out of an antimatter collector at that altitude.
