I know that\u0027s quite a lot of new functionality, especially the homing part, but that\u0027s what the model inspires for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: A much more realistic option would be making it exactly like a pulley\u002Battachment node from KAS, so it can be shot in the general direction, captured by a kerbal and attached into the docking port.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-11T14:37:58Z\u0022 title=\u002209/11/2015 02:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by qm3ster\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"qm3ster","CreatedById":150338,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-06T13:11:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECpt.
