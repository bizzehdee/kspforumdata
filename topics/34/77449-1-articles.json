Instead, reliability information becomes more inaccurate as reliability drains.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Through the Monitor GUI, parts with failed modules can be set to highlight red.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Through the Monitor GUI, a color map of the ship\u0027s status can be placed on the ship. Green for high reliability, yellow for aging, and red for very low.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFailures can be fixed by going on EVA, getting some spare Rocket Parts, right-clicking the part, and attempting the fix.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost failure types have two repair options, one which costs Rocket Parts and is more reliable, and another, more silly option that is free, but may make the problem worse.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBe warned, though. Most proper repairs require an experienced Kerbal Engineer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCHANGELOG:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nv0.6.4.1:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Fixed icon duplication bug.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nv0.6.4:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- KSP 1.0 \u0022Kompatibility\u0022 update ;3\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nv0.6.3:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Fixed App window bug on resolutions other than 1080p.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nv0.6.2:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Fixed KSP App Launcher bug when switching to the main menu and back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Fixed bug with App window not showing when an alert is showing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nv0.6.1:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Fixed part highlighting compatibility issue with Ship Manifest (and any other mod that highlights parts).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nv0.6:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Added settings option to stop time warp when a failure occurs.

(Compatible with 0.24.2)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Added Funds support. Terrible quality parts (all modules 0%) cost 50% of the part\u0027s default cost. Default quality parts (all modules 75%) cost 100% of the default.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Added thrust gauge failures. Excessively high g forces will cause the thrust gauge to display incorrect data. If multiple parts with gauge capabilities are present, all must fail to cause true failure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Added Reliability Monitor to all command parts. Has both quality and reliability, but no true failure. Low reliability results in inaccurate reliability data across the ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Added a control panel to the Reliability Monitor that allows highlighting of parts with failed modules. Also allows the player to map the status of the ship\u0027s parts on the ship. (Green is good, red is bad.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Added option for quality changes in the editor to also affect parts in symetry with original part.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nv0.3.1:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Updated mod to KSP version 0.24.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Fixed instant and automatic altimeter failures on all but one pod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- IMPORTANT NOTE: Due to a fault in how part costs work, this version DOES NOT support funds. An urgent email to Squad support has already been sent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nv0.3:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Modified reliability drain algorithm to use a curve, such that increases in quality past a certain point gives less and less decrease in reliability drain. The same about quality decrease is also true.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Reliability drain now goes by Kerbin days instead of tiny percentages per 10 seconds, but the drains are still calculated every 10 seconds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Most modules now drain a small initial amount while idle, and an increased amount if the part is considered in operation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Added preventative maintenance. This allows the player to increase the reliability of old parts before failure occurs or after repairs at a cheap Rocket Parts cost.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Added fuel tank leaks. Leaks become more likely the longer a craft remains. Once a leak is started, the amount leaked is initially large and leaks less as time goes on, simulating pressure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Added engine alternator failures. The alternator may fail as its reliability drains, or at a vastly increased likelyhood under excessively high g forces.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Added altimeter failures. Excessively high g forces will cause the altimeter to display incorrect data. If multiple parts with altimeter capabilities are present, all must fail to cause true failure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nv0.2.3:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Fixed bug that allowed use of lights while broken via the Lights button at the top of the flight screen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Reduced reliability drain of lights.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nv0.2.2:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Fixed bug that prevented proper loading of quality and reliability data.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Fixed bugs in ModuleReliabilityIgnitor and ModuleReliabilityCooling that prevented proper fixing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nv0.2:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- The entire system has been rewritten, such that failure modules no longer inherit the module they cause to fail.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Parts can have multiple failure capabilities.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- The mod no longer replaces stock parts, but instead injects its modules once the game starts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- The engine\u0027s failure module has been split into three: Gimbal, Ignition, and Cooling\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- The information on all failure modules on a given part can be viewed by right clicking the part and selecting \u0022Reliability Stats\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- The quality of a part can be modified in the editor through the same window.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- A part with a broken module will now glow red until fixed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nv0.1:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- INITIAL RELEASE\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-08-28T13:11:03Z\u0022 title=\u002208/28/2022 01:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 28, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by James Kerman\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Elink removed\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CalculusWarrior","CreatedById":58313,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-13T17:52:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmm, a competitor to DangIt!, interesting.

This is something I wish to fix, but I have been too busy going back and forth between 3 total projects and a job. When I first designed the decoupler\u0027s failure, I intended it to be non-permanent and deal-with-able (if you know what I mean), such that it can eventually be detached, assuming you have the time. Someone recently requested that some things be more permanent, but more rare to balance. I did add this to a few things, like the engine cooling having a chance to explode if kicked, and the gimbal potentially permanently locking if kicked. So I ask for your opinion: how would you feel the decoupler should best fail and be repaired?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe engine: You say the engine ignition fails frequently? Interesting. In all my tests working with the g-force-based modules, never once has an ignition failure happened. Were you staging and then throttling, or throttling and then staging? I guess good ol\u0027 Jeb likes selling you some crappy engines... Actually, that\u0027s an interesting idea... Having companies that sell crap parts, and having to reprimand them for their parts\u0027 failures...
