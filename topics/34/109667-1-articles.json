[Jebretary](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/72212-Jebretary-Automatic-Version-Control-%28backups%29-for-craft-and-saves-v0-4-0) is probably a better choice for most people, but if you know your way around Git and just want a simple plugin that does commits, then maybe KerbalGit can be of use.\n\n[https://github.com/kria/KerbalGit](https://github.com/kria/KerbalGit)\n\n**The plugin is very basic and doesn\u0027t have a UI. Don\u0027t install KerbalGit unless you are comfortable using Git!**\n\nWhen first run, the plugin will set up a Git repository for the *saves/* directory. The *.git/* directory itself is placed in *GameData/KerbalGit/*. The plugin is invoked and commits changes on three events:\n\n- autosave\n- quicksave (F5)\n- save in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E\n\n![kerbalgit-commits.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kria/KerbalGit/master/kerbalgit-commits.png)\n\n**OS support**\n\nI have only tried KerbalGit on Windows. The plugin uses LibGit2Sharp 0.17 which relies on the the native library libgit2. A Windows binary (git2-06d772d.dll) is included, but separate [builds](https://libgit2.github.com/docs/guides/build-and-link/) are needed for Linux and OSX.\n\n**Installation**\n\n1. Get the latest [release](https://github.com/kria/KerbalGit/releases).\n2. Copy *GameData/KerbalGit/* to your KSP directory.\n3. Copy *git2-06d772d.dll* (on Windows) to the root of your KSP directory. Pick the correct one from *NativeBinaries/* depending on if you run KSP in 32-bit or 64-bit mode.\n\n**Configuration**\n\nYou can exclude any files and directories that you don\u0027t want to have under version control in *saves/.gitignore*. In *GameData/KerbalGit/settings.cfg*, you can set the minimum interval (in seconds) between commits and the committer\u0027s name and email.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-07-03T14:09:53Z\u0022 title=\u002207/03/2016 02:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 3, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by kria**"},{"CreatedByName":"kria","CreatedById":136219,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-03T14:08:04Z","Content":"KerbalGit 0.3.0 released with support for KSP 1.1 and Unity 5.
