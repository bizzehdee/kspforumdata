Except for the X-15 (which is a suborbital rocket plane), other launchers have not launched sufficiently often for reasonable safety comparisons to be made.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout five percent of people who have been launched have died doing so. As of November 2004,[dated info] 439 individuals have flown on spaceflights: Russia/Soviet Union (96), USA (277), others (66).[citation needed] Twenty-two have died while in a spacecraft: three on Apollo 1, one on Soyuz 1, one on X-15-3, three on Soyuz 11, seven on Challenger, and seven on Columbia. By space program, 18 NASA astronauts (4.1%) and four Soviet cosmonauts (0.9% of all the people launched) died while in a spacecraft.[citation needed]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESoyuz accidents have claimed the lives of four cosmonauts. No deaths have occurred on Soyuz missions since 1971, and none with the current design of the Soyuz. Including the early Soyuz design, the average deaths per launched crew member on Soyuz are currently under two percent. However, there have also been several serious injuries, and some other incidents in which crews nearly died.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-12T00:44:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESoyuz is great. Even if something does break, it usually results in an injury, not death. Considering how hostile space is, that\u0027s quite an achievement. American spacecraft, on the other hand, had to be built to too tight tolerances to ensure that sort of reliability. Soyuz can reenter with out detaching it\u0027s PAO, while Shuttle burned up from a missing heat tile. Soyuz is cheap, but Apollo CSM was too expensive to keep running like that... Soyuz is awesome, because it\u0027s so overengineered that there\u0027s little that could really threaten the crew. Sure, early versions had problems, though only on 11 it was an actual technical problem. On Soyuz 1, the problem was downright criminal negligence in order to meet an arbitrary Party-issued deadline, something very common in Soviet Union at the time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"roscosmos","CreatedById":64719,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-12T02:42:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Acemcbean\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Acemcbean\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESilly Russians..
