Integration with Kethane is not something that ever occurred to me. Mostly because it\u0027s a mod I\u0027ve never gotten around to trying. For those who do use it though I can see combining the two as an appealing idea. I do think bases should have a way to harvest water or ice to process into oxygen, but I saw adding resource mining as beyond the scope of the crew support mod. So thank you for the suggestion; it\u0027ll be something that I look into after I finish the next version.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELotzofgibberish, I\u0027m not entirely sure what you\u0027re asking for. I\u0027d assume ejecting carbon dioxide means a way to remove it permanently from the vessel, in which case the built in CO2 scrubbers do that. I know it\u0027s not realistic because they should really just trap the CO2 and thus the mass shouldn\u0027t be lost but that would require a new resource to track and so instead they simply delete the CO2. So changing the mechanism to eject CO2 would really just be cosmetic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you do just want to change the button so it says \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CEject CO2\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 though that\u0027s not too hard to do; it just requires some variable name replacing in the source code and recompiling. On the other hand, if you want to also change the behaviour of the button so it very quickly removes all the CO2 on the vessel and then turns off automatically that is a little more complicated and will require some small modifications to the functionality of the code. I\u0027d be happy to give you step by step instructions on what to do in either case.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lyndonguitar","CreatedById":61194,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-18T04:36:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan you add a food and water supply?

A couple problems unfortunately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy 16 crew members seem to randomly die after long time warp periods and NaN displaying for O2/CO2 rates. I\u0027m guessing the main pods O2 tank gets drained before everything else, need to test that more, but my charge levels where topped off. I\u0027m running four recyclers, three of which are modified, but two of those are just copy/pastes into 3rd party tank cfgs. Also, the recyclers can\u0027t generate enough O2 to keep up for a journey to Duna. Do they require CO2 to make O2? Also, can I have a part recycle and support crew?

The two belonging to the mothership will remain off till the pods disembark. Unfortunately the time warp issue remains.
