I started modifying my powershell script utilizing mbm2png but came across some issues with what you said. i couldn\u0027t figure out how to know if a file was successful or not during conversion using nvdtx.exe\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaalidas","CreatedById":111158,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-14T18:36:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s actually pretty simple. I use a \u0022FOR\u0022 loop to go through all the files that I want to modify, then use a \u0022CALL\u0022 command on the nVidia command-line tool for converting image types, then I use an \u0022IF\u0022 command to see if the resulting filename with the new extension exists before deleting the unneeded file. Here\u0027s what I have, though the code I\u0027m going to post is not ready to be used outside of my home system as of yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EConvertoToDDS.bat\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E@ECHO off\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E:: Initialization of environment states and variables.\u003Cbr\u003ESETLOCAL ENABLEDELAYEDEXPANSION\u003Cbr\u003ESET localdir=%CD%\u003Cbr\u003ESET DDSTool=\u0022C:\\Program Files (x86)\\NVIDIA Corporation\\DDS Utilities\\nvdxt.exe\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EFOR /R \u0022%localdir%\u0022 %%F IN (\u0022*.png\u0022) DO (\u003Cbr\u003E    CALL %DDSTool% -dxt5 -outsamedir -quality_normal -nomipmap -flip -file \u0022%%F\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E    IF EXIST \u0022%%~dpnF.dds\u0022 ( del \u0022%%F\u0022 )\u003Cbr\u003E)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI put that batch file in a folder on my computer under \u0022documents\u0022 that I call \u0022MyTools\u0022 and reference this from a shortcut. I can put that shortcut into any sub-folder I want to start from (for instance, the \u0022B9_Aerospace\u0022 folder) so that I do not convert everything in one go (I\u0027m not done testing the effect on GUI elements or TextureReplacer elements at this time) and I simply change the \u0022Start in:\u0022 field to match the folder that the shortcut resides in. Otherwise it will look in the \u0022MyTools\u0022 folder for the images to convert, and successfully find nothing to do and quit without error. \u003Cem\u003EEDIT: Alternatively you could just copy the batch file to whatever folder you want to start recursively checking and it would work just fine out of the box. Also note, the new file will be placed in the same place as the input file and the batch file will recursively select any file in any sub-directory from the starting folder.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see from the code, I first set it to not bore me with echoing commands. I set a local variable that probably isn\u0027t needed here but helps if I ever need to expand a variable at a delay from the start of the script. Next I have the path to the tool I want to use, in quotes so that it does not choke on the spaces in the path.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also define the local \u0022start in\u0022 folder to a variable just so that it isn\u0027t determining the local path every time I want to reference the default \u0022%CD%\u0022 environment variable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I have the loop which places each PNG file in each loop into the variable defined as \u0022%%F\u0022 which I can then reference with a variety of interpretations using the \u0022~\u0022 operator where \u0022~dF\u0022 gets the drive letter, \u0022~pF\u0022 gets the path (minus the drive letter), and \u0022~nF\u0022 gets the file name (minus the extension). Since I use \u0022CALL\u0022 the batch will wait until the nVidia tool is finished before executing the next command. It then checks to see if the new file, at \u0022%%~dpnF.dds\u0022 exists (the file drive, path, and name minus extension, with the new extension at the end) and if it does, it deletes the PNG file. Else, it leaves it alone. Note, the nVidia tool continues to output all sorts of crud to the screen despite the echo being turned off, but that can be fixed later if you care.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that\u0027s it. It\u0027s not even the most complicated batch file I\u0027ve written. You should see the one that I use to detect and convert any image downloaded in a mod to the format that I prefer to use. \u003Cem\u003EThat\u003C/em\u003E baby is massive, and makes heavy use of subroutines and the \u0022EXIT /B\u0022 command, and even uses several different batch files to process the entire thing. I even implemented a basic progress meter and counter in the title bar. I\u0027m quite pleased with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Note, I realise I\u0027m using \u0022-nomipmap\u0022 in my conversion command. It runs faster, and for testing I decided mips were not required.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-14T18:40:44Z\u0022 title=\u002210/14/2014 06:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 14, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Gaalidas\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Justin Kerbice","CreatedById":101695,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-14T19:26:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Gaalidas\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Gaalidas\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EConvertoToDDS.bat\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EFOR /R \u0022%localdir%\u0022 %%F IN (\u0022*.png\u0022) DO (\u003Cbr\u003E    CALL %DDSTool% [B][U]-dxt5[/U][/B] -outsamedir -quality_normal -nomipmap -flip -file \u0022%%F\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E    IF EXIST \u0022%%~dpnF.dds\u0022 ( del \u0022%%F\u0022 )\u003Cbr\u003E)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edxt5 could makes tex bigger if they don\u0027t have alpha channel at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn such case, better to sue dxt1c format.
