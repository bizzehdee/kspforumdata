The 0.25.0 is in the file version; from what I understand, AssemblyVersion is used to determine if interfaces between DLLs are valid.  Changing that value will break mods that provide RPM interfaces (SCANsat, DPAI, etc), which forces those mod authors to update their code (and puts more work on them if they have to do that every time I update).  If I can find an way to automate AssemblyFile numbers, I\u0027ll do so.\n\nAnd the README - oh, yeah, I was including a text file, and I switched to the markdown file instead.  I don\u0027t remember why I did that.  I\u0027ll merge the two into a single file so I\u0027m less likely to make that mistake again.\n\nThank you for the feedback - it is extremely helpful to know what I\u0027m doing right and what needs improved."},{"CreatedByName":"Fwiffo","CreatedById":148084,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-07T06:33:10Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 4/5/2016 at 8:03 AM, MOARdV said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The auto-increment system versioning system would be handy, but, from what my experience, it only works with AssemblyVersion, not AssemblyFileVersion.\n\u003E \n\nIf you\u0027re interested in this, I made a tiny EXE a long time ago called BuildIncrement which might just do the trick.
