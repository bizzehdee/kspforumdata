Further, test the face tracking within FTNIR. My experience with FTNIR was less than perfect as compared with my FreeTrack setup, however, this is expected given webcam resolutions and the cpu required with facetracking. Expect it to be less than perfectly precise, and use the smoothing features to help reduce jittering. Finally, re-read the OP carefully after ensuring that FTNIR is indeed functioning correctly. Report any updates you might have.

With KSP, this means you should have a quad-core computer to run face tracking. You can improve this by reducing the resolution and frame rate your camera is running at. If you can\u0027t do that, FreeTrack uses less CPU power as it only has to track LEDs, so that setup would be more appropriate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Helix935\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Helix935\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ei have already tested the face tracking and it does work (although it would sometimes confuse my eye brows for my eyes) and although i should mention that sometimes when i test it in KSP, it would actually move but only rarely(like only twice since i started using this) and only front an back in one-movement jerks so i will continue testing this as i also test out my own mod\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake sure you are in a well-lit room and that the camera is centred on you at an appropriate distance.

Without FaceTrackNoIR running, this plugin shouldn\u0027t do anything to affect game speed. What other mods are you running? As above, FaceTrackNoIR is very CPU-heavy. FreeTrack with LEDs or a TrackIR 4 would be a better solution for you in this case.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
