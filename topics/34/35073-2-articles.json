Although the mode can be used to successfully balance the thrust with a wide variety of vessels you do need some background information for its correct operation and you should read this section in full. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe center thrust window can be opened by right clicking on the part and selecting and selecting \u0022TC systems\u0022 and then clicking the \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CCenter thrust mode\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 button.

See paragraph 3 on how to designate an engine to center thrust mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOff/On: Toggles the center thrust mode on and off. When turned on all or a number of engines, depending on whether the mode is set to Designated or All, will be set to center thrust mode.

If your engines are facing in another direction then backward in relation to the command module the ship is currently controlled from, you should first try to select another command module or docking port. If this is not possible you can use the this window to select the direction the engines are facing in relation to the command module. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis mode makes incremental adjustments to individual engines to over time move the Center of Thrust onto the Center of Mass. In the current version these adjustments are done fast enough to give a near instant corrections when necessary \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe center thrust mode assumes all active engines are facing the same direction. This might cause issues in certain VTOL designs which have separate engines for vertical and forward movement. For these specific situations the engines facing other directions should be set to \u0022ignore\u0022; this will cause these engines to be ignored in Center of Thrust calculations. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor VTOL designs Diazo\u0027s \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/50736-Vertical-Velocity-Control-in-1m-s-increments-with-compensation-for-vessel-angle\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAutomated Vertical Velocity and Altitude Control\u003C/a\u003E can be use alongside this mod.

This is something which the center thrust functionality alone could not do because it does not compensate for drag and drag forces on unsymmetrical vessels are often to strong to compensate by conventional controls. When using the throttle steering in in combination with SAS, monitor KSP\u0027s control indicators in the lower left of the screen. When any of the these indicators nearing their maximum it is an indication the current torque setting is too low to compensate for drag forces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E#4 Throttles\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/yW53mQb.png\u0022 alt=\u0022yW53mQb.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe module can supply four additional throttles.

No manual steering or SAS would be able to prevent this. The center thrust mod will however downregulate some of the outer engines, in this particular example, in such a way that the combined thrust of all the engines lies directly behind the CoM, which will allow the vessel to take of straight. After decoupling one of the outer engine mid flight the center thrust mod will rebalance the remaining outer engines and central skipper to again produce a centered thrust. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Absolute Human\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Absolute Human\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnd the last, it is not entirely related to your mod, but there just aren\u0027t any working thrust correctors for 0.23 since \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/37251-0-20-2-Project-Arcturus-Thrust-Corrector-Remission-and-Range-Safety\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EArcturus\u003C/a\u003E stopped working. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;.;\u0022\u003E And no, don\u0027t point me at \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/52882-0-22-Kerbal-Isp-Difficulty-Scaler-v1-2\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKIDS\u003C/a\u003E.

That said, it potentially covered your center thrust AND throttle steering option. If you can steer, so why not to simply steer up? The problem of Ruffus\u0027s mod was in its weird behaviour in certain situations. For example, you were going up slightly swaying from side to side, and then, after one bigger swing ALL your thrusters started to bate thrust and you quickly found your rocket falling rotating to the ground with almost no thrust. At least I remember it happening. Another thing was when you had thrust set to zero and then started to turn with \u0022throttle steering\u0022 on: engines on one side began to burn... or maybe that happened only when you had RCS on. So, \u0022It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s like RCS.\u0022 as his spaceport page says. I mean, it didn\u0027t really maintain the summary thrust equal to throttle, that was the problem. If it also has a limiter for the correction value, about 10%-50% but 100%, It would a very-very good plugin, as now it only counts as an experiment. Why am I saying it to you? Well, there is not such mod around here, and your mod is related with thrust adjusments, and seems pretty promising. I can\u0027t believe that thrust correction wouldn\u0027t been accepted and come handy in the community. What is the fun in building big wide skycranes if you can steer them only with reaction wheels or RCS?
