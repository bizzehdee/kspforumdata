But I put this sat in a 1600km orbit and did a full rotation with everything deployed (antenna\u0027s dishes, lights...) and it made the darkside transition with over 30% EC remaining?  I have built this same sat before and I know 4810EC is plenty of EC.  I thought maybe they changed the EC consumption of the dishes or something but apparently not as it makes it through the darkside transition using less then 70% of the 4810 EC on board.\n\nTo build this with 11403 EC would require two and a half time the batteries I have on it now and the thing would be rediculous.  \n\nSo unlessI am reading something wrong it looks like the dark side power consumption calculations are off.  Once again it might be a result of a mod like remotetech changing the power consumption for the dishes and omni\u0027s.  So there might need to be an adjustment made to support RT.  Not sure if the RT author can do anything at his end to fix it.  Or once again maybe I am just reading something wrong.\n\nLet me know if you\u0027d like logs or if there is anything else I can provide to clarify things more.\n\nRegards,\n\nCTBRAM\n\nUPDATE:  It appears there might be something wrong with the power drain calculation.  \n\nI did the math and at 1600km orbit the darktime transition is roughly 959.5 seconds and if the power consumption is in fact 11.89EC / sec I\u0027d need 11408.5EC.  However, That satellite in actual orbit at 1600km is only using 3367EC apparently, which is only 3.51EC/s ??\n\nEach dish requires 0.82EC/sec\n\nThe omni uses 0.60/sec\n\nThe probecore says 1.5/min = 0.025/sec\n\nSo the total for the dishes \u002B omni \u002B probe is  -\u003E 3.085 EC/sec which seems to agree with the rough 3.51 EC/sec I am observing on the actual probe.\n\nUPDATE 2.  OKay SOLVED.  I looked at parts and it\u0027s adding the 8.737 EC / sec of the electric propulsion system as if it was on all the time.  DERP\n\nI simply had to turn off including it in the ampyear calcs and bingo I get 3022 EC needed for darkside transit and a surplus of 1868 which is exactly what I am seeing.\n\nSorry for the false alarm.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-06-19T02:33:09Z\u0022 title=\u002206/19/2017 02:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJune 19, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by ctbram**"},{"CreatedByName":"Gordon Dry","CreatedById":163177,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-19T11:36:44Z","Content":"This reminds me of the idea that parts which not always use (or produce) EC but only during short times should be treated as a special category.\n\nA one-click-for-all button to exclude these parts from calculation would be another neat addition."},{"CreatedByName":"JPLRepo","CreatedById":114736,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-19T12:12:37Z","Content":"I\u0027ve found the problem with the log spam in the editor.
