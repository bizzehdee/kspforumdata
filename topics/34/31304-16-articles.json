Now I don\u0027t want to show 100 geostationary missions to the user. That would be a mess. Instead the plugin picks exactly one of those 100 contracts from the companies. And if the user wants the next contract of that type, he presses discard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI introduced a new mission field: repeatableSameVessel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis field basically declares, if the mission can be finished more than once with the same vessel. Let\u0027s take ComSat Contract III as an example.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow it should be:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Erepeatable = true: makes the mission repeatable, but you can not finish *this* mission more than once with the same vessel\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eclien controlled = true: client takes over control\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ErepeatableSameVessel = false: even after the lifetime is over, you *can not* finish this mission with this vessel again\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we change repeatableSameVessel to true, the vessel can finish the mission more than once, but only after its lifetime.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut besides that... let\u0027s not focus on the contract missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd FYI: bac9 was so nice and made some new icons.
