No matter what I do; nothing can receive what my arrays in Kerbol orit are transmitting. I even went so far as to make a \u0022stock\u0022 install (Just KSPI and HyperEdit for testing); slapped together a basic Sat with like 200K EC storage \u002B 8 of the Gigantor Arrays and put it in Kerbol orbit at ~3.75mm. With the large transmitter this gets me ~380MW when the solar panels are directly facing Kerbol.
