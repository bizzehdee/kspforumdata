Edit: And when I docked with Salyut-6, both names turned into the name of the soyuz vessel.

So a download link is available, also back on CKAN too!\n\nNote about 1.7.1:\n\n- Fixed the issue raised by **[Alexisroldan97](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/158368-alexisroldan97/ \u0022Go to Alexisroldan97\u0027s profile\u0022)** regarding Soyuz-10 and Salyut-1 (it was possible to destroy the station before the mission) Although this may still be an issue for Mir, and Salyut-2 to Salyut-7, a note is included in the contract parameter for missions requiring the Soyuz missions to be complete before deorbiting.\n\nWhitecat106 ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"Deimos Rast","CreatedById":157420,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-26T06:59:20Z","Content":"ooo la la; going to download, I appreciate all the work you\u0027ve done, these really add a lot of spirit to the game, thanks.\n\nOne minor complaint, is the pacing seems a bit off. I have kerballed landers on both moons and it\u0027s still telling me to do LKO unmanned missions and I\u0027ve been churning those out like mad (even using the cheat screen at times![:sticktongue:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif \u0022:sticktongue:\u0022)).

I\u0027m assuming this is a contract from HistoricMissions, but it never explicitly states it, but there are others that I\u0027m pretty sure I\u0027ve done that were listed (V-2), but I could still be wrong, and if so, I apologize. Not sure how it\u0027ll affect the contracts in game, if they don\u0027t have a correct reference point, or point of origin, it might kill them completely for all I know, I haven\u0027t test it, just discovered this now.\n\nAnyway, thought you should know (and I know you\u0027re busy).\n\nCheers.\n\n---edit---\n\nReverted to previous version and exceptions/errors disappear.\n\n    ContractConfigurator.ContractType: CONTRACT_TYPE \u0027SoyuzTMA-21\u0027: Error parsing targetBody\n     \n    (Filename: /home/builduser/buildslave/unity/build/artifacts/LinuxStandalonePlayerGenerated/UnityEngineDebug.cpp Line: 56)\n    \n    ArgumentException: \u0027Earth\u0027 is not a valid CelestialBody.\n      at ContractConfigurator.ConfigNodeUtil.ParseCelestialBodyValue (System.String celestialName) [0x00000] in :0 \n      at ContractConfigurator.ExpressionParser.CelestialBodyParser.ParseIdentifier (ContractConfigurator.ExpressionParser.Token token) [0x00000] in :0 \n      at ContractConfigurator.ExpressionParser.ExpressionParser\u00601[T].ParseVarOrIdentifier (ContractConfigurator.ExpressionParser.Token token) [0x00000] in :0 \n      at ContractConfigurator.ExpressionParser.ExpressionParser\u00601[CelestialBody].ParseSimpleStatement[CelestialBody] () [0x00000] in :0 \n    Rethrow as Exception: Error parsing statement.\n    Error occurred near \u0027*\u0027:\n    Earth\n    .....* \u003C-- HERE\n      at ContractConfigurator.ExpressionParser.ExpressionParser\u00601[T].ParseExpression (System.String key, System.String expression, ContractConfigurator.ExpressionParser.DataNode dataNode) [0x00000] in :0 \n      at ContractConfigurator.ConfigNodeUtil.ParseSingleValue[CelestialBody] (System.String key, System.String stringValue, Boolean allowExpression) [0x00000] in :0 \n      at ContractConfigurator.ConfigNodeUtil.ParseValue[CelestialBody] (.ConfigNode configNode, System.String key, Boolean allowExpression) [0x00000] in :0 \n      at ContractConfigurator.ConfigNodeUtil.ParseValue[CelestialBody] (.ConfigNode configNode, System.String key, System.Action\u00601 setter, IContractConfiguratorFactory obj, .CelestialBody defaultValue, System.Func\u00602 validation) [0x00000] in :0 \n    UnityEngine.Debug:Internal_LogException(Exception, Object)\n    UnityEngine.Debug:LogException(Exception)\n    ContractConfigurator.LoggingUtil:LogException(Exception)\n    ContractConfigurator.ConfigNodeUtil:ParseValue(ConfigNode, String, Action\u00601, IContractConfiguratorFactory, CelestialBody, Func\u00602)\n    ContractConfigurator.ConfigNodeUtil:ParseValue(ConfigNode, String, Action\u00601, IContractConfiguratorFactory, CelestialBody)\n    ContractConfigurator.ContractType:Load(ConfigNode)\n    ContractConfigurator.d__1e:MoveNext()\n    ContractConfigurator.ContractConfigurator:Update()\n     \n    (Filename:  Line: 4294967295)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-26T20:44:07Z\u0022 title=\u002202/26/2016 08:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 26, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Deimos Rast**\n  \nupdate"}]}
