Universal Storage has a central part and has wedges that attach to the part. What I want to do is use the same part to stack parts as well as attach other copies of the same part to the sides. Here is what I mean. Below is an example of attaching copies of the same part to the sides.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![hXmzhTQ.png](http://i.imgur.com/hXmzhTQ.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nI also want to stack the parts vertically:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![QpU1wde.png](http://i.imgur.com/QpU1wde.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nRight now, I can do one or the other, meaning I can stack them vertically, or I can attach them to the sides. I know that I can create two parts, one that stacks vertically, and one that attaches to the sides, but I\u0027m hoping to avoid that, because then I\u0027d have to store the side panels separately.\n\nI know that ModuleKISPartMount has a mountedPartNode, but it doesn\u0027t support multiple mounted part nodes.
