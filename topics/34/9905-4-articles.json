The map view seems to be implemented by a set of planet objects in a normally-invisible layer. But these objects use a scaled-down version of the normal coordinate system, with the scale factor given by Planetarium.InverseScaleFactor, which is somewhere around 0.0001 I think. I wouldn\\\u0027t be surprised if you\\\u0027re hitting one of these scaled-down map view planets with your raycast, though I kind of thought they didn\\\u0027t have colliders.
