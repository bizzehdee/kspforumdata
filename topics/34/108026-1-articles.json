So I made a simple mod that moves the unique reports automatically to the science container on your vessel or kerbal so that you can run another report if you so desire. And just like stock, it will not allow multiple of the same exact experiment in the command pod or kerbal.\n\nNote: If you use my mod ForScience!, you have no need for this mod.\n\n![JYhMtBw.png](http://i.imgur.com/JYhMtBw.png)\n\n[Download it here.](http://www.curse.com/ksp-mods/kerbal/230239-simplesciencefix)\n\n[License: CC by SA](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)\n\n[Source](https://github.com/WaveFunctionP/SimpleScienceFix)\n\n[Coffee Fund](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick\u0026hosted_button_id=VQWK2AHCDMR9Y)\n\nKnown Issues: None.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-09T20:58:49Z\u0022 title=\u002205/09/2015 08:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by WaveFunctionP**"},{"CreatedByName":"GavinZac","CreatedById":68719,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T09:16:14Z","Content":"Thanks!

The addon simply moves that data to the science container. It doesn\u0027t care if you want to keep it or not, it just moves it to get the experiment ready to go again.
