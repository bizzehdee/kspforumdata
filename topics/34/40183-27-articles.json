But I have mentioned many times to Mission authors that Docking Goals should be by themselves in a separate goal. There is no way around the way KSP works with Vessel IDs. If you dock with a vessel the vessel ID changes. And if it changes to the wrong ID (doesn\u0027t take the Original vessel ID) the mission goal won\u0027t be complete.\u003Cp\u003EIf the goals are seperate then you have a higher chance of not running into that problem. Because the Docking Goal is a separate Goal From the others. If together, then MCE is checking the IDS of every goal in that SubMissionGoal. Its a pain in the ass, but I have tried a thousand different ways around this.. And they all cause just as many problems. Even Knobody had this issue and he was trying to find a way around it. Until KSP changes the way this works in the actual game. Its going to be a problem. If they must keep the Goals together then they need to use either the Special field which turns off the Vessel IDs saving for that Goal (but causes the more then 1 docking port bug) or they can use vesselIndependent which doesn\u0027t save any of that goal to file and any vessel can complete it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBummer.

Talk about a grind fest. LOL. I will see what modules Interstellar drives has in it, and see if I can get the cost down. I have not checked to mod out in long time.. But I know that before you could upgrade a low End Drive to one of the higher ones while still on the vessel.. So in a way if you pay for a huge cost for a vessel.. keep the vessel in orbit (like you would anyway with this mod) then technically your only buying the vessel once. And getting free upgrades to that vessel. (other then the science cost to upgrade them in that mod)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMCE should have no problems at all with the new expanded planets mod. The only thing I could think of that might be a problem is the names of the planets and assigning them in missions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/malkuth1974/KSPMissionController/blob/master/missions.md\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe directions for making missions is located here.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-07T01:00:59Z\u0022 title=\u002211/07/2013 01:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 7, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by malkuth\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"malkuth","CreatedById":57414,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-07T01:34:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENew Version of Mission Controller Now Available.

The kerbal Space Program Revert Button Does Not Revert Mission Controller. The New Button is located on the Main Menu GUI, on the bottom. You can\u0027t miss it.
