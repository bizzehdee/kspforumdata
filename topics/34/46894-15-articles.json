A 2.5m engine that produces 1200Kn of thrust is much easyer to engineer and build than a 2.5m engine with 1800Kn thrust and that gimbals. Even a basic 3.75m nozzle would be easyer to engineer than a intricate 2.5m nozzle with redundencies and sub systems....\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cammcc92","CreatedById":86067,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-28T17:30:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eon your newest update, my computer says that the file in \\KW Release Package v2.5.4\\GameData\\KWRocketry\\Parts\\Fuel\\KW2mtankL4\\KWmtankl4.mbm is corrupted and i cant use your amazing mod. please can you help me out and try to fix it?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kickasskyle","CreatedById":250,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-28T19:41:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022smunisto\u0022 data-cite=\u0022smunisto\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI think something funny is happening with the new side 2m conic tanks.\u003Cp\u003EEngines placed on them (or atleast Skipper, which I\u0027ve tested with) lose heat emissives - when they start heating or firing they turn grey instead of black or orange.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EForgot to take a screenshot, but I am pretty sure it will be easy to reproduce it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: A screenshot, for science!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-image-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo i did some experimenting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a stock KSP problem, let me explain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe short story is, the further the attached engine is from the fuel tank\u0027s center the more heat it builds up (or the less it dissipates depending on your perspective).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow on any long tank you can actually make the skipper overheat slightly and it seems as though the stock emissive was made under the assumption that this would never happen.
