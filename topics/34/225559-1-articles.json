Getting way too much science biome hopping on Minmus? Well, now you do not have to worry about that anymore! With this mod, you will actually have to explore the system! Science Labs are now for transmitting the full amount of science you would get on recovery, Biome hopping is non existent, the barometer does not work in space and more! This mod is still very early in development, so feedback would be appreciated!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDownload here:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://spacedock.info/mod/3674/Dan\u0027s%20Science%20Overhaul#info\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://spacedock.info/mod/3674/Dan\u0027s Science Overhaul#info\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
