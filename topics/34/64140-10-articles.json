its the mod I\u0027m configuring for now, the resourse storage tanks in TAC life support (fantastic mod btw) don\u0027t have the same density values when comparing the capacity of the large tanks to the small ones, the settings I have for my current build mean is that when comparing the large, medium and small containers then the amount of resourse in each per its volume is WAY off, for example, the small tank says the density value is 10000, whereas the value for the large tank is ~4740 (note these values shouldn\u0027t mean anything to you guys) it basically means the resource per volume value of the small tanks is BETTER than using one large tank, so physical volume wise, loads of smaller tanks of a given volume will give twice as much resource than using one large
