KIS follows the game\u0027s concept in spite of it\u0027s kind of odd. Ideally, EvaFuel mod should take care of the canisters as well. Those who have no mod will use the game\u0027s approach (infinite eva fuel), those who decide to change the concept will install the mod. How to do it is another question. I think some support from KIS side will be needed. If I only fix the canister (which doesn\u0027t seem to be a hard task) then the behavior will become inconsistent: infinite fuel for kerbal\u0027s pack but limited fuel for the canisters.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 6 minutes ago, dlrk said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [https://www.dropbox.com/s/qid50jqqc8q22c4/output_log.txt?dl=0https://www.dropbox.com/s/qid50jqqc8q22c4/output_log.txt?d](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qid50jqqc8q22c4/output_log.txt?dl=0https://www.dropbox.com/s/qid50jqqc8q22c4/output_log.txt?dl=0)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E When I removed the surface experiments package mod, it became the simply the replication bug others haves reported.

All mods are the respective latest KSP 1.1 compatible versions. What works ok:  \n\n - VAB/SPH (I can load, modify, create new ships, see all modded components that were added, all mod functionality is nominal...)  \n\n - Tracking Station (I can see all ships ok, new planets from ESO are good, I can go to and fly all ships, new KSP functionality is nominal...)  \n\n - I can access all buildings at the KSC without any issues  \n\n - I can load any saved files ok  \n\nThis is the problem I am encountering. Once I load a ship to go to the launch pad, the initial loading screen is as its always been. But once the ship gets loaded onto the launch pad at KSC, the screen goes dark and I only have very limited functionality. The game then proceeds to hard crash to desktop if I try to do anything from returning to launch, to VAB or to KSC. \n\nScreenshot of the issue:  \n[http://imgur.com/Z0usdh2](http://imgur.com/Z0usdh2)  \n[http://imgur.com/vW7ygH1](http://imgur.com/vW7ygH1)  \n\nHere is the complete list of mods I was running (minus TAC Life Support for 1.1, Axial Aerospace and FASA.

I\u0027m using Windows 10 64bit OS.\n\nThe really weird thing that I did notice when trying to debunk this is that the ship seems to get instawarped into a solar orbit into deep space or something weird like that. I was able to (somehow) recover one ship and I got science for having retrieved a ship from solar orbit, or something like that... Here\u0027s the screenshot for it (this happens when I reload the game and try to launch another ship, at which point I have to clear the launch pad, and it gives me this):  \n  \n[http://imgur.com/CyWSTe3](http://imgur.com/CyWSTe3)  \n\nReally unsure what is causing this but, as you can imagine, this is a pretty bad issue. I cant launch anything at the moment. I can only play with what has already been launched.   \n\nThanks for any help! I really need it!  \n\nCM"},{"CreatedByName":"Enceos","CreatedById":110725,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-30T04:34:16Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, Calvin\\_Maclure said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Well, not sure... here\u0027s the deal:\n\u003E \n\nI\u0027ll PM you to keep the thread clean."},{"CreatedByName":"Enceos","CreatedById":110725,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-30T05:11:19Z","Content":"There\u0027s another mod which causes a kerbal replication bug, just so everybody knows.
