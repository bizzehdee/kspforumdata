I\u0027m working on my first plane and whenever I attempt to attach the engine nacelle or the precooler the nodes line up as they are supposed to, but the moment I click for them to attach to anything like a fuel tank (same if i try to attach radially), it greys out the nacelle and removes one of the attach nodes. If I try something like connecting it directly to a cockpit, then the two, although separated on screen both grey out and attach themselves to my cursor until I trash them and attempt to start over. This (so far) is only occuring with the early game engine nacelle/pre-cooler, but I\u0027m wondering if anyone else is having this problem. The weird thing is when I try to attach it, it greys out and the attachment points of both the fuel tank and the front side of the engine piece disappear, but the bottom attachment node still shows, which I\u0027m unable to use because the fuel-tank (or whatever else I attempted to attach it to) no longer has an attachment node. Whenever I attempt a radial connection with 2x of the pieces when I click on whatever spot I wish to attach it to it reverts to 1x radial and refuses to attach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m wondering if this is a bug brought on by the newest versions of these mods or a conflict from another mod that isn\u0027t officially part of the RO modlist (node helper and node-resizer are the only two I can think that would mess with this). I\u0027ve since removed these two mods from the folder but I haven\u0027t had a chance to check it (about to go to bed).

I took out the node helper mod and it didn\u0027t change anything. Not sure what the trouble is. I just reinstalled AJE, RO, and SXT (not sure if any of these had anything to do with the problem) but I had changed the Enginee Nacelle from a .dds to the older 1.0 version before the .dds switch and I\u0027m betting this caused the issue, further testing commencing...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Edit 2* No Luck. No idea what could be causing this issue. I\u0027ve been playing with this save for awhile, but never attempted to make a space place so this may have been a problem for awhile now. Hopefully I can either figure out what the hell is wrong with this part or hope that the problem doesn\u0027t occur with any other parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf screenshots would help explain my issue to lead to a diagnostic, let me know, and I\u0027ll oblige. At this point I\u0027ve redownloaded all the base mods and a few suggested mods for RO and am not using any part mods that aren\u0027t supported by RO/RP-0.

I went ahead and spent the last 4 hours checking which SXT models weren\u0027t working, (and when doing this found a handful of major engines like the RL10/AJ10/RD-107/108 were showing up as invisible when I opened a sandbox. Now, normally RO would take KW Rocketry and edit those engines to match the real-life engines, but I\u0027m assuming they weren\u0027t showing up because I had retrofitted some of the .dds files in the 1.0.4 install to their .mbm equivalencies from 1.0 and prior. I went ahead and checked which squad engines were actually changed by Ven/SXT/RO and switched them back and I\u0027m testing it now, and I\u0027m assuming it will work.\u003Cp\u003EThe strange thing I found out before I last ran the game was that I could use the Highly Pressurized fuselage perfectly fine, but the non-pressurized version would give me the issue where it would connect for a second then bug out and destroy the attachment nodes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully this takes care of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, THANK YOU, I didn\u0027t realize proc fairings was causing those ghost nodes and that was driving me crazy, but the issue with the regular fuselage connecting for a second and then removing the nodes from the root piece and fuselage itself would leave a ghost node below the are I attempted to connect them as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure if an edit would warrant any attention, but I\u0027m running into further problems than just the engine nacelle/pre-cooler and non-pressurized fuselages not connecting to nodes correctly. It\u0027s moved on to certain docking ports, and a number of seemingly random items from all over the tech tree (the docking port that has the issue is the non-nasa \u0022in-line\u0022 docking port that has an opening hatch that opens in order to dock. Sometimes after a ship or something similar has been built and I attempt to attach one of these it reacts like it will attach to the node, then it grays out sort of like it\u0027s not selected, but then when i attempt to throw the part to the trash it\u0027s like it has become the new root part and anything I tried attaching it to follows with it. Sometimes I\u0027m able to trash these items, but sometimes I have to start an entirely new project from scratch (or load a save, hopefully one made during the creation of whatever I\u0027m working on). I have no idea what could be causing the issue, as it has some very strange results, and any mod-conflicts that may seem obvious (like node resizer or something similar) don\u0027t do a thing to help. I have logs disabled at the moment to help the game run more smoothly, but next time I run the game I\u0027ll turn on logs and recreate the bug, and hopefully NathanKell or someone familiar with KSP modding can help diagnose the issue.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shawnbyday","CreatedById":96255,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-26T10:38:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have the following issue:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E[Exception]: MissingFieldException: Field \u0027.CelestialBody.maxAtmosphereAltitude\u0027 not found.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt keeps spamming constantly.
