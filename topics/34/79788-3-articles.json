The contracts are randomized more than enough so it is unlikely that there are several ones of the same contract type that you can accomplish in a single mission (thinking about several aerial or rover missions here). Of course one can try, but I would prefer having a wide variety of missions, also without locking out the existing ones by Squad, though I do not know the contract generation process.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there anything like a manager for contract generation? From looking at FinePrint\u0027s sources, I can only see newly defined contracts.
