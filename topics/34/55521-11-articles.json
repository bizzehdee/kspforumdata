Means that there will be an extra installation step for realchute users, but it could fix the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MaxP","CreatedById":92030,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-02T13:34:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe link on the RealFuels configuration file is broken ((\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"aristurtle","CreatedById":108264,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-02T14:51:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MaxP\u0022 data-cite=\u0022MaxP\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe link on the RealFuels configuration file is broken ((\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe current version of Real Fuels includes the patch anyway\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taquarinha","CreatedById":47685,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-02T19:45:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RuBisCO\u0022 data-cite=\u0022RuBisCO\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI see a lot of potential for widening the view, basically could you make the windows larger?\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Gnmv41f.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/Gnmv41f.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso if you could make the hatch a little bigger I don\u0027t know how the heck the Kerbals squeeze through that. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBesides that The Radish is my \u0027go to\u0027 ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah that would be great!!!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
