I\u0027ll do some re-evaluations as to what a balanced mass should be considering I also shrunk the drill. But to be honest, even considering a very heavy object, it shouldn\u0027t be 1.1 tons as the stock part file shows. Especially after I shrunk it in half. And it doesn\u0027t need to be super dense heavy metals for construction of it. A dense material for the tip of the drill is sufficient. Keep in mind we are only using this thing to collect one surface sample which odds tell us will either be dirt, sand, or a fairly soft rock.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"taniwha","CreatedById":57176,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-13T01:28:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ecdugas4\u003C/strong\u003E That wasn\u0027t meant to be pestering you.
