Just needs some tuning to get the range right and perhaps some specific animation in the gear to fool the claw into thinking it\u0027s open/closed. Shouldn\u0027t be a problem.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also had the idea of, instead of making the landing gear \u0027sticky\u0027, making the hangar floor tiles (the square grey ones) \u0027sticky\u0027 instead. This means you don\u0027t uncouple two of the three gears one at a time, and have the plane flop through the deck while the last one is still attached. I suppose this is only a problem because we can\u0027t edit action groups on the fly - that would make the gear the better, more versatile, candidate. If we could link the gears on the same planes together so they all release or couple at the same time, that might be handy. I\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s possible to make some parts exempt from the \u0027clipping allowed when part of the same craft\u0027 mechanic, which I recall was introduced around 0.15 - if so, that would mean only one gear needing to dock, and the others would not pass through the deck.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEither way, we get rid of the docking slots, so it\u0027s all good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs it possible to alter the strength of the bond? We don\u0027t want it to be that strong, just enough to hold on in x4 warp, but not enough to rip off the gear. Making it only possible to dock when not moving fast might be a good idea, to prevent cheaty (and very abrupt!) landings :-)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a few parts were there\u0027s a few different sizes to choose from - engines and rudders.

About using autostruts for carrier parts - I had a look through FairingBase.cs in the Procedural Fairing source, and there\u0027s not much to it. It seems (I think!) to iterate through each node checking for a connection, and struts the ones that aren\u0027t. If this was put on the side pieces and maybe the deck of the carrier (not the hull, it has way too many nodes), it would really reduce or eliminate strut usage. I\u0027m not sure if there\u0027d be a performance saving, as the autostruts would add to computational load if not part count, but it would massively simplify the build.
