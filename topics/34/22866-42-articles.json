Firstly, building a carrier which uses more than one of the quarter hull parts is quite difficult since the Editor Tools addon lacks the ability to zoom out far enough to mess around with all the parts (and dragging the ship around by the root part only gets someone so far). Secondly, part count can be reduced in quite a few cases since (at the very least) the structural parts can be built into a single unit (though, this would seem to act badly with some plans it looks like you have for the parts individually).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI bring this up because, as I\u0027m sure you know, the model node system doesn\u0027t allow the part configuration to map a code module to a specific model being loaded. For the most part, someone wouldn\u0027t want to do this since static parts don\u0027t pose a challenge when being welded. Dealing with the idFloatCode you wrote is a bit of a challenge since I\u0027m only able to apply flotation logic to a single model while building the structural \u0022part\u0022 and while I\u0027ve come up with a somewhat passable solution to this, it\u0027s sub-standard and it ends up using (in my opinion) too many floating parts which destroys benefit #2 (though, not by much since I don\u0027t have all the parts I want welded done yet.) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there any chance I could get an explanation of what the different part types are as well as how the mass (of the floating part) and float power variables affect things? I\u0027ve produced some very strange results while messing around with possible solutions and while the source code for the idFloatCode module allows me to understand some of what\u0027s going on, it seems like at least half of it is geared towards the float adjustment feature which currently isn\u0027t available.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I\u0027ve asked the Editor Tools developer about the zoom feature. Further, since the part welding mod now has an in-game builder, I\u0027ve suggested to Squad that they enhance the model node system to allow code modules to be mapped to specific parts, but that\u0027s always a coin flip even if it is in line with the purpose of providing the feature in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Krosulhah","CreatedById":83946,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-12T14:34:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022%5Bimg%5Dhttp%3A//i.imgur.com/WASeGsK.png\u0022 alt=\u0022WASeGsK.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHit Confirmed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Krosulhah","CreatedById":83946,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-12T15:57:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eafter everything had settled, the actual runway bit of the aircraft carrier had slid off and that bit that was sinking had resurfaced, the whole thing has also capsized.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"InfiniteDice","CreatedById":57451,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-12T16:25:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESome parts will become damaged and no longer float, others will float but be dragged down by the mass of the other attached parts.
