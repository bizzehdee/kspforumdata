The stake stays standing after the second time. In case you didn\u0027t know. This also applies to the ground blocks and other things. They always seem to need to be dropped down then surface attached a second time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of my biggest bugs right now is stuff exploding on the ground when time warping. I build a fairly large ground base on eve (one that worked fine on minmus) every time I time warp things \u0022flex\u0022 when the time warp stops causing clipping into the ground. When that happens my entire base falls apart. I even had one where a kerbal was on top of my base standing on it, and when time warp stopped he was flung off the base and somehow got under ground with only his foot and was promptly pulled into eve. This cause a chain reaction where the entire solar system collapsed on itself (not kidding) and everything was gone. No eve, no kerbal, no sun...NOTHING. The entire save was ruined because I had saved before the time warp and whenever I loaded the \u0022flexing\u0022 effect occurs upon load and the base explodes. Any idea what is causing this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way, still having the transfer issue when moving kernels around. What can I send you to help diagnose? I don\u0027t have Connected Living Spaces or any other mods like that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI only have your recommended mods installed. KIS, KAS, Kethane, EPL, and a few other mods. You can see the full list on my twitch page (www.twitch.tv/gokouzwar) in the page part at the bottom below my logo. I don\u0027t have many mods at all. I try to keep the game light. Most mods are for assisting with navigation, building (KER) and other such things (atmosphere trajectories) the only mods I have that modify how the game works is your mod and KAS really...and Kethane I suppose but that shouldn\u0027t affect the transfer of kerbals from workshops. It\u0027s ONLY workshops that have the problem. I can EVA and transfer from any other modules just fine.
