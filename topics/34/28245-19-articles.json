Your normal map SHOULD have a blue \u0022background\u0022 as Unity seems to want the full RGB style of normal map. If your bump is subtle you may not be able to easily discern the pattern in the finished map until you apply it to the model. You shouldn\u0027t need to use the nvidia plugin at all- your 3D software should be capable of baking a normal map directly to the RGB format in a variety of normal spaces. The image is in tangent-space normal coordinates, so full blue on the image means no change in the surface normal at that point. (R=x offset, G=y, B=z which is directly away from the surface-the default state for a surface normal). If you\u0027re using Blender, here\u0027s a reasonably decent tutorial for how to bake the normal map: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://cgcookie.com/blender/2010/06/30/normal_maps_blender_2_5/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://cgcookie.com/blender/2010/06/30/normal_maps_blender_2_5/\u003C/a\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rottielover","CreatedById":73403,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-08T04:59:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Talisar\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Talisar\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDo you need help actually changing the texture files, or the part in the cfg file that directs which texture is loaded?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like to make textures for the TAC lifeSupport mod (similar to the IronCross tanks, but I was thinking about what it would take to get started in making textures and I have no idea.
