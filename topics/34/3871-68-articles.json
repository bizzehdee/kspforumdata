Some texture tweaks for those not swapped yet. (You will need to load up old craft files and re-attach the engines properly before launching)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdded SAS computer modules and reaction wheels as appropriate to all Command Pods and Unmanned control units.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdded a new winglet to fit the Bearcat 5x engine as Saturn style stabilizers. Use incremental rotations to align it properly. It will also work on any other attachable surface)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConverted previous SAS modules into a combo SAS Computer/Reaction Wheel module - available for all diameter sizes. (Note you can disable the reaction wheel if you do not want added torque)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETweaked some SRB balance numbers (thanks to Qerbal for the input)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemoved the old \u0022ASAS\u0022 parts from the folder - If you used them on a craft file you\u0027ll need to remove them and resave before deleting the NP_ASAS* folders inside of GameData/NovaPunch2/Parts/SAS/\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETest it out, find the broken things I missed, tell me how things are working now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome notes:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe new SAS is pretty amazing, the oscillation is vastly reduced. Unfortunately, its not 100% gone. On large rockets (typically consisting of 5m parts) and engine gimbals enabled, the SAS will still have a bit of back and forth input when holding course. Having spoken with a dev about it, this is actually the fault of the same thing which has plagued the large parts in the past; the mathematical errors which occur when the Mass of Unity parts goes past a certain threshold. So the same thing which makes tanks dance on their engines or just snap off affects the SAS trying to figure out the velocity of the rocket to correct it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing proper strutting will certainly keep the oscillations from breaking the rocket, and if you can fly the 1st stage without SAS or without Gimbals, you shouldn\u0027t have any trouble afterwards. And on the whole SAS control is really awesome now. Let me know your experiences.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso try out the Odin RCS performance. It has been plagued with some RCS imbalance issues causing it to drift when translating - there should be some fixes for that in place in KSP now. Just enable FINE CONTROL MODE when using RCS to translate/dock and you should see a big difference.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Toyotawolf","CreatedById":75259,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-25T05:27:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELove the new look of the engines Tiberion and gang, keep up the good works \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maackey","CreatedById":39248,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-25T06:04:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t tried NovaPunch for a long while (because of excess parts I\u0027d never use), this is looking really good. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt seems that all the decouplers are incredibly heavy compared to the stock ones.
