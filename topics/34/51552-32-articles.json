I keep the task manager open on a second monitor; if I am frequently above 2,500 Mb something\u0027s gotta go...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway after doing a 4 probe \u002B interplanetary relay exploration of eve with 90-150s of signal delay, here\u0027s what I\u0027ve figured out: Open the flight computer, hit the Q (queue) button. Everything you do will show up in that window-- action groups, staging, flight computer inputs, right click on a part -\u0026gt; anything, even canceling a previous command, along with a countdown to when that command will actually execute. In the bottom of this you can set a \u0022total delay\u0022, either in seconds, or in xxh yym zzs format (it won\u0027t take days, but \u0026gt;24 hours works). Remember to hit enter for it to apply, and it\u0027s easy to forget that you have a delay plugged in!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe attitude control works pretty much like mechjeb\u0027s S.A.S.S., but I haven\u0027t figured out how to switch to say surface retrograde without first sending a surface prograde command. The throttle slider is obvious, but it defaults to 0 which means it\u0027s easy to accidentally command a burn with a 0% throttle setting. The window below the throttle lets you plug in either a burn duration, or a dV value by typing \u0022m/s\u0022 (without quotes) after. If you don\u0027t give units, it defaults to seconds duration. (I\u0027d prefer it defaulted to m/s, since it\u0027s usually far more precise!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample problem: Say I\u0027ve got a 1 minute burn I want to execute in 2 hours time. I\u0027ll usually pull up the navball and look at the maneuver details next to it, paying attention to the countdown. I\u0027ll set my delay to 1h 59m, and send either a \u0022node\u0022 command (click the node button) or just a prograde/retrograde/etc. command if applicable. (The advantage to using a relative direction rather than the node is that it won\u0027t get confused if the node gets deleted, and it won\u0027t get squirrely towards the end of the burn.) This way, the craft has a bit of time to align itself for the burn but it doesn\u0027t try to point itself that direction for the entire time up till then. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter that, I\u0027ll pick a throttle setting and enter the dV value in the box (don\u0027t forget \u0022m/s\u0022 after!) Once the countdown hits 1h 59m 30s (1 minute burn, so we\u0027ll shoot for 30s on either side. Sometimes you\u0027ve gotta take a WAG here on account of the sketchy burn duration numbers you\u0027ll get from maneuver nodes), I\u0027ll hit the \u0022burn\u0022 button, and then sanity check the commands in the queue window. Then it doesn\u0027t hurt to zero out your delay, and time warp. The computer should automatically stop time warp and execute the burn as scheduled.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cilph","CreatedById":21477,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-21T19:47:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KerbMav\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KerbMav\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHow the Kerb did I manage to put them on my crafts??\u003Cp\u003EGame would not load two probes with these two deleted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEh?

There\u0027s no dish on our vessel bigger than those at KSC tracking station.
