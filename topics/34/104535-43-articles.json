I\u0027m unsure if other mods might interfere with the issue I\u0027ve been having: Infernal Robotics wheels causing vessels to leap into the air and slam back down, causing explosions as parts become too stressed.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [Here is my test craft.](https://www.dropbox.com/s/8cyrn8j8jqmizqj/Prover.craft?dl=0) I also tested with a reaction wheel and one of Roverdude\u0027s life support inline cans. The life support can seemed to keep the center of mass low so the vessel didn\u0027t leap into the air, though the reaction wheel had an effect I should\u0027ve seen coming (It caused the vessel to flip when I tried to roll forward).\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E If you need any more info, lemme know and I\u0027ll try to get you what you need to sort this out.\n\u003E \n\nI\u0027m afraid you misunderstood me, IR wheels from Zodius parts pack are still broken. This fix was for stock wheels attached to robotic crafts (like in this album posted before)\n\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/JmvoE/embed?background=ffffff\u0026text=1a1a1a\u0026link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-06T19:03:16Z\u0022 title=\u002205/06/2016 07:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 6, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Ziw**"}]}
