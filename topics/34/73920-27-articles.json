Well I\u0027ve had mixed results, on one flight a fuel tank started leaking so I EVA\u0027d out and right clicked, it said 1 SparePart was required which I then went and collected and the leaking part gave me the option to duct-tape the hole! Great I thought, it works! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI recognize that this crude fix removes the balance of the mod, so to compensate I\u0027ve also reduced the number of SpareParts carried on each capsule.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, a while later I was flying a twin engine jet when one of the engines turned red and cut out. I killed the throttle and managed to glide to a safe landing. When i confidently EVA\u0027d to repair the damage I was sad to see it required 2 SpareParts to fix, and was therefore impossible. I guess this means that the RepairCost isn\u0027t as simple as I imagined...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThinking about it more I will continue to use this combination of mods, because realistically there are some problems which can\u0027t be fixed in the field, and not being able to repair a jet engine while landed in a literal field actually adds to the immersion! From now on I will have to build craft with a \u0027plan B\u0027 in mind for when the unfixable failures strike!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for your great mod and good luck crushing this weird interaction bug.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Coffeeman","CreatedById":69966,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-27T23:06:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActually, you can download a fixed build from here: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/Ippo343/DangIt/releases/tag/0.5.4-pre\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/Ippo343/DangIt/releases/tag/0.5.4-pre\u003C/a\u003E .

Or RCS thrusters? If the probe is small enough you can probably get to orbit on RCS thrusters on Minmus, so I\u0027m not sure which part(s) you\u0027re talking about. I can imagine the RCS thrusters might have a low MTBF set in the config files, because they don\u0027t fire for long durations and otherwise they\u0027d never fail.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
