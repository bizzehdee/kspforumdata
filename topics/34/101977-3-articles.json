I understand the Centre of Thrust part and I know what B9 is, just have no clue what OPT is.\n\u003E Cheers,\n\n\u0022OPT\u0022 is another part maker. The B9 set revised the Mk2 fuselage section, and you can\u0027t really mix those with stock. OPT has essentially produced a really big version of the Mk2 for large spaceplanes.\n\nThread Here\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/97525-1-0-4-WIP-OPT-Space-Plane-v1-7](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/97525-1-0-4-WIP-OPT-Space-Plane-v1-7)\n\n\u0022CoL\u0022 is centre of lift\n\nThe problem that was described may be a sign of getting short on usable RAM. I\u0027ve had exactly the same symptoms, and I don\u0027t use FAR. I am thinking I may have to do SpacePlane things in a different install, without the big boosters. These things can all be well-designed for RAM usage, but it adds up nevertheless. Or it may be some sort of memory leak. It depends on the OS, but certainly consider a KSP restart, check for crud running in the background, and maybe restart the OS.\n\n(Most people need the Firespitter plug-in. Most of the Firespitter parts, while good, are superfluous. Do you really need that biplane when you\u0027re flying hypersonic spaceplanes? You do get the choice.)"},{"CreatedByName":"General Venter","CreatedById":146392,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T08:38:16Z","Content":"When i have this mod on, b9 procedural wings and opt wings DONT work.
