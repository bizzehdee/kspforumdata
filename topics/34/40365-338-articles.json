Modelling it effectively so there\u0027s a real and predictable difference between getting a bunch of radiation in a short period and the same dose over a long period of time sounds like a difficult task. For one, it can\u0027t be modelled perfectly based on real life; people would almost certainly have problems understanding it and predicting the effects. And if you were to model it accurately, you need to also be measuring absolute exposure in Gray, as sievert is intended only to measure the health effect of small doses over a long period of time. High Sv levels near a reactor don\u0027t actually make much sense. One would be more interested in the absolute dose over such a short period (for practical purposes one can often calculate that dosage and then treat it as if it were all given in a single dose).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd all that is already hurting my brain.

Since I only have the 2-3k science point nodes left to unlock, I think it is time to head out in the Kerbol system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI plan to learn everything by the try\u0026amp;error method, strapping the max possible amount of Interstellar parts to one craft and testing multiple variations until I understand how it all works. Ever since I installed Interstellar the most of its parts I installed on a craft is just a reactor and a science lab. No power stations, no relays, not even rockets with Interstellar engines, which seem to be super efficient and I might try them when I get my power relays in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TinyPirate","CreatedById":77813,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-17T12:06:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGuys, I have a reactor up and a TON of coolant, but we\u0027re still overheating - you can see the stats and station in the following screenshot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/QgTLJGA.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/QgTLJGA.jpg\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/QgTLJGAl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022QgTLJGAl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHALP!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-17T12:16:18Z\u0022 title=\u002204/17/2014 12:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 17, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by TinyPirate\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AndreyATGB","CreatedById":62674,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-17T12:07:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TinyPirate\u0022 data-cite=\u0022TinyPirate\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EGuys, I have a reactor up and a TON of coolant, but we\u0027re still overheating - you can see the stats and station in the following screenshot.\u003Cp\u003EHALP!\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m gonna need a better resolution than 640x360 to help you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TinyPirate","CreatedById":77813,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-17T12:16:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NeoAcario\u0022 data-cite=\u0022NeoAcario\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt\u0027s all about Thrust to Weight and how much you need.
