Yes, the RCS will fire only when attached to a part that contains the appropriate fuel. The only way around this is to enable crossfeed for the part between them with the help of the Crossfeed Enabler mod, look in its thread for instructions. The easiest solution, however, is to use the same propellant configuration for RCS that you do for your main orbital engine, for example Aerozine \u002B N2O4. This way you can simply attach RCS to your main service module tank, without having to use any separate RCS fuel tanks at all. Do you know how to switch the fuel configuration of RCS? (Switch to \u0022action groups\u0022 menu, and click the RCS thrusters you want to configure to get to the detailed configuration menu).\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually, during manual install via ckan, I did forgot to include the RCSEnabler mod (shame on me!).

Unfortunately, English is not my mother language so please apologize, if I couldn\u0027t myself make clear.\u003Cp\u003EMy initial problem, that it wouldn\u0027t work at all was purely my fault. I forgot to add the CrossfeedEnabler mod via CKan. I have already added it and crossfeeding works [for now]. In the example I mentioned above the problem is a different one: The RCS thrusters fires all the time (like I would press \u0022H\u0022 all the time).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA last word to my setup with the Jumbo: This was only for reconstructing the error, not for real flight. My real ship uses procedural tanks and initially the Hydrazine tank was located inside the main tank (as you suggested), but now I have some radially mounted tanks, purely for asthetic reasons. Both variations work well with CrossfeedEnabler. Thrusters consuming Hydrazine now from the radial mounted tanks. But they fire instantly, when I activating the RCS system. Seems to me like a problem with some of the config files but I am not good enough with KSP internal stuff to know where to look at and to corecct it for myself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor my real setup I am using - along with ProceduralParts - the FASA Apollo command pod and the whole thruster thingy with this pod and the service module gives me aheadache.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd while I am typing this I made an additional test and found something weird:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thrusters are firering continouisly, because the rocket engine(!) is throttled up. Main engine throttled up (but not activated). If I press \u0022R\u0022 to activate RCS, the additional thrusters will immideately fire. If I press \u0022X\u0022 to set throttle to 0, they stop firing. I assume, that the RCS engine are handled internally like normal rocket engines and due to the fact that they do not need to get activated they fire according to the throttle setup.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe work around for me now is to use RCS only with throttle set to 0, even if the main engine is not activated at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan anybody reproduce the problem?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-27T16:02:48Z\u0022 title=\u002211/27/2014 04:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 27, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Carraux\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hattivat","CreatedById":110255,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-27T16:09:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh, yes, now I know what your problem is.
