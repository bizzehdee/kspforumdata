It is provided to make the concept of connected living spaces easily available to other mod developers and so to provide a single consistent understanding of which parts connect to each other, bringing together both multiple features via plugins and multiple part pack via configurations.\n\nCLS itself has a simple GUI to show the player which parts are connected to which. It also has an optional feature that conforms the stock crew transfer system to CLS\u0027s view of internal connectivity.\n\nCLS now supports [KSP-AVC](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79745), an addon version checker. If you have KSP-AVC installed, it will detect when CLS needs to be updated.\n\nCLS also is listed in [\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?showtopic=197082) for your automatic installation convenience.\n\nYou can access the [source code here](https://github.com/codepoetpbowden/ConnectedLivingSpace).\n\nIf you spot a bug please let me know. Ideally bugs should be raised in Github. More helpful than raising a bug report is to raise a bug report with lots of information about how to reproduce the problem, and with logs files, save files, craft files etc. Even more helpful is to write a fix by forking the code in Github, and then generating a pull request ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n![DgAQNWS.png](https://i.imgur.com/DgAQNWS.png)\n\nLicense:  ![80x15.png](http://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-sa/4.0/80x15.png)\n\nConnectedLivingSpace is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License\n\n[CLS API WIKI](https://github.com/codepoetpbowden/ConnectedLivingSpace/wiki) - of interest to modders using CLS in their own mods.\n\nThere is also some early documentation in the [development thread](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/68617).\n\nWhile CLS is primarily an API, it will operate in standalone mode, and does offer a few features.

However if you upgrade to 1.0.5.0 you should update other mods such as Ship manifest that use (or do not use!) it.\n    Version 1.0.4.1 fixes bugs, allows for shielded docking ports and is the result of a major rework of the code. Hatches in docking ports have been re-written. There is also config for many more mods, and more options for the configs.\n    Version 1.0.3.0 fixes a few bugs and adds more configs\n    Version 1.0.1.0 is now available. this version adds closable hatches in docking ports, as well as improvements to the GUI, and configuration for more part packs.\n\n![NDvdt2P.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/NDvdt2P.jpg)\n\n**Mods using the CLS API**\n\nHere is a list of mods that have been released that make use of ConnectedLivingSpace.
