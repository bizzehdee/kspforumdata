If you add multiple radiators in symmetry mode, it\u0027s still only one heat pump but it distributes the heat being pumped out of the target part amongst all symmetrically placed radiators. Individually placed radiators count as separate and individual heat pumps. This isn\u0027t really by design; it\u0027s a consequence of not having been implemented as a vessel wide thermal management system like the stock radiators. Use of symmetry is a cheap solution until I come up with something better.\n\nUntil I implement a vessel wide thermal management version, this means that you could increase performance by adding the radiators separately but each individual radiator has to manage the heat load on their own. The only reason that would really be necessary though is if a part overheated and you wanted it to be cooled down faster. The main purpose of this mod is to intercept heat being conducted into the tank before it becomes a problem. (this newest version should handle things better....)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-03-16T00:53:42Z\u0022 title=\u002203/16/2017 12:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 16, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Starwaster**"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwaster","CreatedById":71262,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-17T04:31:57Z","Content":"Heat Pump version 1.3.0.1 updated for KSP 1.2.2\n\n[https://github.com/Starwaster/HeatPump/releases/tag/v1.3.0.1](https://github.com/Starwaster/HeatPump/releases/tag/v1.3.0.1)\n\n- Added missing \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E configs (adds duplicates of stock radiator panels using HP module for cryo cooling)\n- *\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBe sure to delete any older HeatPump folders!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E*\n\n(HP 1.3.0 change log)\n\n- Clamped heatTransferCap to equal or greater than heatTransfer\n- Fixed bug in how heat transfer was calculated.
