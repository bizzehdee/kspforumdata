The runway and especially the launchpad parts have beautiful animations but are so unweildy as to be useless. It might be possible to use them with KAS but I have not tested that yet. The launchpad is especially broken because it has a node hanging out in mid air/space several meters away from the stack. It also has a crew of 2 despite not having a compartment or hatch for said crew making it impossible to transfer them to another craft. The only usable part is the orbital spacedock. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. The construction process begins with the Orez. Ore is a standardized resource that may be obtained through one of several mods. It may be obtained using the kethane style scanning and augur equipment that comes with this mod, it may also be obtained with Karbonite\u0027s parts or from asteroids from the Asteroid Resource Toolkit (or similar name). There could also be some other mods out there that will provide it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Since smelting discards 40% of the mass as slag, you REALLY want to smelt it before launching it. Also, with the procedural tanks and KW rocketry, it is possible to launch a 350\u002B ton slug of metal from Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. A functioning construction base must have the construction dock. It must also have a workshop with a parts converter in order to process the metal. The conversion process is 70% efficient, The filings/shavings/waste should be recycled with an on-board smelter which can restore the system to 100% efficiency. So the smelter goes under Really Should Have . You will then need a bin for the parts and a fuel depot with at least enough to get the rocket to the next fueling station. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Assuming the UI component is working (it uses KSPAPIextensions) it will be possible to select any of your designs, or even subasemblies, and send them to be fabricated. The fabrication process can be sped up by having more kerbals in suitable modules on the base. My ship had a crew of 21, including the workshop.
