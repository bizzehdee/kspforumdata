I would love there to be a better consensus on this to make it easier for everyone to install mods, but as a start I only offer my observations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- First I want to say you\u0027re absolutely right, in a completely stock game of KSP v0.20.2, adding everything to the \\GameData\\ folder as you suggest, will work just fine. It would look like this: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://screencast.com/t/RrMtFjQ8snq4\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ehttp://screencast.com/t/RrMtFjQ8snq4\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E But a couple things have come up:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe version of ModuleManager.dll that shipped with RemoteTech had some conflicts with the B9 parts pack. Specifically the plugin \u0022ExsurgentEngineering\u0022 which ships with that pack. Since that conflict arose new versions of ModuleManager were updated to ensure that conflict didn\u0027t occur. It can be found on the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/31342-0-20-ModuleManager-1-3-for-all-your-stock-modding-needs\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EModuleManager forum post\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EOther mods that are shipping with ModuleManager (DeadlyReentry, FerramAerospaceResearch, IoncrossCrewSupport, and ModularFuelTanks) set up the \\GameData\\ folder with the ModuleManager.dll naked in the \\GameData\\ folder: \\KSP\\GameData\\ModuleManager.dll (Side Note: I\u0027m confident that this is how those modders intended for their files to be installed because the GameData folder is included in their distributed .zip file; thus clearly communicating the intended folder structure.) This means that if I install RemoteTech and another Mod using ModuleManager then it would \u003Ca href=\u0022http://screencast.com/t/3qdjra47Iq\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Elook like this\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E.

But unfortunately that\u0027s not what everyone else has done so it would still be an issue. Longer term, it would be awesome to change the norm here. I haven\u0027t actually looked at the code yet but I\u0027m a bit concerned that I suspect ModuleManager.dll is looking through all the .cfg\u0027s in child directories of it\u0027s root location. It would be nice if the scope of this location was limited to .cfg files that were intentionally meant to be leveraged by ModuleManager. This is why your installation method really apeals to me...but the norm would have to change. (EDIT: A quick glance at the ModuleManager source has me less convinced that this is how it works. Probably no reason to stop putting the ModuleManager.dll at the \\GameData\\ModuleManager.dll location...no reason other than my own OCD I suppose; FOLDER FOR ALL THE THINGS!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- IMO, the best course of action in the short term would be to recommend a different installation practice. One where the ModuleManager.dll is utilized in the base location of the GameData folder, and the ProbeCompatability_ModuleManager.cfg is located in a RemoteTech folder of any name desired. This would \u003Ca href=\u0022http://screencast.com/t/1DNCOAunYHlt\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Elook like this\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- So in short summary, two things should be done differently for the short term.

Allow me to share some of the potential conflicts with this... I would love there to be a better consensus on this to make it easier for everyone to install mods, but as a start I only offer my observations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- First I want to say you\u0027re absolutely right, in a completely stock game of KSP v0.20.2, adding everything to the \\GameData\\ folder as you suggest, will work just fine. It would look like this: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://screencast.com/t/RrMtFjQ8snq4\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ehttp://screencast.com/t/RrMtFjQ8snq4\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E But a couple things have come up:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe version of ModuleManager.dll that shipped with RemoteTech had some conflicts with the B9 parts pack. Specifically the plugin \u0022ExsurgentEngineering\u0022 which ships with that pack. Since that conflict arose new versions of ModuleManager were updated to ensure that conflict didn\u0027t occur. It can be found on the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/31342-0-20-ModuleManager-1-3-for-all-your-stock-modding-needs\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EModuleManager forum post\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EOther mods that are shipping with ModuleManager (DeadlyReentry, FerramAerospaceResearch, IoncrossCrewSupport, and ModularFuelTanks) set up the \\GameData\\ folder with the ModuleManager.dll naked in the \\GameData\\ folder: \\KSP\\GameData\\ModuleManager.dll (Side Note: I\u0027m confident that this is how those modders intended for their files to be installed because the GameData folder is included in their distributed .zip file; thus clearly communicating the intended folder structure.) This means that if I install RemoteTech and another Mod using ModuleManager then it would \u003Ca href=\u0022http://screencast.com/t/3qdjra47Iq\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Elook like this\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E. The multiple copies of ModuleManager.dll is problematic and likely causes conflicts with itself.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Personally, I really like the direction you headed in with the ModuleManager.dll and configs in their own folder (though I would\u0027ve named the base folder \u0022ModuleManager\u0022 such that a single .dll in a generically named folder could be used by all other mods as well). But unfortunately that\u0027s not what everyone else has done so it would still be an issue. Longer term, it would be awesome to change the norm here. I haven\u0027t actually looked at the code yet but I\u0027m a bit concerned that I suspect ModuleManager.dll is looking through all the .cfg\u0027s in child directories of it\u0027s root location. It would be nice if the scope of this location was limited to .cfg files that were intentionally meant to be leveraged by ModuleManager. This is why your installation method really apeals to me...but the norm would have to change. (EDIT: A quick glance at the ModuleManager source has me less convinced that this is how it works. Probably no reason to stop putting the ModuleManager.dll at the \\GameData\\ModuleManager.dll location...no reason other than my own OCD I suppose; FOLDER FOR ALL THE THINGS!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- IMO, the best course of action in the short term would be to recommend a different installation practice. One where the ModuleManager.dll is utilized in the base location of the GameData folder, and the ProbeCompatability_ModuleManager.cfg is located in a RemoteTech folder of any name desired. This would \u003Ca href=\u0022http://screencast.com/t/1DNCOAunYHlt\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Elook like this\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- So in short summary, two things should be done differently for the short term.
