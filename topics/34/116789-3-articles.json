For most antennas, that penalty is 0.75, so stacking N antennas only increases power by a factor of N^0.75, not N.  To get to 900 Gm, you would need to use 235 RA-15 antennas (which have a power of 15 Gm each), or 19 RA-100s.  Or, get DMagic Orbital Science and use one SIGINT antenna, which has a power of 10 Tm (10,000 Gm).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 4 hours ago, larkvi said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I am having this show contracts for relays for every planet in the GPP system, despite never having done a flyby of any except Iota and Ceti.
