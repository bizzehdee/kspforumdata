Personally I\u0027m taking away the mach and G ribbons since I would prefer the mach be reserved for flying an aircraft and the G\u0027s be reserved also for aircraft or for a rocket launch - situations where it\u0027s harder to achieve these ribbons, in other words\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, what is definitely a bug is that my kerbal was awarded a 4000t heavy vehicle crew ribbon for a 53t vehicle. The timestamp of the ribbon shows it was awarded the second I brought the rocket out onto the pad\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso can we have total mission and total EVA time in the after-mission report box?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nereid","CreatedById":68815,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-28T23:20:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022vardicd\u0022 data-cite=\u0022vardicd\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo, possible bug, Under certain situations, it appears the mach 10 ribbon can be awarded in a straight vertical launch.
