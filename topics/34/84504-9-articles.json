I had previously indicated there shouldn\u0027t be any compatibility issues between SDF and Trajectories, but I\u0027m not sure there has been an actual testing of it. So I checked that out as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, Firespitter airbrakes. Those had been discussed previously so I put those in the mix as well. Oh, and a comparison with Mech Jeb 2\u0027s landing predictions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow is a series of screenshots. The first one is pretty much just a discarded rocket stage with some fuel left in it. No airbrakes. The blue marker is Mech Jeb\u0027s prediction. You will also notice a similar red marker on top of AT\u0027s cross. I put that there (MJ\u0027s landing site selector) That way I can get a precise indication of how far off the two are. (the landing autopilot window indicates a difference of 57.23 km)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next few shots are a reentry vehicle with four FS Airbrakes and an inflatable heat shield. The last is significant because it alters drag when it inflates. Each of the 4 airbrakes alters the drag rating by setting it to 40 (maximum_drag = 40)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the brakes deployed MJ is reporting a difference of 6,314 km but I\u0027m pretty sure it\u0027s only about 200 km difference. With the brakes off, the number falls to 12 km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs it turns out, MJ\u0027s prediction was closer. (except for its odd reporting of over 6 THOUSAND kilometers initially so that sounds like a bug report for the MJ forum coming up). As the craft got deeper into the atmosphere, Trajectories\u0027 prediction got closer to MJ\u0027s as seen in the final shot. I\u0027m not sure why the airbrakes would produce such a discrepancy seeing as all they\u0027re doing is increasing the drag rating on the airbrake parts. Strictly going off of stock behavior. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the other discrepancies I\u0027m not sure if that\u0027s an RSS issue or what. It shouldn\u0027t be really. The atmospheric model is legacy so nothing unusual going on there other than the atmosphere being over 100km deep.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/jPHXn\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
