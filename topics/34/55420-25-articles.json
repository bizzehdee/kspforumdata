I include it in the final product, but it\u0027s hidden away in an optional tab that, if you so choose, you\u0027ll never have to click on. What annoys me the most with this case is it sticks out like a sore thumb. It\u0027s a bright yellow button on a partially transparent black background. What I did was change it to a dark box to where it blends into the background a bit better; now I barely notice it. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/gol8r80n3bioqd5/donate.tga\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHere\u0027s a link to the alternate donate button texture.\u003C/a\u003E This is what it changes it to: \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qYlFsvG.png\u0022 alt=\u0022qYlFsvG.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, it\u0027s up to the author how he/she implements a donate button. Some keep it to the side and some put right in your face. At least in this case you can change the texture so its less noticeable.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-23T08:08:48Z\u0022 title=\u002205/23/2014 08:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 23, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by FiiZzioN\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
