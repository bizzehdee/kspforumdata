The simple answer is to regress to the 0.90 version of reactor heating. If the goal is radiators everywhere as you stated, could you just tweak that system to do globalize the reactor heat output and radiator heat rejection instead of checking each reactor and only parts attached to it? Instead just sum the heat rejection the reactors require, sum the heat rejection of all radiators in the moment (to account for retracted/deployed) and base the efficiency/power output calculations off that.\n\nAlternatively stick with the 1.0.2 system since, as most of us in the thread agree, stock f\u0027d you over.

I had the same concern, but when testing [this patch](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/124391-1-02-Heat-Control-Manage-your-ship-s-heat%21-%2815-06-2015-new-radiators-and-heat-exchangers%29?p=2053278\u0026viewfull=1#post2053278), I HyperEdited my spacecraft into orbit of Moho, and the reactor steady state temperature only increased 2-3K.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E You could also make reactors be fully isolated at all times. Make them just not participate in exchanging heat with the vessel. That way it\u0027s easier to balance for the conformal set, because it always guarantees conformal conditions.\n\nI really think this is the way to go (well, not necessarily *fully* isolated, but very low heatConductivity). It\u0027s the only way, within this system, to achieve robust reactor/radiator relationships. I would argue that it doesn\u0027t entirely defeat the purpose of the heat simulation, as players will still need to consider issues of radiator saturation if they have any other heat-producing parts on the spacecraft.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Fraz made some comments before about ignoring sunk costs, but I think he\u0027s not really doing that himself. There are a lot of things we don\u0027t model, like ionizing radiation, nuclear waste dumps, Kerbal \u0022no-nukes\u0022 protestors trying to block the launches, etc. Why are we trying to model reactor heating the way we are doing?\n\nWhat sunk costs am I holding on to? Reactor heat itself? As [my recent patch](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/124391-1-02-Heat-Control-Manage-your-ship-s-heat%21-%2815-06-2015-new-radiators-and-heat-exchangers%29?p=2053278\u0026viewfull=1#post2053278) demonstrates, it\u0027s actually *really easy* to balance reactor heat if we take Nertea\u0027s radiators out of the picture.\n\n* * *\n\nNertea,\n\nFor you consideration, I have outlined one potential approach to working through the reactor heat/radiator issues:\n\nStep 1 - Update NFE for 1.04, *without conformal radiators*. This involves (i) tuning reactor properties to be well-matched with stock radiators (as I did in my example patch), and (ii) solving the \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0\u00C2\u00A51000x time warp exploding ship issue (e.g., by disallowing \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0\u00C2\u00A51000x time warp with active reactor, or turning off reactor heat production at \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0\u00C2\u00A51000x time warp).\n\nStep 2 - Update HeatControl for 1.04, as a parts-only pack (which would now include conformal radiators, and should probably *exclude* heat pipes and exchangers). This would involve tuning the conformal radiators to work as matching sets with their corresponding reactors, which I still believe is possible, though *it will be messy*. Doing so will probably require tuning the emissivity values of each radiator individually to achieve the desired performance.\n\nStep 3 - If/when motivated to do so, develop an optional \u0022HeatControl\u002B\u0022 add-on that basically restores your pre-1.03 radiator behavior and localized heat management, including heat pipes and exchangers.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-02T00:59:40Z\u0022 title=\u002207/02/2015 12:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fraz86**"},{"CreatedByName":"Nertea","CreatedById":83952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T04:18:33Z","Content":"I wrote a long post but the forum ate it.\n\nSummary: I really need to work out what\u0027s going on about over 100x warp.

Some people may not be bothered as much as I am, so maybe solving the issue with additional parts is acceptable. Also returns a little bit of purpose to Heat Control as a mod.\n\nFor pure part balancing, fully isolating reactors isn\u0027t required. It all depends on how much you want to push the conformal radiator thing. From how I see it, even with full reactor isolation you\u0027ll have to run with completely inconsistent numbers between the three sizes to make it work with the existing radiators.\n\nWhich leaves one more option: new radiators.

Converting to a second system like KSPI removes that element, however its not off the stable right now.

Heat is handwaved as a few numbers the mod tracks (not unlike the black magic of stock) but unlike KSPI, its not a resource.\n\nTLDR: before stock heating, the reactors did run on a custom arbitrary system.

A common misconception - it\u0027s perfectly possible to have high (\u003E0.95) emissivities with bright coloured materials, as we\u0027re generally talking about emissivity in the thermal region of the spectrum while we see in the visible spectrum. Those only overlap significantly at very high temperatures.\n\nThen you might want to quantify radiator effectivity as (very crude, I know) capability to remove amount of heat per unit of time. That way you could recalculate both stock and mod radiators for easy comparison, and also to determine heat produced by NF EC generators (to preserve easy calculation).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-03T23:30:05Z\u0022 title=\u002207/03/2015 11:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Wolfox**"},{"CreatedByName":"Fraz86","CreatedById":90101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-04T01:13:28Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E [New test release](https://www.dropbox.com/s/w1zkqp193uibhsz/NearFutureElectricalX0_5_2a.zip?dl=0)\n\u003E Removes conformal radiators, tweaks reactor temperatures and masses a bit. Also stops reactor heat production at \u003E 100X time warp. See if that helps (I have a worry here).\n\nLooks good! Here are my initial observations:\n\n- The \u003E100X time warp temperature jump no longer occurs in my tests. Now the temperature drops dramatically at \u003E100X time warp. This is technically exploitable - you could build a ship with no radiators and lots of batteries, start the reactor at 0% output, go to 1000X time warp, adjust output to 100%, fill batteries, decrease output back to 0%, turn off time warp, then use the stored electricity to power engines or whatever. Thankfully, it\u0027s a bit difficult to imagine when this would really be useful, considering that - if you\u0027re going to 1000X time warp to fill batteries, you might as well just use solar panels or RTGs.\n- It looks like my wishlist of proposed changes was almost entirely implemented, so I don\u0027t have much else to add. The only exceptions are MX-4 mass (which remains at 1.22 instead of 1.2) and reactor costs. I agree with Steetwind\u0027s assertion that, given the expensiveness of reactors, it seems reasonable to leave them alone. The only additional suggestion I can think of is, I suppose it wouldn\u0027t hurt to increase radiatorMax of reactors to 0.35 like LV-Ns (though, as I said before, this will only matter in very specific circumstances).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Is there some effective way to quantify radiation capacity of stock radiators at optimal temperatures? It would be good to place a descriptive field on them (for HC) for better intercomparison between parts. I can add a part description field easily enough.\n\nGiven that heat radiation varies significantly depending on the target temperature (e.g., ~775 for M-EXP, MX-4, \u0026 MX-1, ~800 for MX-2, ~ 825 for MX-L, and potentially much higher for nuclear, ion, and plasma engines), I worry that including specific heat radiation capacity information will end up being more confusing than helpful to the average player. Perhaps we could simply describe radiation capacity in terms of an arbitrary unit where 1.0 is defined as the capacity of the Thermal Control System (small). Thus, the TCS (med) is 5, TCS (large) is 20, GR-EXP is 0.5, GR-4 is 1 ^2^/\u003Csub\u003E3\u003C/sub\u003E, and GR-1 is 10. Multiply everything by 6 if you want only whole numbers.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-04T01:55:58Z\u0022 title=\u002207/04/2015 01:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fraz86**"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-04T01:16:35Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E [Oh trust me, I know !\\[;)\\](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)](http://www.atmos-meas-tech.net/8/2699/2015/amt-8-2699-2015.html).\n\u003E It\u0027s less the theoretical BB radiation and more the effective heat removal ability.
