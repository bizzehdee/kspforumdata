The sensible thing is treat them like mobile homes; begin in LKO, with a TH-NKR and F-RRY, and have a space tug that can separate them and nudge them between orbits in Kerbin SOI. Each tug only needs a couple of thousand delta-v when attached, and that\u0027s a mid-size 2.5m tank and an efficient engine. Trying for 6 permanent stations (8, including landed on Mun/Minmus) would be prohibitively expensive. You do however get a lot of money for launching the experiments, which are easily carried. My current habit is to have a spaceplane with room for 4 kerbals, and an experiment in the cargo bay, and leave the station itself unmanned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECyclotron... now that is a beast.

This can un-dock while it stays in the flight scene. Changing to KSC and back, or F5-F9, and possibly transferring crew, removes the ability to un-dock. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- EVA\u0027d an engineer, had him activate the un-dock option manually; no joy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- un-docked, re-docked, un-docked the tug on the left (regular clamp-o-trons on both sides).

Doesn\u0027t seem to be docking port specific.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- launched a new 1.25m rocket with regular shielded clamp-o-tron. No problems docking and un-docking this from the SS lab.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- bodged a regular clamp-o-tron into a cargo bay. This port has no problems docking and un-docking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- docked spaceplane and tug rocket. These two have no problems with each other and behave as they should.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- launched a whole new lab with a different root part, and a fresh spaceplane. Problem recurs, port cannot undock from an SS lab structure, but is fine with other ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- put together an ugly rover to try out on the KSC runway; interestingly the problem does \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E occur on the ground. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWondering if it might relate to the bit in your code that is checking whether an experiment is in progress at the point something un-docks from the lab?
