It has 4 pads for landing ships, and a lot of fuel. IT IS NOT FIT ON A LAUNCH PAD! You should build a tower from tanks.\n\nIt\\\u0027s not need launchers. It can fly to the moon itself. I didn\\\u0027t try to fly to Minmus, but you can change config if you need more fuel. Have fun!\n\n[![a920daafb2c2517017a155cee31cb79c.jpeg](http://i34.fastpic.ru/big/2012/0525/9c/a920daafb2c2517017a155cee31cb79c.jpeg)](http://fastpic.ru/)\n\n**Planned features in 1.1:**\n\nMonorail(will be animated if somebody tell me how to make it)\n\nConfig fixes\n\nHotel\n\nBigger landing pads\n\nSome other buildings\n\n**1.1 release soon!**\n\n[http://www./?hyt329m9838so6l](http://www./?hyt329m9838so6l)"},{"CreatedByName":"GabrielG.A.B.Fonseca","CreatedById":13436,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-25T18:48:39Z","Content":"Nice one, Vlad.
