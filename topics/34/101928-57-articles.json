Any thoughts? If I just drop the parts on the ground they eventually just blow up.\n\nHi Rottielover,\n\nThe issue is that there are new settings for how you attach things on the ground. MeCripp figured out that you need to modify the Saddle to look like this:\n\nMODULE\n\n{\n\n name = ModuleKISItem\n\n volumeOverride = 100\n\n stackable = true\n\n allowPartAttach = 2\n\n allowStaticAttach = 1\n\n}\n\nI\u0027ll have a that change in the next update of Pathfinder.\n\nMeanwhile, I have a different issue. I\u0027m using KIS 1.2.0 and KAS 0.5.3. First, here is my base. \n\n![suPmhnZ.png](http://i.imgur.com/suPmhnZ.png)\n\nPathfinder relies heavily upon KIS/KAS for assembly; I\u0027m enjoying building my mod around KIS/KAS. Anyway, you can see that I\u0027ve attached batteries, solar panels, and using the ModuleKISPartMount, I\u0027ve attached a crew transfer tube (essentially a modified connector port) and two Chuckwagon inflatable storage modules. What I\u0027m trying to do is set up a second Ponderosa and attach it to the first via crew transfer tube. Bill is having a problem though, and cannot pull the Ponderosa from its mounting rack:\n\n![1AA0Yor.png](http://i.imgur.com/1AA0Yor.png)\n\nFrom the looks of it, KIS is looking at the already setup base instead of the part that is attached to the landing craft, and incorrectly determining that it has parts attached to it and thus cannot be carried. I tried pulling all the parts off of the established base but I get the same error. You can find my log [here](http://www.spellflight.com/KSP/KSP.log), though I didn\u0027t see anything that was reported by KIS to the effect that I have parts attached.\n\nI think the steps to reproduce this are:\n\n1. make sure your ship has two SM-62 mounts on the ship and two SC-62 containers.\n\n2. Grab one of the SC-62 containers and carry it. Then Grab the empty SM-62 and mount it on, say, a slab attached to the ground.\n\n3. Mount a SC-62 to the SM-62 that is attached to that slab. Then attach a battery to the SC-62.\n\n4. Back to the ship, try grabbing the other SC-62.\n\nEdit: I tried this again and here is what I see in the logs when the icon turns red while trying to grab the Ponderosa attached to the ship:\n\n[LOG 08:48:44.378] [FLIGHT GLOBALS]: Switching To Vessel Bill Kerman ---------------------- \n\n[LOG 08:48:44.382] stage manager resuming...\n\n[LOG 08:48:44.385] [KIS] Part detection stopped\n\n[LOG 08:48:47.937] [KIS] Equip item KIS.electricScrewdriver\n\n[LOG 08:48:57.081] [KIS] Part detection started\n\n[LOG 08:49:02.032] [KIS] Part detection stopped\n\n[LOG 08:49:03.555] [PlanetariumCamera]: Focus: Mun\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-13T21:21:31Z\u0022 title=\u002207/13/2015 09:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Angel-125**"},{"CreatedByName":"rottielover","CreatedById":73403,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T17:19:49Z","Content":"Thanks Angel!
