I assume you are using something like Dijkstra\u0027s algorithm or a brute-force search to find connections between satellites, but have you considered spreading this search out over a wide time frame? I\u0027m sure you have to do this to some extent, but as the most recent test showed, a high density constellation can wreak havok. So, I suggest a sort of \u0027searching for signal\u0027 state for a ship/satellite indicated by a flashing Antenna Range icon. During this time it is pinging all satellites within range who report whether or not they have a path back to Kerbin, and caches the results. Depending on network traffic this might be quick, or if a lot of satellites are in this state, it might take much longer. Once it finds one that reports a path back to Kerbin, it applies a timestamp and a reliability rating. The rating is basically an \u0027uptime\u0027, how often, when asked, it has been a successful path. When it comes time to recalculate, it can priority search reliable and known good connections first and dump any low reliability, missing or just ignored options. This should avoid, to some degree, complex constellations going \u0027bananas\u0027 and in it\u0027s own way rewards building said constellations since high reliability connections back to Kerbin are prioritized over jumping across random craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suggest suspending operations during high time warp, as a drawback a lot of ships might have to drop into searching for signal once you\u0027ve exited, but any high traffic zones: ie: constellations, should come back online quickly enough that it would be a minor nuisance if at all.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-26T14:04:52Z\u0022 title=\u002205/26/2015 02:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Hyomoto\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"toadicus","CreatedById":67745,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T16:58:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Edwerntz\u003C/strong\u003E, and anyone else noticing that LOS is required whether you ask for it or not, give this build a shot: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://ksp.hawkbats.com/AntennaRange/AntennaRange-dev.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E[zip]\u003C/a\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022http://ksp.hawkbats.com/AntennaRange/AntennaRange-dev.tar.gz\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E[tar.gz]\u003C/a\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022http://ksp.hawkbats.com/AntennaRange/AntennaRange-dev.tar.xz\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E[tar.xz]\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHyomoto\u003C/strong\u003E, individual resolution searches don\u0027t traverse the entire network at all; I use a \u0022lazy\u0022 resolution that naturally takes up to \u0022D\u0022 frames to resolve, where \u0022D\u0022 is the number of relays in the longest chain that must all depend on the next one in line.

You can notice the \u0022lazy\u0022 in action when a relay that was a \u0022destination\u0022 relay e.g. was making a link from a more distant relay to Kerbin becomes occluded; for 1 frame it will target Kerbin and report no connection and the previous \u0022source\u0022 vessel will target Kerbin and report a connection, in the next frame it will target the previous \u0022source\u0022 vessel and report a connection, resulting in a sort of \u0022flicker\u0022 appearance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis whole thing runs at O(n\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2), and not all checks are performed for every stop in the loop because I discard potential targets as aggressively as possible. Were I to do a path all the way back to Kerbin for each relay using something like Dijkstra\u0027s, I\u0027m pretty sure it would be O(n\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B3). But, by being lazy, I don\u0027t need to bother traversing the whole network for any given relay because momentary incorrectness on the order of 8-33 milliseconds is an acceptable delay for this kind of mechanic in this kind of game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL;DR: to answer \u0022have you considered spreading this search out over a wide time frame?\u0022: yes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe search will naturally resolve over the course of 1 or more frames as necessary based on the depth of the network. I have also considered spreading it over an even wider time frame, e.g. only running the check on one vessel per frame, effectively making the responsiveness of the network on the order of t * N * D, where \u0022t\u0022 is the Update time in Unity (usually 8 to 33 milliseconds), \u0022N\u0022 is the number of relays, and \u0022D\u0022 is the depth of the longest chain in the network. For a game with 20 relays and a deepest chain of 4, that would put the worst-case resolution delay at around 2.5 seconds, whereas currently the delay is t * D. Relay chain depth is realistically limited to 3 or 4; it\u0027s very uncommon to see a chain longer than that for any reason (at least in my experience). I like a responsiveness on the order of 132 ms much better than 2.5 seconds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be pretty easy for me to have relays go straight back to Kerbin if they can do so; basically just put the \u0022can I talk to Kerbin?\u0022 check before the per-relay vessel loop instead of after, and skip the loop entirely if so. I could then resolve most networks in only slightly worse than O(n), because at any given time odds are good that most relays can talk straight back to Kerbin. But, I think people like seeing relays going through chains to talk to other relays on their way back to Kerbin -- even if it\u0027s not the most realistic representation, I think it feels more \u0022fun\u0022. Since charge use isn\u0027t modeled on the other relays, the cost of a chain isn\u0027t really relevant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn some respects, it would be cool to model charge use along the chain, and there are a few mod tools out there to do so, but it\u0027s a high-cost operation on my end for what feels like very little reward. Since transmission happens outside the simulation anyway (it\u0027s tied to real-time seconds, not simulation seconds), all it would really do is penalize the player by making them spin more at time warp waiting for the transmission to finish. That\u0027s already tedious, and I\u0027d rather not make it more so just for the sake of \u0022realism\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuestions for you: are you recommending such consideration because there is a change in behavior or performance you\u0027d specifically like to see?

You could just the above ranges, as below:\u003Cp\u003ECommunotron 16: Increase range to Kerbin\u0027s SOI\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComms DTS: Increase range to Duna\u0027s SMA \u002B Kerbin\u0027s SMA, allowing it to be used for all \u0022inner system\u0022 missions\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECommunotron 88-88: Change range to ~1.5x Eeloo\u0027s SMA\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWouldn\u0027t this be functionally almost the same as the additive option, except that the non-additive approach wouldn\u0027t require a matching antenna in Kerbin orbit (which seems like a rather trivial difference)? The end result, in both cases, is a progression from Kerbin SOI -\u0026gt; inner planets -\u0026gt; outer planets, which feels intuitive and well balanced.
