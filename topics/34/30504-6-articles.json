The difference is way more than saving 2k from the extra config file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESay I have 5 tanks that are all textured with identical textures, just rescaled to the size of the part. If those parts are installed, KSP loads each part in its entirety on every load of the game. If they\u0027re separate parts, that same tank texture is reloaded five times into five separate memory spaces. If it\u0027s a 100k texture, that\u0027s half a meg of memory overhead for the 5 tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the 0.20 system, a part can contain multiple scales of the same texture, \u003Cem\u003Ewhich only loads once\u003C/em\u003E. Redoing my five tanks to be a single .cfg with part variations defined within reduces my memory overhead from 500k to 100k. That\u0027s a significant improvement. Look at B9 Aerospace -- by using the new methods, they shaved something like 45 megs off their texture load overhead. The new method greatly improves KSP\u0027s memory usage, which is vital to those of us who use a lot of mods and therefore are running up against the 32-bit memory allocation limit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dimovski","CreatedById":53976,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-04T19:20:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou DO realize I know that, dont you?

What I misunderstood was how GDb orders its loading operations. I was under the impression that the part/cfg level loading was done first, and then it loaded textures/sounds/etc within a given part framework, but said textures/sounds/etc could be referenced independently from the part/cfg file structure (i.e. part002 could reference part001\u0027s texture, and there wouldn\u0027t be a need to have that texture duplicated in each part folder it was used in, as was necessary before). Which, if it were true, means that Catsun\u0027s plan saved disk space, but not program memory overhead; only organizing into a single part/cfg would save memory. Ergo, I thought you didn\u0027t realize that the change actually would have substance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, after further review, that\u0027s not how it works. It loads all the assets first, then parses the part/cfg files by looking at the cross-links to the loaded assets within those cfgs. So all you have to do is keep your textures/sounds within the new GameData structure and re-reference within the part .cfg files to get both the disk space and the system memory benefits. So in fact you\u0027re correct, and it doesn\u0027t have an impact at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo my bad.
