I\u0027ve seen allot of people that have the issue you describe and it is always due to either having Fractal\u0027s version for .23.5 installed or improperly trying to install WaveFunction\u0027s version by overwriting.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, got the issue fixed by installing the experimental. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Akira_R\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Akira_R\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESince Fractal has been MIA for months now WaveFunction has essentially taken over development, his experimental version is the only one that works on .24, and he is now working on a v.12 that he will release on a new thread essentially as a new fork of Interstellar, and he is making allot of optimization changes and large over all balance adjustments from what I understand. I know that one of the changes he is making is TweakScale support, this way instead of having 4 different versions of the same reactors you have one that you can tweak from .625 up to 3.75, maybe even 5m if he decides to add that, and all the power output and resource stuff adjusts accordingly, this will save on part clutter and RAM, but it will also break any ships in your save that have the reactors on them, you will have to rebuild them if you update.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022undercoveryankee\u0022 data-cite=\u0022undercoveryankee\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWave\u0027s next planned release of Interstellar replaces families of similar parts in different sizes with single parts with TweakScale support.
