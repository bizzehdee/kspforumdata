It already has a full-featured MFD and implementation for all the major standard gauge types. It\u0027s perfectly usable and has a number of items never implemented in RPM. It really just needs IVA makers.\n\nI\u0027m hoping to create some, but I\u0027d never done an IVA before, so I expect it\u0027ll be very slow going for me. MAS is worth it, though. I can\u0027t run RPM well anymore due to the hit on frame rate when running with my other mods - if someone \\*does\\* pick up RPM for further dev, I really hope they optimize or re-write it to be faster."}]}
