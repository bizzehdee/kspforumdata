It covers all of the new ARM parts, as well as the parts you need to make all 3 of the currently proposed booster options. I\u0027ve also tweaked a few of the RealEngines aside from that - like for those that want to use proper thrusters for the Orion SM (repurposed/respecced one of the many 1kN engines in the RE pack) and alternative configs for some RCS modules. I\u0027m about to do a full fresh install of the required RO mods, required mod packs for the various base engines, and the \u0022latest\u0022 RealEngines, to ensure that my modded parts and the corrections to RealEngines that I\u0027ve made will work on a totally fresh install and that I\u0027ve not missed anything, and then I\u0027ll be sending it to Nathan for distribution/testing as desired - it\u0027s still not totally polished, and I expect there will be some problems that I\u0027ve not gotten to test out yet, but I\u0027m going to be away on a sailboat delivery for the next couple weeks so I wanted to get at least something out there before I took off \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-26T04:57:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWoopert: You\u0027ll want to create a custom TANK_DEFINITION with a lower basemass and/or lower masses for the propellants used.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, make sure that your entire core is in fact light; I have set RF tank mass to account for some of the mass of other components (guidance, interstage, ducting, etc) so while the tanks themselves will be heavier per m^3, the stage should be ok (I hope).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt has nothing to do with Stretchy or PP since RF sets the mass of parts itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERaccoonTOF: awesome!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would suggest dropping RedAV8R a line, since he\u0027s also been working on SLS stuff (although in that case the payload and DCSS, not the launcher).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mar117117","CreatedById":108311,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-26T19:57:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei am having problems with remote tech. i seem to be able to comunicate interplanetary with reflectrons, basically. any ideas?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RaccoonTOF","CreatedById":84116,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-27T09:07:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not really touching the DCSS/ICPS/SM stuff except for a couple engine tweaks as mentioned above, just to ensure that the total vehicle delta-V numbers match up with those projected for the real life options - just enough to allow me to test the core/boosters really.

Frizzank then modeled his own Saturn V and IB for FASA, DennyTX also modeled his own Saturn V as well with the OLDD pack. The CSM and LEM are newer/better versions (IMO) than what is in the FASA pack as well...When it comes to the Saturn V each has their own strengths and weaknesses. Due to the modelling by Frizzank, I was actually able to get scaling to RL better than some of the OLDD models, configs should be near identical though...If your computer can handle it, I\u0027d recommend both, try them out, and see what you like, you can always delete parts of either pack you don\u0027t like and keep the rest.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpacedInvader","CreatedById":106018,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-01T11:51:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot going to jump straight into calling this one an error, but with your configs installed, the node position for the LEM deployment device is such that the plate is only a few inches from the bottom of the engine bell.
