When you get down to it, an unlivable space would cause low morale, and as the space degrades, it would also cause morale to drop.  This way you can still require \u003Cappropriate resource=\u0022\u0022\u003E to still maintain vehicles, you still maintain the mechanic, but you also eliminate the concept of things wearing out.\n\u003C/appropriate\u003E\n\nWhile the concept of things never actually wearing out is unrealistic, it\u0027s kind of essential to KSP with your approach to USI-LS, as you don\u0027t kill kerbals by default (unlike TAC-LS), which means things wearing out and breaking shouldn\u0027t occur because that\u0027s the equivalent of killing structures.  It\u0027s definitely a feature that could be enabled, but one that\u0027s off by default.\n\nWhat\u0027s not sitting well with me is that I am no longer in control of when things need to be replaced, as the habitation mechanic is usurping that control (as I currently understand it).  That will creates more unnecessary work, whereas a morale mechanic makes sense, as that\u0027s a direction that things should go, and (to me at least) fits with the general USI-LS approach to life support.  The other advantage to morale is (for vanilla at least) happier scientists can get a productivity bonus to the mobile processing lab, and that mechanic also works well with the various productivity mechanics of UKS.\n\nThe creation of uncessary work is also why I recently pulled Remote Tech from my mod install, as it was making pre-communication network gameplay less fun that I really wanted it to be because you need to be high enough in the tech tree to get the solar panels so you can loft the satellites to geostationary orbit, which basically added too much busywork, and it\u0027s something I\u0027d like to avoid as there\u0027s enough stuff to do with the various USI mods as it is.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-20T01:06:46Z\u0022 title=\u002201/20/2016 01:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 20, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by almagnus1**"},{"CreatedByName":"crash087","CreatedById":151606,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-20T01:17:23Z","Content":"is anyone else seeing an issue where new ships launched dont show up in the Life support menu? the two space stations i have show how much supply is left, but the ships im launching now dont even show up, even though they have the mini life support packs attached (i also tried putting them in the seat inventories but nothing changed)"}]}
