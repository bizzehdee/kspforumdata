It is not an intrinsic property of the aircraft. Some aircraft (in real life most, in Kerbal few) are built with the wings angled up a bit relative to the nose; these aircraft might be said to have a bit of \u0022built-in\u0022 AoA, but the actual AoA is still that of the geometric relationship between the airflow and the wings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe air deflection created by AoA is the primary lift force, and the lift provided by this deflection is always opposite to the direction in which air is deflected. So in normal flight, with the nose a few degrees above the airflow (positive AoA), the aircraft is lifted up. If the nose is moved to a few degrees below the airflow (negative AoA), the aircraft will be pushed down. This all works exactly the same when you invert an aircraft, with the sole exception that \u0022a few degrees above the airflow\u0022 now requires you to push the stick forwards instead of backwards. The direction of lift isn\u0027t fixed relative to the aircraft, or to the planet; it is the opposite of the direction of air deflection, whatever that direction is. The only thing \u0022negative\u0022 about the AoA used for level inverted flight is that it is in the opposite direction (relative to the aircraft) to that used in normal flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat a cambered wing does is to enhance that force a bit by increasing the deflection of the air. But unlike the AoA, the camber actually is a physical property of the aircraft. And because wings are only cambered in one direction at a time, that does have a fixed direction relative to the aircraft (not the planet; neither effect here is related to \u0022up\u0022 in the gravitional sense). Camber works like an upside-down racing spoiler, and if you invert a normally cambered wing, the camber will start to push down, just as an inverted racing spoiler would push up. But the effect of camber is a small percentage of the effect of normal AoA-driven air deflection, and is easily counteracted by marginally increasing the AoA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAircraft with wings, with or without symmetric or asymmetric wing camber, fly inverted just fine.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Val","CreatedById":126227,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T09:43:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022JaredTheDragon\u0022 data-cite=\u0022JaredTheDragon\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENo, most old planes could NOT adjust their AoA and had no mechanisms at all in their wings to do so.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou are confusing terms.
