Some other parts use them, too. (Recyclers, like you mentioned).\n\nWhen you are looking at a part in-game (on a vessel, not in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E) any part that has ReplacementParts as a resource will show a little \u0022Wear xx.x%\u0022 message when right-clicked. All parts that have this little message are maintained by having an engineer EVA and perform maintenance. You need to have MaterialKits either on board a part on that vessel or in a nearby vessel (I believe the range is 150m). The game will take MaterialKits from storage, magically turn them into ReplacementParts, then put those into the part you are repairing. The \u0022Wear\u0022 percentage when the part is right-clicked will then be reset.\n\nAs you mentioned, you will have two \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS setting files if you have both UKS and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS. The game will give the UKS ones preference. Basically, it\u0027s set up that, if you only have \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS, you don\u0027t have to worry about wear (since \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS doesn\u0027t give you any way to store MaterialKits) but with UKS plus \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS, wear is enabled, since you have all of the tools necessary to deal with it.\n\nYou shouldn\u0027t need to edit configs to remove ReplacementParts from any parts since any part that has them can be maintained by the method described above."},{"CreatedByName":"LatiMacciato","CreatedById":165597,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-18T07:12:57Z","Content":"well one question remains for me .. is there any way to check the wear status of any station/base/vessel? .. all parts in 1 display or something .. or base wear-out status etc?"},{"CreatedByName":"Merkov","CreatedById":165068,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-18T08:56:12Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, LatiMacciato said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E well one question remains for me .. is there any way to check the wear status of any station/base/vessel? .. all parts in 1 display or something .. or base wear-out status etc?\n\u003E \n\nNot that I know of... I THINK TriggerAu\u0027s Alternate Resource Panel mod actually displays ReplacementParts for the whole vessel (although that MIGHT be because I have been messing with configs a lot in my install...) but even that doesn\u0027t really help you much, since it wouldn\u0027t tell you if one part was more worn than another. The only real way is to right click individual parts and check them. Remember, you don\u0027t have to check every single part on board a vessel. No engines or fuel tanks or anything like that have them. Only crewed parts and then some USK/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS parts. Not too many to have to check.\n\nAnother thing to remember is that you don\u0027t need to worry too much about wear. Parts can last for a long time (years) before they need maintenance. That \u00220.000001\u0022 you found is how many ReplacementParts get consumed each second. If I remember right, that works out to ~10 ReplacementParts being consumed on a module per kerbal year. Since most parts have 100\u002B ReplacementParts when you launch them, you have a long time before you need to worry about them.\n\nAnother little option: The MK-V Inflatable Workshop and the UKS Orbital Workshop will automatically do maintenance on parts that need it as long as it is manned by an engineer (and there are MaterialKits available). That way, you don\u0027t even need to worry about EVAing and looking for parts with wear."},{"CreatedByName":"LatiMacciato","CreatedById":165597,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-18T09:02:10Z","Content":"awesome, so this UKS Orbital Workshop is checking all parts that are worn (even after year(s)) or just surrounding as the description says?\n\n.. im very looking forward to the upcoming things (KSP and mods), very excited to see, hehe"},{"CreatedByName":"Merkov","CreatedById":165068,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-18T09:06:50Z","Content":"It will perform regular maintenance on all parts that use the wear mechanic on that vessel, or on vessels within 150m of it.

For that, I\u0027ve been using TAC Life Support, because it goes along better with how I view what the system should be like. However, there\u0027s something that might be a problem and I\u0027m wondering if anyone knowledgeable on the subject could chime in here.\n\nRecently, I noticed that \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E Life Support had managed to make it\u0027s way into my install. Might have been a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E slip-up or something. Anyways, I noticed things were a problem when my Kerbals became tourists inside my space station. I found that super strange, because I didn\u0027t expect to have USILS installed... but sure enough, one of my viewers on YouTube chimed in and told me, and he was right. I had it in there.\n\nSo I promptly removed \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E LS, and everything appears to be back to normal, after moving my Kerbals back to Kerbin and bringing them back up almost in one piece (RIP Bartmund Kerman). However, my Debug is showing lots of NREs now, and I get regular skips in frame no matter what craft I\u0027m controlling, even unmanned vessels. The NREs are not very helpful in their description, but they started popping up right after this event happened. I\u0027ve asked in a few other areas of the forum because of ideas that it could be another of those mods, but if you think you could take a look at [this log file](https://www.dropbox.com/s/bklwjy2n3m8tb4e/output_log.txt?dl=0) and see what the issue might be, I\u0027d appreciate anyone\u0027s time wholeheartedly. \n\nI also see this in my Debug window now as well, in addition to all the NREs.\n\nSpoiler\n\n[Error]: Cannot find a Module of typename \u0027LifeSupportScenario\u0027  \n\n[Error]: ScenarioModule is null.\n\nThank you for your valuable time."}]}
