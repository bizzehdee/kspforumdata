So looks like you found the Classic Bobcat Parachute part and it\u0027s wrecking your space program ( That\u0027s what it does ). We admit that the label \u0022 \\* Danger \\* \u0022 on the part is not sufficient to properly explain what is going on.\n\nEssentially we were supposed to remove that nose cone however as an oversight it was left in the parts bag. With 1.0.4 it not only doesnt work, it breaks things after you try to use it. \n\nSO! Orion has a customized parachute solution which you will find in the craft files. It\u0027s pretty easy to make, and we should have included this quick instruction booklet with it however that was left out as well.\n\nAn Action ticket for removal of that part and inclusion of the Quick Instructional Booklet has been created and your tracking Monkeynumber is 464-2927A\n\nUntil then, here\u0027s a quick reference guide to surviving a flight with the Chaka version of Bobcat\u0027s Orion capsule in 1.0.4\n\n**Chaka Orion Direct Attach Parachute Assembly and Quick Start Guide** **** **TM**\n\n![FyHszI.jpg](http://imageshack.com/a/img673/741/FyHszI.jpg)\n![a2UAE6.jpg](http://imageshack.com/a/img537/814/a2UAE6.jpg)\n\n![pjKGjE.jpg](http://imageshack.com/a/img661/7637/pjKGjE.jpg)\n\n![G3OkJH.jpg](http://imageshack.com/a/img673/6175/G3OkJH.jpg)\n\n![h7lIQN.jpg](http://imageshack.com/a/img673/3685/h7lIQN.jpg)\n\n![vDrLdp.jpg](http://imageshack.com/a/img540/8984/vDrLdp.jpg)\n\n![NKVMMe.jpg](http://imageshack.com/a/img540/2100/NKVMMe.jpg)\n\n![icaSY6.jpg](http://imageshack.com/a/img537/5655/icaSY6.jpg)\n\n![euOTwz.jpg](http://imageshack.com/a/img537/8567/euOTwz.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T00:12:38Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E OK, perhaps a stupid question, but I downloaded this pack today, and I both love it and hate it.\n\u003E Its gorgeous.

I tried deleting everything once, and I kept getting stuck when creating new vehicles and finding that I do in fact need an I-beam or that stock solar panel would work okay here\n\nThere\u0027s a question of game style buried in this.\n\nI don\u0027t use IVAs much, maybe cockpit views only, but they can use a lot of RAM and soak up clock cycles in rendering. It\u0027s partly large, sharply-detailed, textures, partly the mesh files.\n\nSimilarly, some items have to be more complicated than others. Open girder structures need far more polygons than a simple tube and that increases the rendering cost. The rendering process is also more complicated\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20ACthat open girder has parts blocking the line of sight to other parts of the same component.\n\nI have a few such parts which also switch between different physical fuel tank meshes. I am not sure if the in-flight views are using data structures that include the invisible components, and how the render-engine handles them.\n\nI\u0027ve been doing some of the CGI stuff for a long time. I still see people using meshes that are so densely structured that, in a wireframe view, lines are so close together as to seem like a solid surface. Maybe you need that to produce a high-res picture of a Mercury capsule in orbit (there are some other techniques that could simplify the mesh for that) but it cripples the live animation for a game.\n\nAnyway, stock parts are created with an awareness of the trade-offs. Some mods use parts that get seriously over-complicated. You can choose not to use complex girder structure, and delete the particular parts. IVAs don\u0027t look so easy. The part.cfg can be modified by Module Manager to remove the references to the IVA, but you have to deal with the correct files so they\u0027re not loaded by the game. And several IVAs often use the same sub-components.\n\nI\u0027ve also seen alternative textures in sub-folders that end up in GameData. That\u0027s grabbing a bit of precious RAM. It\u0027s the downside of using tools such as Texture Replacer.\n\nIn the end, I cut down on Spaceplane-oriented Mods for my current game. Disk space is cheap, so I can have a parallel complete install without 5m boosters. And that style/theme choice could allow some of the stock wings and air-breathers to be deleted.\n\nI think I shall have to do such things until a reliable 64-bit Windows version is available. I hear good reports of Linux, but I still seem to need an ancient version of Internet Explorer to reliably deal with the brave new world of government IT my country is entering.\n\nSince CMES is using parts from several different sources, it\u0027s a bit of a hostage to fortune. No names, but I have had bad experiences of one of the Mods, and when it reaches a formal upgrade, and likely enters CMES, life could get messy. As you say, CMES is already a heavy pack."},{"CreatedByName":"ebphoto","CreatedById":144831,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T15:59:51Z","Content":"I was just going through all the different launch systems in the download and I was wondering if you could tell me what the XLS Transfer Vehicle I, II and III are used for?

This would mean that in the next update we could do away with the need for nesting the red parachute. A few tweaks to the final descent rate will make this config simply the best it has ever been.\n\nPlease join us in expressing our appreciation to V8jester for sorting this!\n\n\u003E \n\u003E YANFRET,\n\u003E I fixed the triple chute for myself.

Yeah, I\u0027ve tried just about everything...starting a fresh install, JUST installing CMES and the newest version of RPM and it still happens, so glad to see this was confirmed. At least it doesn\u0027t seem to interfere with any ship mechanics or anything, just seems to be a weird visual bug. Today, I spotted a new one similar to this while I was sending a rover to Duna. Instead of the helmet rack, I noticed a white circle floating in space like the rack did, it just looks like a flat white plate. Usually after warping to a maneuver node, I\u0027ll see this white circle object fly away rapidly, then eventually re-appear. I just removed the ASET folder containing the props and the RPM folder because I never use IVA anyway so we\u0027ll see if that fixes it."},{"CreatedByName":"YANFRET","CreatedById":90547,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-02T21:15:54Z","Content":"**Action Ticket Resolved!**\n\nObviously we will be doing an update, but until then you can replace \n\nCMES/Pod/ALCOR\\_Monkey\\_Rover/Spaces/ALCORE\\_Monkey\\_Internals/ALCORMonkeyInternals.mu with\n\n[**this one**](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ba9kitfvve4x82l/ALCORMonkeyInternals.mu?dl=0)\n\nSpecial thanks again to Alex Ustas for supporting Monkey exploration!!"}]}
