To do this, you\u0027ll need [Blizzy78\u0027s Toolbar mod](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/60863).\n\n**Contributing**\n\nSince we don\u0027t support all the mods that add engines, we\u0027re always looking for contributors to help attach plumes to engines. The process itself is very easy. Start out with a regular RealPlume install, with Blizzy\u0027s Toolbar installed as well.\n\n1. Make a .cfg file for your engine with this text in it:\n\n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E {  \n\u003E  @MODULE[ModuleEngines\\*]  \n\u003E  {  \n\u003E  @name = ModuleEnginesFX  \n\u003E  %powerEffectName = Kerolox-Lower  \n\u003E  }  \n\u003E  PLUME  \n\u003E  {  \n\u003E  name = Kerolox-Lower  \n\u003E  transformName = thrustTransform  \n\u003E  localRotation = 0,0,0  \n\u003E  localPosition = 0,0,-0.15  \n\u003E  fixedScale = 0.5  \n\u003E  energy = 1  \n\u003E  speed = 1  \n\u003E  }  \n\u003E }\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E     @PART[partname]:FOR[RealPlume]:NEEDS[SmokeScreen]\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\nLaunch the game, and put your engine on the pad upside down.  \nOpen the SmokeScreen config tool and adjust the parameters in the PLUME nodes to size and position the plume to the part.  \nCopy those parameters back to the config created in step 1 and hit save.  \n\nAnd you\u0027re done! Submit them as a Pull Request to the RealPlume-StockConfigs repository, and you\u0027re good to go!\n\nFor more detailed instructions, [check out this Wiki Page on Adding a Plume to an Engine](https://github.com/KSP-RO/RealPlume/wiki/Adding-a-Plume-to-an-Engine), or just ask in the thread and we\u0027ll help you out!\n\nLicense:\n\nCC-BY-NC-SA\n\n***Changelog:***\n\n\u003E \n\u003E DerpyFirework added or updated support for the following mods:\n\u003E \n\u003E Pheonix Industries - Boosters CTN\n\u003E \n\u003E SpaceY Expanded\n\u003E \n\u003E Tareobee\n\u003E \n\u003E Taurus HCV\n\u003E \n\u003E TantaresLV\n\u003E \n\u003E nanuschao added support for:\n\u003E \n\u003E Space Shuttle Program Mod\n\u003E \n\u003E Randazzo added support for:\n\u003E \n\u003E Custom Clusters\n\u003E \n\u003E Some minor tweaks to plume appearance.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n\u003E \n\u003E CryoEngines is now supported\n\u003E \n\u003E RLA Stockalike is now supported\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n\u003E \n\u003E Change atmospheric scaling based on solar system.\n\u003E \n\u003E Adjusted placement of effects for non-VSR stock engines\n\u003E \n\u003E Added support for BTSM\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n\u003E \n\u003E NHawks17 edition!\n\u003E \n\u003E Fixed Turbojet emissives\n\u003E \n\u003E Added support for KSPX\n\u003E \n\u003E Added support for new solids in SpaceY\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n\u003E \n\u003E Fixed NonVSR mainsail plume placement\n\u003E \n\u003E Updated hydrogen ntr nerva plume placement to match new particles. \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n\u003E \n\u003E Added plume to stock LES.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n\u003E \n\u003E Improved plume placement and sizing on several packs\n\u003E \n\u003E Added support for the following:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E - SXT\n\u003E - Tantares\n\u003E - AIES\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n\u003E \n\u003E Some plume improvements\n\u003E \n\u003E Added support for:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E - Tundra Exploration SpaceX Stockalike\n\u003E - Modular Rocket System\n\u003E - Completed SpaceY Lifters\n\u003E - Procedural Parts SRB\n\u003E - Atomic Age Nuclear Rockets\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n\u003E \n\u003E Initial release, supported mod packs:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E - AB Launchers\n\u003E - FASA\n\u003E - KW Rocketry\n\u003E - SpaceY Lifters\n\u003E - Squad\n\u003E - Tantares LV\n\u003E - Ven\u0027s Stock Revamp\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-08T00:47:12Z\u0022 title=\u002210/08/2015 12:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Felger**\n  \nRelease 0.8.1"},{"CreatedByName":"Mitchz95","CreatedById":82292,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-19T05:48:27Z","Content":"This looks amazing.
