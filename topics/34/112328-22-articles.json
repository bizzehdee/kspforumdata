That being said, [Kerbal Animation Suite](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/117663-113) has all the tools required to create animations. But it has some limitations, and one of those is that it currently does not work with the IVA Kerbal animations, which are completely different to how the EVA animations works (which it does support). I did do some work on getting it to work on IVA animations and did pass that info on. Then for a long time Kerbal Animation Suite kinda went into suspended animation - maybe it got DeepFreeze\u0027d (sic). So I kind of dropped it altogether. But recently I see it got udpated again. So in \\*theory\\* it could be done. Making Kerbal monster animations. But that would take a lot of time, and unfortunately, I don\u0027t see it as a priority. If I had unlimited time, or if modding actually put food on the table for my family and paid the bills and mortgage then I\u0027d be more than happy to. As it stands.
