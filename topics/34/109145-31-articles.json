The first part lets any vessel (under 10 tonnes, I believe) with the Dropship Cockpit ferry resources between two vessels/bases that are landed within 2 km of the dropship. The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E Karibou rover does the same thing. The second part rebalances/reconfigures the Mk2 reactor to behave like a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E one. Basically, it\u0027s stats are the same as the 1.25 m \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E one (since the mk2 profile is basically a 1.25 m tube that tapers out on either end, I didn\u0027t think there would be any more useful space in there for more reactor) but it still keeps the radiator and lifting body. As a penalty, it is a little bit heavier and more expensive. The patch does not apply if NFE is installed for two reasons: one, you already have a NFE compatibility patch, and two, NFE modifies (or used to modify, anyway) \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E reactors to behave like NFE ones. No point in overriding that. \n\nThe \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS patch for M2X is even smaller: \n\n    @PART[M2X_SmallLab]NEEDS:[USILifeSupport]FOR:[Mk2Expansion]\n    //Adds a life support recycler to the Mk2 Science Lab. Supports fewer kerbals and less efficient than stock lab.\n    {\n    MODULE{\tname = ModuleLifeSupportRecycler\tCrewCapacity = 3\tRecyclePercent = .4\tConverterName = Life Support\ttag = Life Support\tStartActionName = Start Life Support\tStopActionName = Stop Life SupportINPUT_RESOURCE\t{\t\tResourceName = ElectricCharge\t\tRatio = 1\t}}\n    \n    }\n\nThe only thing I\u0027ve done is added a life support recycler (which, in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS world reduces a kerbal\u0027s life support resource consumption rate) to the Mk2 science lab. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS adds similar functionality to the stock lab, so this was pretty straightforward. When I do the M3X version, it will be significantly more efficient than this one, which is slightly less efficient than the stock one. \n\nPart of the problem with the Mk2 profile when it comes to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS is the concept of habitation/living space. The idea is that a kerbal can\u0027t reasonably stay sane for months on end locked up in a Mk1 command pod for months on end, so the mod imposes a 7.5 day-per-seat limit, with a few parts being dedicated to habitation (the stock hitchhiker is one. It seats 4, but it\u0027s so large that it could conceivably have crew quarters dedicated to longer-term expeditions). Mk2 parts tend to be pretty cramped, though, so it\u0027s hard to make a case for which, if any, should allow kerbals to take longer voyages. The Mk2 crew cabin has airline seating; not the way you\u0027d want to spend a month-long voyage. The best thing I can think of would probably be something the size of the stock Mk2 crew cabin, but with only capacity for 1 kerbal. I think anyone who is using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS likely has to accept that the Mk2 fuselage is ill-suited for any trips outside of Kerbin\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E. \n\nLike I said before, if you decide to ship these, make sure to ping me if anyone has any issues with them. No sense in sending you a couple of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E patches and then not at least trying to support them. \n\nThanks!"},{"CreatedByName":"Warezcrawler","CreatedById":145377,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-28T12:58:15Z","Content":"[@SuicidalInsanity](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/143878-suicidalinsanity/) could I please request that you make a minor adjustment of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E arguments in you patch for ModuleResourceIntake?\n\n\u0022Mk2X\\_AtmIntake.cfg\u0022\n\nIn my mod I have an intake switch, which works like resource switching, just for intakes instead.

Regarding fuel flow cooling, that\u0027s something to ask Nertea about - my best guess from looking at NFE reactor cfgs is NFE reactors generate substantially more heat per second than is consumed when the engine is running.\n\u003E \n\nRevisiting this, and comparing your patches to the ones shipped with KerbalAtomics, yours appear to be missing the exhaustCooling field in the FissionFlowRadiator module. This would explain the complete lack of cooling from exhaust.\n\nAssuming the KerbalAtomics patches are correct (going by the author, I would expect them to be), and that the ratios translate directly to your engines:  \n\nHeatGeneration for the Rontgen is 40000, so HeatUsed should be 800, not 900. exhaustCooling should be 800 also. For maxEnergyTransfer, KerbalAtomics uses the same value as HeatGeneration, so 80000 -\u003E 40000.  \n\nPluto just needs the exhaustCooling field, in this case HeatGeneration/50 = HeatUsed = 1300.  \n\nHades \u0026 Sievert (M3X) appear to have the same reactor stats as the pluto (which seems a bit silly, but whatever), and need exhaustCooling too.\n\nAlso, as these are engines, adding FollowThrottle = true to FissionReactor may be beneficial (and save fiddling with context menus in flight).\n\nI\u0027m cobbling together a few patches ATM, will try them out with the mentioned values soon.\n\nEdit: Well, bugger me. It still doesn\u0027t work properly (still getting rapid overheats), but ~~the stock NTR with the KA provided patches behaves this way too.~~ NM, wrong ModuleEngines ![:rolleyes:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif \u0022:rolleyes:\u0022). Still appears to be no exhaust cooling at all.  \n\nGuess I\u0027ll go bug Nertea then...\n\nEd.  \n[@SuicidalInsanity](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/143878-suicidalinsanity/): Fixed it. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022) ModuleActiveRadiator on the Pluto was interfering with FissionFlowRadiator.
