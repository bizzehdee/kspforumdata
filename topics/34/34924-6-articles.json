The new Enterprise blows the other one out of the water (literally and visually), the Vengeance looks and is bad***. What some guys need to come to terms with is: it\u0027s Abrams\u0027 reboot, let him do what he wants. So far, he\u0027s done well. Just because the new ships don\u0027t fit into scale with their predecessors doesn\u0027t mean they should be completely disregarded. He (Abrams) started his reboot with a paradox that completely and totally changed the course of ST history, so don\u0027t be surprised if he goes completely off of the beaten track. He\u0027s not trying to amend to the previous generation, he\u0027s trying to present an old, worn out story for the new generation to enjoy, which requires massive changes. Also, rewritten star trek is better than no star trek.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[hijack][tangentalSoapbox]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is no coming to terms with the fact that JJ didn\u0027t care about ST to begin with; he had never even watched a TOS episode. The \u0022reboot\u0022 was b-reel for his SW aspiration (which evidently succeeded). Presenting \u0022an old, worn-out story for a new generation\u0022 (which Star Trek is FAAAAAAAAAAR from old and worn-out) does NOT require massive changes. It requires thoughtful changes, the likes of which Kurtzman and Orci apparently find abhorrent.

It definitely would have set a better stage for a better story than ITD. They should have received a Golden Raspberry for 2009.
