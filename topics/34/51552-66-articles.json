MJ is working fine too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I\u0027d really like to see is a directional target option so I can set a dish to always point away from the planet. This would allow two major improvements. One is that it means I can tell a dish to always point away from the planet which therefore always connects to whatever comsat is more or less directly overhead. I realize omnidirectional antennas do this but I have my comsat network set up at 4875km meaning the small antenna won\u0027t reach and I haven\u0027t yet researched the longer antenna. (The reason I have the network set so high is because I\u0027m using a mod which provides small, low-powered dishes with very narrow angles)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other thing this option would allow is building something akin to the deep space network, ground-based dishes strategically placed around the globe allowing a 360 degree view of the Kerbolar system. If you include another modification allowing landed craft to network with mission control as if by hard-wire (perhaps make it a part which only works while stationary on the surface).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like to avoid using the \u0022Active Craft\u0022 target as it seems a little too cheaty, and besides, if you have something pointed in your general direction but there\u0027s a moon in the way, a relay sat can pick up the transmission and bounce it around the obstacle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt first I was going to ask for a set of directional targets based on the orbit (pro-/retro-grade, etc.), but currently I can only think of a use for the \u002Bradial direction, as stated above. In fact, since \u002Bradial would differ depending on how eccentric your orbit was, a \u0022point away from currently orbited body\u0022 option would be best. (Plus you would end up with range cones sweeping across the Kerbolar system, akin to a lighthouse, and that would be damned cool)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sma","CreatedById":67377,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-26T14:31:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Cilph\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Cilph\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m back for now~ I must say, the testing team did a **** poor job.

Both are taken while the game is \u0022paused\u0022 and you can see that there is no menu.\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/0UCsmz6,NXmJfQ8#0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/0UCsmz6,NXmJfQ8#0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not quite sure what logs, if any, to post, and I\u0027ve never really posted logs before so let me know what would be helpful in fixing this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPost a description on the GitHub issue tracker and include KSP_Data/output_log.txt of a game session where the problem occurred.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
