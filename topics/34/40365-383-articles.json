Antimatter reactors are obviously more than capable of supplying such. Upgraded 3.75m fusion reactors are another good bet; my plasma-thruster based asteroid tug uses 5 of those to max out the power usage of 4 1.25m plasma thrusters, and it can take off from Kerbin under its own power using Argon propellant in drop-tanks, even with the hefty load of LiquidFuel for orbital maneuvering and Monopropellant for holding the craft straight when the asteroid starts trying to swing you around (and the substantial mass of the reactors themselves). With anything smaller and less high-tech, the power-to-weight ratio starts dropping pretty quickly, and that\u0027s what you need for high thrust-to-weight ratio with plasma thrusters, since their thrust is directly determined by the power delivered. At maximum throttle, the argon thrusters on my tug produce 2045 kN of thrust each, but that\u0027s at a power consumption of 32.9 GW* each. \u003Cp\u003EAlternately, you can start spamming power transmitters and use microwave transmission to run your plasma thrusters, which takes away a lot of the TWR issues.

Feeding a 1.25m plasma thruster 20,000 MW (20 GW) will get you exactly the same thrust and ISP as feeding a 2.5m plasma thruster 20 GW.

Increase your power generation and your maximum thrust will increase accordingly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs of right now, solar panels will only produce ElectricCharge, which cannot be turned into MegaJoules on the same vessel and thus cannot directly power a plasma thruster. You can use solar panels to power a microwave power transmission antenna, however, which will generate MegaJoules on the receiving ship. Remember that 1000 EC = 1 MJ; you need quite a lot of solar power flow for this to be useful. Lots of panels and low solar orbit is recommended for solar power stations.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nli2work","CreatedById":106805,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-24T00:18:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Darkeners\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Darkeners\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESomone can tell me:\u003Cp\u003E1) How to upgrade reactors?
