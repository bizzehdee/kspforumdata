Does Contract Configurator override stock contract generating mechanics like the weighted contracts thing?\n\u003E \n\nThe way the stock weighting system works is based on the class of the contract, and there\u0027s only one contract class in Contract Configurator (which is how it can allow a contract author to not have to write any code).  So it\u0027s turned off for Contract Configurator contracts.  Right now it still fits in with the stock generating mechanics, but in a very awkward way."},{"CreatedByName":"Honeybadga","CreatedById":64977,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-06T15:59:55Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 6 minutes ago, nightingale said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The way the stock weighting system works is based on the class of the contract, and there\u0027s only one contract class in Contract Configurator (which is how it can allow a contract author to not have to write any code).
