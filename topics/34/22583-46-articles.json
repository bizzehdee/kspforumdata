When I roate my wings with shift\u002Bwasd keys I put a cubic octagonal-strut with the opposite rotation as the wing to make it straight down, then attach landing gear to that. OR... you could be putting them on a missile or something, which creates a problem.

At that time, doing a faithful spitfire cockpit was beyond what I could do, and I wasn\u0027t into creating alternate fuselage shapes. Things have changed since then. I could do a better job on the cockpit, and I have gotten the reference material to do it well.
