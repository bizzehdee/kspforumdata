The LV-N currently has orange paint, which is the signature of Rockomax.\n\nRockomax Conglomerate uses orange, grey, and black. Not much must be changed, but perhaps an option to have the tops/bottoms of the Rockomax tanks painted orange (they are not actually flat tops, they have a rounded tankbuttlike shape.) The yellow pipe on the Poodle should be orange, and maybe a few other accents on the Poodle could be recolored.\n\nKerbodyne is sleek and white/black. I figure the tankbutts ought to be a silver or grey similarly to the stock tankbutts of the Rockomax tanks.\n\nProbodobodyne is blue and dark grey, but I don\u0027t think there\u0027s any parts that disobey this color scheme.\n\nSteadler is yellow and white with some small bits of dark grey.
