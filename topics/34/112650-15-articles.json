It just occasionally happens that solar panels don\u0027t generate any EC even tho there are no (heavy) consumers on the ship except a \u0022Comms DTS-M1\u0022. The ships have 2-4k\u002B Max EC and plenty of either SP-L1x6 or Gigantor XL Solar Arrays, all with \u0022Direct Sunlight\u0022 and \u0022Sun Exposure\u0022 above 0.9. But still \u0022Energy Flow: 0.0\u0022\n\nOn ships in space, this seems to \u0022go away\u0022 after a while, when they change their positions in orbit. But for my current lander on the Mun it didn\u0027t change even after 10\u002B days.

It would seem that the panels have to be in line of sight with Kerbol, but also the galactic center. So if the sun is blocking view to the galactic center, you don\u0027t get energy flow. I assume that the game thinks the galactic center is the sun source (although the panels show sunlight amount based on the local sun)."},{"CreatedByName":"politas","CreatedById":119649,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-18T07:01:55Z","Content":"I was looking into adding this mod to [CKAN](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100067), and there are a few issues that are making it difficult. \n\nIncluding Kopernicus with a modified config file goes against the philosophy of every mod being its own consistent pack of files, and causes installation hassles for users. Perhaps look into how [Galactic Neighborhood](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/128856) is handling the issue of re-homing the Sun/Kerbol?\n\nBetween Curse / Curseforge / Dropbox as sources for the mod and no KSPAVC or MiniAVC support, maintaining the versioning in CKAN is very difficult. I believe KerbalStuff makes it pretty easy for mod authors to do versioning well.\n\nIs there a KerbalGalaxy (1) out there? I\u0027m confused as to the need for the 2, especially given that you\u0027ve left it off your GameData sub-folder.\n\nKopernicus-based mods and some of the issues users have reported in this thread are an excellent example of why CKAN was created.
