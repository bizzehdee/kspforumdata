Here\u0027s the craft in question:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://puu.sh/6cvDe.png\u0022 alt=\u00226cvDe.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhenever I try to re-enter the atmosphere from LKO (around 100km) I end up, invariably, in a perfect 0 degree flatspin, and can\u0027t recover from it no matter what I try. I\u0027ve tried numerous angles of approach, from entering the atmosphere nose first, as the craft would fly, and when that didn\u0027t work I tried a 15 degree angle, 45 degree angle, and a 90 degree angle. Everything results in the craft tumbling out of control, then just when it seems like I might regain it, it shifts into a flat spin with the nose on the horizon and falls straight down. What am I doing wrong here? Atmospherically this craft flies like a dream, cruising right up to LKO at a 25 degree climb. I\u0027m no aerospace engineer, so any help here would be appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(I know the radiators are producing extra drag, but they\u0027re necessary so the KSPI reactors don\u0027t overheat, and since the craft flies fine from the runway to orbit, I don\u0027t think they\u0027re the issue)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ferram4","CreatedById":21328,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-07T08:28:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are a few possibilities I can think of. The first is that when you empty the cargo bay of whatever\u0027s in there and go to land it you end up with the CoM moving back enough that it becomes unstable. That would be the case if it starts to pitch up out-of-control as you hit the atmosphere. The solution is to mess with your wing design to put the CoL further back, and make sure to add more pitch control surfaces to compensate for the added stability, which will make flying it a little bit more difficult. If that doesn\u0027t work, you might have to redesign the craft so that the CoM doesn\u0027t move appreciably after te payload is deployed. Odds are you can just shrink the wing a little bit and shift it back and it\u0027ll be fine, make it look more like the wings on the Space Shuttle, which are further back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second is that you don\u0027t have enough yaw stability; if that\u0027s the case it\u0027ll start to roll out-of-control before tumbling. Basically, the lift of a wing is partly dependent on its angle of sweep; more-swept wings make less lift than less-swept wings. If the plane starts to sideslip, say 5 degrees to the left, then the left wing is swept 10 degrees more than the right wing, causing the plane to roll to the right. The solution is a bigger vertical stabilizer, using RCS to artificially create yaw stability during decent, or building a small angle of attack into the vertical stabilizers so that they are more responsive to sideslip, similar to the way the X-15 has a giant, fat wedge as a vertical tail, though that will lead to a lot more drag on the vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd if you can get away with it, I\u0027d say to try stowing the radiators in the cargo bay if you can, since that\u0027ll prevent them from affecting the aerodynamics of the vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dreadp1r4te","CreatedById":98426,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-07T08:49:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ferram4\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ferram4\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThere are a few possibilities I can think of.

I designed it for retrieving payloads from orbit like decommissioning stations without just de-orbiting them; as such it\u0027s set up so that the weight in fuel it burns getting into orbit/rendezvousing with the target is replaced with the weight of whatever it\u0027s recovering in the bay, but as a fail safe it\u0027s set up so it can still land with no cargo/fuel load remaining. Since neither of those have been the case as these are just sub-orbital hops to test stability, I can kinda rule that out for now but I\u0027ll set it aside for future consideration. I have had trouble with pWings correctly displaying CoL, and I\u0027m not sure if that has been corrected by or exacerbated by FAR, so it merits further testing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t put RCS on it yet, I\u0027ll try that first to see if I can stabilize it, in addition to increasing the size of the vertical stabilizers to increase yaw stability as I think that may be the culprit. Will post back with results.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI added a 3rd vertical stabilizer in between the initial two with its own rudder, as well as enlarging the other two rudders, added two reaction wheels, and a reasonably balanced RCS network that favors yaw control at the nose and is balanced otherwise around the CoM. I also temporarily stowed the radiators in the cargo hold to reduce drag. This had the net result of giving me outstanding roll authority, as well as the yaw authority needed to overcome the side slip that seems to be common on re-entry.
