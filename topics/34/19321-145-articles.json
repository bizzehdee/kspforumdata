That is of course bull****, bc when reentering with a cone, especially at hypersonic speeds, both nose-first and base-first attitudes should be stable (that\u0027s why NASA worried during Project Mercury about spacecraft being caught in nose-first attitude during reentry, bc once it gets hot, it\u0027s so stable that it\u0027s impossible to orient heatshield-first anymore). Also the drag was ridiculously low - it may have been due to heavy payload, but even though it descended in least streamline attitude, it still hit the ground at Mach 1.1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I tried to keep it stable by keeping the last stage (tank \u002B engine) attached at entry. Before I added \u0027fairing\u0027 to nosecone title it, ekhm, pushed the lifting body code to its limits. The drag of warhead plate caused it to reenter at something arround 80*AoA. Once it went subsonic, it violently pitched up and went upwards... gaining arround 1500m of altitude before it started falling. It hit the ground at arround 100m/s. After fixing nosecone to shield warheads inside I finally got stable descent... but at ludicrous speed.
