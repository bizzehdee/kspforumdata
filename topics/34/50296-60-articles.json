I have an alternate donfig I\u0027ll submit later. sorry bout double post\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Patch file for the inflatable. Still grants a lot of increased drag befitting an inflatable shield (which is meant to assist in aerobraking as well as thermal protection) but not to the point that it flips. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, what did I change... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebase maximum_drag / minimum_drag set to 0.2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebase angularDrag set to 0.2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EmaxTemp reduced to 2600 down from 10000. So now you have to treat it like an actual heat shield and make sure your reentry angle is shallow enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInflation only increases drag to 1, which is still 5 times most stock drag values. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Einflated angularDrag has been set to 5 to offset the increased inflated drag value and make it easier to keep shield oriented.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebase heat shield reflection value reduced to 0.02 in order to match the value used in ModuleAnimation2Value\u0027s valueCurve\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDREC_inflatable.tweak.cfg\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E@PART[6.25_Heatshield]:NEEDS[DeadlyReentry]:FINAL\u003Cbr\u003E{\u003Cbr\u003E @maximum_drag = 0.2\u003Cbr\u003E @minimum_drag = 0.2\u003Cbr\u003E @angularDrag = 2.0\u003Cbr\u003E @maxTemp = 2600\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E @MODULE[ModuleAnimation2Value],0\u003Cbr\u003E {\u003Cbr\u003E @valueCurve\u003Cbr\u003E {\u003Cbr\u003E @key,0 = 0 0.2\u003Cbr\u003E @key,1 = 0.8 0.5\u003Cbr\u003E @key,2 = 1.0 1.0\u003Cbr\u003E }\u003Cbr\u003E }\u003Cbr\u003E @MODULE[ModuleAnimation2Value],1\u003Cbr\u003E {\u003Cbr\u003E @valueCurve\u003Cbr\u003E {\u003Cbr\u003E @key,0 = 0 0.2\u003Cbr\u003E @key,1 = 0.8 0.5\u003Cbr\u003E @key,2 = 1.0 1.0\u003Cbr\u003E }\u003Cbr\u003E }\u003Cbr\u003E @MODULE[ModuleHeatShield]\u003Cbr\u003E {\u003Cbr\u003E @reflective = 0.02 // Make sure initial value matches uninflated value used by ModuleAnimation2Value\u003Cbr\u003E }\u003Cbr\u003E MODULE\u003Cbr\u003E {\u003Cbr\u003E name = ModuleAnimation2Value\u003Cbr\u003E animationName = heatshield\u003Cbr\u003E valueName = angularDrag\u003Cbr\u003E valueCurve\u003Cbr\u003E {\u003Cbr\u003E key = 0 2\u003Cbr\u003E key = 1 5\u003Cbr\u003E }\u003Cbr\u003E }\u003Cbr\u003E}\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-24T08:42:17Z\u0022 title=\u002205/24/2014 08:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 24, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Starwaster\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Eagle21221","CreatedById":106478,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-24T07:39:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Etweak able everything was causing, just disabled it and was working fine.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
