But as saiko mentioned, these in fact do exist if you hunt for them (or download the field research contract pack that includes waypoints to find them). It would be really great if we could add these situations to the x science checklist!

Splashdown in mountains and highlands isn\u0027t included in x science at all. My assumption is that the developer assumed these don\u0027t exist because mountains and highlands are, by definition, high altitude biomes and wouldn\u0027t include water.

There is TextFilters section, where you can add or remove your own filters, which will be applied to hide some combinations. Just delete \u0022TEXT\\_FILTER = Kerbin Splashed Mountains|Highlands\u0022 and you\u0027ll see them in the list."}]}
