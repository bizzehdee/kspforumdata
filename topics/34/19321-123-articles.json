Normal jet engines get more efficient with altitude. Piston engines stay about the same. However, Ramjets and Scramjets get more efficient with speed and remain about the same with altitude, however the limiting factor with them is heat.

Never height. And I find even with FAR my stock formula still works. Start pitch at 100m/s. 25 degrees at 250m/s, 50 at 500m/s, 75 at 750, 90 at 1,000m/s. The lower the TWR the higher the speeds need to be at each interval. I use Mechjeb as well.. so its a smooth, gradual gravity turn.
