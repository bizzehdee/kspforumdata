It\u0027s based around a THSS truss with a THSS probe core. 3 RemoteTech CommTech-1 dishes provide deep space communication (and fit the THSS perfectly). It\u0027s powered by 6 RLA ASRG RTGs (Roemy-Lemdun Atomics kit) that sit along the corners of the truss (also fit perfectly). They can keep all dishes/antennas running even in shadow. Mounted on the RTGs are 3 AIES frying pan dishes (5Mm) (unfortunately also named CommTech-1) provide for inter-satellite communication as well as downlink, 3 AIES ESC-EXP antenna provide redundancy and near-orbit communication without need for targetting, 3 small solar panels to provide extra power for station-keeping, and a trio of flashing beacons (AviationLights) so I can find them if I need to send a manned service crew up. Tucked behind the large dishes are xenon tanks and on the end an RLA resistojet engine. All told it\u0027s a reasonably compact package, but weighs in at 9 tons. The dishes are 3t. The RTGs another 3t (those dishes require a lot of power). 1.5t in xenon. The truss is .5t. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI launch an array of 4, 90 deg apart, which puts them 4,055km apart, connected by a 5,000km dish. It\u0027s a reasonably heavy lift - 36t of satellites, hauled into final orbit by a NERVA. The NERVA goes into an elliptical orbit of 16,200s (4.5 hours) with apoapsis at 2868km and pops off a satellite every time it reaches apoapsis. With a geosync period of 21,600s (6 hours), the previous sat has fallen exactly \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BC orbit behind. The sat pops off, fires up the resistojet, and circularizes. It\u0027s also weak enough to fine tune the orbit to exactly 6 hours. Previously I would have put a bit of RCS on to do that. Might have been the better decision as I could have dumped 1.5t from each sat, put that into extra fuel for the NERVA and just used it to set each orbit, and used a wee bit of RCS to fine tune it. But I think it looks cooler this way. Putting all 4 up at once makes it hard to design the lifter, but easy to get them precisely positioned. I always struggle to get them properly positioned when I launch them individually,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the first image you can see the main lifter having just detached and the NERVA cowlings falling back. There\u0027s a bit of scaffolding to keep the whole thing from wobbling apart (even with joint reinforcement it wiggles a fair bit). It was a coinflip on the NERVA over a lighter but lower ISP engine. It had barely enough thrust to perform this role, so it worked out pretty well. Even managed to get it home in one piece (there\u0027s a probe core and a bunch of chutes on it). The second shows the sat moving into position with a nice view of the design. The last has the engine disabled and ready to transmit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssuming one satellite may be blocked at any given time, I can configure each pair of sats redundantly, and hold 6 different targets anywhere in the solar system. Or I can hold 12 targets with half an hour of downtime every 6 hours. Now I can send my massive science mission to the Jool system and get my experimental techs all unlocked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can find my tech tree and RT2 patch for AIES over on the AIES thread.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-14T10:31:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Briarknit\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Briarknit\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhen using this mod and trying to transmit science with the Comms DTS-M1, I get \u0022There are no comms devices on this vessel, cannot transmit data.\u0022 Any reason why this would be happening and is removing the mod the only way to fix it?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe antennas do not deploy automatically anymore with this mod - but they do not retract after transmitting also, which I see as a big bonus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is because antennas use energy continously with this mod and retracting a probes antenna after a transmission from far away would practically kill it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou also have to be in range to transmit science, even if you have Kerbals on your vessel - unlike a probe core with this mod they can control the ship without an uplink to mission control, but the science data has to reach Kerbin somehow. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JDP","CreatedById":30775,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-14T11:52:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Dexter9313\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Dexter9313\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI volunteer to help Tobyz, I think I messed around enough with the mod since v1 so I can pretty much document everything (what really is a command station, what really are dishes, what really are omnis, what are the requirements to do this or that, etc...).
