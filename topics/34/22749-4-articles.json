While it\u0027s going to take some more discussion to figure out which pack should rescale and how much, one thing that we need to dispell here and now is the \u002264%\u0022 ideal that has been discussed recently. The logic for the 64% idea comes from the assumption that the Apollo capsule and the Mk1-2 from KSP are equivalent. Therefore if Apollo was 3.9m in diameter, it follows that the Mk1-2 would be 2.5, because 0.64*3.9=2.496\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey aren\u0027t equivalent, and shouldn\u0027t be treated that way. The reason is because of the seating arrangement in Apollo. It isn\u0027t enough to say \u0022they both seat three, so they\u0027re the same,\u0022 because Apollo seats three men shoulder to shoulder, while the Mk1-2 seats the commander in front and two men overlapping and slightly behind him. Assuming that a man\u0027s shoulder-to-shoulder width is about 0.6 meters, this gives us a minimum of 1.8 meters by 1.75 meters space needed for this configuration. For simplicity, let\u0027s say it\u0027s a square of 1.8 by 1.8.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you overlay a 1.8x1.8 square on a circle with diameter of 3.9, you\u0027ll find that you\u0027ll have a meter of space on each side of the square, allowing the astronauts freedom of movement inside the capsule. If Kerbals were human-shaped, this configuration would result in over half of a meter of space on all sides. (In reality though, the passengers aren\u0027t sitting at the base of the cone, which means we would have a little less space in every direction, but still totally livable.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, Kerbals aren\u0027t human shaped. Their heads, as Bobcat showed in his overlay on the previous page, are beyond shoulder-width \u003Cstrong\u003Ewithout\u003C/strong\u003E their helmets. With helmets on, Kerbals have a width of 50% of their height, meaning if humans shared these propotions, three shoulder to shoulder would be 0.9mx3, or 2.7 meters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat makes this especially difficult is that, unlike humans, who have their widest section in their torso, Kerbals are widest at eye-level. If you want to place your Kerbals so that they can see the instrumentation, this means that their eye level needs to be above the bisector of the cone cross-section. The higher above the bisector you go, the more rapidly lateral headspace decreases. This means that the radius of the the entire craft needs to increase the further away from center the Kerbals\u0027 eyes are.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImagine you have a circle, and then draw a line from left to right through the center. Now draw a 45 degree angle in quadrant I. The trigonometric unit circle denotes that the point this angle will hit on a circle is ((sqrt2/2),(sqrt2/2)). The quantity of the square root of 2 all over two is about 0.7. On a unit circle, the radius is always 1. The length of a chord parallel to the diameter that intersects this point will therefore be almost exactly 70% the length of the diameter, every time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I just lost you there, what I\u0027m trying to say is that if we place the Kerbals in a seating position similar to the way a human would sit, with the torso at the center of the craft, the diameter of that craft will need to be 1.4 times the amount of required lateral head room. This means that the width we found earlier of 2.7 meters would be that eye-level width, whereas the diameter would be 3.78. Accounting for these dimensions takes \u003Cstrong\u003E96%\u003C/strong\u003E of the original craft width. If we want the interior of the craft to be as roomy as it was for the Apollo astronauts, we would need to increase the diameter to 5.78m.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo where are we now? If a Kerbal is, as they say, 1m tall, we know that he will also be 0.5m wide with his helmet. A meter\u0027s worth of space at the hip of a human would be equivalent to 0.6 meters of space at the hip of a kerbal, meaning that our KSP Apollo would be 3(0.5)\u002B2(0.3), or 2.1m diameter. This doesn\u0027t disprove the viability of the 64% rescale because it\u0027s 2 dimensional. We have a circle here, whereas we need to start talking about cones.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Apollo capsule was 3.2 meters tall, so the ratio between height and width is 3.2(x)=3.4. X therefore equals 1.0625; to get the height of the KSP Apollo we would use y(1.0625)=2.1. This gives us a height of 1.97 or so. Do we have a cone 2 meters tall, then? No, because the Kerbals sit inside the cone, not flat against the bottom. This height covers a cone that reaches a ring centered midway across their bodies in profile. To get the rest, we need over another quarter meter of height, preferably half a meter to include the seats and such. So instead, we have 2.5(1.0625)=Z. Z is 2.65625.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETL;DR?\u003C/strong\u003E It is impossible to build an Apollo at proper specification using the 64% scale. At a bare minimum, we need almost 70%. To be comfortable, I recommend 75-80%. In the end, it really comes down to what Dragon was saying:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Dragon01\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Dragon01\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m not advocating scaling them as they\u0027re IRL, I\u0027m advocating \u003Cem\u003Escaling them to what works best. \u003C/em\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerry519","CreatedById":18146,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-27T03:41:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs anyone else getting a weird problem with the MIR trying to rip itself apart when switched to?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ShroomOfDoom","CreatedById":44990,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-27T06:14:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kerry519\u0022 data-cite=\u0022kerry519\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIs anyone else getting a weird problem with the MIR trying to rip itself apart when switched to?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappened to me a while ago when switching ships in-game.
