I quickly became obsessed with this mod as I\u0027ve done quite a bit of work with man-pack FM radios in very hilly country where manned relay stations are a must (and automated ones with vintage gear put the \u0022magic\u0022 in the term \u0022FM\u0022), so I geek out on this stuff. My standard comms plan:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Put up a nice big constellation of satellites w/ omnidirectional antennas. I like a 1/2 period orbit a.k.a. 3 hour orbital period (I think 1/2 period is the correct term?) These handle your relay traffic in/out of KSC. I go for 8, although that\u0027s really more than necessary. I do not want a momentary LOS blackout interrupting a critical maneuver or causing me to miss a window! Once I got burned by comms going down before I could extend solar panels...dead satellite.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Get the workhorse satellites on station. I rig these up with small dishes and omnidirectionals. The dishes handle specific comms targets and the omnis relay to my lower constellation. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) This is where things get mission specific. Once I put a couple satellites with long range dishes on a highly eliptical polar orbit inspired by the Molniya Orbit. My idea was to maximize on-station time waaaay up over Kerbin and have one satellite ascending while the other descended. I figured \u0022If I put it way up there I\u0027m not gonna have LOS issues.\u0022 Worked decently well. Sky\u0027s the limit on your mission-specific comms. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGetting the bones of your network 100% solid is the best way to prevent future problems. Conducting a routine relay satellite launch to fix your shoddy network under the pressure of an upcoming maneuver window is not fun...although it\u0027s probably the most Kerbal way of doing things \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-06T04:05:14Z\u0022 title=\u002211/06/2013 04:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 6, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by abica\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"15nelsoc","CreatedById":57328,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-06T01:22:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022intidragon\u0022 data-cite=\u0022intidragon\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENow KSP gets interesting once more besides the tech tree. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E But just a curious question guys. . . . can any of you show/give tips on making an effective interplanetary satellite network?
