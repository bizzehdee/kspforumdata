After using the Servo Configuration to separate my servos and with the Servo window open, my KSP RAM gradually climbs from ~1.5GB to ~2.87GB until it freezes and sometimes produces the linked crash report. It\u0027s consistent and supremely annoying (I just want to explore the cosmos like everyone else...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI first noticed it after installing the IR Robotics rework. After some research, I couldn\u0027t figure out why it was crashing. So today, I started with a fresh KSP install and a previous save with the science needed. I opened the stock game, runs about 1.35GB, and doesn\u0027t creep up at all. I installed just the IR mod, and I get a crash after a few minutes of messing with IR specific parts and the Servo window. I also tried with MM 2.5.1 and Active Texture Manager. I keep trying to build an arm as fast as I can before my RAM gets too high, but to no avail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know what I\u0027m doing wrong, or if it\u0027s a bug.
