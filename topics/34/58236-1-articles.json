RealEngines supports the least number of engines, but each one is lovingly set to be an exact 1:1 performance clone of a real engine, with as close a model as could be found.

If you placed a radial engine where the RCS thruster is, and it would get fuel, then you have a fuel feed.

I have not yet added different solid-fuel resources, however, so all solid fuel parts will need approximately 4.2315x as much SF as they had before to have the same total mass of solid fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQ: How do I configure this for a non-rescaled solar system?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA: RF is designed for real-world performance. Engines and tanks in stock KSP (and stock-balanced mods) perform much worse than their real counterparts; engines are about 3.2x as heavy for their thrust and role, and tanks about 4x as heavy (in terms of dry mass). This means that if you use RF on a solar system with Kerbol-level deltaV requirements, you won\u0027t need much rocket. There are two solutions for this. First, you can use KIDS to rescale the difficulty. If you want to need real-life-size rockets, use .3333, .3333 multipliers; if you want something closer to a stock KSP experience, use a higher (but less than 1.0) multiplier for each. If you just want something like a stock KSP experience (with heavier engines and tanks), then open RealFuels/RealSettings.cfg and find useRealisticMass = true and change the true to false. You will get approximately stock-KSP-level performance out of your engines and tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQ: How come my nuclear engines are so bad?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA: They do mass somewhat more than they used to (well, only at low tech levels), but they have a higher specific impulse even at lower tech levels than they did in stock KSP. However, what\u0027s changed is that fuels now have realistic \u003Cem\u003Edensities.\u003C/em\u003E This means if you use a NTR in its default fuel mode (Liquid Hydrogen), you will need to pack a gigantic volume of fuel. That\u0027s because LH2 has a density less than 1/14 what you\u0027re used to, so to pack the same \u003Cem\u003Emass \u003C/em\u003E of fuel (and mass, not volume, is what matters in rockets) you\u0027re going to need 14x as much tankage. If you want to compare the performance of a NTR with a chemical engine, make sure you compare total fuel \u003Cem\u003Emass\u003C/em\u003E, not fuel \u003Cem\u003Eamount\u003C/em\u003E, and make sure that you have a good (full/empty) mass ratio. Since NTRs are much, much heavier than chemical engines, if you only need a little delta V, it can make more sense to go chemical, since the better mass ratio of a chemical engine and its fuel will win out over the higher Isp of the NTR. However, for large delta V requirements (where you\u0027re talking, say, 5km/sec or more) then an NTR is a great choice, since you only need your dry mass * 82% in fuel to get 5km/sec delta V with a low-end NTR, whereas for hydrolox you need 215% your dry mass in fuel. The figures for kerolox or storables are even worse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth these issues are hidden in stock KSP, where, unlike the chemical engines which have about 1/4 the TWR of real engines, the NTRs have about the correct TWR for modern engines (or a full 3x what they should for 60s-era), and where NTRs use the same (density) fuel as chemical engines. So if you load up an existing craft, your mass ratio will plummet both due to the lower density fuel (less mass of fuel) and the heavier NTR. Add more tanks until the total mass is about what it used to be, and you should see somewhat similar performance, unless you only wanted a little bit (1-3km/sec) of delta V.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EFUEL MIXTURES\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E====Chemical=====\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Kerosene aka RP-1) and LOx is the \u0022standard\u0022 / \u0022benchmark\u0022 mixture. It\u0027s what the early launchers used, and what many still do. It\u0027s non-toxic, quite dense, and the LOx is only mildly cryogenic, which means LOx boiloff is not a big issue except for weeks\u002B missions. For all these reasons, RP-1/LOx is the fuel of choice for lower stages.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Liquid H2 and LOx is a high-performance mixture. It gives you more \u0022bang for your buck\u0022 but it\u0027s less dense so you need more tanks (though the tanks are lighter per liter). However, engines burning LH2/LOx generally have a lower TWR than other engines (in MFS, 75%). Also, it is generally less efficient at sea level (proportionally) than other fuel mixtures. The main complication however is that LH2 must be kept extremely cold; boiloff is a serious issue even in insulated (cryogenic) tanks. You should always use cryogenic tanks with this mixture; they mass less for hydrolox than do regular tanks. Given these advantages and disadvantages, LH2/LOx is best for upper stages that are fired during the launch or a few days after; however, some lower-stage use has been done (Delta IV, Ariane 5, Shuttle / Ares / SLS) though often in combination with solid boosters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Liquid Methane and LOx is midway between RP-1/LOx and LH2/LOx: lower performance than hydrolox but denser, and less cryogenic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Various hypergolics. They are various nitrogen-based storable (but highly toxic) liquid fuels. They perform less well than RP-1/LOx (about 95% the specific impulse for modern hypergolics), but are slightly denser and non-cryogenic: they can be stored for months at a time. Given their advantage in density, in actual use they are better than 95% as efficient--tankage for them masses much less. Further, another key advantage is that they do not need ignition: hypergolic means that if the two substances are put in contact, they will burn with no outside trigger. N2O4 is the highest-performing oxidizer; MMH and Aerozine-50 are the highest-performing fuels (UDMH is more stable but has slightly worse performance). Other oxidizers (Nitric Acid, Nitrous Oxide) have lower performance, especially when used with a mixture of Amines rather than a hydrazine derivative like MMH, AZ50, or UDMH. N2O4 and MMH (or another fuel) is often used for high-performance bipropellant RCS (Gemini, Apollo, Shuttle, etc.).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Kerosene and Hight-Test Peroxide is hypergolic when the HTP is heated and run over a catalyst bed. It\u0027s storable, non-toxic, very dense, but has lower performance than kerolox.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Alcohol (75% Ethanol, 25% Water) and LOx was used before kerolox; it is worse in just about every respect compared to kerolox.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Hydrazine, Nitrous Oxide, and HTP can be used as monopropellants. Hydrazine has by far the highest performance, but is very toxic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Solid Fuel is very dense, allows high thrust (since there is no engine per se to feed the fuel through, just a nozzle), but has low specific impulse, only slightly better than Hydrazine monopropellant. However, it took many years to develop larger and larger solid fuel motors, and solid fuel motors don\u0027t scale as well as liquid fuel (since the entire casing must resist the pressure of combustion, the casing itself forming the thrust chamber).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E====Nuclear (Liquid Fuel)====\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn general: the less dense the fuel, the higher your specific impulse and the lower your thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Liquid Hydrogen is the benchmark. Highest performance, but least dense. Same drawbacks as hydrolox, above, except worse, because ALL the fuel is liquid hydrogen\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Liquid Methane has lower performance, but is much more dense and so, despite, the lower specific impulse, the lower tank mass often leads to higher total deltaV for your stage. Considerable increase in thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Liquid Ammonia has lower performance but also less of a thrust increase than Liquid Methane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*LOx-Augmented NTR: This involves pumping LOx into the nozzle along with the expelled, superheated LH2, thus having them combust. Thus you get a hybrid between a chemical rocket and a NTR. Massive thrust increase (8x or so) with a drop in efficiency down to about 65-70% what the NTR gets in pure-LH2 mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E=======================\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003ETANK TYPES\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Note: All tanks are pressurized, but some tanks are highly pressurized; you need the latter for pressure-fed engines.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Default: Your regular tank type, roughly equivalent to the tanks used for Titan or Saturn I/V. Note that in order to match Titan tanks, it\u0027s lighter than it should be for other cases. Features minimal insulation for cryogenic resources (equivalent to the insulation on Saturn V\u0027s S-IVB).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Structural: A heavier version of Default, used for aircraft/spaceplanes (or to simulate old, massive tanks). Example: A jet plane\u0027s tank, or the R-7\u0027s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* ServiceModule: Used for service modules and other pressure-fed tanks. You need this for pressure-fed engines (RCS are pressure-fed engines). Due to supporting up to 200atm of pressure rather for resources than just the 1.8 or so that non-highly-pressurized tanks do, it\u0027s much heavier. Also can store electricity and life support resources. Features more insulation for the cryogenic resources. Examples: Able/Delta upper stage, Apollo Service Module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Fuselage: A heavier version of ServiceModule, used for aircraft/spaceplanes (or to simulate old, massive tanks). Examples: the electronics and life support section of a spaceplane, the WAC Corporal sustainer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Cryogenic: Highly insulated tank. Has the level of insulation (and low boiloff) of a modern cryogenic tank. Slightly heavier than Default due to the increased insulation. Example: Delta IV Common Core Booster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Balloon: Light, fragile tank. In real life the tanks must be kept pressurized at all times (even when empty of propellants) or they will collapse, and if left unmonitored they can collapse. In addition they are much less strong than other tank types, and one cannot attach heavy things to their sides or place heavy masses above them under high acceleartion. Ingame, however, their only major disadvantage is that they cost more. Example: Atlas sustainer (pre-Atlas III).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* BalloonCryo: Same as Balloon, but with more insulation (to the level of type Cryogenic). Example: Centaur upper stage. The Shuttle ET falls in between this and type Cryogenic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E=========================\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EENGINE TYPES AND TECHLEVELS\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn order to have realistic engine performance, RF divides engines into types and tech levels. While type cannot be changed in game (it is determined by chamber pressure, area ratio, cycle type, etc., all abstracted as \u0022engine type\u0022 and applied, as well as can be done given how unrealistic most KSP engine models are, to most stock and mod engines), tech level can. Tech level represents the advances that are applied to a specific model of engine over time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, the venerable LR87 used in the Titan rocket went through upwards of 11 revisions over time, and was converted to use all three main fuel types (kerolox, i.e. kerosene [RP-1] and Liquid Oxygen; hypergolic NTO / Aerozine-50; and hydrolox, i.e. Liquid Hydrogen and LOx). Its Isp and thrust-to-weight ratio increased considerably through the revisions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETerms: SL = sea level, TWR = thrust to weight ratio. Note that in RF, all engines include the mass of their thrust plate, so RF TWRs will be about 20-30% lower than real life engine stats.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, first RF classifies each engine it supports by type. The types are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EO = Orbital maneuvering system. Designed for tons and tons of restarts, and vacuum-only use. Pressure-Fed. High vac Isp, very poor SL isp, lowest TWR. Usually hypergolic. Real life examples: Apollo SPS, Shuttle OME. KSP example: LV-1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EU = Upper stage. At most a couple restarts. Same Vac Isp as O, better SL Isp, better TWR. Real life example: the Titan\u0027s LR-91. KSP example: KR-2L Rhino.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EU\u002B = Upper stage optimized for vac use. Aka \u0022O with a turbopump.\u0022 Highest Vac Isp (higher than O). Lower TWR than U. That\u0027s what \u002B means, higher vac, lower SL, lower TWR. Real life examples: the Centaur\u0027s RL-10. KSP examples: LV-909, Poodle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EL = lower stage. No restarts. Lowest Vac Isp, highest SL Isp barring Aerospike, highest TWR. Real life examples: RD-170 and 180 on Zenit and Atlas V. Fuel is usually kerolox, though could be hypergolic or even hydrolox. KSP example: the Mainsail, obviously.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EL\u002B = same changes as U\u002B: higher IspV, lower IspSL, lower TWR. Designed for a single-stage-to-orbit stack (or at least an engine that\u0027s never staged away even if boosters are). Real life example: Space Shuttle SSME. Note that in real life most rockets have large lower stages and small upper stages, so most real life lower stage engines are somewhere between L and L\u002B, if not outright L\u002B. KSP example: LV-T45, Skipper.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA = Aerospike. Note that in real life nozzle losses are only 15% or so, and most of the efficiency loss at sea level is because there\u0027s air there, not because the nozzle is the wrong shape. For now they have the Isp of a U in vacuum, and 0.9x that at sea level. Real life examples: J-2T-250k (plug nozzle mod of the Saturn V J-2), the linear aerospike on the X-33. KSP Examples: obvious.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ES = Solid.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ES\u002B = Solid for vac use, lower SL, higher Vac Isp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EN = Nuclear Thermal. Approximately same ratio of IspV to IspSL as U. Uses a solid core reactor to heat reaction mass. Very low TWR, very high Isp. Real life examples: the various Project NERVA engines, RD-0410. KSP example: LV-N.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENOTE: RCS uses type \u0027L\u0027 for the Isp and TWR multipliers; in terms of actual performance it\u0027s like O.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat Isp an engine has is determind by grabbing its type, checking its tech level, and getting the appropriate entry in the TLTIsps area of RealSettings.cfg. Then any appropriate multipliers are applied (in the engine CONFIG).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEngines have minimum tech levels; they aren\u0027t available before that. You can, however, upgrade past that. In fact, you are HIGHLY encouraged to upgrade any engine, after placing it in the VAB, to your maximum available TL.

Upgrade costs are controlled by global settings and by per-part settings. In general, it costs a fixed amount of funds and/or science to unlock an engine config, and it costs a fixed amount of funds and/or science, times (desired new tech level - original engine tech level) to unlock a new tech level (so going from TL3-\u0026gt;4 is less expensive than 4-\u0026gt;5 for a starts-at-TL3 engine).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECONFIG settings:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf a CONFIG has an entryCost, that will be its cost in funds to unlock. If it has a sciEntryCost, that will be its cost in science to unlock. If it has a techLevelEntryCost, that will be the base cost in funds to unlock a new TL (see above re the per-TL costs changing), and same for techLevelSciEntryCost. Per-config entry costs can also have multipliers and subtractors. This means if one CONFIG is very similar to another CONFIG (on that or another engine), you can get a reduction in cost if you\u0027ve unlocked the other CONFIG. You can add a entryCostMultipliers {} node to the CONFIG and have a list of the other config(s)\u0027 names and their multipliers, like LR89-NA-6 = 0.5 (which will mean the current config costs only half as much to unlock if LR89-NA-6 is unlocked). This applies to both funds and science. You can do the same with the entryCostSubtractors {} node, except in this case, the value is subtracted from the final cost, rather than the final cost being multiplied by the value. In this case, the subtractive value will be multiplied by configCostToScienceMultiplier if the cost is a science cost (see below for configCostToScienceMultiplier).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGlobal settings (configs):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EconfigEntryCostMultiplier: if no specific costs are set, then config entry cost will be (this * config.cost).
