For science \u0026amp; contracts mod, I have Fine Prints, Mission Controller Extended, and D Magic installed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit 2: I digged out a little bit more of the safe file detail and I found something interesting. Station Science refer to target body in contract by the name of body (i.e. targetBody = Kerbin), while other mod use the number instead (i.e. for Kerbin; targetBody = 1). Might this be the cause of the problem? I will try it out when I have time later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT 3: So I experimented again and found the solution to my problem. Turned out that I can turn in the contract if I recover the experiment pod back. So the contract works so far. However, the contract would not update throughout the process. So it will go from 0 to complete and no update in between that got me confused whether it works or not.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-09T16:25:16Z\u0022 title=\u002209/09/2014 04:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 9, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by veldril\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Emore detail\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hotblack Desiato","CreatedById":93895,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-10T05:11:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have a similar problem, with a slightly different situation: I use extraplanetary launchpads and produce the pod right at the minmus orbit station (where I produced most of the science station).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand I never realized, that the mission says: start that thing from kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eany chance that you change the mission-behavior to stock-alike missions? do the test over there and bring the results back (or the pod)?
