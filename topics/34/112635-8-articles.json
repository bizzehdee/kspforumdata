This is my first attempt at an IVA so don\u0027t expect a luxury suite. It\u0027s the essentials and a few extras.\n\nCabin Lights - every bridge now gets cabin lights with some extra glow around the edges for a scatter effect.\n\nLanding Lights - Every CVE part gets landing lights embedded in the flight deck. Turn your CVE lights on and you have a floating xmas tree.\n\nFeel the vibration of high compression diesel pistons as they try to beat the cylinder heads off your new engines. No more silly jet noises. It\u0027s a ship!\n\nToys:\n\nA Clipper cradle to help you get your ships to the water. Slap it on, throw some wheels on it and you got one really big rover. I\u0027ll most likely be making a big change to this in the next patch. I\u0027ll split it in two so that it won\u0027t hang up under the ship when you release it.\n\nMoar Lights.\n\nA real SHIP spotlight. Not that dinky stock rover thing. And, proper navigation lights. And all are tweakable.\n\nHere\u0027s a comparison of the stock spotlight (the wide beam) with the new Fengist\u0027s Shipyard Spotlight... the one that reaches out and torches things. Plus, I think you\u0027ll like the internal glow... it looks like... well a light. Not like someone painted a piece of glass yellow.\n\n![Spotlightcomparison.jpg](http://www.datainterlock.com/Kerbal/Shipyard/Spotlightcomparison.jpg)\n\nAnd here\u0027s the new navigation lights. They\u0027re not designed to cast much light, but they are visible from a distance (which is what navigation lights do).\n\n![navlights.jpg](http://www.datainterlock.com/Kerbal/Shipyard/navlights.jpg)\n\nAnd that\u0027s pretty much it for this update. I have been doing a LOT of testing, to include... gangways, shipping containers and even submarines, but so far there are pretty big issues with each of those.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nFair winds and following seas...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-02T07:08:24Z\u0022 title=\u002207/02/2015 07:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fengist**"},{"CreatedByName":"Goddess Bhavani","CreatedById":14001,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T11:05:40Z","Content":"Regarding the bow thrusters, in my very honest and tiny opinion it could be nice to have them as normal low thrust electric engines that don\u0027t produce any useful thrust above 1000m ASL (preventing exploits).

But, they can\u0027t be heavy... at all unless I kinda bend the laws of physics. Any amount of mass, like the blisters and the rudder, that gets placed underwater causes massive drag in stock physics. Like MASSIVE drag. If you\u0027ve ever seen guys try to build a stock submarine, you\u0027ll know. I\u0027ve seen them with 6 jet engines pointing straight down and they still descend like they\u0027re flying in molasses. And yes, using them properly would require action groups and would be super low thrust. I shall work on it ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif).\n\nAs for hovercraft. I actually had the chance once to ride in an [LCAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:LCAC_19970620.jpg), and not just in the hold, I got to cruise around while sitting on the bridge. They picked me up on the beach (yea, it was a ride just for me if you can believe it) and took me out and we boarded their LHA (I\u0027m pretty sure it was a [Tarawa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarawa-class_amphibious_assault_ship) class) via the well dock. And yes, it was pretty cool. They even demonstrated, and I can\u0027t remember the exact words, but the pop-up effect hovercraft have. Basically, they cranked their hovering engines to max while sitting still and the craft shot upward and a huge blast of air shot out from under the skirt. It was a pretty cool ride and made for some great video.\n\nNow, implementing that in KSP... wow. You\u0027re talking multiple engines... forward and upward. Next, balancing issues, just like a VTOL and finally, throttle issues. The hover engines are completely independent of the horizontal engines. So ummmm... yea. I\u0027d have to contemplate this pretty hard. Not saying it\u0027s impossible, just unlikely.\n\nNow, if I were into feeling like I were cheating the laws of physics, there are already anti-grav engines in the game via [Kerbal Foundries](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/84102-PARTS-PLUGIN-1-0-x-V1-8G-Kerbal-Foundries-wheels-anti-grav-repulsors-and-tracks)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-02T12:56:58Z\u0022 title=\u002207/02/2015 12:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fengist**"},{"CreatedByName":"Fengist","CreatedById":78435,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T13:33:04Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E What are the issues with submarines?

I shall give you part of the problem but you won\u0027t like all of it.\n\nThe first problem, which is most likely fixable I\u0027d just have to do some more testing, is the fact that while I can dive just fine, surfacing is not something I\u0027ve been able to do easily using stock/FS mechanics. Yes, I know that\u0027s backwards from stock physics. Everyone can surface but diving is an issue. I\u0027m having the opposite problem.\n\nSpeed is not an issue. I have surmounted that. Here\u0027s a screenshot showing me goofing off with some stock parts. This one is moving rather slow because I\u0027ve only tweaked about half the parts on here. I have hit speeds of 40-50 m/s underwater... enough to crash into the bottom of the ocean and splode. You\u0027ll note my depth at almost 800m. And I\u0027m also toying with one of the new .14 spotlights underwater. Works great!\n\n![Subtest1.jpg](http://www.datainterlock.com/Kerbal/Shipyard/Subtest1.jpg)\n\nSo yes, a submarine is probably doable with stock/FS physics.\n\nNow, for some reasons why not:\n\n**If you want your vision of becoming a Kerbal submariner to be ruined, view the spoiler.**\n\n**If you want to keep the mystery of a beautiful seascape under the surface, do NOT read this spoiler.**\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The camera is not an issue. There are mods that allow you to mount external cameras and there\u0027s the one I use, Kerbcam. Being able to move the camera angle isn\u0027t a big deal. \n\u003E \n\u003E The big issue with submarines is Squad. They do not consider underwater to be a place where you should go. This is a game about rockets and aviation. Not about aquatics and maritime activities. Oceans are merely a consequence of making realistic planets. They\u0027re not a place for exploration. Therefore, they have put no real effort into making water a physically attractive place. There\u0027s a VERY good reason why stock cameras are locked in the vertical down position when underwater. It\u0027s because the oceans have no surface when viewed from below. If you were able to rotate the stock camera upward, you\u0027d see that. Rather than fix the view from underwater, Squad simply locks the stock camera so you can\u0027t point it upward.\n\u003E \n\u003E This is the same view, a minute or so later with the camera tilted more toward horizontal. You\u0027ll note I\u0027m now 815m... BELOW... the non-existent surface.\n\u003E \n\u003E ![Subtest2.jpg](http://www.datainterlock.com/Kerbal/Shipyard/Subtest2.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E This is a night shot so it doesn\u0027t look too horrid. In full sunlight, half the screen is nearly black while the other half is a blinding white. Without a surface the visual contrast is... horrible.\n\u003E \n\u003E The next reason, you can easily verify yourself with the bathysphere.\n\u003E \n\u003E On Kerbin at the long/lat of -28.9 / -83.1, you will find the lowest geographical point. The depth there is around 1300m. Take a bathysphere to that location and dive it. It\u0027ll take a moment to reach that depth. But, at around 1,000 meters, you\u0027ll see the next reason why submarines aren\u0027t really... expected to be in the game. I won\u0027t keep spoiling this and tell you what happens but suffice it to say that no surface reflection is a minor physical anomaly in comparison. \n\u003E \n\u003E Thus far, Squad had shown no real desire to change the seascape. Now that being said... if I DO make submarines work then perhaps Squad would have a reason to fix these issues. I\u0027m afraid it would take a lot of opinions to change that and I don\u0027t think there are enough submariners in the game for them to really care.\n\u003E \n\u003E I included the bathysphere knowing these things in hope that people like you would want to use it, see these problems, and start making some noise about getting them fixed. And I\u0027m planning the IVA for the bathysphere in the hopes this happens. I\u0027d love to see subs. But Squad would need to make the oceans friendly before they become visually appealing.\n\u003E \n\u003E In some ways, making mods sucks. You end up learning all the dirty little secrets.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nIf you reply to this post, please use spoilers if discussing the above.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-02T14:47:40Z\u0022 title=\u002207/02/2015 02:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fengist**"},{"CreatedByName":"TUKE","CreatedById":119239,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T15:50:24Z","Content":"You know i\u0027m trying to limit my mod count right?

And then the REALLY annoying part, they don\u0027t face the same direction as the external part so I spend hours flipping and spinning them around to get them in the proper position... and then... the Kerbals face backward from that and then... I get to create new models to stick on the inside and THEN, I finally get to add the props like buttons, compass, throttle, etc. The cargo bridge took me daaaaayyyyzzzz \\*snort\\*\n\nSo, which is it?
