I can report back that I believe the KJR fix is working properly with IR, because with the full release enabled, my ship prevents itself from going full kraken due to a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E shift, and with the new version, the robotic parts freak out but nothing breaks... at least for a really long time until ridiculous torque levels are reached. With no KJR installed I get regular ol\u0027 explosive kracken on my solar array booms from the rotatron-\u003Ehinge-\u003Erobo-poles. I understand that a recent release from december attempted a fix for the drift, but I can confirm that it does not. My craft was exiting the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E of minmus to escape kerbin \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E when I returned to find the kraken, leading me to reload with old/full-release version of KJR and the robo parts were stiff and safe. upgrading to dev release of KJR reengaged robo-drift-kraken on the same craft even after having \u0027saved\u0027 it with KJR. Another variable at play, whose relevance I am unsure, is that previous to my warp through \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E I had engaged the locks on the rotatrons. I hope that if drift cannot be fully fixed, that the out of control kraken nature of it can be... they are infinitely flopping, even as they attempt to obey my commands. I merely reorient the tentacles with the servo controls. This all makes me assume that some sort of damping parameter would not work. If you could explain your understanding of why this happens, perhaps that would be helpful to the community in solving this issue. For now, I am forced to be extremely careful with my craft and save files, and selectively reload certain craft using the not-working-with-IR KJR release. \n\nEDIT: further testing has now spread the kraken to different save files, before any \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E changes. This is truly disconcerting because it implies I can\u0027t just save the game and revert to be safe... I cannot use this ship and IR simultaneously.

I\u0027m sure I\u0027m missing something.  Anyone else have that issue?\n\u003E \n\nI seem to have stopped the collapse of the heavier ships using the dev version of KJR by using EER to set autostruts to grandfather parts globally before adding any robotic parts.  Adding the robotic parts after setting autostruts this way seems to work ok.  I was also able to autostrut everything (robotic parts and all) and then un-autostrut the robotic parts only on the launchpad to get them working correctly.  Seems like this is close to a real solution.  I\u0027m still really new so I\u0027m probably making it harder than I need to.  Maybe there should be a way for KJR to ignore robotic parts and their immediate children?
