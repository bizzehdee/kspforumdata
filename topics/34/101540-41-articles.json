First and foremost, scaling would be optional and support would need to be done by the authors of the part mods (today most patches are supported by me). Which means that many mod parts would just not be scaleable anymore. Stock support would be reduced to the smallest common denominator (like tanks, aero and structural). Any functionality that has its quirks (like scaling crew capacity) would be cut out. Last but not least, no updates between KSP versions.

Of course, in Tweakscale when changing the size of fuel tanks, larger tanks carry more fuel and are heavier. This should go without saying. But now, no matter how big I make the capsule, I can only fit one crew! The crew tab only allows one passenger. This is not economical, since I need more crew in a larger capsule! I KNOW it is possible to fit extra crew in Tweakscaled parts, I have done myself before on a lost install, and I have seen pictures of other players who have done this.\n\nDoes anyone know how to fix this?

Let\u0027s first note that the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E of an engine (without any tanks) should be preserved for balance reasons, so mass and thrust should use the same exponent.\n\nThe straightforward way of scaling engines would be to make the thrust proportional to the area of the nozzle (an exponent of 2). That would mean that the height of the fuel stack an engine can lift is preserved, which makes upscaled engines useless (light but too weak) and downscaled ones too strong (a tiny engine that is heavier and stronger than it looks). Also the density would scale too much which could result in unintuitive physics behavior.\n\nSo the current exponent is 2.5. This means that you can not simply scale up a whole vessel an expect it to behave the same behavior. On the other hand the height of tanks you can stack on an engine increases with size ( sqrt(scale) to be precise ).\n\nI do think this is a good compromise for engines. But I\u0027m also not really happy with SRBs, and don\u0027t find much use for scaled ones. Their weight is dominated by the solidfuel tank, so the mass exponent needs to stay at 3. We have a tweakable thrust limiter so increasing the thrust should not be much of an incompatibility. Finally I don\u0027t see much physical sense in the thrust values of the stock SRBs (other than to make them useful in different stages of the career progression), so there is no stock behavior to be consistent with.\n\nYes, I think a thrust exponent of 3 makes sense for SRBs. Of course that also means that downscaled SRBs will get weaker. So anyone using them as sepratrons might like the old setting better.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 24.1.2017 at 4:00 AM, DrunkenKerbalnaut said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Hey [@pellinor](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/85299-pellinor/), is there a way to constrain a dimension when scaling a part?\n\u003E \n\nNo, it would mean a lot of additional complexity and there are just to few models that look decent with non-isotropic scaling."}]}
