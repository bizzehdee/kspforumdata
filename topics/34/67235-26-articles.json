This number is saved in the .sfs file in the SCENARIO AGExtScenario module as the LastSave value. So a .sfs file with a LastSave =15 value will try to load AGExt00015.cfg when it loads.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen the clean up runs, it checks all the .sfs files in the directly for the LastSave value and deletes all AGExt00000.cfg files that do not match a LastSave value or a LastSave value less one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if our .sfs file above with a LastSave =15 was the only .sfs file in the directory, the clean up routine would leave AGExt00014.cfg and AGExt00015.cfg and delete all other AGExt00000.cfg files in the directory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis LastSave value in the .sfs file is also the only place you can tell which AGExt00000.cfg file belongs to which .sfs file. Because I\u0027m hooking into KSP\u0027s saving process, I have no control over the file names of the .sfs files and there is no other way to tell which AGExt00000.cfg file a specific .sfs file uses for sure. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA good indicator is the time stamps, a .sfs file and its associated AGExt00000.cfg file will be created at the same time, but I don\u0027t guarantee this method as I have not tested it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know how often you back track, or how far you backtrack, with all those saves. If it is not very often you can make a \u0022backup\u0022 folder in your save directory and move all the old .sfs files and AGExt00000.cfg files into it. That way the clean up routing only has a few .sfs files to cycle through so it cleans up after itself without being such a long wait.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe downside to this being that if you want to load on of those saves, you have to move it back into the main saves folder before you can load it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ED.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"madmatt55","CreatedById":132251,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-18T22:06:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk, I think I get it.

When I say completely broken, the UI shows up in the VAB and I can assign actions just fine like normal, and then when I save the ship and go to the launchpad everything disappears as if I never assigned actions. I also can\u0027t assign any actions inflight/on the pad, opening the editor there won\u0027t allow me to assign actions to anything.
