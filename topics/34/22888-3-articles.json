I\u0027ve been trying to find more real world missions for KSP. I\u0027ve always been fascinated with space, but who isn\u0027t?... Finding this sent me on a mission to learn more. For the last week or so, I\u0027ve been doing a lot of reading about the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo missions, and then actually being able to do them is awesome. Though I have yet to really grasp the concept of rendezvousing without the help of mechjeb, I was able to make a successful dock from about 200m out, without using mechjeb. I still have a few more missions to go before I start my Apollo missions. I was wondering if anyone could point me to an accurate ATV or an ATDA? I know I could just build one, but would prefer something not so Kerbaly.Thank you again and keep up the great work.
