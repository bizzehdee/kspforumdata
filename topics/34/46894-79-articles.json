Barring bugs in the texture loader (of which we have a few), MBM, TGA, and PNG should deliver the same result in memory. DDS uses the DXT family of compressed encodings, which can be used in-memory, so depending on details of the texture loader a DDS is more likely to get a DXT-compressed in-memory representation as opposed to an uncompressed one than a format that has to be converted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost games that deal with this many textures are capable of loading and unloading on demand to stay within the memory limit.
