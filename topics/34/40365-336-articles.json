I\u0027m playing the pre-ARM 0.23 with the 0.10.3 version of Interstellar, if things have changed since then consider this post redundant \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all let me say that I really enjoy the more difficult / complicated way to get science out of that instrument. Adds another layer to the game, which is always nice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe amount of power the transmission needs is insane though. There is virtually no way to transmit the science on a \u0022standard\u0022 solar powered probe. Of course one can always build huge contraptions to provide enough juice but I\u0027m talking about a reasonable probe. The instrument virtually requires a reactor, or the probe to come home to Kerbin. Why I\u0027m saying this is because I found that unlike other instruments, the transmission doesn\u0027t seem to continue after the batteries have sufficiently recharged. So once the batteries are drained, that\u0027s it, the WarpPlugin.cfg value switches to transmitted = true and its over. Searching this thread it seemed to have worked (people have mentioned using time warp to \u0022cheat\u0022 a bit on energy consumption) earlier but at least for me, it doesn\u0027t. Not sure that is intended. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also found out that the science from the instrument can\u0027t be picked up by a Kerbal on EVA. I had this happen to my Mun detector (insufficiently solar-equipped, see above) where I sent a pickup mission only to find out that I couldn\u0027t get the science out of the instruments thru Kerbal. That\u0027s definitely not fun. I saw a post somewhere concerning the magnetometer science not being allowed to be picked up thru EVA being a bug, so I\u0027ll assume the same is the case here, just letting you know.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext, I have a nuclear powered rover with a Double C on board on the surface of Kerbin with antennas and everything. I thought to be incredible smart since I make a point of crashing the last ascend stage of virtually all rockets back on Kerbin to avoid debris. Free science, right? Doesn\u0027t seem to be the case. When I switch to the burned out fuel tank / engine / fin assembly (no power, no control) and watch it crash it doesn\u0027t get registered by the Double C. Again, not sure if that\u0027s intended behaviour.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELast, sometimes when I read the seismic reports on a probe and click the green \u0022store experiment\u0022 button in the popup, it seems that the \u0022transmitted\u0022 value in the WarpPlugin.cfg is incorrectly being set to \u0022true\u0022. Not 100% sure how to reproduce it but I had several cases where the sequence of \u0022impact -\u0026gt; switch to detector -\u0026gt; read -\u0026gt; store -\u0026gt; switch to next impactor\u0022 caused the first impact to be set to transmitted = true while that was not the case.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, great twist on the instrument but it could use some tweaking in my opinion.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"leftler","CreatedById":100432,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-15T13:03:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022WaveFunctionP\u0022 data-cite=\u0022WaveFunctionP\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eis there a warpconfig in your save file?
