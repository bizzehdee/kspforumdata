Yes, the magic altitude for GSO is 2868.4km, not 4868, but 2868 is as close as the MechJeb will get you. You can later fine-tune your orbit by looking at the Orbital Information pane. It\u0027s pretty hard to get a perfect orbit and some drift is inevitable, which is why you will need to do some station-keeping over time. You should equip your GSO sat with RCS and fuel for station keeping, like in real life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 angle from the 475km transfer orbit works like this: KSC is at -74\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0.6 longitude, so if you want to get your satellite above that target, you want to start your burn at -164.6\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0. You can see your current position in the Surface Information pane.
