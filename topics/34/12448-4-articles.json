While I love the design, at this time I don\u0027t think that I have the time and resources to really do it justice. There isn\u0027t enough reference out currently (that I have found, anyway) to build it as accurately as I would like, and there would be a lot of work to get the mechanisms working for it to function as it does in the movie. A better plan would be to attempt to build the Serenity as there is plenty of available reference and any work that goes into the swivel engines can be applied to the Prometheus if I choose to build it in the future. The Prometheus also has a few of the balance issues that the Serenity has when looking at volume distribution.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@Naoma: As far as my understanding goes, the issue with landing vertically using mechJeb is an issue with mechJeb. Something about it not paying attention to the thrust vector of the engines. This leads to two possible solutions: comb through the mechJeb source code and figure out how to get it to work (far above my skill level and not something I want to do since mechJeb isn\u0027t mine), or figure out a way to swap the orientation of the entire ship with a button press without causing any other problems. My experience with mechJeb is very limited, so if someone else has different ideas that don\u0027t require drastic changes to anything, let me know. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll this said, I have found a little time to play with a few things:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1261.photobucket.com/albums/ii590/joshCogswell/kerbalHatch.png\u0022 alt=\u0022kerbalHatch.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1261.photobucket.com/albums/ii590/joshCogswell/kerbalOutFront.png\u0022 alt=\u0022kerbalOutFront.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1261.photobucket.com/albums/ii590/joshCogswell/kerbalTop.png\u0022 alt=\u0022kerbalTop.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis required scaling the entire thing up by a factor of three.
