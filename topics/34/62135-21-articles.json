Could I have designed an open cockpit with large window views like this? Certainly. But as you\u0027ve seen from exterior views and in general that isn\u0027t the form factor of this vehicle. In that example, we could calibrate a HUD to a kerbal very simply. But the KSO\u0027s exterior doesn\u0027t have large bay windows to make that easy. Its control panel was already cut down further than originally designed as the measurements for a kerbal are very strange. In other words, a glass cockpit as seen in the KSO or an airliner is not as easy as doing something like the Gemini in terms of getting the views to be useful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second problem when designing something like this is the angle or field of view. If the opening was large and directly in front of the Kerbal, that wouldn\u0027t be a problem. Otherwise if you have a panel in front of them, it would have to be incredibly short. Kerbals have a very short body compared to their large head.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0027ve tested the actual Kerbal view lined up with the cockpit glass. His head would hit the top panel and his seat would have to be about where the top of the throttles are.
