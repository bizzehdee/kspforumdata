The plugin simply takes stored information about vessels \u003Cem\u003Eoutside\u003C/em\u003E of the render distance, loads the model of each part in its proper place, and then destroys all of the physics colliders. Note that \u0022render distance\u0022 is referring to the point at which KSP loads and physically simulates vessels -- KSP\u0027s default \u003Cem\u003Emodel\u003C/em\u003E rendering distance seems to be 750km (which, again, isn\u0027t touched).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, I suspect that the ship-eating bug is an error in destroying the physics collider. I think there\u0027s some mod part or possibly even a stock part that doesn\u0027t allow the collider to be destroyed, then the collider manages to stick around and blow up the ship. I\u0027ll have to do some more testing when I get home in a few hours.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the meantime, if you are having problems with this error, you can disable vessel rendering by going into the Settings.cfg file and setting maxDistance to -1.
