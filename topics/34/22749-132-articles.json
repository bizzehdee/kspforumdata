The robotic arm didn\u0027t even show up in the parts bin in game. Also the front landing gear didn\u0027t deploy. I had to replace it with a stock part. Otherwise the Buran flies great and I loved it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just tried again to fly the N1-L3 and I just can\u0027t do it. Even following BobCat\u0027s video tutorial. In the last third of the first stage burn it starts to turn up, down or sideways and I can\u0027t regain control. I managed to fly the mission twice before, but it\u0027s not easy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the American Pack, the landing legs on Altair (lunar lander) don\u0027t work (attaching some stock ones solves that). It also has control issues, especially with Mechjeb. Same with Orion\u0027s service module. Using Mechjeb to do the orbital rendezvous and docking with Altair is very difficult. At the end of each burn the blue target starts to move, Mechjeb tries to follow and ruins the burn. Increasing \u0022tolerance\u0022 on Mechjeb\u0027s Maneuver Planner (to 5m/s I think) solves that issue to some extent. However, if you replace the service module with stock tank and engine then Orion flies great! So the problem is the service module. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECoincidence or not, Mechjeb also shows the DeltaV of that service module and lander to be 0. The capsules and the lander from the Soviet Pack have the same issue, but I don\u0027t remember them having the same control problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I almost forgot I had trouble with the LifeSupport plugin included in the packs. If I sent a Kerbal on EVA he disappeared when trying to enter a spacecraft (which made transferring them to landers impossible). The Kerbals were back on KSC as if they never left. Deleting the LifeSupport folder solved that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Virtualgenius","CreatedById":67644,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-16T01:54:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAre you using the latest Dev version of MJ as I don\u0027t experience that many problems landing legs seem to only work with g key MJ can\u0027t seem to do it auto\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BioHaZarD.PT","CreatedById":106836,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-16T07:35:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI did update mechjeb to the latest Dev version a couple of days ago, so I reinstalled the American Pack and gave it another shot.
