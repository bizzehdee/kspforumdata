It\u0027s all about \u0022Firsts\u0022. So the contracts fire when there is a \u0022First\u0022 to be done, and if you\u0027ve already done the \u0022First\u0022 then we\u0027re not interested. Assuming you\u0027ve been using the stock contracts before now, you haven\u0027t missed out on anything. The reward structure of Exploration Plus is setup to mimic the stock contracts. It \u003Cem\u003Elooks\u003C/em\u003E a little higher because we streamline a few steps (like not making you do a rendezvous around every body before you can proceed) but the overall compensation for a body should be the same as you get from stock.
