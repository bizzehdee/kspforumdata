I know this is quite high, but going much lower leads to bad pixelation in the surface of the planet before the switch to PQS generated terrain, and even at that altitude, you can clearly see the pixels. Once we get EVE configured, I\u0027m thinking we should allow for a breakout around 10km mostly because vertical visibility is almost always better than horizontal visibility through clouds / fog, and if you look at the Venera surface images, it looks like you might be able to get about 1-2 km visibility. I would also mention that by the time you get to 50km, you\u0027re pretty much committed to a landing region, with only the ability to fine tune the exact location unless you have oodles of delta-v to waste on climbing back out through the atmosphere to reattempt a landing zone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NathanKell\u0022 data-cite=\u0022NathanKell\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI think it\u0027s probably safe enough to just require EVE as a dependency, and use that for clouds; besides, rbray is currently implementing volume fog, too, so gas giants (and Venus) can have thick-as-soup atmosphere all the way down.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m looking forward to that, though I still think it prudent to include a placeholder image of the cloud surface for those who for one reason or another won\u0027t be using EVE.

Right now I can\u0027t tell if its because of the oceans of Eve (though time warp doesn\u0027t get rid of it, so unless Venus is tidally locked, eventually the oceans should move on) or if its because of the normal map I used, which is all black then generated into the normal, but the clouds should definitely not look like a glass surface.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-24T22:53:04Z\u0022 title=\u002204/24/2014 10:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 24, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by SpacedInvader\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
