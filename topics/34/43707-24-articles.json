Now with the .50 update the mod will refuse to work at all if running from the archive folder.

It doesn\u0027t have to be an exact pitch either as long as it is enough to cancel the horizontal speed before you hit the ground. Preferably, a few hundred meters before you hit the ground. I have just been using horizontal speed canceling devices. AKA parachutes. I have managed to get some inclination on orbits by sort of hacking my way through it. Though it isn\u0027t ideal and it messes up your G-turn. It\u0027s just bizarre. It has you thinking that it works in some kind of absolute vector but that isn\u0027t the case either. If it was, then when you set up \u002B R(-90,-90,0). it would put you on the horizon of the nav ball with a 45deg NE vector. Nope then it doesn\u0027t do anything.

I have a surface velocity scalar but no vector at the moment, I\u0027ll make sure it\u0027s in the next update\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou should be aware that there is a slight difference between what your surfacespeed gives versus the thing I\u0027m talking about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo illustrate the difference. Say I\u0027m falling at a 45 degree angle toward a spot on the ground, moving along with the planetary rotation. My navball tells me that my surface speed is 10 m/s. Your surfacespeed variable will only say the speed is about 7.07 m/s because it\u0027s only showing the speed of the ground projection of that vector ( 10*cos(45) ).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, if all I want is the scalar, I can take your surfacespeed and your verticalspeed and use them to derive the navbal\u0027s idea of what \u0022surface\u0022 speed means by the Pythagorean formula.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course if you do implement a vector that corresponds to your surfacespeed scalar, from that plus the verticalspeed I could derive the navball\u0027s idea of what is the surface prograde direction with some trig... but if your goal was to make this accessible and easy for people to use it might not be a good idea to be using terminology that\u0027s at odds with what the navball says. The navball already has an idea of what a \u0022surface speed\u0022 is and it\u0027s different from what your mod uses the term for.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-10T21:18:42Z\u0022 title=\u002209/10/2013 09:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 10, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Steven Mading\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sma","CreatedById":67377,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-10T21:15:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kilman54\u0022 data-cite=\u0022kilman54\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESMA,\u003Cp\u003EYou would get more accurate fuel values if you activate the asparagus stages first, check the fuel, then active the main engine - all before launch. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssuming all asparagus stages are identical:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003Eset acount to 3. // How many stages are asparagus.\u003Cbr\u003Eset totalfuel to \u0026lt;liquidfuel\u0026gt;.\u003Cbr\u003Estage. wait 1. //all asparagus stages activated but not main engine.\u003Cbr\u003Eset aspfuel to stage:liquidfuel. //total fuel in the 3 stages\u003Cbr\u003Eset eachstagefuel to aspfuel /acount.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003Estage. //main engine start and clamp release\u003Cbr\u003Elock throttle to 1.\u003Cbr\u003Eset x to acount.\u003Cbr\u003Eset spentstages to 0.\u003Cbr\u003Euntil x = 0 {\u003Cbr\u003E   set currenttotal to \u0026lt;liquidfuel\u0026gt;\u003Cbr\u003E   if currenttotal \u0026lt; (totalfuel-(eachstagefuel *(spentstages\u002B1)) { \u003Cbr\u003E      stage. \u003Cbr\u003E      set x to spentstages\u002B1. \u003Cbr\u003E      set spentstages to acount-x. \u003Cbr\u003E   }.\u003Cbr\u003E}.\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously, you have to adjust to include launch code, like the gravity turn but it\u0027s a start!\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was having problems with this for a while last night.
