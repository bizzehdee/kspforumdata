The economy (contracts, parts, building upgrades especially with penalty slider) is totally imbalanced anyway, and contracts are mainly for roleplaying. No real reason to balance the contracts when the rest is so imbalanced anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.

The whole stock contract system is a major headache. The SETI contracts have to be competitive with totally imbalanced stock contracts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI agree that it is not balanced, but I kind of lack the motivation to solve all the underlying problems or put time into really balancing the SETI contracts if everything else is a total mess.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt works for casual derping around, everything else requires roleplay anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConsidering the recent squad updates, that is working as intended by squad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedit: I have some more challenging gameplay in mind, might do some minor rebalances of the contracts if I feel bored enough to fight the squad windmills of unmotivated disimprovements.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Targa","CreatedById":116596,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T00:03:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Landwalker\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Landwalker\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf you\u0027re rolling in that much money, I want to be doing whatever you\u0027re doing...

At that point it just becomes sandbox play. This goes back to the original difficulty curve in collecting science in this game, where you could finish the tech tree before ever leaving Kerbin\u0027s SOI. For many players (myself included), this results in a loss of motivation for further exploration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpon reflection, I think that in order to play the game the way I envision it, I\u0027m going to have to come up with my own tech tree that allows base-building and mining earlier in the tech tree, while moving a number of the science-gathering instruments to later in the tech tree. This will encourage base-building on the Mun/Minmus to create a refueling station, and a slow colonization/expansion into the rest of the solar system. Unless someone knows of a mod that already does this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile I\u0027m not familiar with \u0022Bog-standard Community Tech Tree\u0022, have you tried just using that? (And if so, does/would it help with the problem you\u0027re running into?) There\u0027s also OpenTree, but I don\u0027t know where the MKS parts fall on that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also saw \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/125055-1-0-X-ETT-1-0-Engineering-Tech-Tree-%28with-flight-first-option%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis relative newcomer\u003C/a\u003E the other day.
