Distances measured in light-years or parsecs (even if it\u0027s fractional like tychochallenge suggested), SOIs on par with a kerbalized (ie. scaled down) heliopause (kerbopause?) several hundred Gm or single digit Tm (heliopause is about 18 Tm), and orbital periods measured in centuries (100 years at least, preferably quite a bit more). Perhaps in the future you could provide a config for those of us who want a larger system. That\u0027s all assuming Unity can handle those distances and doesn\u0027t just explode in a shower of kuarks and kluons (see what I did there?).\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027d also be cool to see someone (possibly myself) work on creating a nebula-like object (extremely large gas-giant- or star-based object with extremely low density and, therefore, gravity, can only be seen from a distance, maybe utilizing volumetric clouds if they can be set up to become invisible when close by), possibly even with a stellar nursery). The SoI would have to be comparatively immense (certainly larger than a normal star system\u0027s), I\u0027m thinking in the tens of Tm (tens of billions of km). Any stars inside would be bright and hot, with SoIs barely larger than a large gas giant, eccentric and randomly-inclined orbits (no ecliptic to speak of, not even any general agreement on direction, but because of the low gravity differences in orbital velocity would be relatively small), orbital periods of many centuries (millennia even, due to the low gravitational binding of the system), and possibly protoplanetary disks (volumetric-cloud-based dust rings with small asteroid objects, certainly nothing larger than pol).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd finally, because I had to remove this mod due to these bugs, any chance of fixing the somewhat-random (though generally upwards) forces at launch and inadvertently launching from some, seemingly random (but probably isn\u0027t) height bugs?.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think Oven is dead.

While you are in the Nebula, will there be an \u0022atmosphere\u0022?

I\u0027m not suggesting it would be easy by any means. The densities of nebulae are less than the density of the lunar atmosphere. To put it another way, the most perfect artificial vacuum we can create on Earth is far more dense than your average nebula. So no, there wouldn\u0027t be an atmosphere. Basically what I\u0027m suggesting is creating a very large object that has absolutely no substance, just a texture. Additionally I\u0027d look at using the Environmental Visual Enhancements mod to add volumetric \u0022clouds\u0022, however I\u0027d have to find out if there\u0027s a way to have them fade out as you get closer to them. There is virtually no visual difference between being inside a nebula and not, the only reason we can see them is that they\u0027re so massively gigantic, even so you generally can\u0027t even see most of them with your standard backyard telescope (in fact, I\u0027d be surprised if you could see any but the brightest without near-professional equipment with long exposures).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as the stellar nursery goes it\u0027d just be a collection of tiny stars in weird orbits. The protoplanetary disks would be troublesome, but might be done using EVE clouds, purely a visual thing, and a small handful of large asteroids (like Pol, Bop, and Gilly, something Ike-sized would be questionable) that may eventually become planets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022_Augustus_\u0022 data-cite=\u0022_Augustus_\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI think Oven is dead.
