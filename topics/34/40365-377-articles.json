I\u0027ve only gotten the fission reactors, thermal rocket, plasma jets, and electrical generators thus far, and I realize they probably get better with upgrades, but I haven\u0027t gotten to the science lab yet and I have to say it\u0027s kind of disappointing how useless these parts are when you get them. First I tried a nuclear rocket-powered probe, and while it had fantastic ISP (using pure hydrogen as fuel) it completely lacked the thrust to make any notable course corrections. It\u0027s presently stuck in an orbit around Duna, and the only reason it got there was because my 2nd stage 1.5m Orbital Achievement device put it there. I figured I just made an error in judgement, later tried a larger thermal rocket (2.5m) running LFO, which made decent thrust (more than the 2.5m Nerva) but weighed so much that it ran out of fuel before it got anywhere. Finally, I figured the mod\u0027s description of plasma jets indicated they were somewhat superior in thrust to the stock Ion engines, so I loaded up a probe with a tiny fission reactor, plasma jet, electrical generator, and a stack of xenon and some sensors. Total weight: 1.5 tons, and total thrust output? 0.0kn indicated. So, yeah. I get that this is supposed to be endgame stuff, but I really think I should be getting some better results, at least useful stuff, even if it could be better. For example, the thermal rockets should be a bit more powerful considering that each one of them MUST be attached to a nuclear reactor, so building a craft with more than one of them requires more than one reactor, plus cooling stuff for it. \u003Cp\u003EEither that or I\u0027m just doing something horribly wrong and misread something, so feel free to correct me if I\u0027ve missed something...\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing microwave energy beaming technology the thermal rocket engines attached directly to the microwave heating units, I have produced probes with 250ms2 accel that blow up at full accel.

The real world moon is supposed to have a bit, all be it in still very small concentrations. I still have concerns about this - Mun would make life just a little bit too easy in my opinion. Mun of course also doesn\u0027t have to be an exact analogue of our own, so maybe this idea would work but use it on other bodies. Maybe Tylo would be a perfect place to have some, still making He3 something of a challenge. I also think cloud harvesting is a brilliant fun engineering challenge (far different from yet another \u0027land a base on X and press extract\u0027) and thus should still be the best source of He3. Perhaps this is exactly what Fractal had in mind? The best way to make this more relevant is an quantity increase in Jool. 10x Would make large harvesters like my own able to fill a tank in 12 minutes instead of 120 - a good upgrade. It could even be increased further to allow for higher atmosphere dives to pull in small quantities and deep dives to rapidly fill many tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe bigger issue still remains - what the hell is the point of it in Fusion? The larger reactors become worthless and the smaller ones are well, small!

Currently KSPI hardly incentivizes ISRU at all, and since using He-3 requires you to have the delta-V to send a ship out into Jool AND come back you run into the issue of it costing more than it\u0027s worth in terms of gameplay. Adding He-3 to the moon adds a much needed early source of He-3, and allows you to set off for jool using only the reactor that you plan to use there. What I think is the best approach to this is adding a very small concentration of Munar He-3 to the game, and then increase the concentration of He-3 in Jool\u0027s atmosphere to provide a progressive and useful gameplay dynamic.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cy-one","CreatedById":74874,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-18T20:44:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy new nuclear plant, ready to beam 40\u002B GW into spaaaace.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know that the atmosphere will reduce the efficiency a lot, but for now it should suffice \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIncludes a refinery under the transceiver.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i4.minus.com/iboc6fPc2O3uTU.png\u0022 alt=\u0022iboc6fPc2O3uTU.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"phoenix_ca","CreatedById":50380,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-18T20:57:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy are you using two generators on fission reactors?
