If the engine is not pressure fed (on J_Davis stockalike config all O enginesare pressure fed, (s)he said also U\u002B but I\u0027m not sure, the Vesta isn\u0027t) you need something to push the fuel to the bottom. On the launch pad or after a landing for example on the Mun it is done by gravity. As long as engines are running they push the craft against the fuel. Although if your engine isn\u0027t powerful enough and you are in an atmosphere it might happen that the atmosphere is slowing the craft down which results in the fuel floating around or even \u0022splashing\u0022 on the other side. And when no engine is running you are in weightlessness (especially if you are not in an atmosphere) which cases the fuel to float around so it might leave the input the turbopumps. That\u0027s why shortly after cut of it is still (very) stable, but after time it gets unstable. A trick might be to centrifuge the fuel to the end, but be careful with starting your engine. HoneyFox (the developer of that mod) suggest to throttle up slowly to avoid draining the input of the turbopumps to quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut usually you have some sort of engine which can be start always which pushes the craft a little bit forward resulting in the movement of the fuel to the engine. I suggest to use Sepatrons, or if you have KW Rocketry installed the Ullage Motors to push the craft slightly forward. RCS normally doesn\u0027t suffice as the thrust is to low, or you need quite a bit of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFabian\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/51880-0-23-Engine-Ignitor-%28V3-1-Released-Dec-27-2013%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThis is the mod we are talking about\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chebalu","CreatedById":34329,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-25T19:13:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks xZise!
