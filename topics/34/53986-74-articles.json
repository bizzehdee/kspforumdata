I finally decided to give this mod a try, got every mod I wanted in it (pretty much) up and running, slapped on mechjeb for delta v calculations, built a 3 stage kerolox rocket and launched 3 intrepid Kerbals into the black. I ended up giving too much delta v (8000 m/s because I like to be liberal with delta v) but couldn\u0027t throttle down when I was nearing apoapsis because I am using real engines and ignitors so I ended up in a 350 km/350 km orbit (after circularizing with my 5oo delta v crew pod).

You learn a lot of stuff along the way: Building a re-entry capable space plane, flying a brick, learning to deal with off-center thrust, SRB\u0027s, huge tanks that need to be aerodynamical, using 3 gimbaling engines, having an extremely low amount of orbit delta-v (about 400m/s), learning to adapt your payloads instead of your rockets (you have to make the payload fit), weird angle dockings, putting RCS on abnormal rockets. Since you do the same type of launch a lot of times, you learn to optimize it perfectly and make orbit with as little fuel as possible. I, an experienced player (I\u0027ve got to the moon and back with engine ignitor, built countless stations, organized over 5 GEO satellite arrays and have a fleet of extremely optimized rockets) still haven\u0027t been able to make a shuttle.

Also that doesn\u0027t seem enough to make orbit anyway, especially a 350km one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt; I feel so accomplished right now. I am getting psyched up for my lunar mission and can\u0027t wait to get there! Then I\u0027m gonna go to Mars... that will be super exciting because even WE haven\u0027t done that yet!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t worry, the roller coaster of emotions in a lunar trip are incredible, it is definitely worth it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt;I\u0027m still debating whether I should build a space shuttle, I know I can but is it practical... hmmm. I\u0027m sure I can build a space station with fewer launches using a heavy lift rather than using a shuttle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBuild the shuttle. You learn a lot of stuff along the way: Building a re-entry capable space plane, flying a brick, learning to deal with off-center thrust, SRB\u0027s, huge tanks that need to be aerodynamical, using 3 gimbaling engines, having an extremely low amount of orbit delta-v (about 400m/s), learning to adapt your payloads instead of your rockets (you have to make the payload fit), weird angle dockings, putting RCS on abnormal rockets. Since you do the same type of launch a lot of times, you learn to optimize it perfectly and make orbit with as little fuel as possible. I, an experienced player (I\u0027ve got to the moon and back with engine ignitor, built countless stations, organized over 5 GEO satellite arrays and have a fleet of extremely optimized rockets) still haven\u0027t been able to make a shuttle. I wish I could reap those benefits. It is in no way easy, but it gives a lot of advantages. Good luck anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI made it into that orbit with ~8000 m/s delta v... it takes 7500 m/s to make LEO doesn\u0027t it? I reached the 350 apoapsis with my second stage by accident, my periaps was about 23 km. I staged and used 73.5 m/s delta v to circularize. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think u may have misunderstood me. I\u0027ll try to be more clear in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve built shuttles before with FAR and B9. the CoM and thrust vectoring are a huge pain in the butt. Gimbaled engines help, but I have the most problems with the SRB\u0027s and getting them to counter balance the 3 SSME engines. If it isn\u0027t perfect, the entire thing flips. And that\u0027s without payloads! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I decide to build a shuttle, it is going to have to lift as much if not more than the RL shuttle, function exactly the same way and have the exact same specs (almost). It can be done, it will just take a lot of trial and error. If I can improve on the shutle design, I will, but as of right now I need to get it off the ground first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHonestly, I would much rather have a kerolox based shuttle rather than a hydrolox based shuttle BUT the SSME\u0027s are designed for hydrolox and they are one of the few rocket engines that can throttle... something that is very important when attached to psychopathic boosters like SRB\u0027s.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Agathorn","CreatedById":99662,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-22T02:10:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Hodo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Hodo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYeah pretty much, everything is up to date up there last I checked a week ago.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!

I finally decided to give this mod a try, got every mod I wanted in it (pretty much) up and running, slapped on mechjeb for delta v calculations, built a 3 stage kerolox rocket and launched 3 intrepid Kerbals into the black. I ended up giving too much delta v (8000 m/s because I like to be liberal with delta v) but couldn\u0027t throttle down when I was nearing apoapsis because I am using real engines and ignitors so I ended up in a 350 km/350 km orbit (after circularizing with my 5oo delta v crew pod). It happened too fast to compensate. \u003Cp\u003EWhat really caught me by surprise was that pods no longer have control moment gyros, I had to use RCS to make attitude control adjustments. THAT put a HUGE grin on my face!
