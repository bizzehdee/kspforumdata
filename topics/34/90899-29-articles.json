It\u0027s not as simple as momentum conservation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe closest one to your gravity gradients having an effect is the \u0022Angular Momentum\u0022 model. That\u0027s the one Serino and I wrote that was the original \u0022alternate physics\u0022 you see being spoke of. Basically the idea is that in order to not get massive amounts of free potential energy, your velocity must reduce. We have the game constantly recalculate and re-set your velocity so that your angular momentum magnitude remains intact. It behaves a lot different than the linear momentum preservation model. You can set that in the VAB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe properties of exotic matter are a bit hand-wavey (as is everything with warp drive). Partly because it has never been observed in nature and as far as Alcubierre\u0027s drive goes its a result of the thing you\u0027d need to get it to work (negative energy), not really something described by the standard model.

Mostly what is currently being tested in reality is more of a booster version similar to the original way this drive works but instead of just jumping you up to 15c it would instead multiply your true velocity to create an apparent velocity. Simple answer is that if we can make it then more than likely it will be a drive that makes it so you appear to move 100x faster than what you actually are. What I am currently working on is one proposed outcome that just makes you go X speed but conserves all your energy so when you exit the bubble then the universe punches you in the gut with a reality check. This is a less common idea of how it would work since we aren\u0027t sure how things would behave. As for my model of this idea as I said it will be Soon since KSP doesn\u0027t like complex math, nor some of it\u0027s own variable strangely, and krakensbane makes using vectors a pain in the ass, especially with how many I would need to use.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"futrtrubl","CreatedById":77310,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T02:22:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022eliminate1337\u0022 data-cite=\u0022eliminate1337\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a ton of mods installed but all through CKAN so there shouldn\u0027t be any incompatibilities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sorry I have nothing to add to help your issue, though I know it has been brought up before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut that sentence of yours that I quoted.... that gave me a good laugh.

For example, my module does not need or use an underlying ModuleEngines, which also means that I\u0027ve come up with my own formulas for how much ElectricCharge and WarpPlasma to use. It also includes the ability to expand the warp bubble via another part, which is something RoverDude has said he\u0027s against, I believe. Then there are just all the little details like how I changed the failsafe altitudes and how the drive reacts when it flames out and stuff like that, which admittedly could be all put into if statements, but it makes the code longer and uglier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, basically, avoiding mod fragmentation and working for mutual benefit are definitely worthwhile goals and I support them, but I have some pretty strong opinions about how I want my idea of a warp drive to work and I don\u0027t want to clash with anyone. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SimBobHorner","CreatedById":145241,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T18:21:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EApsolutely brilliant mod!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe asthetics are just amazing!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing though, ive tries launching it from the launchpad and it doesnt seem to work.
