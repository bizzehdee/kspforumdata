The F-1 engine mount is missing the characteristic black and white pattern, and the red and yellow looks pretty weird.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The LM descent stage VAB icon has the extreme zoom bug caused by its .cfg having 3 resources without a module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-I can\u0027t get any of the 3 ALSEP instruments to attach to the ALSEP box properly (this was an issue before, so maybe I\u0027m just missing something).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-When put together, this is a very wobbly rocket.
