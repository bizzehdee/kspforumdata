The stock panels, which *appear* to rotate to avoid getting hit with solar heat... actually don\u0027t. Yes, it looks like they do. But if you go and look at their radiation flux with the thermal debugging turned on, the actual thermal behavior completely ignores the apparent position, and just acts like the panels are fixed in place. [Detailed discussion here](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/136297). It\u0027s clearly a bug.\n\nRandazzo was kind enough to jump in on the thread and test his own panels-- and they actually work, unlike the stock panels.\n\nSo kudos to Heat Management: you did a better job than Squad did. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n(In Squad\u0027s defense: NathanKell jumped in on the thread I linked to above, and indicated that they\u0027re aware of the problem and are working on it. Presumably 1.05 will fix the problem. However, until it comes out, this mod is the only game in town for dealing with solar heating.)"},{"CreatedByName":"Randazzo","CreatedById":136468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-11T23:54:29Z","Content":"Update for 1.0.5 is out.\n\nAHMS performance is slightly different but still should be sufficiently overpowered.
