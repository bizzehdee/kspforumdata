The payload mass is just that, the stuff you put on the rocket.\n\nBelow is four plots with the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E ratio for mutliple pairings of booster mass - payload mass, giving a 2D color map.\n\nSpoiler\n\n![Vn3fPkV.png](https://i.imgur.com/Vn3fPkV.png)\n\n![mRkAbZM.png](https://i.imgur.com/mRkAbZM.png)\n\n![KBmChAZ.png](https://i.imgur.com/KBmChAZ.png)\n\n![Tyv44J9.png](https://i.imgur.com/Tyv44J9.png)\n\nLong story short : with regular tanks, LH2O is nearly always worse in terms of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E. Not by much in quite a lot of cases, but worse. All pairs except wolfhound - tharsis, are nearly perfectly balanced with the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E engines in terms of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E. The wolfhound - tharsis pair is the exception with the wolfhound being slightly better to a lot better in terms of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E. This is due to the very good (godlike) \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E of the wolfhound.\n\n\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E always wins for large booster mass - small payload mass from the much better mass fraction from the tanks.\n\nHowever, the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E is massively favoring LH2O in the following pairings : pavonis has \u002B40% thrust over the cheetah, the ulysses has \u002B50% thrust over the poodle. terrier - hecate and wolfhound - tharsis are balanced in term of thrust.\n\nUsing dedicated cryo tanks for the LH2O engines give them \u002B30% to \u002B55% \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E over an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E setup. (so, not for upper stage in atmo since cryo tanks would blow up, but out of the atmosphere, it\u0027s amazing.) If one account for the powersupply and power storage as part of the mass fraction the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E edge over \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E goes down to \u002B20% to \u002B45%. Still very good.\n\nI haven\u0027t tested, but it might be better to use a cryo tank with a fairing rather than a regular tank if one build an LH2O upper stage.\n\nIf you are interested I can pretty much test any engine pairing, such as comparing nuclear-thermal to LH2O engines.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-01-13T15:29:02Z\u0022 title=\u002201/13/2020 03:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 13, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Muetdhiver**"},{"CreatedByName":"Nertea","CreatedById":83952,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-01-13T16:43:03Z","Content":"Thanks for the analysis.
