The part shall be 6.604m wide at the top, 10.058m wide at the bottom, and 5.778m tall. The walls should be say .1 meter thick (we can do some research to determine what it is).

That said, because there are no reaction wheels, if RCS is broken, starts spinning, there is nothing there to stop it. The blowing up of interstage I noticed yesterday during my first flight testing. Sizes, weight, fuel load was first, no comes the flight testing to make sure it all comes together.

There are no reaction wheels present though, so it must use other means (IE RCS) in order to keep itself pointed in the direction you want. Well at this time the RCS is screwed up. Until that is fixed, it\u0027s not going to work. One could make a work around, but I\u0027m going to give DennyTX a shout and see what he can do first, then it\u0027s up to Frizzank to include it in FASA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I need to suggest to DennyTX to rework his RCS for the Apollo Command Module. First, there are 12 engines in the real deal. He has modeled 8, missing the 4 roll engines outright, and 6 of the others are wrong compared to real life. The pod that is placed near the forward tunnel, under the front heat shield, fires outward, as is modeled it\u0027s the only one that is the same as real life, BUT it\u0027s on the WRONG SIDE, the top of the Command Module needs flipped 180. Once that is fixed, all will be well again. DennyTX has two options as I see, model the RCS trust transforms and visual model into the Command Pod itself, which with the advent of ModuleRCSFX resolves all issues that otherwise would have occured, or he can make 1 new RCS pod model, one with the trust transforms that fire correctly for roll and cut out 2 sections in the command module to place them. Then it would be up to the individual to place them correctly. I obviously am in favor of just building the entire command module model correctly with the transforms and let ModuleRCSFX do the work, but others don\u0027t like that.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-28T16:48:16Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2014 04:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by RedAV8R\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BombastixderTeutone","CreatedById":104840,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-28T16:39:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not talking about RCS but about the gimbal of the different rocket stages, they don\u0027t act right and I have no clue what causes this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RedAV8R","CreatedById":94171,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-28T16:46:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022BombastixderTeutone\u0022 data-cite=\u0022BombastixderTeutone\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m not talking about RCS but about the gimbal of the different rocket stages, they don\u0027t act right and I have no clue what causes this.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell talking about RCS then SAS and so on, one was led to believe you were.
