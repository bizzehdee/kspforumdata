When these are released, there will be a grand total of TWO choices for dedicated VTOL engines, these and the B9\u0027s. And the B9 ones are messed up now, IMO, because of their latest update adding too many variables to set in assembly, and then the engines rotating the wrong way when you go to launch. I just want engines that rotate 90 deg. down for vertical takeoff, then go to level for forward flight. And also maybe can be set at 15 degree increments in between, and that\u0027s it. Well, the fact that you\u0027ve integrated landing feet into them is awesomely cool, too, saves on part count. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWill these be available in multiple sizes?
