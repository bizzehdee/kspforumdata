It should by all accounts it should continue to accerlate, but instead it starts to slow down and lose power. The aircraft is flying mostly level, with a 500mm/s rate of climb (yes that is milimeters a second). Instead of continuing to push past mach 3, it suddenly starts to lose power and slow down. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I get home I will post pics of the craft and let you figure it out.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-27T22:32:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere is the pictures I said I would post.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think I figured out the ramjet, but it still doesnt fell right. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/ico76\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
