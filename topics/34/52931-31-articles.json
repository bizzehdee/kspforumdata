Also does the number of chutes refer to the number of chute parts used or the number actually deployed? For example the main chute part will deploy 3 chutes while the radial will only deploy 1. So if I\u0027m calculating the diameter needed for a main chute do I plug 3 into the chute count?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust saw your post in the development thread - I get now that parachute count refers to part count used (duh, since there are two separate calculation modes in the app) and I understand a bit more what the drag coefficient is for but still not quite sure...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-17T16:20:24Z\u0022 title=\u002202/17/2014 04:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 17, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Gaiiden\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
