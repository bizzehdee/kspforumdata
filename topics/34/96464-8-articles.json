Both activate on staging (for powered tower jettison during ascent). Then you add \u0022activate engine\u0022 for the LES to the abort group, along with decoupling from rocket or service module. Then on abort you hit abort; tower fires. Then you can stage normally to jettison it via decoupler.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor added security you can set a second action group button (I use 5 instead of abort/backspace) that will activate the decoupler on the tower, decouple heatshield and any other remaining parts, and trigger parachutes.
