Furthermore the PART{} wrapper that has somehow confused a bunch of people makes it so .cfgs don\u0027t really matter ether, the system treats them as a folder and parses what\u0027s in them. Important to note, KSP Does Not load the File into memory. What it does is it reads the file, and loads the nodes, PART{}, RESOURCE_DEFINITION{}, INTERNAL{}, PROP{}, and probably some others I don\u0027t know about, into memory, then closes the file. As you can see from that, it does not matter where your .cfg is, or what is in it, at all. Any organization you choose to do is purely for your own benefit.

I don\u0027t know if .20.1 or .20.2 fixed the reference thing but I intend to make it so there is one set of model files in /GameData/HexCans/ and all of the parts will reference them, bringing the total model count down from 14 to 4. However, the textures and .cfgs will remain where they are. As I said, you can have any number of any root nodes in any .cfg file, but this does make it substantially more difficult to keep track of changes as you may have edited This part of That file, but not the other part, and as mentioned, the .cfg does not matter, the number of them does not matter, having fewer of them only minutely reduces the distributed file size, it Does Not Impact The Game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETechnically speaking, you could have every part in the game, every resource, and every IVA set and it\u0027s props, all defined in a single giant ungodly file.
