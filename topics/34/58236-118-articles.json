So you can go quick and dirty and multiply the stock capacity of a tank by 5. This only works for Mono/LF/O. Xenon and ElectricCharge don\u0026#39;t work that way. The [B]real[/B] way is to calculate dimensions of the stock part and calculate the volume of a pill tank (two half-spheres on either ends of a cylinder) that fits inside. Add or subtract as needed for the particular part. Go math. :) Also, you don\u0026#39;t define resources as your tank type. A tank type defines what resources can fill it. So, Default tanks basically take any rocket fuel/propellant. ServiceModule is pressurized and can take pretty much anything. Cryogenic tanks can take the same as default (I believe) but reduce the boiloff penalties for cryogenic fuels at the cost of extra weight. And so on. Check out the links on the first page for more info.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n2) Your engines define your fuel/propellant mixtures, as in real life. Your tanks can be filled to match the engine ratios in the VAB/SPH. So, as long as you pay attention in the VAB, you\u0026#39;ll always burn evenly. Also remember that in KSP the ratios are [B]volumes[/B]. Most resources online that talk about ratios are [B]mass[/B] ratios. More maths to get from one to the other.

As a rule, I always use the service module tank type for my final stage tank so that I don\u0026#39;t have to mess around with ullage when I\u0026#39;m trying to perfect an orbit, but I\u0026#39;ve noticed with the most recent version (both of KSP and RF since I haven\u0026#39;t played since 0.90) that the service module tank type will often allow fuel to go into the \u0022very unstable\u0022 condition, even though it is listed as being pressurized. This seems to happen most often after the craft has been coasting for a time and can usually be corrected by imparting some centrifugal force onto the tank, but unless something has changed that I missed, if the tank is pressurized, there should be no ullage simulation at all, right?[/QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\nPressurized tank have no effects on ullage you still need rcs or solid motors to promote propellant stability. :)\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpacedInvader","CreatedById":106018,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-26T20:20:33Z","Content":"\n[quote name=\u0027Svm420\u0027]Pressurized tank have no effects on ullage you still need rcs or solid motors to promote propellant stability. :)[/QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis appears to be new then... in the past a pressurized tank (service module) \u002B a pressure-fed engine (orbital maneuvering engine) = no ullage simulation.

That all said, is RCS the best way to handle ullage on satellite sized craft? Also, when asked about the absence of pressure-fed engines in the config, Raptor831 mentioned in the stockalike configs thread that he was probably going to be making all of the orbital engines pressure fed soon, after which he\u0026#39;d add / remove from the list as needed.
