However, would it maybe be possible to get more simplified single engines? Like the ones from Lazteks SpaceX pack. There is a\u00A0good reason why he chose to make his 1st stage engines as simple models, and that was in order to keep the poly count down.\u00A0Your models are all amazing, but are known\u00A0for being super high-detail and very polygon heavy. Just the 9 high-detail engines alone, with the colliders and textures is pretty insane, and then when you add on all the other parts, including a high-detail 1D vacuum engine, things tend to go slow in the game.
