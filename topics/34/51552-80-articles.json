The process involved editing the Remotech_settings.cfg file I have looked in my remote tech folder and I have 4 .cfg files, none of them named settings. Could someone clarify what exactly I need to modify? I am not a programmer so kindly do not use the word \u0022obviously\u0022 in your answer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) The flight computer built into remotetech, how do I operate it? I have seen people talk about putting delayed commands into it to perform actions when a probe has no active communications. How do I do this? I have tried pressing some of the buttons and all it does is spin my ship around. All I want to be able to do is to re-activate an antenna after re-entry. A simple, \u0022wait 10 minutes then turn this bit on\u0022 is all I need.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Settings file is only created on first loading... not sure if you need to just load ksp or start a game and launchpad something with a probe core on it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFile will be named: RemoteTech_Settings.cfg\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDefault line will read:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnableSignalDelay = True\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChange to:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnableSignalDelay = False\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Flight compute has an arrow in the lower right to expand it. In the lower right of the expanded view there is a box you can enter a time into. You can put seconds/hours/days etc and hit enter. Just to the left of the box the current command delay should be shown. Try setting that box to your time, hit enter, then hit your command group button. If it worked it should queue up a command the area just above it with a countdown. Confirmed, action groups work with delay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe navigation buttons will point to useful points on the nav ball, but the current computer seems to bounce around a lot before getting on target.

I stand corrected. Think I\u0027m still going to setup a stationary network though and make it more for missions that go beyond Kerbins SOI. I\u0027ve been thinking of setting up a 4sat 300-400km network to handle missions closer to Kerbin, which will require less power to run so not as worried about periods when the sun isn\u0027t visible. \u003Cp\u003EOne problem I was thinking of with geostationary was that if you\u0027re not using RTG\u0027s and you\u0027re not careful enough about where the 3 sats are one may end up in darkness, not sure for how long though as the further out you go the less time you would be in shadow. So far I haven\u0027t actually experienced that yet though, had been trying to use kOS to setup the network. Same would go for lower orbit, although not being \u0022stationary\u0022 I would imagine they might recover faster because of the faster orbital speed.
