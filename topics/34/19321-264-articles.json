Along the direction of travel, the CoP needs to be \u003Cem\u003Ebehind\u003C/em\u003E the CoM for stability. So when you\u0027re launching a rocket, you want the CoP to be more towards the engines than the CoM, and when you\u0027re reentering, you want the CoP farther from the heatshield than the CoM. The other trick is that in the VAB, the direction of travel is always modeled toward the roof, even if you flip the whole rocket upside down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI ran a couple more tests with the pod.
