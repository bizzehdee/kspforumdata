Sorry, got a toad in my throat. Anyway, the other thread that had the latest version link in it (the latest version is on space port, and of course, fixes everywhere on the forums for .20) was consumed by the April purge. The April purge was when the forums went down due to a lot of somethings, and the forum managers hadn\u0027t actually been keeping good backups of the forums, or they got corrupted by something else. The managers were forced to use an october 2012 backup as it was the cleanest. Unfortunately, people lost accounts, and threads were wiped away. This included the newest KW thread.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow to inspire hope for people: Kyle and Winston (why do you think it\u0027s called KW pack?) have gone on Hiatus before. Right before the .18 update, they were no where to be seen (I even complained about this back then on this very thread, though I think the post was purged). After the .18 update, Kyle and Winston suddenly appeared with a completely new update on the KW pack that they had been working on without putting out a lot of news. The even updated it a few times before going on Hiatus once again. The last thing we heard from them is they were updating the Ceres craft (seen on first page of this thread, though that isn\u0027t the updated version of course). Since the .20 update just came out, K and W might be working on a release as we speak, and will get to us once complete.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow to drive that hope away: There is always the possibility that they have decided to give up on KSP due to:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-KSP not being optimized*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Real Life Problems (so pesky this Real Life thing)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Computer melt downs leading to loss of data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The FBI finally caught up with them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Of course I know KSP is only in Alpha, but K and W might not want to constantly update something over and over again.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shadowsutekh","CreatedById":55189,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-28T01:40:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKW Rocketry for 19.1, and legacy compatibility for .20 can be downloaded at spaceport here: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/0-18-1-kw-rocketry-overhauled/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/0-18-1-kw-rocketry-overhauled/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis thread is now locked while we wait for Winston to post a new updated thread. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor now questions should be directed to addon support.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
