It is a compressibility effect rather than a friction effect (much like how the bottom of your bike pump heats up when you pump up your bike tire). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe model assumes that the supersonic shock is detached from the spacecraft (i.e. a normal or strong shock) rather than a weaker oblique shock. The equations that I use for this are really only valid for air and up to about Mach 5.0, but this is a game not a physics simulation so I\u0027m taking some liberties. The results are in the right ballpark, relative to the expected values. I then calculate the temperature of the heat shield due to convective heating effects, again making some gross simplifications because this is after all just a game. You can read more about the physics model that I use \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/showthread.php/13271-Re-entry-Heating-Model\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E if you are interested.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for why coming in more steeply causes less heating than coming in at a shallow angle: You are exposed to the highest temperatures for less time when you re-enter steeply, as compared to when you enter at a shallow angle. Think of it like fried ice cream or waving your hand through a flame. You can expose objects to very high temperatures for short periods without appreciable heating. When you do a very steep re-entry, the spacecraft slows down so fast due to atmospheric drag that it doesn\u0027t have time to heat up. In that case, the spacecraft is destroyed by g-forces, rather than heating. I regard this effect as another piece of evidence that the re-entry heating physics model is actually working the way it should.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the case of the Duna entry, maybe try going for a more shallow entry angle? The limit for the parachute is Mach 2.0, so you can open it at greater than 400 m/s. Maybe I need to expose the parachute Mach limit in the part.cfg file? That way it could be set higher if it needs to be. That being said, I referenced Curiosity\u0027s parachute\u0027s Mach limit when I chose the Mach 2.0 value.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn real life Mars entry, speeds are considerably lower than for Earth, but the heat shield still needs to be very well designed. According to Table 1 in the JPL paper \u0022\u003Ca href=\u0022http://trs-new.jpl.nasa.gov/dspace/bitstream/2014/41591/1/09-4690.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E2011 Mars Science Laboratory Mission Design Overview\u003C/a\u003E\u0022, Curiosity reached Mars with an atmosphere relative entry speed of about 5.5 km/s. That is roughly 2 km/s less than the shuttle\u0027s re-entry speed. Even so, radiation heat transfer effects are more significant during Mars entry than for Earth entry. My best guess as to why is that Mars\u0027 atmosphere (mostly CO\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E) is a strong greenhouse gas that reflects heat rather than transmitting it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-09-30T23:12:59Z\u0022 title=\u002209/30/2012 11:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 30, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by PakledHostage\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbalboy2000","CreatedById":22597,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-30T21:28:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESir we have a presentation in our Science Option and I used this to simulate re-entry, I also mentioned your name, greetings from Canada.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Subcidal","CreatedById":20751,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-30T22:05:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sorry if i missed it, But did you do something with all parts?

That slight angle gave them a bit of lift. I figure I could simulate this by offsetting the reference vector that I use in the inherent stability routines. The reference vector is fixed to the spacecraft and is always held in alignment with the retrograde vector by the inherent stability functions. The reference vector is currently pointed straight out the top of the capsule. I could rotate it so that it is still coming out of the top of the capsule, but adjusted a few degrees away from the hatch. I could then simulate a lift force, which would be oriented perpendicular to the direction of travel and towards the hatch. You could steer the capsule slightly during re-entry by rotating the crew hatch towards the direction you want to deflect your trajectory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do people think?

I\u0027ll look into it. What if you try it without jettisoning the heat shield? It could also very well be because you are using an unmanned pod.

I have never actually flown there myself so I don\u0027t know anything about it. (I set myself the goal of reaching each of the new planets NASA style... That is, the first time I try, no pressing f9, and with the smallest rocket possible. That requires a bit of planning.) If it is because Duna\u0027s air is thin, then I will have to tweak the atmosphere specific constants for Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will also look into how hard it will be to add simple sound effects.

In my module, I check the game\u0027s built-in \u0022vessel.isCommandable\u0022 flag to decide if certain things should happen. Maybe that flag isn\u0027t being set correctly in the unmanned part mod that you are using? This would explain what you\u0027re reporting.
