Some inspiration, food for thought. Not that you seemed bored and in need of new part ideas but here it is anyway.\u003Cp\u003ETo start, put the thermal jet engine in your brain. Runs off nuke as the heat source for the typical \u0022combustion\u0022 stage. right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Enow:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Snip*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a combined jet engine and generator. The performance is basically that of a jet, but if the generator loads it down then thrust will drop. On the other hand, it can generate a fair amount of juice this way. It only functions if there\u0027s atmosphere, but does not require any fuel other than the reactor. As a generator, it should be lightweight and efficient compared to the one\u0027s we\u0027re used to in this mod (But it only works in atmosphere).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Snip*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a side-mount concept featuring two of those offset jet generator things into an integrated reactor. Basically a one-stop shop to make something move in the atmosphere. It\u0027s by itself here so no scale, but I imagine a small one would have a probe with small wings cruising nicely or make a rockin KAS jetpack. Or just a really convenient generator. Normal size would be similar thrust to a single turbojet and capable of jamming out a few MJ if needed. Maybe half actually.. Very modest, but also very lightweight. Ideal for a scout type plane setup where you aren\u0027t looking to charge an FTL jump or anything. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Snip*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esimilar concept, this is a larger inline style shown with Mk 1 cockpit and sandwiched between 2 fuel tanks. Not that it needs fuel but this layout kinda makes a hole for something to go there. The scale I drew is also kinda big, that thing would haul ass. Probly oversized.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis could perhaps be a large sidemount meant to stick onto existing reactor part. Again, mostly redundant to the existing thermal jet but contains generator. as a non-integrated setup it seems maybe too redundant?

I could be wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReally though, even an AM reactor would just be little bits of AM that are used to ignite magnetically compressed hydrogen to get it to a usable plasma state without having to use a bunch of power for massive lasers too. Otherwise, an AM reactor wouldn\u0027t produce much (currently) usable energy at all. It\u0027d generate a lot of thermal potential, but not all that much more than most nuclear reactors, and that would be only a tiny fraction of its power...the rest would be wasted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we really want to get the most out of any such reactors, we\u0027ll have to develop materials that, in concert, are capable of interacting with the radiation from the reaction the same way solar panels convert visible wavelength photons into electricity. In the meantime, our only options are to use as much of the energy to generate as much heat as possible to use over the broadest system to get the most mechanical/electrical potential out of it. Or, to pass the plasma through networks of coils to generate electrical fields as it passes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFortunately, there are already materials under research that will be capable of directly converting thermal energy into electrical energy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat...may have come across as patronizing or condescending.

I know certain experiments have considered using hydrogen as a medium to allow compression (with some pellet formation as a buffer), but most current concepts (and the one that\u0027s been actually built) still use a plastic film which absorbs the laser light. It vapourises and part goes out, part goes in. The inner part crushes the D\u002BT core and should lead to fusion. I don\u0027t think anyone has made ignition via this method yet, compared to Tokomak like devices. Those (as Fractal_UK said) are hard to do with pure deuterium or hydrogen based reactions. Basically D\u002BT can be done with less strenuous conditions to allow electron tunneling via indeterminacy. Um. That probably could do with more explanation but my quantum physics isn\u0027t that good. Basically it\u0027s the energy needed to get atoms (or a smaller particle and an atom) to get over their mutual repulsion and finally fuse together. D\u002BT needs lower pressure and temps than other reactions to get this condition.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"automcdonough","CreatedById":12249,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-05T02:46:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022BananaDealer\u0022 data-cite=\u0022BananaDealer\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo basically a one-piece SCRAM/Thermal Jet hybrid?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess? it started primarily as an idea for simple generator.
