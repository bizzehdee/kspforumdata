Reason: Hab of 5 for 1 crew makes stock PPD-10 unattractive with its 21 at 4 crew.  \n\nEl use is thus down accordingly.\n\n2) Nerf of 10-man hard can hab value. 53-\u003E42.  Reason: Its 53 is correct by crew capacity, but incorrect by weight. 10-man weights 5t, where (4-man) PPD-10 weights 2.5t. If 10-man hab value is calculated by capacity, then it outclasses PPD-10 in all categories, so its calculated by weight instead of capacity - hence 42 ( 2x(of PPD-10) = 2x21 = 42 ).  \n\nThat means one 10-man can weights same as two PPD-10, gives equal habitation times, but better 10 capacity instead of 8.  \n\nEL use is also down, its 2xof PPD-10 matching 2x habitation time.\n\n3) Increase for 4t inflatable 10-kerbal habitat. 21-\u003E42. Reason: doubled to match 10-kerbal hard can version.  \n\nAdvantage of inflatable is a lower weight (4t vs 5t), but it must be inflated and provides no workshop ability.  \n\nEL use is also up and same as 10-man can with same habitation time as above.\n\n4) Decrease of EL for 1-kerbal and 2-kerbal inflatables. Reason: recalculated using PPD-10 LS EL value to 5 and 10 hab value correspondingly.\n\nSpoiler\n\n@PART[MicroInflatableHAB]\n    {\n        @mass = 1.0\n        @cost = 350\n        @entryCost = 6000\n    \n        @CrewCapacity = 0\n    \n        -MODULE[ModuleAnimateGeneric] {}\n    MODULE{\tname = USIAnimation\tdeployAnimationName = TentInflate\tinflatable = true\tCrewCapacity = 1}\n    MODULE{\tname = ModuleLifeSupport}\n    MODULE {\tname = ModuleHabitation\tBaseKerbalMonths = 5\tCrewCapacity = 0\tBaseHabMultiplier = 0\tConverterName = Habitat\tStartActionName = Start Habitat\tStopActionName = Stop Habitat\t\t\tINPUT_RESOURCE\t{\t\tResourceName = ElectricCharge\t\tRatio = 0.131\t}}\t\n    MODULE{\tname = ModuleWeightDistributableCargo}MODULE{\tname = USI_InertialDampener}MODULE{\tname = MKSModule\tBonusEffect = RepBoost\tApplyBonuses = false}\t\n    \n    }\n\n    @PART[SmallInflatableHAB]\n    {\n        @mass = 2\n        @cost = 900\n        @entryCost = 10000\n    \n        @CrewCapacity = 0\n        \n        -MODULE[ModuleAnimateGeneric] {}\n    MODULE{\tname = USIAnimation\tdeployAnimationName = SmallHabInflate\tinflatable = true\tCrewCapacity = 2}\n    MODULE{\tname = ModuleLifeSupport}\n    MODULE {\tname = ModuleHabitation\tBaseKerbalMonths = 10\tCrewCapacity = 0\tBaseHabMultiplier = 0\tConverterName = Habitat\tStartActionName = Start Habitat\tStopActionName = Stop Habitat\t\t\tINPUT_RESOURCE\t{\t\tResourceName = ElectricCharge\t\tRatio = 0.262\t}}\t\n    MODULE{\tname = ModuleWeightDistributableCargo}MODULE{\tname = USI_InertialDampener}MODULE{\tname = MKSModule\tBonusEffect = RepBoost\tApplyBonuses = false}\t\n\n    }\n\n    @PART[InflatableHAB]\n    {\n        @CrewCapacity = 0\n    \n        -MODULE[ModuleAnimateGeneric] {}\n    MODULE{\tname = USIAnimation\tdeployAnimationName = LargeHabInflate\tinflatable = true\tCrewCapacity = 10}\n    MODULE{\tname = ModuleLifeSupport}\n    MODULE {\tname = ModuleHabitation\tBaseKerbalMonths = 42\tCrewCapacity = 0\tBaseHabMultiplier = 0\tConverterName = Habitat\tStartActionName = Start Habitat\tStopActionName = Stop Habitat\t\t\tINPUT_RESOURCE\t{\t\tResourceName = ElectricCharge\t\tRatio = 1.05\t}}\t\n    MODULE{\tname = ModuleWeightDistributableCargo}MODULE{\tname = USI_InertialDampener}MODULE{\tname = MKSModule\tBonusEffect = RepBoost\tApplyBonuses = false}\n    \n    }\n\n    /// DO NOT CONFUSE, this is not \u0022INFLATABLE\u0022 part.

It lets you distill Fertilizer from Mulch at a steep ratio in the Mobile Lab.\n\nMy ingame logic:  \n\nYou loose biomass in the process by pulling out all the nutrients in a bucket of Mulch to use them as Fertilizer. It can extent the time you are able to produce food, but it lowers the amount of Supplies/Mulch on the ship/station until you have none left.  \n\nAlso, never let it run for to long, or else it will grab all Mulch and your kerbonauts will sit on a pile of unedible Fertilizer!\n\n    @PART[Large_Crewed_Lab]\n    {MODULE{\tname = ModuleResourceConverter_USI\tConverterName = Compost\tStartActionName = Start Distilling Mulch\tStopActionName = Stop Distilling MulchINPUT_RESOURCE\t{\t\tResourceName = Mulch\t\tRatio = 0.025\t}\tINPUT_RESOURCE\t{\t\tResourceName = ElectricCharge\t\tRatio = 30\t}\tOUTPUT_RESOURCE\t{\t\tResourceName = Fertilizer\t\tRatio = 0.0025\t\tDumpExcess = False\t}}\t\n    }\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-08-10T12:20:02Z\u0022 title=\u002208/10/2017 12:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 10, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by KerbMav**"},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-10T12:42:39Z","Content":"I do not recommend converting mulch into fertilizer - it bypasses mechanics that are there by design, and can also cause unpredictability because you have competing, dependent converters."},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-10T13:07:57Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 20 minutes ago, RoverDude said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I do not recommend converting mulch into fertilizer - it bypasses mechanics that are there by design, and can also cause unpredictability because you have competing, dependent converters.\n\u003E \n\nI only put it into my game as a last ditch effort should I run out of fertilizer, very well aware of the fact that it takes biomass out of the circulation and will only prolong the inevitable - as well as risking to convert all mulch and having nothing left to grow new supplies from.  \n\n(I guess you wouldn\u0027t like my patch that lets you breed nuclear fuel from depleted uranium neither? ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022;)\u0022) )\n\n[@NomenNescio](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/116492-nomennescio/) So, you have hereby been warned multiple times - ~~tread~~ mod lightly! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"NomenNescio","CreatedById":116492,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-10T13:35:40Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 24 minutes ago, KerbMav said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [@NomenNescio](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/116492-nomennescio/) So, you have hereby been warned multiple times - ~~tread~~ mod lightly! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022)\n\u003E \n\nWhat is this warning of which you speak?

The crew will munch the Supplies into an equal amount of 100 Mulch.  \n\nYour orbital vegetable garden will turn 10 Mulch and 1 Fertilizer into 11 Supplies, so the amount of M\u002BS\u002BF stays the same at first, but Fertilizer being the limiting factor for how long you can repeat the cycle of Kitchen-Kerbal-Karden (sorry...).\n\nNow, if we use Mulch to create Fertilizer, we reduce the amount of available biomass in the cycle (my patch converts 10M to 1F) and if we keep doing it long enough we will have nothing left - or, if we let the Fertilizer production run for to long unobserved, we end up with a ship full of inedible Fertilizer and kill our crew even before the Supplies had run out had we done nothing.\n\nIt also reduces the maximum mission time basically, as when the Fertilizer runs out, there are still the Supplies left - but if some of the Mulch has been used to make Fertilizer, the remaining amount of (self produced) Supplies will be lower since there was less Mulch to produce them from.\n\nI only intended it to be available to me should the need arise during a mission far away, should I desperately need Fertilizer to get to a place where I can resupply either of the resources.  \n\n(\u0022Spock, we have to do something, do you have any ideas?!\u0022 - \u0022Of course, Captain, basic chemistry will safe us.\u0022)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-08-10T14:28:33Z\u0022 title=\u002208/10/2017 02:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 10, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by KerbMav**"}]}
