Perhaps at a base or to rescue a prior mission. MJ lets us target a flag or the lander for the earlier mission but often, especially on vacuum bodies, it will land right on top of the target. As I posted this morning, the accuracy is phenomenal but dangerous to both crafts in this kind of circumstance. If the KSP Map view let us zoom in much more closely, we could use the \u0022Pick a Target on the Map\u0022 feature in MJ\u0027s Landing Guidance to get close but not on top of the target.

After this it will not course correct unless the error grows to more than 600m (almost what you observed). At this point the craft will cruise until either a deceleration burn occurs (for bodies with no atmosphere) or the parachutes are deployed (bodies with an atmosphere). The the case of a deceleration burn MJ can control the overshoot / undershoot by burning more/less than it anticipated it would have to. For parachutes it can contol the overshoot/undershoot by timing when to activate the chutes. The deceleration burn seems to be more accurate, but timing the parachutes works well on bodies with thick atmosheres in flat areas. Timing parachutes around hills is hard as the AGL triggers the full deploy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be interesting to know if your landings were:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) on a body with or without an atmosphere\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) whether or not you are using parachutes\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) if you are landing on a body with a thick atmosphere (ie not Duna)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) if you were landing in a hilly area, or a landing site near a slope, or an approach path the pases over a slope.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) if the landing error was an overshoot/undershoot error or if you landed to the side of the target.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LameLefty","CreatedById":57336,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-14T16:29:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENote: I had targeted the flag (\u0022Southwest Crater\u0022 on the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn) in order to rescue Buzz Kerman, whom I had accidentally left standing at attention when his partner took off for home. Buzz is about 1.5 meters closer than the flag; you can see his helmet there close to the target marker. I only missed him by this much because I realized I was about to crush Buzz and aborted the auto-landing and did it manually. As you can see, I also forgot to deploy the landing gear.

I\u0027m experiencing a lot of nav ball target reticle jittering as a burn reaches the end, usually in the last 0.5 m/s. In the last 0.2 m/s of the burn, the reticle begins moving off-center (still shaking like a hairless dog) and the ship dutifully tries to follow it around. The other issue is when I\u0027m closing in on a rendezvous target and switch to the docking autopilot, I cannot do a \u0022control from here\u0022 when right-clicking the docking port, nor can I do a \u0022set as target\u0022 on the destination\u0027s docking port. It is acting as if the ship is still in time warp, even though the warp indicator\u0027s all say I\u0027m in normal time.
