Because KSP doesn\u0027t compute drag on unloaded vessels, but does compute acceleration from gravity, it\u0027s possible that your stage is going much faster than 2km/s at deletion. The speed at deletion will be listed in the Flight GUI and (probably) in the small message. If you feel that it\u0027s too likely for your stage to burn up (apparently the 1.0.2 heating isn\u0027t even an issue at 3km/s...) then you can either increase the DR Velocity setting (remember, it\u0027s a minimum value above which there becomes the \u003Cem\u003Epossibility\u003C/em\u003E for burning up.
