These days, I almost never put RCS on ships that will not be docking to anther ship. Saves you a TON of mass not having to put those big heavy RCS tanks and spamming your ships with RCS thruster blocks. This in turn would give you more delta-v from your launcher and interplanetary stages. If you are going to be docking an interplanetary stage to your research lander, instead put the RCS on the interplanetary stage and in turn dock it with the lander. That way your lander just needs a handful of reaction wheels to control it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, you might try to use small clusters of LV-909\u0027s or 48-7S\u0027s. Those white radial engines are pretty blah. If you want to use clusters of smaller engines, you might try to attach some engines to a small fuel tank and then you only need to run one fuel line from those large tanks on top of your labs. If you intend on landing on a planet with an atmosphere, a good mix of drogue and regular parachutes can dramatically reduce your thrust needs for landing to the point where they are just assisting with the braking and are not your primary means of slowing your descent. Granted, chutes won\u0027t help if you land on something that doesn\u0027t have an atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou mentioned you don\u0027t like making multiple trips. Another option you might consider is a seeder ship. You basically have a core interplanetary ship. Attached radially or whatever are a number of labs, each with their own landing systems. This way you can send a large number of labs to a planet/moon, and then one by one land your labs, \u0022seeding\u0022 them across the surface. Think like a dandelion or a maple tree. Would be very easy for someplace like Laythe and Eve since a couple chutes would get the job done.

I just tested the concept and it worked beautifully. I launched 5 probe cores, each with their own chutes. At apoapsis, I staged and the ship splintered into a beautiful shower of parts, 5 of them with chutes open. I was worried that drag and chutes wouldn\u0027t work properly, but it appears that as long as they all stay withing physics range, all the pods will land. I\u0027ll post a short video later tonight. I would say the advantage of doing this as opposed to using chutes to land a single large structure would be that it is probably easier on structural integrity to land a lab with its power source. The disadvantage would be that each pod has to have its own systems (like you can\u0027t use one large reactor to power 5 labs; each lab would need its own power system, radiator, etc). Or you build the scatter separation system into a large lander as a backup. That way if you get a structural failure, instead of 5 labs crashing, you might only lose 1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit 2:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScatter landing vid postponed so I can play with awesome new 0.8 update.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-24T06:30:35Z\u0022 title=\u002211/24/2013 06:30  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 24, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Eadrom\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fractal_UK","CreatedById":61595,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-24T06:18:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EVersion 0.8 Released\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe much awaited update is finally here.

Also, it takes 8 tanks to completely refuel a 3.75m fission reactor. The current amount per tank is great for the 62.5cm fission reactor, except that the tank is way, way too big for my little probes. The size of the D/T is much more useful. I can see myself using the fusion reactors and keeping a D/T on hand for resupply.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* LOVE LOVE LOVE the little tiny radiators! I really like building small, efficient ships and probes and the new fusion reactors and these new tiny radiators are perfect. They are working at radiating heat as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* The fusion reactor\u0027s tooltip in the VAB/SPH has the following error: \u0022Laser Power Consumption: MW\u0022 - it doesn\u0027t tell you how many MW are needed to kick off fusion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* The 62.5cm fusion reactor has an issue with time warping. When filling up the MJ and Thermal power bars, I can\u0027t time warp faster than 50x without the fusion reactor turning off. Once the MJ and Thermal power are filled, I can time warp up to 1,000x, but it again turns itself off on higher time warps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Similar issue with the 1.25m fusion reactor. Turns itself off at 10x time warp. When MJ and thermal power are full, turns itself off 1,000x time warp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* I was able to use a 62.5cm fission reactor attached to launch clamps to start the 62.5cm fusion reactor with a single click. I used a 1.25m fission reactor to start up the 1.25m fusion reactor, but I have to click the activate reactor button several times to get the fusion reactor to actually start up on the larger of the two fusion reactors (yes, I have more than 7 MJ resource bar).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Physical time warp also turned the fusion reactor off. It seems that as long as I still have some MJ stored up in the fusion reactor\u0027s generator, I can still turn the reactor back on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Manual D/T transfer between the tank and the fusion reactor works splendidly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Love that there is relatively very easy access for mining thorium close to the space center. What is the range on the detector? Anywhere in the SoI?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* I like that you can convert lithium to tritium still with the fusion reactors. Will make filling up a D/T tank early on during a mission easy, then I can just dump the lithium tank once the D/T tank is full. Hope this isn\u0027t a bug. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* The GRS says it can detect more common materials as well as the radioactive thorium and uranium. Does this mean it\u0027ll show what other stuff is available like aluminum or CO2?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Refinery looks awesome! Little large for my tastes, but awesome! I like the variety of attachment points as well. I am having some issues getting the top and bottom attachment nodes working. The side attachment nodes seem to be working much better. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* During testing of the microwave receiver system, I set up a little rover with a 1.25m fusion reactor. I\u0027m having issues with the fusion reactor staying on in between scene changes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* I turned on the transmitter and it just drained the MJ out of my rover, even with the two 62.5cm fission reactors and the 1.25m fusion reactor burning at 100%. Once MJ reaches 0 on the resource bar, the microwave transmitter is not transmitting any power at all. My microwave receiver on my test rocket was receiving power the first try, but when I reverted to VAB, made a tweak, and went to relaunch, the receiver wasn\u0027t getting any power at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* The transmitter was draining MJ from a 3.75m fission reactor rover w/ microwave transmitter as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* I was playing around with the thermal receiver and I was only able to get MW on the receiver by setting the two transmitters to relay mode, but only intermittently. Not sure if it\u0027s something I\u0027m doing wrong or if it\u0027s a bug. I have a small chemical stage to lift my test rocket up a bit so that the receiver should have a better line of sight/angle to the transmitters, but the one time I did get the transmitters/thermal receiver to work, my power received got WAY worse the higher I got (was only a few hundred meter boost). The thermal receiver says two satellites connected. I\u0027ll have to play around with this a bit more and see if I can figure out how to make it work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll this testing was done in sandbox mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll in all this looks to be a GREAT update and well worth the wait! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-24T10:42:19Z\u0022 title=\u002211/24/2013 10:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 24, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Eadrom\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CattyNebulart","CreatedById":79428,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-24T08:24:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETried building a simple test craft of the new reactor, and I get NaN errors;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/MhxMdZC.png\u0022 alt=\u0022MhxMdZC.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is in a sandbox game.
