Probably a stock KSP quirk, honestly. I did try placing the small rads in the service bay, but it looked ugly. Yes, functionally it was fine, but since the service bay (visually, from my PoV) wasn\u0027t meant to have stuff mount on the central shaft, I didn\u0027t like it. Plus the model for the stock rads mounting point made it look worse. (Also realized the stock rads are slightly offset. Irks the OCD in me...).\n\nI still wish there was a MK2 cargo bay that acts like a radiator when it\u0027s open. Doable in stock with an MM cfg, maybe, but nothing like that model-wise. IIRC, the real Space Shuttles use their cargo bay doors as radiators.\n\nOne other thing is a service module that has small deployable solar panels build into them. Think the stock shrouded solar panels, but integrated into a MK2 service-bay sized lifting-body part. MK2 dual-axis tracking Solar panels would be nice, but from what I\u0027ve seen of dual axis SPs, they\u0027re kinda messy to implement. (Dr. Jet\u0027s ChopShop has a couple models; they use dual SP modules to work.)\n\nOh, actually, about the MK2 Landing legs: I know someone brought up the angled foot and it being a limitation of KSP\u0027s landing gear/leg module, but have you consider using BDAnimations for the foot (assuming it would work on legs as well)? Adjustable Landing Gear lets you angle both the strut and the wheel, so maybe that could work here, though that is adding a(nother?) dependency. Though KSP 1.1 is coming with a complete rewrite of the wheel/leg module, so this is probably a moot point."},{"CreatedByName":"GERULA","CreatedById":40633,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-07T06:32:49Z","Content":"why did you remove JumpJet ? ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)((\n\nEDIT:\n\nnop, it\u0027s still there, my bad\n\nGreat mod ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-07T06:36:11Z\u0022 title=\u002210/07/2015 06:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GERULA**"},{"CreatedByName":"qm3ster","CreatedById":150338,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-07T10:43:07Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E @qm3ster; That\u0027s what I figured had happened - the install stanza confusion was from the change from find \u0027ships\u0027 to find \u0027SPH\u0027 and find \u0027VAB\u0027.

I would think AJE MM edits would happen prior to Mk2Expansion\u0027s due to the way MM sorts and prioritizes changes by default.
