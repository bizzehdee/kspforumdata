To fix the problem, you need to edit the \u0022tmr()\u0022 subroutine in the protractor - partmodule.cs file\u003Cstrong\u003E, \u003C/strong\u003Eand change the line \u0022else if (p.Modules.Contains(\u0022ModuleEnginesFx\u0022))\u0022 to \u0022else if (p.Modules.Contains(\u0022ModuleEnginesFX\u0022))\u0022 (note the capital FX). You also need to rem out the \u0022if (!me.flameout)\u0022 line, although I\u0027m not sure what flameout relates to, since as far as I know that only occurs on jet engines and you don\u0027t use them for planetary transfers (although there maybe other engines that have this property).\u003Cp\u003EAnyway I hope this helps everybody, especially mrenigma03, who created an excellent mod.

It\u0027s because Protractor assumes circular orbits and estimates based on that. Which means elliptical orbits throw off the time estimates. When things reach zero, it\u0027s still time to burn, but the time/date estimate can be off leading up to that. Let\u0027s say Moho is on the long leg of its path, then it is going slower and it will take longer than the prediction, and vice-versa.
