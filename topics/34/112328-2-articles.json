The new version does break your save (kind of). \n\nWith the change from Available to Dead upon Freezing, your existing frozen kerbals will be MIA on the Deepfreeze frozen list. They will show up in Ship Manifest, but they will not have the vessel assigned.\n\nThis can be corrected in the GameSave, by changing the Kerbal\u0027s state from Available to Dead. You can easily find them by searching for the word \u0022Unowned\u0022\n\nIf you do not want to directly edit your gamesave, I suggest you unfreeze your kerbals before upgrading DeepFreeze. Then upgrade and Refreeze your kerbals. You can recover your lost Glykerol by turning off Realism in Ship Manifest and manipulating your fill/dump for the resource, and transferring to get back to your original values. (or just refill for free, if you are not too concerned about realism).\n\nIf you have already installed the new version, simply revert to the previous version, unfreeze and then upgrade again.\n\nUpdate:\n\nAfter a bit more testing, I\u0027ve discovered that If you have already installed the upgrade prior to unfreezing your kerbals, they will no longer be associated with their respective freezer parts. you can correct this by freezing 1 kerbal in your part, and exiting the game. \n\nThen, locate the Scenario in your game save named DeepFreeze. in it you will find all your frozen kerbals, with a VesselID and part ID. These IDs will be all zeros except for the kerbal you just froze. copy the vesselID and partID from the just frozen kerbal for future use..\n\nThen, replace the vessel Id on your other kerbas with that value. If your freezer was full, then you will want to thaw the kerbal you just froze and make room. then go back into your save and replace the VesselId and partID with the values you copied.\n\nyou will also need to set the vesselname, partID, seat index (0-9), and SeatName (Seat1-10).\n\nExample:\n\n        SCENARIO    {        name = DeepFreeze        scene = 5, 6, 7, 8        DFGameSettings        {            Enabled = True            KerbalInfo            {                lastUpdate = 1246270.75248855                status = Dead                type = Unowned                vesselID = 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000                VeselName =                 partID = 0                seatIdx = 0                seatName =                 experienceTraitName = Engineer                kerbalName = Papa Joe            }            KerbalInfo            {                lastUpdate = 1246270.75248855                status = Dead                type = Unowned                vesselID = 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000                VeselName =                 partID = 0                seatIdx = 0                seatName =                 experienceTraitName = Scientist                kerbalName = Jenger Kerman            }            KerbalInfo            {                lastUpdate = 1246510.59248877                status = Dead                type = Unowned            --\u003E vesselID = b28ee9a7-f24c-4f43-9d7b-620f907a810d            --\u003E VeselName = StationLifter_sci3            --\u003E partID = 3063789044            --\u003E seatIdx = 0            --\u003E seatName = Seat1                experienceTraitName = Scientist                kerbalName = Chadwick Kerman            }        }    }In the Kerbal section:        KERBAL        {            name = Chadwick Kerman            gender = Male            type = Unowned            brave = 0.04110909            dumb = 0.9296894            badS = False            tour = False       --\u003E  state = Dead  (Change From Available to Dead)            ToD = 0            idx = -1            CAREER_LOG            {                flight = 0            }            FLIGHT_LOG            {                flight = 0                0 = Orbit,Kerbin            }        }\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-09T07:36:10Z\u0022 title=\u002206/09/2015 07:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Papa\\_Joe**"},{"CreatedByName":"JPLRepo","CreatedById":114736,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T08:14:14Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E One note for users of the previous version of DeepFreeze.

But I knew TaranisElsu was working on a new version too.. Let\u0027s see if he responds next day or two.\n\nOk, I got bored and forked TAC LS, made the changes, sent a pull request to TaranisElsu.\n\n[Source of my change is here.](https://github.com/JPLRepo/TacLifeSupport)\n\nTo fix TAC LS to work with DeepFreeze:\n\n1) Install TAC LS and DeepFreeze (if you haven\u0027t already).\n\n2) [go to this link](https://github.com/JPLRepo/DeepFreeze/blob/master/TACLSTempFixDLLs.zip) and click \u0022view raw\u0022 - yes this message isn\u0027t intuitive. This will download the ZIP file with the fixed DLLs in it.\n\n3) Install the two DLLs in the ZIP file to \u0022\u003Cyourkspinstalldir\u003E\\GameData\\ThunderAerospace\\TacLifeSupport\\\u0022 directory (ENSURE YOU OVERWRITE existing files).\u003C/yourkspinstalldir\u003E\n\n4) Done. TAC LS will now correctly ignore frozen Kerbals and won\u0027t retrospectively consume life support when they are thawed out.\n\nI have no intention on maintaining my fork. I hope TaranisElsu will merge my changes into his mod fairly soon. Will let everyone know when he does.\n\nThe ZIP file contains just the two DLLs and the TAC LS LICENSE file which permits me to do this.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-10T03:02:20Z\u0022 title=\u002206/10/2015 03:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by JPLRepo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Papa_Joe","CreatedById":10788,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T14:51:12Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Thanks Papa\\_Joe for taking the time to document this...
