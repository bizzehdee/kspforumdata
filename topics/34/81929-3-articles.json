I\u0027m assuming you\u0027re referring to the number of times they eat per day is currently 2 instead of 1? I think once every 6 hours(on average) is better than the current 3 hours.

With two time systems, it\u0027s difficult to say what a good consumption per day should be. I wish it could just be 1 snack per day, but if it\u0027s 1 per Kerbin day then it\u0027s 4 per Earth day.

Basically the part in question instead of holding snacks holds frozen snacks which would be a new a non-pumpable resource. to get snacks a kerbal has to eva over to the part and thaw some out(ResGen can accomplish this it would be a simple eva activation only frozen snacks to regular snacks conversion generator, and of course include another going in reverse for storing the snacks again) The parts big perk is it would effectively hold more snacks for a given dry mass, but the down side is it would constantly draw electricity, and if the space fridge doesn\u0027t have electricity it will start to dump the frozen snacks (ResGen can also do this with its BADINPUT functionality). This probably shouldn\u0027t be part of the core mod as it adds a new resource and as a result breaks a key unspoken rule about simplicity but it would definitely be worth it as an add on. So assuming no one gets impatient and beats me to it I should have time to hammer this out for real this weekend by turning less popular parts like the structural mk1 fuselage or the probodyne rovermate into real snack freezing power hungry space fridges.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s tempting, \u003Cstrong\u003Epassinglurker\u003C/strong\u003E, but I think it would make thinks overcomplicated...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"passinglurker","CreatedById":103157,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-22T00:06:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jlcarneiro\u0022 data-cite=\u0022jlcarneiro\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt\u0027s tempting, \u003Cstrong\u003Epassinglurker\u003C/strong\u003E, but I think it would make thinks overcomplicated...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIndeed thats why I said it would be better suited as its own extension of snacks but not part of the core mod.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tgruetzm","CreatedById":103217,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-22T01:05:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, I guess I lied.
