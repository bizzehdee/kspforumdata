Mixed feelings, though overall I think it\u0027s a good thing, just think of it as the operation that depletes the deposit registers an update to the database. Updating a map when a deposit was depleted using the old system was a pain, I usually deleted the map just so that I\u0027d know when I had scanned enough to have an accurate map again.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes. The deposit will still show up, but the color will update and the deposit will appear depleted.

If you mean the old drill then that\u0027s the culprit. It\u0027s not because its from the Kethane pack specifically it\u0027s because it is hard to place in general. So one time when you were trying to place it it looked liked failed, but actually party succeeded by adding the part link into the file without the actual part. From now on I\u0027d recommend turning on part clipping when you want to install those drills\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t have any old kethane mods.
