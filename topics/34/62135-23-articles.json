You need to stay above 39K altitude and S turn until your velocity drops at least to ~1500 or as low as you can. You just keep your vertical speed around -50 as long as possible. It does glide a long way so when the space center is in sight you have to deploy speed brakes but not so much that you loose all your energy and land short. It\u0027s very tough and I have almost landed perfectly. Last attempt I was just left of the runway, but walking distance away.

When I tested the cfgs I would usually be at around 1000-2000m before going sub-sonic. I also nosed up for as much of the reentry as I could, to bleed off speed. The deorbit maneuver is usually only around 100m/s, so if you come in real steep you\u0027re going to scream in like crazy no matter what you do. And I tend to come in almost ballistic right until the end when you pull up to land. It\u0027s an MM config, so heck, take a stab at the FAR settings! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E I borrowed most of the details from the stock FAR configs or the B9 mod configs, so I\u0027m sure they could be improved.
