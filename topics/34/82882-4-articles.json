I don\u0027t expect rigid realism, although the *concepts* being potentially real and the effort to balance them so was more appealing to me than say, hyperdrive, which is why I picked this up. Not having played the new version yet I can\u0027t speak to balance - i just know sometimes people nerf capstone skills/techs/unlocks because they\u0027re \u0022massively overpowered\u0022 by end-game, but it\u0027s a capstone - an antimatter engine should be ridiculous, that\u0027s the point.\u003Cp\u003EI have faith, I\u0027m just hoping the cool end-game stuff didn\u0027t become \u0022side-grades\u0022 instead because it was \u0022too easy\u0022 .

The isp or thrust bump from a side-grade is much more visceral than having \u0022every stat increase by x%\u0022. And the scaling in general was plain breaking the challenge of the game. With just fusion you had access to ridiculous thrust and isp. This made fission nearly worthless and made AM scale beyond the confines of challenge. AM along was over 7.5 times as powerful as the already overpowered fusion. AM is still powerful, you can feel the difference, but it is not going to render other parts completely obsolete.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShould we get actual interstellar travel in the game, the maybe there will be a place for scaling of higher magnitudes, but right now all it does it make the game boring because you have less challenge and less parts to work with (because so many parts have been made obsolete).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WaveFunctionP","CreatedById":104784,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-26T21:02:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022lordkrike\u0022 data-cite=\u0022lordkrike\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWaveFunctionP - \u003Cp\u003EWhen you do get around to integrating RealFuels with everything, take a look at the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/90884-Karbonite-Real-Fuels-Integration-Configs\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ERealFuels/Karbonite integration configs\u003C/a\u003E Raptor831 and I have been working on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI feel like they may be useful to you when you want to integrate RealFuels with those other mods.
