Your mods are very useful and was not aware of them until recently.\n\u003E The method to change the value of Max Physics Delta Time per Frame seems to be the next logical step. Currently exiting to settings menu is agonizingly slow. I am experimenting on the two extreme values to identify the effects on vessel simulation. \n\u003E \n\u003E Example: a plane flies maneuvers and flown at high G force to try to break it apart. Then the value for Max Physics Delta Time per Frame is lowered from 0.12 to 0.03 and the plane is again put through similar testing. So far the results are not showing much difference and the two simulations have similar results. Re-entry is up next for testing and now knowing that using time warp is messing with the value the main menu screen is going to be seen more often.\n\u003E \n\u003E If it is possible could you add a method for changing the Max Physics Delta Time per Frame during run time. You were probably already thinking of this, am I right?\n\u003E \n\u003E Keep up the great work.\n\nI didn\u0027t have any plans to add this but for science I did it anyways! I\u0027ll upload a new version in a few minutes that adds a(few) new option(s) to PhysicalTimeRatioViewer.\n\n\u0022Change maximumDeltaTime\u0022, \u0022Live edit\u0022 and depending on if \u0022Live edit\u0022 is on or not 2 different sliders that look the same but one edits the value directly and the other one only if you press on \u0022Save\u0022.\n\nI myself had some testing with it. The minimum value unity/kerbal lets you set it to is 0.02. \n\nI only tried it till 1.00 and that had horribly low fps. So i decided to cap the max value to 0.20 which still gets low fps but for those that want to experiment with it can still do it without possibly locking themselves out of kerbal. Please be aware that at 0.2 your fps will most likely be around 5 with larger crafts.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Kerbal Engineer can do that I believe ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n I\u0027m not using Kerbal Engineer myself but from looking at its code i believe you mean the simulation time. This option only affects Kerbal Engineers own simulations and not kerbal\u0027s/unity\u0027s.\nEdit: Just uploaded the new version.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-17T23:39:40Z\u0022 title=\u002209/17/2015 11:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SpaceTiger**"},{"CreatedByName":"Moesly_Armlis","CreatedById":112247,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-20T19:38:20Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m not using Kerbal Engineer myself but from looking at its code i believe you mean the simulation time.

This will be included in the workaround posting as this is efficient for those that need to reset the value lower than 0.08 for Max Physics Delta Time per Frame. Currently I am using 0.08 for default as this is the value it will bug to.\n\nThe science experiment continues and still not able to notice any difference between a low or high value for the MPDTF, the simulation results seems to be the same. The significant difference at a high value is on my slow computer the game runs closer to 80% Physics Time Ratio and that is such a relief when I have kerbal EVA around a base station and do not need to use physics time warp."},{"CreatedByName":"Glyph","CreatedById":107405,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-21T06:35:09Z","Content":"Would it be possible to have the auto-balancing legs mod remove the stock legs?

It assisted in a 300\u002B part train during testing and filming.\n\nTesting a high part count vessel would take too long in real time to reach top speed (when the problems would arise).
