The Kosmos LK Lander (Large) craft needs to be more balanced, well at least the parts in that mod. I was able not once but twice (I did it once and wanted to confirm it) send the large LK Lander with nothing other then the lander craft all by itself to Mun, land, then take off and successfully make it back to Kerbal with (little) fuel to spare (mostly RCS fuel). No deaths, no mechjeb.

In your youtube video of your space-station you deploy all the solar panels at the same time. I think (because I think that I did that once but dont remember how) there is a button that you keyed for the powertech.dll plugin that deploys all the solar panels and the radiator panel at once. What is this key, and could you in the next update add a readme file or post the various controls for your mods on the front.
