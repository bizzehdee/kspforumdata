The reason the adjusted preset has such a heavy penalty for flying in atmosphere is that it has to front-load this same ~1000dV penalty to the first 35,000m of altitude, before the atmosphere becomes so thin as to not affect your Isp anymore. Generally speaking it shouldn\u0027t significantly affect your rocket design compared to the universal preset (since the idea is to make you carry more fuel into orbit, meaning you need more fuel and possibly thrust in your lifter), but your ascent may need to be more vertical to get enough efficiency out of those engines to reach orbital speed before you run out of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jeffjeff","CreatedById":110969,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-16T16:17:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks Makrond, that makes perfect sense.

The procedural SRB lets you choose (among other things) the thrust and ISP (surface nozzle or vacuum nozzle) of the part. If KIDS is set up to vary thrust depending on ISP then this will usually (but not always) give the SRB the wrong thrust and ISP. The ISP will be the ISP specified on the part in the VAB, and the thrust will be the default thrust of the SRB (250kN) multiplied by the inverse of the ISP multiplier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I said, it doesn\u0027t happen consistently, but it happens pretty often when launching a new vehicle.

It doesn\u0027t notice the ISP has been updated, so the result is a high fuel-flow, high ISP (= high thrust) engine and rockets with launch TWR of about 20 incinerating before they reach 10km.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"velve","CreatedById":112979,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-21T15:54:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESeems there has not been a reply in a while but got a quick question, Does KIDS play nice with -Real Solar System, Realism overhaul, Listed Realism overhaul mods, Realistic Progression lite and all its submods?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes I may have fallen for the \u0022realism\u0022 trap, but I\u0027m really enjoying them and was just wondering if KIDS enjoys them too?
