I would personally still have it start with the uncooled intake open, because starting on the runway at zero speed is exactly when you would want to have the extra intake open.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is not the problem here. All my intakes are stacked to the precooler and the precooler was not doing a thing. When I used to use them they just worked (and didnt randomly cool an engine to the hundreds of thousands -ve degrees), but if what nightdagger says is true then manually switching them can be used as a work around for now.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-31T14:33:09Z\u0022 title=\u002207/31/2014 02:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 31, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Ice30\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lagrangewei","CreatedById":113865,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-31T14:59:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethey need to change the precooler so it either effect itself or give an option to disable the intake in VAB.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ford6","CreatedById":117336,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-31T19:26:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDuh!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat was it.
