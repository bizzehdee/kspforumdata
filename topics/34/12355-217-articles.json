I mean, the ship needs to be fairly well balanced to begin with, of course, but if you haven\u0027t tried it, give it a go. It would save you from needing to download another mod, at least if it works for you. Oh, here\u0027s a tip: If, when hovering with \u0027Translatron\u0027, your craft seems to oscillate back and forth slowly, like it\u0027s swinging from a long rope, you need to open the \u0027Attitude Adjustment\u0027 window and LOWER the \u0027Tf\u0027 value, or try the \u0027Autotune\u0027 feature. But if your ship, chopper, whatever, is wiggling really fast, well, you probably have too much torque, either start disabling or removing reaction wheels until it stops, and/or your \u0027Tf\u0027 is too low, and needs to be raised, again selecting or de-selecting Autotune if necessary. Sometimes it takes a bit of experimentation to get it dialed in. Finally (about Translatron, anyway), remember that your \u0027control from here\u0027 axis MUST be vertical. Meaning that you need to have a probe core or docking port pointed at the sky, with all blue showing on the navball. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I know Firespitter has some kind of hover control too, but I haven\u0027t messed with it so I can\u0027t say how well or even if that works.

Yes, the sphere would be large. Here\u0027s why:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor #1, only allow the object actively docking with the target to have \u0022permission\u0022 to enter this sphere. The Docking Autopilot can thus ignore the sphere for the most part (it would have permission to enter the sphere) since it is aiming at one specific location, most often a port. The Rendezvous Autopilot needs to absolutely pay attention to the sphere so as not to inadvertently get too close and potentially impact the target. This sphere would have authority over the rendezvous distance value, and could be used as the default value given in the dialog. Regardless of the value put into the dialog box by the player, the RendAP should never try to approach the target closer than the \u0022safeDistance\u0022 value.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-21T13:06:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe distance is mostly used when the docking ship starts on the wrong side of the docking target.
