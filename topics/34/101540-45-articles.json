This creates a slew of logical problems as a result of using the same scaletype applied to parts with different original sizes, ultimately. The only way to fix that - and you\u0027re right, it definitely could be done - is to create a big heap of different scaletypes for different scenarios. One scaletype for every size of part, really, and then possibly some extra scaletypes for special cases.\n\nThen, if you want to use a mod with non-\u0022standard\u0022 sizes, like BlueDog or HGR or what have you, that means you have to re-do every single scaletype to accommodate new sizes. That is way too complicated.\n\nThe logic of the \u002B/- limiter is essentially \u0022we get better at adapting any given design to different-than-intended sizes as we get better materials technologies\u0022 (or engine techs, or whatever), and it *automatically adapts to any number of size increments the user wants to use*. The difference is that it only takes a few adjustments to affect the logic of scaling for all parts - no need to write a complete set of custom scaletypes and re-patch *every part in the game* in order to use this logic. In addition, it also allows for more interesting possibilities regarding different types of part - for instance, the \u002B/- limit makes a lot of sense for engines. It seems strange to be able to take a 3.75m engine design and scale it all the way down to 0.625m. But if there were logic built in to tweakscale that allows for control over the *ratio* you can scale a part to rather than the *particular value in a scaletype*... Again, a person *could* account for this with the existing config interface, but only by creating a big load of scaletypes and overhauled patches every part. Monumental amount of work vs. changing a few values in one setting in one config somewhere.\n\nThat\u0027s my $0.02 anyway, and why I think it would be a useful feature.\n\nEDIT: probably even more useful if you can define limits (absolute or tech-based or whatever) by different modules present in a part...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-03-25T01:04:15Z\u0022 title=\u002203/25/2017 01:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 25, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by AccidentalDisassembly**"},{"CreatedByName":"eberkain","CreatedById":157548,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-25T16:48:40Z","Content":"So when thinking about TweakScale in the context of career mode, what do you think could be done to make it balanced?

Restricting how much you can scale parts would be good, and I\u0027m fooling around with some configs for that.  I don\u0027t feel that crew parts or science parts should be scalable either for a career game.  Anything else?\n\u003E \n\nMost science has no capacity, thus what would scaling mean?  I would say the goo and the materials bay should be able to be scaled up (giving additional uses), nothing can scale down.\n\nAs for everything else--I would be inclined towards the various sizes being unlocked by nodes in the research tree that are one above the spot level where objects of that size are introduced (as unlocking a size would allow manipulation of multiple types of parts) or else have separate unlocks for various types of parts and introduced at level."},{"CreatedByName":"eberkain","CreatedById":157548,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-25T18:05:15Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 9 minutes ago, Loren Pechtel said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E As for everything else--I would be inclined towards the various sizes being unlocked by nodes in the research tree that are one above the spot level where objects of that size are introduced (as unlocking a size would allow manipulation of multiple types of parts) or else have separate unlocks for various types of parts and introduced at level.\n\u003E \n\nI dont think that unlocking different scale sizes is not something that could be done with simple \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E patches.

I dunno, not much of a coder and therefore not really sure how to help and/or think through how it would work in meaningful programming-ese. =("},{"CreatedByName":"pellinor","CreatedById":85299,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-25T23:33:19Z","Content":"My current idea is:  \n\n\\* if there is a techRequired entry (from the part or inherited from the scaletype) then this is used (= the old interface)  \n\n\\* otherwise look for a new entry that has yet to be defined, containing tech requirements for relative scales"}]}
