On launch I get halfway through my first stage and the solar panels, interstage fairings, and remotetech dish explodes out of nowhere. I have Deadly Reentry and it begins playing the \u0027g-force damage sound\u0027 several times and then it blows up. Not all of them but several and it is different everytime which ones it is. The flight log says it is due to g-force damage. But looking at the maximum G\u0027s reached during flight it reads 2.2. It doesn\u0027t happen every launch either but is very random.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thought it was DRE at first, but I have had the same version of that for a while and no problems.

List of mods i\u0027m using:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have 000_Toolbar, B9_Arospace, BoulderCo, DeadlyReentry, EnhancedNavBall, ExsurgentEngineering,FerramArrospaceResurch, Firesplitter, HexCans, KAS, KerbalJointReinforcment, Kethane, KineTechAnimation, KWRocketry, MagicSmokeIndustrys, NavyFish, ResGen, SH_Mods, Squad (Duh), ThunderAerospace, TreeLoader, VNG, and WarpPlugin in my Game Data Folder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thought erroneously that the problem lie with TAC Life-support, but now believe the problem to be in how KJR, FAR, and different mod parts (B9, KWR, ect.) interact because I removed and re-installed each, and the problem only exists with KJR enabled in conjunction with the other stated mods (with the exception of removing all adding part mods -B9, KWR, ect.-). I believe that the inherent oscillating nature of the craft that is suppressed due to KJR is the culprit. Deadly reentry detects the suppressed oscillations (that increase with acceleration) and views this \u0022suppressed\u0022 G\u0027s sustained from the individual parts as actual G\u0027s instead of the whole spacecraft. This the mod detects, which leads to G-Max being reached, even though it should not under such little stress to the rocket and occupants.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, traveling at less than 20/mps^2 acceleration with less than 3G\u0027s at about 1km for 10ish seconds will equate G-Max being reached.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7MtBmHg.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00227MtBmHg.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jk9JO48.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022jk9JO48.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1TEltHw.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00221TEltHw.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-29T02:03:17Z\u0022 title=\u002201/29/2014 02:03  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 29, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by First Victor\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EChanged a number that was wrong, included forgotten mod\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ferram4","CreatedById":21328,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-29T02:10:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMake sure that you\u0027re using Deadly Reentry Continued v4.3 instead of the old Deadly Reentry v2.0.
