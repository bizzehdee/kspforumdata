You are right that the delta-v will increase for the inner stage(s) and this is not shown within my calculations. The current calculations assume that a stage will stay intact and decoupled all at once. You can get a grasp of what\u0027s happening within the Flight Engineer, as the stage delta-v will jump up once you\u0027ve decoupled the empty tanks. I have given it quite a bit of thought and not come up with an adequate solution myself yet. Bug fixes being the most important and also some other features have taken priority so far. If you could PM me your script, I\u0027ll take a look and see if your equations and algorithm could be adapted.
