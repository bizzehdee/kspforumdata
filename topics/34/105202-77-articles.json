Comparing my GameData folder with the USI-LS download, it appears that everything was properly present in the UmbraSpaceIndustries folder, but the 000\\_USITools folder was completely absent. I \u0022need\u0022 the version updating convenience of CKAN, so as a compromise all I did was add the 000\\_USITools manually. So far this appears to work fine.\n\nNow I\u0027ve realized \u0022USI Tools\u0022 is in CKAN so I\u0027ve installed that with CKAN instead. So far so good. Although it took me a long time to troubleshoot why I was always getting indefinite hab and home values. Turns out it\u0027s because by default NoHomeEffect = 0 and NoHomeEffectVets = 0 which turns the feature off. Also by default HabMultiplier = 5, although the cfg said default should be 1, so that\u0027s fixed now."},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-06T21:41:55Z","Content":"I\u0027ve updated the CKAN metadata to reflect the need for USITools."},{"CreatedByName":"Nicole","CreatedById":102302,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-07T06:49:32Z","Content":"When a craft runs out of Electric Charge does the Kerbal give up right away, or does it get the same amnesty period that running out of snacks does?"},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-07T09:34:25Z","Content":"It gets the same level of amnesty - the two are on the same timer."},{"CreatedByName":"Nicole","CreatedById":102302,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-07T13:09:20Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 3 hours ago, RoverDude said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E It gets the same level of amnesty - the two are on the same timer.\n\u003E \n\nOkay thanks. I thought that was the case, since it\u0027s mentioned in the first post. I was asking because when I ran out of EC in my game when using this mod, and monitoring the life support status window, it simply made the timer for supplies freeze. I didn\u0027t loose control but it seemed like odd behavior and I thought maybe I had met a bug. I used time acceleration to run the clock quite a lot (I was in orbit around the sun) but the timer remained the same and I still had control 15 days after supplies had run out (By my estimate, since the life support timer was stuck on a positive number). Then I went back to the space center and the life support data correctly showed the craft was 18 days past supplies running out, and switching back to the craft found all my Kerbals on strike. It was just odd that running out of EC stopped the timer for how long my supplies would last and apparently left the craft in life support limbo. I launched another test and I found that I could reproduce that, but also that restoring the EC after being deprived of it resumed the timer from where it was stopped."},{"CreatedByName":"Cruzo","CreatedById":159784,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-07T16:22:16Z","Content":"I\u0027m sure this is a known issue but just in case, undocking/redocking still seems to reset the hab timer.
