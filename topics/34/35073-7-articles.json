Lock the jet engines at a set thrust to provide most of your lift, add some smaller downwards pointing rocket engines for altitude control on a second throttle (stock jet engines have too long a spool time for responsive altitude control), then put your horizontal pointing thrust engines on a third throttle so they can be controlled separately. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that the unbalanced thrust should be enabled on all three throttles, this mod calculates it separately for the engines assigned to each throttle, so turning up your horizontal engines will not flip your VTOL over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI then mentioned my mod because it integrates with this mod and not TCA so I didn\u0027t want people thinking I recommended this mod for that reason.
