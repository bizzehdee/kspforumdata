E.g. KerbalQuest Jetpacks plugin re-enables jetpack \u0026amp; co. and KSP re-enables eyes each time a portrait is recreated. You can disable helmet/jetpack hiding by setting \u0060isAtmSuitEnabled = false\u0060 in a configuration file (e.g. in \u0060@Default.cfg\u0060, but I recommend creating an alternative one that only contains options you change, since \u0060@Default.cfg\u0060 should be overwritten on each version update).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shaw","CreatedById":64788,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-06T17:08:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Proot\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Proot\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EEy Shaw, just want to say many thanks for the last update.
