It may be better to download the mod directly from Spacedock, and just overwrite (not merge) the ShadowWorks folder in you GameData with the one from ShadowWorks 2.0.3.  The craft files did not change from version 2.0 to 2.0.3, so you wouldn\u0027t need to worry about reinstalling craft files or anything like that.  I would say that if \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E complains about something, try installing manually, just in general.

You can check your KSP.log file by opening it in NotePad, TextEdit, or your preferred text editor and look for any warnings or errors connected with ShadowWorks parts that you know are not showing up.

There\u0027s not much else I can tell you with the information you\u0027ve given me at this point.

There are craft files included in the download if you want to use them instead of building from scratch.
