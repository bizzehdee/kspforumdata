Here\u0027s what happened...\n\nConducted a flyby of the moon, thought I had plenty of supplies, brought a 1.25 diam LS container for two kerbals. Don\u0027t recall seeing any warnings about low supplies. During the return Bill exited the craft to gather up the science before ejecting that part of the ship to land the crew capsule. Upon reentering the capsule, Bill can no longer EVA to get the other half of the SCIENCE! It was giving me a statement along the lines of \u0022Tourists can\u0027t exit the vehicle\u0022. I thought that was odd, but sent Jeb out to get the other half. After reentering the capsule now he can no longer EVA either with the same tourist warning, and the controls are dead. Once I was done panicking, I quicksaved and downloading hyperedit to bring the capsule down safely. Don\u0027t judge me!\n\nAnyway, after running a few tests, I had this occur on the launchpad too. Bob and Val both exited the vehicle on the launch pad, reentered, and suddenly unable to EVA. Now all my orange suits were listed as tourists in the crew roster. If I hired someone new though, I didn\u0027t have that issue. Didn\u0027t have it in a new career game on the launch pad, nor in a sandbox game. After reverting to the quick save doing the above again a few times, when I splashed down in water instead of land, I noticed it state \u0022Jeb and Bill have returned to duty\u0022 or something along those lines. Now they were no longer tourists. Well, after chasing my tail for about an hour, I finally equated this issue to the USI LS mod. To test I put a capsule on the launch pad, and fast forwarded until they refuse to work, upon recovery they are listed as tourists in the crew roster. Is this working as designed? Shouldn\u0027t they reset when recovered? Any reason why EVA was insta-touristing kerbals on the launchpad after EVA? I also found it odd that they did reset at splashdown but not when they land in an open field.\n\nEdit: Just saw the above posts about a similar issue...I do believe I was out of EC at the time I EVA\u0027d. Heck, I was out of EC since my moon flyby probably. No solar panels and left SAS on afterall. I could just use thrust a bit as needed to get some. Of course that begs the question, why didn\u0027t they refuse to work BEFORE they eva\u0027d?
