Promise I thought of it before I saw that!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know Kethane is currently only configured for one resource at a time, and for one in and one out, but I was considering what would be needed and what would be good game playing work when multi resource is available. There certainly should be some variation in parts used for construction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) \u0027Structure\u0027 for plates, fuel tanks, and kerbal carrying modules.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) \u0027Components\u0027 for engines and miscellaneous mechanical stuff (ie damn robotics stuff)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) \u0027Electronics\u0027 for ion drives, control systems and flight capsules (and maybe damn robotics stuff)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) and \u0027Doodads\u0027 for kerbal containers... ie anything that Kerbals need like seats, manual controls, fuzzy dice etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOK, then what to make these from? Well, I think there should be some variance in availability, and I\u0027m not just talking about what\u0027s common on certain worlds. For example the main resources should be metal and minerals, and those you\u0027d likely need in fairly large quantities. They\u0027d also be fairly common on most worlds and be easy and quick to mine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could also have gold for electronics. It\u0027s rare, takes a LONG time to mine, but you wouldn\u0027t need much to build anything, just make sure you have some on hand. Similarly for structure you might need Titanium in addition to metal (light weight construction) but again, tricky to mine and you wouldn\u0027t need much of it (alloying with metal? *shrugs* just need an excuse to make some kind of rare material for that component. True you\u0027d need more Titanium for structure and fuel tankage on most rockets, just thinking more game-play dynamics here). People have mentioned plastics and I admit I didn\u0027t think of that, but it\u0027d be good for Doodads.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027d end up with a construction facility with large tankage for Metal and Minerals, with small tanks for Gold, Minerals and Plastic. Probably Mine mainly for Metal ore and Minerals (would it be processed minerals finally? Or go with Minerals and mineral ore? *shrugs*) On site or nearby, then ship in the others from nearby mining sites... assuming you aren\u0027t near enough to Kerbin to ship parts directly from home rather than making them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall I think this would make things difficult enough to make making a base challenging, but not overly difficult. You don\u0027t want TOO many parts required, but you need some variation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the same thought, I\u0027ve noticed on every game I\u0027ve played with this and Kethane that the ore and Kethane patches don\u0027t overlap. Is this hard coded or just coincidence? In the future could there be a \u0027sweet spot\u0027 on a planet where two or three resources could be mined on the same spot? That would make finding a site for manufacturing more interesting, finding a place where at least the main ores are present on site, then just have small mining outposts in rover or SSTO range to ship materials in.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
