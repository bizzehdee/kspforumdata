Anyway, in the new version of the mod it would be really awesome to see dishes able to automatically change between a chosen set targets depending on which are in range. Imagine you have three relay satellites at geosyncronous orbit and you have a probe in really high orbit. It would be really handy if when selecting targets, you could give it a priority list rather than one fixed target, that way it would switch as the satellites come in and go out of range. You would have one dish doing the work of three.\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t tested RT2 out yet, but in RT1 this was possible by aiming the probe\u0027s dish at the orbital body instead of at a particular commsat.
