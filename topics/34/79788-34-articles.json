As of now, I\u0027ve added many complex contracts, and as you know, the more contracts you add to the pool, the less of a chance you have to see any particular one of them. This puts me in a dilemma, because people have so many good ideas, but I do not want to imbalance the game with a lot of contracts that are complicated and take a ton of effort. There should be an equal amount of complicated and simple contracts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs of now, the contracts \u003Cstrong\u003Eare\u003C/strong\u003E generated using the Progress Tracker, which is what the game uses to keep track of what the player has done. However, it is using the Progress Tracker quite loosely. It only checks to see if the player has been to a planet or not. This means that if you do a simple flyby of Jool, even if you just graze the sphere of influence, your progress updates and contracts start appearing for Jool. What I\u0027d like to do is leash the contracts to a much tighter usage of the Progress Tracker. There are progress tracks on everything...whether the player has flown by, orbited, landed, done an EVA, docked, all sorts of stuff, for each planetary body...and I can use those to gain a more accurate picture of what the player is capable of and give him missions that are much more tailored to his skills. For instance, only giving him rover contracts for planets he\u0027s at least established an orbit around before, or only building bases on planets he has landed on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis will also lower the general amount of complex contracts, leaving a void. This is where my next idea comes into play. I am calling them \u0022breadcrumb\u0022 contracts. They will be similar to the World First contracts, with some differences. They will check for the next unvisited location and situation, and ask you to do something extremely simple. Like fly by Jool, or land at a specific waypoint on Pol. Very simple objectives, but utilizing my systems for waypoints and such to make them more interactive. These contracts would fulfill two purposes: they would balance the complicated contracts, and they would push out the player\u0027s progress tracker. How a bread crumb contract will differ from a World First contract, is that once a bread crumb gets to Eeloo, it will not stop appearing. It will push in a progression from Kerbin outward, but once it hits the edge of the system, it will fold back in, and unlock again for every planet, to create some contract variety, and continue balancing the harder missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI believe this is the best step for Fine Print to make next. It would give the contracts system some much needed balance and progression. Please let me know what you guys think.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: This does not mean work on more complex contracts is ceasing. I just need a method of balancing them out, and I think breadcrumbs are a good way.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-04T16:23:19Z\u0022 title=\u002209/04/2014 04:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 4, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Arsonide\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Minwaabi","CreatedById":91050,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-04T18:13:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat makes a ton of sense.
