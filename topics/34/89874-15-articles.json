Suggestion: Why not make them a little bit wider ? For example, few post above I showed some of solutions to put 3 x medium gear on structural panel and then put that structural panel somewhere on craft, either on hull or wings. Everyone have different taste about it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, instead of 3 gears next to each other, use width of gear so it is possible to attach two heavy gear on 2 x 2 m structural panel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat will solve many issues you have with more narrowed design. Also strength of one heavy gear should be like 3 x medium gears - just from expirience in creating heavy planes. Your mod already helped a lot with that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother suggestion. For same wheel type as on your pictures. Rotate them on two axes, not just one, when you need to fold wheels inside gearbox. Meaning one point of rotation is on leg near gear box, but you need second rotation point on leg near wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, when you raise gear, leg rotates 90 degree to pitch up wheels, but at the same time wheels rotates also 90 degrees in a way that wheels keep position as they have on ground.

It\u0027s kinda hard to explain but what I mean is, instead of animating the gear normally, how it works is when you deploy the gear, it tells the leg to rotate towards the user-defined leg angle, and same with the wheels and piston length.
