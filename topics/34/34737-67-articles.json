First sorry if this was posted in this thread already. 165 pages long, I wish I had that much time to find an answer :-).\u003Cp\u003EI was going thru my mods for a new .23 campaign and I remember that I had used this plugin and had alot of fun with it but had some rather outstanding issues that prevented me to use it on long term.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe issue I had was that sometimes parts were getting \u0022disconnected\u0022 when reloading a save. I often was building a small crane to help assemble my mun base. Usually a hinge on bottom with 2 piston and another hinge on top with KAS magnet attached to it. Sometimes when I was reloading a save, I had the parts from this plugin just float in midair. It was still connected to the vehicle as I still had control over them but visually, there would often be big gaps between the parts which made things look rather strange.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe issue could probably be caused by my use of the plugin or maybe a bug, I don\u0027t know. Anyone know of this issue? Is it something that I can work around it or has it actually been fixed (assuming its coming from the mod)?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a bug that I haven\u0027t figured out how to fix it yet.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SVoyager","CreatedById":57670,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-18T20:44:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sirkut\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sirkut\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt\u0027s a bug that I haven\u0027t figured out how to fix it yet.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, damn.
