Currently, when you drill a deposit, you extract Kethane from the entire deposit as a single unit. It doesn\u0027t matter what hex you\u0027re in; as long as you\u0027re inside the deposit, you\u0027ll be able to suck it dry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe new deposit generator architecture affords a lot more flexibility, so the new deposits will have a different quantity in each individual cell. The small drill will only be able to extract Kethane from the hex immediately under it, but the heavy drill will be able to also draw from surrounding cells. My current thinking is that for every unit drilled from the main cell, half a unit (total) is drilled from the surrounding cells. Once the main cell is depleted, surrounding cells can no longer be accessed, so landing on the highest-density cell in a cluster is important for unlocking large quantities without relocating the drill. This is why a detailed scan of a deposit will be handy; if you know all the cell levels, you can plan out where to land to best satisfy your mission requirements. Of course, if you only need to refuel a small ship, a small drill landed anywhere on a deposit will do just fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#808080;\u0022\u003E-------------------------------------------------------------------------\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a completely different note, \u003Cstrong\u003EHAPPY BIRTHDAY, KETHANE!\u003C/strong\u003E On this day last year, MMI released Kethane 0.1 to the public.

Mining kethane is difficult enough for me as it is, this will make it harder. Also, some cells have absolutely terrible terrain large scale mining operations (edge of huge crators).

We could set up one large base/refinery anywhere within the deposit, but we have to drop smaller (fire and forget?) oil drills around, in each cell. As long as they have a certain part and are in the cell, they never need to be the active ship to transfer kethane to the main deposit refinery.
