I could put the test mode on but I feel it is not fair as if I crash the plane it should cost me way more than 3%. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is why I downloaded the source files and modified the code to get me back 95% on recycling but I could not recompile the file despite spending all the night trying. It shows me an error saying that namespace \u0022IManager\u0022 is missing but I could not find any reference to it. Would you now where that comes from by any chance? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also had another small glitch: I have a plane ready to launch on the runway, I hit space to start the engine so the price of the plane plus the insurance cost are substracted from my funds. For some reason I decide to abort the lauch half way the runway and hit the breaks, bringing the plane to a halt. At that stage the plane had just rolled a bit in the runway but had not taked off. When I recover the plane from the station I did not got any money back, neither for the plane nor the insurance. I assume you re aware of that but I thought I\u0027de let you know anyway just in case \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-05T19:06:49Z\u0022 title=\u002209/05/2013 07:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 5, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by gwichy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ratzap","CreatedById":75982,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-05T21:25:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh man, I left MC switched on while I designed, tested and launched a bunch of huge lifters (3600t\u002B on the pad).
