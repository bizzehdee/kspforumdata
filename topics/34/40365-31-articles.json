So, yesterday i made my first warp flight - Raven II probe finished her task of mapping Minmus, and finally i could test her warp drive. The target of test flight turned out to be Dres - it was in conjunction with Kerbin at the moment. It wasn\u0027t perfect configuration, because Dres was couple of degrees ahead of Kerbin, but i decided to try anyway. At 0.10 c Kerbin system literally disappeared in a blink, and i could actually see my probe closing in on Dres in real time. It would take only 33 minutes in real time - what a ride! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E Then i disengaged warp drive, and my smile disappeared. I had to do 5300 m\\s burn to capture into orbit O_O. Of course Raven did not carry so much fuel, so i had to either watch my probe shoot into interstellar space or...Yes, i used Infinite Fuel cheat to save my first, and so far only warp capable spaceship.

The same goes for LKO - it is important when and where we enter warp, because it changes relative velocity significantly. And finally: we need a probe sized engine with huge Isp - not many unmanned ships carry 5000\u002B dV and can sustain 34 minutes long braking burn, even with nuclear engines onboard :-/\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"smurphy34","CreatedById":73342,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-18T14:27:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022nhnifong\u0022 data-cite=\u0022nhnifong\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOne more question before fractal wakes up \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy is this small generator is not producing more megajoules when there\u0027s thermal power to spare?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/34jfpN9.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002234jfpN9.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I like your landing struts, what mod are they from?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"smurphy34","CreatedById":73342,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-18T14:46:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022nhnifong\u0022 data-cite=\u0022nhnifong\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m trying to use to AEIS models for the Beamed Microwave power and I think it has messed up the animation and/or readouts.

Since my mod is largely about forms of power and power in large quantities, no less, the lack of radiators becomes even more galling.

The panels align themselves such that they minimise the amount of light that falls upon them from the sun, which is important because they are, afterall, supposed to be radiating the heat into space rather than collecting it from the sun. (In other words, they align themselves 90 degrees from the direction that solar panels would).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDue to this being a relatively major introduction to the mod, my current plan is to implement this in two steps (i.e. across two updates):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first step is to introduce the waste heat mechanics and radiators to the game, the second step is to introduce consequences for not dissipating the heat.

In atmosphere, despite its name, its rather better at convecting away heat. This makes your job of keeping things cool in atmosphere that much easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe amount of heat you need to radiate is equal to the thermal power production of the reactor minus the electrical power produced by the generator. Thus the greater the efficiency of the generator, the less (proportionate) power you need to get rid of.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere the radiators are folded up on the launch pad, when in this configuration radiative output is reduced by 10x and convection is reduced by half.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JQWg1kh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022JQWg1kh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe can also deploy the radiators when we\u0027re ready to undo those nasty penalties, the radiators begin to align themselves edge on the sun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/eb6laZl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022eb6laZl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMuch like solar panels, you do *not* want to try flying through the atmosphere with your radiators deployed, here is a shot of me attempting to deploy them during flight:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/pfdAE9g.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022pfdAE9g.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wasmic","CreatedById":64885,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-26T19:34:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWoo, cool!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"theSpeare","CreatedById":62144,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-26T19:40:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan you make these panels configurable through their cfg files?
