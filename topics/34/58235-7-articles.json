Using KSPI\u0027s DT Vista engine, if you add stock or spherical fuel tanks ahead of it, remove all included tanks and add a pure liquid fuel tank, on transfer to the launchpad from the VAB those tanks also get an extra oxidizer tank added that exceeds limits, and it breaks the clickability of the tank. Should be noted that I have the 3.75 stock decoupler after the DT Vista and then a LF/OX booster to get the thing to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat tank are you using?

Now I don\u0027t know what is in the tanks, in terms of RealFuels, and I will have to apologize for my ignorance but I don\u0027t know exactly what you mean by removing the resources... as I think of it, in my mind, it would defeat the purpose of being able to add those types to the tanks if I remove them from the tanks afterwards. I will be the first to stand up and grant that I know very little and am basically talking out of my arse, but thats what happens when you have limited knowledge about something LOL. That being said, I would be willing to do anything to have you help educate me, I can be made available via a phone call ( I have Vonage and can call most places free), Skype, live chat, I even have team viewer to be able to share desktops so you can show me in real time what your speaking of. Also, while I am not swimming in funds, I can even donate a six pack of your favorite beverage to your coding cause. If you install MFT and KSPI you can test my cfg files. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know that RF has split from MFT, and I don\u0027t want to cause more work, or clashes of any type but I am in desperate need of reducing models and textures I am running at the lowest possible mesh density AND running maximum compression and still am at the 4g barrier. So, it is one of the many reasons I am doing this, I am also gearing this setup up to come to an attempt at talking to the various mod designers to come up with a standard for fuel to resource ratio of the different types especially water as the two waters are disparagingly different and I would like to make water the same as other waters unless its of the actual heavy type if you know what I mean. So any help you can come up with would be great, if the cfg\u0027s above can be modified the way you stated, I would be elated. But any help you can give I will try to reward to the tune of ten fold.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks again!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks again Swamp_ig, I should have a cfg or two to work this out posted by 5pm pst. so that people who have this same problem can counter it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-06T06:40:55Z\u0022 title=\u002206/06/2014 06:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 6, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by MrWizerd\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"swamp_ig","CreatedById":97983,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-06T07:37:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk before anyone else reports it - I\u0027m aware that when you go to flight mode from the VAB you get \u0027phantom tanks\u0027 added.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWill have a fix for this soon.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rampart","CreatedById":79170,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-06T12:13:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022swamp_ig\u0022 data-cite=\u0022swamp_ig\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOk before anyone else reports it - I\u0027m aware that when you go to flight mode from the VAB you get \u0027phantom tanks\u0027 added.\u003Cp\u003EWill have a fix for this soon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think this was my problem, good to hear \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snoman314","CreatedById":106370,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-12T05:06:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022swamp_ig\u0022 data-cite=\u0022swamp_ig\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOk before anyone else reports it - I\u0027m aware that when you go to flight mode from the VAB you get \u0027phantom tanks\u0027 added.\u003Cp\u003EWill have a fix for this soon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny progress?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rosenkranz","CreatedById":57152,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-12T22:44:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022swamp_ig\u0022 data-cite=\u0022swamp_ig\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOk before anyone else reports it - I\u0027m aware that when you go to flight mode from the VAB you get \u0027phantom tanks\u0027 added.\u003Cp\u003EWill have a fix for this soon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECool, I\u0027ve been trying to figure this out for a bit now.

But I suspect it\u0027s a problem with MFT and not TweakScale: I don\u0027t know how each work, really, so I could be completely wrong, but TweakScale correctly updates all values for the part so long as you FIRST configure that part with MFT (mix \u0026amp; match your tanks while it\u0027s at original size) and then scale it afterward. But when you use MFT to alter tanks in a part that has already been tweakscaled, the whole thing goes crazy and appears to cause the dry mass of the tank to become related to the mass of the resource in it (I think, I am just supposing some things). So it appears that it is MFT updating numbers for a tweaked tank that creates weirdness, not TweakScale updating numbers for a tank that has been MFT\u0027d, if that makes sense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you use MFT to modify tanks on a part that has previously been tweakscaled to 2x its normal radius (so 8x the volume, I guess), the dry mass of the tank becomes equal to the mass of the resources now in the tank. Actual resources in the tank are correct, dry mass of the tank is not. So when MFT is updating the tanks, this happens:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOriginal part: .5t dry, 4.5t wet. (4 tons of fuel)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScale it to 2x radius, so 8x volume: there should be 32 tons of fuel (8x4). There ARE 32 tons of fuel, so MFT is correctly measuring (I guess?) the new volume of the tank. But now there are also 32 tons of dry mass, so the whole tank weighs 64 tons. I don\u0027t know where the 32 number is coming from, since it should be simply 8x the original dry weight, or 4 tons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut again, I don\u0027t know how these mods work at all, so that\u0027s why I posted in both threads (and because appearances suggest something going on with MFT).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Biotronic","CreatedById":72381,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-19T11:15:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is a bug in TweakScale that sirkut just made me aware of, where the mass is scaled improperly.
