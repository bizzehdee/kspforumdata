If you\u0027re getting requested to build a station, saddle your workhorse up with additional objectives that coincide with it. Then be careful in the future to read what the return payout is for completing a mission.

I\u0027m looking at them right now in 0.52a, so I can\u0027t debug a problem I\u0027m not experiencing. if you are experiencing this, I am very interested in your logs, please PM them to me. I would also be interested in knowing if anybody else \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ecan\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E see these right now. Remember, the waypoints do not display right now in the tracking station, only the in game map. They also do not display for a planet unless you are focused on that planet, or a ship near that planet. Ensure that your mission is not on Laythe or something.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-31T00:32:06Z\u0022 title=\u002207/31/2014 12:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 31, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Arsonide\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Burkitt","CreatedById":58086,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-31T00:27:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m experiencing the same problem as Sarayakat, the \u0022Have a newly discovered asteroid in tow\u0022 part of the contract just won\u0027t complete.
