For spare parts, perhaps a nice add-on would be configs to put in KAS support. Example: Filling KAS containers with a \u0027spare part\u0027 instead of merely putting it in Capsules. It would encourage you to always carry spare parts or \u0027mission critical\u0027 replacements if necessary due to explosions (if implemented).
