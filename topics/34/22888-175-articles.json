Make multiple versions of the Main engine and the booster engines. Each one should have a different amount of thrust power. With that, people could make all the different types of Atlas rockets and be able to still launch them. I got this idea while I was using your Atlas engines to try and launch an Atlas II replica. Not enough thrust. So, please make a mod with several different Atlas engines, each with a different amount of thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hellblazer","CreatedById":131384,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T22:07:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have FASA installed with RO.
