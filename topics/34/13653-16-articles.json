It would be wholly SILLY to be able to refuel craft no matter where in the universe they are. Have you actually tried to get the craft you are trying to refuel CLOSER? say withing 10km? What is the distance between them (roughly) at the moment?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a maximum distance and I forgot (blush)...

I know it \u0022could\u0022 be pretty simple to add in for the next update but is it possible to add a \u0027Fuel Relay\u0027 Part when if the relay is 99m from the pump, then another relay with 99m of that, you could relay the fuel to longer distances. This could work by simply extending the range of the craft finder or by going a more complicated route and detecting any craft within 100m or EVERY relay. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you think?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
