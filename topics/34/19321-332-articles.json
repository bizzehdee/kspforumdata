What I do is I use TAC fuel Balancer and I leave one tank empty on the craft for weight transfer in flight. Real aircraft do this exact thing for the same reasons. I will lock that tank most of the flight but once the nose gets heavy I will shift fuel towards the rear of the craft to bring the CoM near the CoL as it shifts back.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bv1","CreatedById":127982,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-09T04:43:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022futrtrubl\u0022 data-cite=\u0022futrtrubl\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBecause in reality they do true gravity turns.

The most important factor I discovered was that the prograde flight assistant is helpful \u003Cem\u003Eonly if \u003C/em\u003Ethe pod\u0027s reaction wheels are disabled. If they are still enabled, then SAS will jitter so much as to flip the rocket around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that much of the problem comes down to limitations of KSP itself. Beyond fixing the jittery flight assistants, I would really like to have some \u003Cstrong\u003Esmall fins\u003C/strong\u003E just to lower the CoM a little for small rockets. A really big problem is that SRBs in KSP are crappy compared to real life: they don\u0027t have any gimbal capability, and the pod\u0027s reaction wheels are not enough to reliably keep it from flipping. Also, there is no way to adjust the bore so that the TWR doesn\u0027t get ridiculously high at the end of the burn.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
