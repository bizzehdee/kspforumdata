You can place them (strut-beam-thingies) on payload in 2\u002B symmetry having their beams shoot outwards and when you put the fairing on - click - everything connects making pretty stable contraption. That and struts from lower fairing part to the rocket (for wider than stack top fairings) makes wonders.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Drew Kerman","CreatedById":103177,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-16T01:33:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Alshain\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Alshain\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAuto struts are for the fairings themselves, not the payload.
