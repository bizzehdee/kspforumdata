Maybe CKAN is pulling up something old, maybe there\u0027s a versioning issue somewhere. I\u0027ve duplicated your RH/FI only environment and I\u0027m not seeing the symptoms you\u0027re seeing and the conduction factors in your PhysicsGlobals are very low, Convection settings are different too.\n\nI installed RH manually so I\u0027m looking at RH on Github and I\u0027ll compare it to what\u0027s on CKAN to see if I can find something there.\n\nEdit: Suggestion: Delete all ModuleManager.\\* in your GameData folder EXCEPT FOR the dll itself. (i.e. Delete ModuleManager.ConfigCache, ModuleManager.Physics, ModuleManager.TechTree and ModuleManager.ConfigSHA - obviously the very first two are the one\u0027s that are really important to nuke but nuke them all from orbit - it\u0027s the only way to be sure)\n\nEdit #2: Somewhere along the way, things changed in your configs and the MM caches didn\u0027t get cleared. Generally, what\u0027s in ModuleManager.ConfigCache/PhysicsGlobals should match up with what\u0027s in ModuleManager.Physics, and in your case they do not. When I spliced in the contents of your cached PhysicsGlobals into my ModuleManager.Physics file and loaded it from the debug menu, my temps started climbing. Right now on the pad at night, it\u0027s past 350K which is about 170 F and that\u0027s at night. Even on the equator, that\u0027s way too hot and it\u0027s not stopping.\n\nSo, my diagnosis is that you need to clear that cache out.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-23T21:44:22Z\u0022 title=\u002210/23/2015 09:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Starwaster**"},{"CreatedByName":"kpstjeev","CreatedById":124873,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-23T22:47:38Z","Content":"Ok...I just made sure that I\u0027m not going crazy and my hardware is sane by testing KSP installation on nearby laptop.

The physics.cfg that comes with a fresh install of KSP 1.04 is different than one generated by KSP under stock conditions if the original physics.cfg is deleted.\n\nWhat differences that makes, no clue. \n\nI\u0027m at a loss. All I can say is BRING ON 1.05.\n\nEDIT: WHOA...so using the auto generated physics.cfg causes exactly what is happening (skyrocking temps). Using the physics.cfg that comes with a fresh install temps stay nice and cool.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-25T21:31:41Z\u0022 title=\u002210/25/2015 09:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by StoryMusgrave**"},{"CreatedByName":"Svm420","CreatedById":136047,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-25T21:38:57Z","Content":"\u003E EDIT: WHOA...so using the auto generated physics.cfg causes exactly what is happening (skyrocking temps).\n\nKnown issue never let KSP generate that file.
