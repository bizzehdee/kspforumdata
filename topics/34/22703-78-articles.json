The parts still work (haven\u0027t tested them on the latest version of KSP, but I bet they still work) but it\u0027s not a true functional mod since you can\u0027t access it on the tech tree in career mode.

(\u0026lt;-- Link to thread here on Forums) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, Devo? I want to note some interesting things I just started noticing recently after playing with this a while. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne - It\u0027s a 2-man pod. When I first saw it, I thought it was a 3 man pod, based on the size. But no - it\u0027s a 2-man with some extra consumables. (I think it\u0027s got a little bit of extra life support if you\u0027ve got TAC or one of the other Life support mods)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, when you look at this thing from the outside... well, I don\u0027t know about you, but I notice a vague resemblance to the Eagle\u0027s pod, at least in the way the windows work in regards to the overall shape and size. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/05afBRk.png\u0022 alt=\u002205afBRk.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut that\u0027s not the important part. It\u0027s actually something I noticed AFTER spotting the following: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd it took me awhile to spot it. But once I did, I had one of those \u0022Holy .... why didn\u0027t I see that sooner?\u0022 moments!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELook at the following IVA image: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nwXqxBc.png\u0022 alt=\u0022nwXqxBc.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow - here\u0027s my \u0022sell\u0022. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDoesn\u0027t that look like the geometry in general has the makings of a wonderful Eagle IVA interior? \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t see it? Let me take you through my thought process to point out the details. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst - Forget the actual windows you see. Ignore them and imagine them to be flat grey bulkheads like the surrounding walls. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond - note the Quarter-Circle control panels directly in front of the Kerbal eyeline. On the far left side of the image, look for the word \u0022Monoprop\u0022 if you\u0027re having trouble seeing what I\u0027m talking about. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow - Imagine those control panels replaced with Eagle front windows. NOW does it start to come together? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I am suggesting here is this: Take away all the actual details - the controls and switches and windows. Strip it down in your minds eye to the basic geometry. What the SHAPES of everything is in this virtual area. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith only a SMALL amount of tweaking, this becomes the PERFECT \u0022skeleton\u0022 upon which to build an Eagle IVA! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn place of the existing windows in that IVA and the walls they are set in, put the large yellow panels of the Eagle cockpit. Windows go where I noted above. Layer in controls, switches and displays based on the Space 1999 Eagle. Make the back door (and there is one in this IVA, I just didn\u0027t shoot an angle of it) into the classic shape, etc, etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow - this is work done by Nertea. So obviously you\u0027d need to work with him and acknowledge/credit his help. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re wondering if he\u0027d be inclined to do so? Well. Heh. This IS the same designer who put together the Mark IV Spaceplane mod.
