I know the new atmospheric model may make getting it into orbit (and back) a significant hurdle at the very least.

And, I will be honest, I don\u0027t use IVAs very much. That crew module, essentially a box high in a cargo bay, looks good but what do you do with the interior view of something that is essentially an airliner cabin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a try-out project, but a crew cabin that can be attached to a cargo bay is something I can see myself making. No IVA, but a central attachment node connects to an offset box. Maybe a couple of attachment nodes for a docking port. Rotate it to put the crew compartment at the top or bottom of a cargo bay. Make the node locations right, and you could put a space telescope so that it can look out of the open cargo doors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be two parts instead of one, but it would be a bit like the real-world SpaceLab stuff carried by the Shuttle. On my test flights I had a fair number of science parts mounted on the rear bulkhead of the cockpit. And no IVA would make the top-or-bottom choice fairly easy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a practical working point. the Mk4 cockpit and the Spacelab module would be fitted with attachments without needing the rest of the spaceplane active in the SPH. You\u0027d need a cargo bay section to check clearances. Maybe a square cupola-like module that, with different .cfg files, could be extra crew space, or a science lab. Also a KIS/KAS compatible pallet-thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI may have come up with something here...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA duplicate install with spaceplanes instead of big boosters looks worth it.
