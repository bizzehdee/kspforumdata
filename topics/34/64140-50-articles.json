The last time I actually managed to do so, I was running StretchyTanks rather than ProceduralParts...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I was wondering- is it actually still possible to build a mammoth fuel tank large enough to, say, stick a cluster of 8 Mainsails (or better yet, the SLS-tyle upper stage engines) under and launch it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m aware that since fuel tanks are pressure vessels, there are limits to their absolute volume in real life.

This is because fuel tanks are pressure vessels- so shapes with more surface area can have proportionally thinner walls...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo there\u0027s no reason to think I couldn\u0027t build a fuel tank 25 meters wide and only 5 meters tall, for instance... Any limits on tank size in ProceduralParts *should* realistically be connected with tank volume (and increase with tech level) rather than tank dimensions, for realism...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut besides that, a single \u0022fuel tank\u0022 part could also just as well be envisioned as a number of smaller fuel tanks withing a single aerodynamic shell- an important distinction over using multiple smaller tanks for FAR, and one requiring far fewer struts and lower part-count... (Procedural Fairings could, in theory, be used to construct such an aerodynamic shell around smaller tanks instead- but the fairings/fuselage cost algorithm doesn\u0027t currently scale well for such gigantic applications, and quickly becomes disproportionately high...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, anyways, the question is this- IS IT POSSIBLE? Will I be able to build the massive, giga-huge fuel tanks of my dreams once I unlock the final tech nodes (such as Experimental Rocketry)- or will I forever be limited to fuel tanks roughly in the 5 meter range and below? (Keep in mind that many rockets with diameters exceeding 10 meters- the size of Saturn V- have been proposed in real life, and would have been perfectly feasible...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EP.S.\u003C/strong\u003E The reason for my desire for huge rockets is actually, though this may sound strange, cost-savings. I am hoping to build enormous rockets to launch fuel extremely cost-effectively to LKO, as larger rockets require proportionately fewer guidance systems and have superior ballistic coefficients which cause them to experience relatively less atmospheric drag for their payload capacities. Also, if I can convince NathanKell to actually fix the boil-off equations for RealFuels so they are proportional to tank surface area rather than tank volume, like in real life, then the gargantuan orbital fuel depots this will allow me to support should also experience proportionally less losses to boil-off, again precisely like in real life- where bigger fuel tanks have relatively less boil-off due to their superior ratios of surface-area-to-volume, via the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square-cube_law\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESquare-Cube Law\u003C/a\u003E...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-17T10:04:48Z\u0022 title=\u002210/17/2014 10:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 17, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OtherBarry","CreatedById":100948,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-17T11:13:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Northstar1989\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Northstar1989\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHey \u003Cp\u003E(...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, anyways, the question is this- IS IT POSSIBLE?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMyself and NathanKell were having a discussion about this earlier.

I use them for RSS, and have no issue building rockets so large that the launch clamps hang several metres off the side of the launchpad. There are a few limitations on the lower end of the spectrum though. I don\u0027t think you can go below 0.01m radius or height, so no 2 dimensional objects unfortunately.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-18T02:19:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe max diameter and max length are set to float.Infinity \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat I\u0027m doing PP doesn\u0027t have relation to boiloff per se, because as I answered there, a single part may have many tanks inside it and thus you shouldn\u0027t base (RF \u0022sub\u0022 tank) surface area on the part\u0027s surface area.
