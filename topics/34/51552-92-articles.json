Once I am satisfied, I unfocus the spacecraft (usually by loading up another on the launch pad) and edit the orbits in the save file so they are at the exact set of orbital parameters I want. Then, I never go to them in game so the rails will just stay there forever and ever. I justify this as continued RCS maneuvers over a long period of time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a network of four satellites at KSO, spaced at 90 degree increments with no inclination. Two of them are 45 degrees ahead of and behind KSC, giving KCS an equal distance line of sight to either one. This redundancy is in case any one of my satellites fails - the network will still be able to function well enough for me to replace it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach sat has one Communicotron-32 to communicate with the others as well as anything else within an orbit of about 2*KSO. The spacing is so precise that if any sat were to librate in it\u0027s orbit by more than 150 meters, it would lose contact with one of the others. That\u0027s why I used save file editing to place them in exact orbits. Each then has three of the 50 Mm, 45 degree cone directional antennae (not sure what they are called) which are perpetually aimed at the Mun, Minmus, and a long (interplanetary) range comms station and telescope that I keep in a 50 Mm orbit just past Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough there is a brief signal blackout as the comms station passes into kerbin\u0027s shadow, it\u0027s a very tiny delay compared to the period of its orbit, and wouldn\u0027t even be noticed by an interplanetary vessel over the course of its transfer. Between this station and my sats, KSC effectively has a clear line of communication with any point in the inner solar system for all 6 hours of its day!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd on top of that, I just completed an orbital space station in LKO that acts primarily as a refueling depot, but doubles as a command station in orbit, so even if my network went down, I still have long range communicability to some degree.
