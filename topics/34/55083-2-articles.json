I think I\u0027m doing one thing, but another thing happened it seems. Looks like the tree.cfg I uploaded is Yargnit\u0027s tree from another save folder. Correct tree.cfg is uploaded now. I wonder.. if the tree will still work if it\u0027s not named tree.cfg. I mean, it\u0027s just another .cfg and I don\u0027t think the game cares where they are in the file structure, they are all put in one big long list of .cfgs. If this is the case, tree.cfg shall soon be further known as AckandersVerticalTechTree.cfg. At least if you download it from me.\u003Cp\u003EI will see about the TreeEdit requirement today. It might be so, I never tried loading the tree without it, in fact.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn a way, this was intentional.. so you could appreciate the grandure of the adventure that was laid out before you. I can compromise, perhaps, and decrease the costs to get to survivability and maybe include wheels sooner?

There was a time when the Kerbals had no rockets. Instead of the usual science grind like the one you might be used to, I\u0027m giving you the means to imagine being a kerbal administratengineer from before there were rockets, gazing up at the Mun and stars and the sun moving across the huge empty sky in abject wonder and belated misery that you don\u0027t know what the heck lies up.. above the ground, when suddenly you are hit by inspiration, and a rock because you live underground when the inspiration hit you too, and you start getting ideas and images in your mind of walking among the stars and touching the Mun and some of the faster moving stars, if only there was a means to leave the ground.. the ground that gives you life, but you feel hope when you think of up above, hope for excitement, for adventure, for chaos bound by moments of crystal clear order, so you make a deal with yourself that you will find out what is above and you need help, because you don\u0027t have the faintest idea of how to go about getting away from Kerbin, which is why you organize your fellow kerbal and share your wild ideas and dreams of a new and better and exciting future, up on the surface and beyond, perhaps among the Mun and stars, so a whole heap of kerbals rise with you at your back to the surface, the desolate and sparsely vegetated surface and there, yes there by the big outside lake you stand tall and proud as your adventurous group shape and build the land into something new, something better, something fearful like when you are young and you know there\u0027s nothing in the lake, but you still worry about something finding you and getting you but no more for you are an adult now and no fear of the unknown will stop you, or your brethren as you build the most magnificent and glorious of structures arrayed in a compound there by the big water so big and vast like the dark sea of stars above in the night sky that you know with all your being you will see and touch and maybe taste like the future glory and victory when you finally get there but first, always first, you must look about you, you and your people, you must figure it out for everyone\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s sake, not just your own fulfilment of twisted and weird feelings and dreams, dreams that you have when you sleep and when you stare awake at the sky and oh how you\u0027re tired now, tired and ready to begin your journey to somewhere, but first you must sleep, perhaps in one of them metal tents with transparent rock windows that someone found earlier and started reproducing them for everyone to sleep in, because they are only big enough for one kerbal to fit into and sleep in like you are doing right now, snagging your strange new suit on which was likewise just found that keeps you so comfortable and warm feeling until you wake up, dazed and tired still inside the metal tent with windows when you notice something, something odd and new, like the scent of newly discovered flowers that you just normally forget about not too soon afterward, but this time, it is different, for you decide to write down what you\u0027re noticing in a report thing so others can read it and learn from it, but for now, you need to get back in your tent because you\u0027re still tired, so you write another report thing after you get in about your situation within the tent, after which you try to figure out who you\u0027re going to give the reports to because you know someone must see them, they need to see the reports so you and your kind can gain new knowledge and understanding and perhaps someday have the ability to go up, far up, and touch the Mun with your own hands, but first the reports must be made by your kerbal people, and turned in, so you go to the top of that new structure they built and sit and give orders and directions and plan and scheme to be ready for the time when kerbals are ready to leave the ground...... aaaaannnd that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s when you get to grind the science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy my reckoning, you only need 25 science points to get small SRBs, and another 50 to get liquid fuel capability. In only a couple of flightless launches, you should be able to gather enough science in and around the KSC to really start taking off, as it were. You really do not need parachutes if you have liquid rockets, and probably can skip solid booster only flight because you have some much science after a little while.

This maxed out the report and surface sample science pretty quick for the launch pad and runway. For KSC I put 10 pods together in a line on its side, five facing in each direction. Used that as a rover to get to the ocean and grasslands speedily but with limited range, used action groups to control direction, maxed out the science for those as well. Played around with just the pod, truss, and the boosters and pipes from LLL in basic rocketry for a bit to see if I could make an arrangement whereby it would be possible to just fly with solids... did not find a solution here, however, I did have enough from my pod rover to get liquid engines, which I used like the Grasshopper to get to space and the highlands/mountains. From there I opened the bigger liquid engine and then science etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like your idea about grabbable science experiments a lot, however I am no programmer, just an air and space engineer. KAS would be a great plugin to implement this too, with grabbing and such. It would be interesting for the kerbals to get out, grab their pack from the external experiments locker, and deploy the experiments about the landing site. It could be like the Apollo\u0027s ALSEP, with multiple experiments. Something that I think should change is how science is gathered. (Which, if I\u0027m not mistake is something Squad might already have talked about implementing) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot only should there be individual sampling and experiments, but also there should be experiments that sit there and collect data continuously. The data is transmitted back to Kerbin, or perhaps some suitable nearby facility for processing the data, which is turned into the science currency. Experiments, and other parts, for that matter, can have a life expectancy, so eventually they wear out from the environment or fuel consumption in the case of RTGs and such. Back on Kerbin, there should be limited resources for building new missions in the form of money and building time requirements, and limited capacity to process data, so just because you design a mission that goes out and collects a potential of 1,000 science points, they can\u0027t all be cashed in so to speak until the data is processed. The money should be an important part of the game. If you can just fast forward to get data processed into science, your program\u0027s funding might falter because of waning public approval if government funded, or revenue in general if a commercial enterprise, and meanwhile, some other governmental or corporate agency is vying for the same contracts and money you are. You could play through the whole transition from government agency, to corporate entity over a long enough time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is beginning to sound like a summary for Space Program Tycoon, hm...

But after spending few hours. Playing it (about 3-4) I can see its highly personalized.\u003Cp\u003EStarting grind is just to long and hard. If you don\u0027t follow one *true* path you won\u0027t make it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example I myself bought the solid booster then a normal rocket, was trying to do all the stuff to get science, from running to watter to trying to crash land.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell more or less I did earn some science but still It would require for me to level up the logistic that are pretty much useless, then open up parachutes. So before you get to chutes you need ~200\u002B science which is just bad. So I modified my config and gave myself a chuute at solid booster node. Grinded the logistic, then bought the chuute node (just for the sake of unlocking it as it would be normally).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I went for thermometer thinking I would earn some more science points faster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I got one battery so my rockets wouldn\u0027t fly around heedlessly with FAR. Bought the winglets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd now I was thinking about buying the radio so I could somehow work it out and send the mission to minmus, basically one way ticket for some science points.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut well I still need like 20\u002B/- science, and I did all research I could. All that is probably left for me is north pole. I got all the high/low orbit grassland/dessert/watter sample and eva stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo basically I have no radio antena, basic engine, basic booster, smallest fueltank, and the only way for me to get some science points now is, either flying around like a headless chicken around Kerbin for hours grinding some low amounts of science points.

With feedback like this, I can do some kind of job balancing out the sore spots, like the entire beginning for instance, and then the costs. Speaking of costs, you should have seen them when I first started this project. I think total science required for all nodes was 43,000 and something science points, but it was a nice looking tech tree... in the shape of a \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/va8UcwI.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Etree\u003C/a\u003E.... and there were only 70 or 80 nodes back then compared to the 140 of now, so they have come down quite a bit, I would say.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing I had not considered until a few seconds ago is that the costs per node on the stock tree will buy you more than just one type of part. I need to orchestrate situations where the same amount of science can generally afford you a few different categories of parts too. I do see how the beginning is rather arbitrary, and it was a small struggle for me to decide to go this route. I did not want to make it too easy or too hard or time consuming... it seems I went too far in the latter direction. It should be ok, as long as everyone gives me a chance to fix it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome other things I have been thinking about are cross discipline lines, an Aerospaceframe Discipline (space planes), and whether or not solid and liquid motors and rockets should be separated from one another. Adding either or both disciplines will invariably complicate the \u0027cleanliness\u0027 of the tree with more cross-discipline lines making it hard to see what node leads to where.

Prices also seemed well whacky. For example I\u0027ve seen that some of first upgrades are 25-50 science for 1 part or two. While later in the tree, for example you could get few engines and fuels for 60-100 points. To much disparity in my opinion.

Mechjeb already have some limitations in stock version where you need additional stability upgrades to unlock new functions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you really want kerbals to start with no rockets, then at least allow a creation of some simple rover. That would require some crappy wheel and one solar pannel or at least weakest battery in the logic department.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example when I unlocked second logic node, just to get the Info part (that allow to print info for other users or some other useless things for me) I\u0027ve felt like someone slapped me in the face.

KSP is a pretty casual game, best way would be to do 2 configs if you want to have the hardcore and normal version. Hardcore version could have engineers working out some machines of doom, while normal version would have players having a harder grind than vanilla, but not as hard as it is now where it basically becomes a korean mmorpg style farming for every science point up to the last 0.1.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fronbow","CreatedById":95397,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-06T10:56:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is all interesting stuff!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis thread has an interesting windows util that might be of interest to you - \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/24931-0-22-KSP-Utilities-Save-backup-application-Tungsten-Alpha-2\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKSP Utilities (KSP TreeCreator)\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI only bumped into it last night and it looks like a good trade-off to trying to do it in-game if you have a list of the part names - and I\u0027ve seen something somewhere that will give a list of part names by traversing the addon directory (can\u0027t for the life of me remember where, but it\u0027ll come back to me I\u0027m sure!).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will gladly help flesh out the descriptions as it seems like this tree could very well get to be a mammoth task for you alone - have you got a github type place for it?

Grinding may be fun, but I don\u0027t think even kerbals are so whacko/dumb to send a kerbanaut around their globe to pick up samples.\u003Cp\u003EYour example of 7-10 command pods rover thing is what I said, you made the game to be played in *1 style*. I for example made a capsule with SRB and girders everywhere hoping to survive landing. I could crash land on earth, but water instantly killed me. Basically FAR requires rocket to look like rockets, or it will be a flying pancake of doom.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlying pancake of doom, nice. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Xat\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Xat\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo well you need to work out the starter pack or first node, to contain at least a parachute. Prices also seemed well whacky. For example I\u0027ve seen that some of first upgrades are 25-50 science for 1 part or two. While later in the tree, for example you could get few engines and fuels for 60-100 points. To much disparity in my opinion. First parts should be cheaper, later parts should be more expensive.\u003Cp\u003EMechjeb, well I\u0027ve seen that mechjeb is almost at endgame requiring nice sum of points. I don\u0027t think anyone will like this tree if they can\u0027t get mechjeb soon. Mechjeb already have some limitations in stock version where you need additional stability upgrades to unlock new functions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn overall price reduction is eminent. I\u0027m thinking probes should be no probs to get to and start building. No particulars on this yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Xat\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Xat\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf you really want kerbals to start with no rockets, then at least allow a creation of some simple rover. That would require some crappy wheel and one solar pannel or at least weakest battery in the logic department.\u003Cp\u003EFor example when I unlocked second logic node, just to get the Info part (that allow to print info for other users or some other useless things for me) I\u0027ve felt like someone slapped me in the face. It costed me 50 points just to move in the node.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EParticulars on this: Treat the first few nodes as a history simulator as I intended, where if anything, the hardest part for the player will be to read the descriptions. They are not that long, either. So a requirement of one launch, to get the couple of science points to get to what we can all agree on now (at least I think we agree?), should be starting equipment. Making you suffer as the kerbals did during early space flight testing doesn\u0027t sound all that fun, now that I think about it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Xat\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Xat\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo first nodes should be cheaper or at least have some stuff that actually matter and allow to progress. For that you have to take into account that most users wont have ALL the recommended mods.\u003Cp\u003ESo I would say you have to work it out somehow, that players can with medium difficulty get to minmus/mun even as one way trip and farm some science points to move their research into future projects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat would probably require some well placed decoupler,even the crappiest solar panel, antena, rover parts so they can drive around mun farming science points. Then after they get enough they can send rescue mission to get jebediah back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou have to remember that most players only play with Jeb or 3crewed ship at most, flying usually 1 mission at a time. Requiring 7-10 kerbals or few crews, for example sending dozens of mun landing one way ticket missions on all of mun diomes, and then getting them all back safe and sound after getting sience, may not really be well received by some.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo sum it up, tree is well thought more or less, with few blank spots here and there or issues with open trees because of no nodes (based on mods you have), but it still requires to cater to wider audience. KSP is a pretty casual game, best way would be to do 2 configs if you want to have the hardcore and normal version. Hardcore version could have engineers working out some machines of doom, while normal version would have players having a harder grind than vanilla, but not as hard as it is now where it basically becomes a korean mmorpg style farming for every science point up to the last 0.1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, what you have described to me here ::points:: it does not sound like a fun time to me. Let me assure you I hear you and am working to address this. This is what happens though when I do not have contact with my potential customers until after product release, as I tended towards making it for myself, hoping I was normal like everyone else who would use it. Hopefully, the next revision when someone says it is too easy will be easier, eh? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E:wink:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EList time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPlanning to\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003Euse the same list as last time because sleep thought it would be funny to push its way up the ladder, so to speak\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ackander","CreatedById":90879,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-06T15:36:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022fronbow\u0022 data-cite=\u0022fronbow\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis is all interesting stuff!\u003Cp\u003EThis thread has an interesting windows util that might be of interest to you - \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/24931-0-22-KSP-Utilities-Save-backup-application-Tungsten-Alpha-2\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKSP Utilities (KSP TreeCreator)\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI only bumped into it last night and it looks like a good trade-off to trying to do it in-game if you have a list of the part names - and I\u0027ve seen something somewhere that will give a list of part names by traversing the addon directory (can\u0027t for the life of me remember where, but it\u0027ll come back to me I\u0027m sure!).\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis does look interesting, I will be sure to check it out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022fronbow\u0022 data-cite=\u0022fronbow\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI will gladly help flesh out the descriptions as it seems like this tree could very well get to be a mammoth task for you alone - have you got a github type place for it?
