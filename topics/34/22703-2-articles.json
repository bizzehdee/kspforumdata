When you start putting a whole bunch of stuff in the same general area, PART COUNT MATTERS. And this version of the launch pad had something like 40 parts. So I am looking at cutting the part count WAY down. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso - thinking of how to get this thing up to the Mun - legitimately without Hyperedit. At first I was thinking of adding engines and stuff to it to fly itself there. But then I had the realization about the part count and knew I was going about it all wrong. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo instead of pushing it up there with engines underneath - I\u0027m looking at moving it with a giant skycrane arrangement and then drop it into place with the skycrane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIdeally, I\u0027d like to add just a bare minimum of parts to allow things like docking and linking up with other Moonbase segments. And maybe an internal fuel supply and a docking port for refueling. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m also wondering about the possibility of using landing gear of various types to level the pad if it winds up I need to put it on not so level terrain. I have various ideas about that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"techno65535","CreatedById":160947,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-20T09:02:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGlad to hear you\u0027re thinking of revisiting/expanding on the station rings. Big request I\u0027ve got at this time would be for a ring that can rotate and have parts attached radially to it. That is, anything attached to the stack nodes at the hub wouldn\u0027t turn, but anything attached to the surface of the ring/to the struts would rotate with the ring. Would probably require tying into damned robotics. Constant rotation without having to hold down a button would be a big bonus.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Devo","CreatedById":22750,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-20T12:38:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EReady for crashing...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpdated first post, but will post here for convenience..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.devogeninteractive.com/picup/image.php?id=662A_51728AA6\u0026amp;jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022image.php?id=662A_51728AA6\u0026amp;jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe WT51 Kerban transport was designed... well.. really with no design plan in mind.

Logan will also understand the need for it, the fuel\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewas being drained too fast and no matter how it was loaded or the amounts, to do this in a single or 2 stages was the aim, without mechjeb\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eengine toggling or mumech engines. These are all liquid engines, not a big deal to some, but the first I have ever released as I always used\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emechjeb engines.
