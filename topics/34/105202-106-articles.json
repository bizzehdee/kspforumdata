But Bill keeps switching to Tourist once supplies run out \u002B15d.  He\u0027s on Mun with 5 whitesuits, MET 65d\u002B.  I\u0027ve changed the Crew and Engineer values from Tourist in the save file, but it switches back.  I thought the orangesuits were immune to giving up.  What am I missing?\n\nThe annoying part is that he\u0027s there to maximize drilling so they can get off the surface quicker, but as a tourist, I don\u0027t get the Engineer bonus to drilling...\n\nPosting for notify"},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-13T18:12:57Z","Content":"Orange suits are no longer the defaults - take a look at your settings by clicking on the USI-LS icon while at the tracking center and you can change it there\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-13T18:13:08Z\u0022 title=\u002206/13/2016 06:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 13, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by RoverDude**"},{"CreatedByName":"ortyblz","CreatedById":138454,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-13T18:18:23Z","Content":"K thanks.
