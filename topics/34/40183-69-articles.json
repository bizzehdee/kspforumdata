Maybe dynamic difficulty, based on how much you spent on previous missions, maybe just make the payout for science heavy missions very small, near the limit of the minimum possible budget, while having some lucrative commercial missions to places/orbits that you\u0027ve already obtained science from. This way the more skilled players don\u0027t have to do easy missions if they don\u0027t want to. I think it would take a lot of playtesting to figure out the best way to balance the wide range of player skill.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Apollo13","CreatedById":74572,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-05T14:33:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0022Repair Satellite\u0022 mission did not register completion of the task.
