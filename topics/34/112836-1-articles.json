Give the underdogs of the space-race a second chance! Some stock parts which don\u0027t \u0022fit\u0022 well with the Soviet-theme are removed (the Mk1 Pod, mercury look-alike, for example) and almost all of the Tantares parts are renamed, re-arranged on the tech tree, or modified in some other way. Rockets tanks are grouped logically by their SL codename# for easy reference, and subassembly parts are included for the major launchers. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E ships are also included for the major crew pods. Adds custom flags (including lettering of Soviet shuttle names) and agencies. Also, a placeholder IVA is added to crewed parts which currently lack one (the \u0022hitchhiker storage\u0022 IVA is used as the placeholder)\n\nRequires: [Tantares \u0026 Tantares LV](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/73686-113-tantares-stockalike-soyuz-and-mir-3603072016atv/) , [AB Launchers](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/96141-11-ab-launchers-12-5m-energia-parts-22-apr/), [Contract Configurator](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/91625-113-contract-configurator-v1190-2016-09-04/), [Module Manager](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/50533-113-module-manager-2625-may-19th-where-the-singularity-started/), [Additional Progression Contracts](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/144401-additional-progression-contracts-10-72316/) , [MonkeyBusiness Retro](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ctqjl806x5eemki/MBIretro12pre.zip?dl=0) (you don\u0027t need it\u0027s dependencies) , [FireSpitter](https://github.com/snjo/Firespitter/blob/master/For%20release/Firespitter/Plugins/Firespitter.dll?raw=true) DLL only\n\nOptional but suggested: [Near Future Electrical](https://spacedock.info/mod/558/Near%20Future%20Electrical) (currently busted, but will start working as soon as it\u0027s update lands), [EVA Parachutes](https://spacedock.info/mod/991/EVA%20Parachutes%20%26%20Ejection%20Seats)(Vostok can be a bit tricky to land...),  [Kosmodrome](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/85861-105-kosmodrome-space-centre-v10-career-edition-24022016/\u0026) and [Kerbal Konstructs](https://spacedock.info/mod/1052/Kerbal-Konstructs) (dont use the KK bundled with Kosmodrome, use the main mod linked here), [Kerbal Planetary Base Systems](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/133606-130-kerbal-planetary-base-systems-v143-1-june-2017/)   \n*NOTE : If you are missing KPBS, and/or NFE, some of the nodes at the top of the tech tree will be empty. Not a problem, just realize that it isn\u0027t a bug if you see it.*  \n\nOptional and compatible:[Anomaly Surveyor Contract Pack](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/98666-113-contract-pack-anomaly-surveyor-v170-2016-07-22/)\n\nDepricated: [Q Orbital Systems](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/114216-104-q-orbital-systems-pressurized-modules-docking-antennae-and-stockalike-orion-capsule/#post2042543) - patches still included, but parts are now duplicates.\n\nIncompatible: The vast majority of other parts packs. Sorry. The from-scratch tech tree will cause other parts packs to throw their parts in really weird places.\n\nCredits : This mod contains, with permission, parts developed by Beale, LinuxGuruGamer \u0026 Lack, Hraban, and SnowWhite, all under Creative Commons. A few were unfinished beta parts which I completed myself, others were forked. Also includes some icons from CommunityTechTree for the tech tree.\n\n**This mod uses modulemanager patches to handle parts - it doesn\u0027t automatically delete or modify any of your existing files.What you get:**   \n\nA bunch of new parts.  \n\nA brand new tech tree.  \n\nSome boosters that use Hypergolic fuels instead of liquidfuel\u002Boxidizer (some, not all)  \n\nA generous amount of new contracts with semi-linear progression of goals and individual mission programs.  \n\nPruning parts out of the dependent mods that don\u0027t \u0022fit\u0022 with the overall theme of the soviet space program.  \n\nHeavy editing of parts in the dependent mods to fit in the modified progression tree, and for balance purposes.  \n\nA bunch of craft files to use as templates - \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eincluding a WORKING Buran/Energia stack which is VERY easy to fly\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E.\n\n**Installation Instructions:**   \n\nUnzip the contents of \u0022gamedata\u0022 into your \u0022gamedata\u0022 like most other mods.  \n\nIf you wish, copy the craft files from the ships and subassemblies folders into your save.\n\n**Included example .craft files and subassemblies:**   \n\n- MiG-9 Fargo\n- MiG-21 Fishbed\n- La-7\n- Tu-2\n- Tu-95\n- Sputnik\n- Vostok\n- Soyuz\n- Soyuz\u002BLK\u002BN1 stack\n- TKS\n- Zarya\n- Zenit\n- PPTS/Federation\n- Buran\n\n**Gameplay Tips:**   \n\nThe progression curve is intended to be SLOW. To be very clear - \u003Cu\u003Eit is significantly more difficult to max the tech tree compared to stock KSP\u003C/u\u003E. You have to mine every last science point if you want to get ahead, especially leading up to the first Mun/Minmus landings.  \n\nUse autostrut for the Buran shuttle and the larger laundhers. Just do it.  \n\nJet engines have had their fuel efficiency SERIOUSLY NERFED to compensate for the addition of more efficient prop engines.  \n\nStart a new save with some extra funds, and upgrade your Launchpad and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E (in that order) to level 2 right off the start. Sorry - the R-7/Sputnik launcher is heavy, and has a lot of parts due to the vernier engines and will exceed the part/weight limtis of the level-1 pad and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\nThe included Mig-9 aircraft (Fargo) .craft is very useful in the early game for completing contracts and rounding up science from nearby biomes.\n\nTry not to \u0022get ahead\u0022 of the objectives you get contracts for. (Wait to do an orbital EVA until you get the contract for it in the Voskot program) Not required, but it makes the game more interesting.\n\nThe tech tree is balanced so you should be able to do Soyuz , Proton , etc all in Tier-1. Tier-2 is for manned Mun landings and interplanetary probes, and Tier-3 should get your manned missions to the other planets. It\u0027s possible to \u0022skip ahead\u0022 of course, but this is the logic behind placement of parts on the tech tree.  \n  \n**Known Issues:**   \n\nA few of the included booster .craft are *slightly* overpowered, which is almost unavoidable in a KSP mod of this sort.  \n\nThe included Buran craft is very high in the tech tree. Sorry about that. Consider trying it out in a sandbox save just for starters.  \n\nThe 3 meter fairing base appears more than once on the tech tree - for the life of me, I can\u0027t figure out why.  \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-06-05T01:17:04Z\u0022 title=\u002206/05/2017 01:17  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJune 5, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by tjsnh**\n  \nOverhaul Release"},{"CreatedByName":"rabidninjawombat","CreatedById":108889,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-13T13:39:33Z","Content":"Cool idea!

Do you think you could screenshot things like the tech tree, the parts list, and some of the part renames?\n\nThe tech tree is the stock KSP tree - but I\u0027ve moved a few (just a few) of the stock parts around on it, and moved most of the Tantares/TantaresLV parts around to make a more clear/consistent progression. For example, on the rocketry side one of the techs gives you most of the Proton rocket parts - another gives you most of the N1 parts, etc etc, rather than having one tech give you 30 tanks and engines. On the science/pods side of the tree, I swapped around quite a bit. For example, getting the basic folding solar panels for the Soyuz (named Koyuz in the pack) is no longer 8 techs away from getting the Soyuz crew capsule. \n\nFor renames most of the tanks are in SL-X-Y format. For example, the top stage of the soyuz booster is SL-4-C , the bottom stage of the N1 is SL-15-A , and so on with a few minor exceptions for booster systems that have more than one upper stage etc. The crewed systems are all renamed to be more kerbaly, Voskot , Koyuz, TKS is now Aurora, etc. The engines are mostly renamed to match their RD-XXX series counterparts. KD-108 , KD-33x8 Cluster, etc etc. Parts are also \u0022manufactured by\u0022 the corresponding OKB where possible. I\u0027ve studied the soviet space program quite a bit, long before KSP even, and when I\u0027ve renamed something I\u0027ve tried to give it a name that had some reference to the \u0022real\u0022 system, even if a few are a little obscure. \n\nKeep any suggestions coming, this is a live project.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-13T23:58:37Z\u0022 title=\u002206/13/2015 11:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by tjsnh**"},{"CreatedByName":"clivman","CreatedById":139191,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T01:34:28Z","Content":"Can someone please do this for a US oriented tech tree with probes first, this is a really cool project."},{"CreatedByName":"tjsnh","CreatedById":108021,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T01:40:47Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Can someone please do this for a US oriented tech tree with probes first, this is a really cool project.\n\nSoon ... :-)"},{"CreatedByName":"tjsnh","CreatedById":108021,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T12:02:45Z","Content":"Minor update posted, fixed a couple of typos (one of which was causing the vostok chute to be unavailable)."},{"CreatedByName":"MK3424","CreatedById":19932,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T12:28:28Z","Content":"If you guys like realism, then i would suggest to use the Kosmodrome addon for Kerbal Konstructs: it adds the Cosmodrome Baikonur to the game.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
