One side is the \u0022root\u0022 which is the part that doesn\u0027t move. This needs to be connected to the body FIRST before you can do anything else. THEN when you got it placed, you can ONLY place parts on the portion of the mesh that will do the actual moving. This is why your crafts don\u0027t operate correctly and this is where the orientation color you suggested comes into play. I have a new computer so I don\u0027t have Unity installed in order to repackage the graphics so it may take a day or two. I will however say that these models have been this way for some time, at least for me I get used to how the orientation should be and work around the confusion. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"m4inbrain","CreatedById":108770,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-20T23:51:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESince i can\u0027t edit my posting, because it didn\u0027t show up yet (-.-) ..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore going to space center:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s30.postimg.org/c40zb7k01/Correct_Position.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Correct_Position.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd when i came back from the space center, it looked like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s28.postimg.org/xt7ok7onx/broken_position.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022broken_position.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry for the borked images, i\u0027m just cropping willynilly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sirkut","CreatedById":57229,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-20T23:56:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ctbram\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ctbram\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ewill do.

This part is about the max volume that I permit. The lifter is my light/medium Soyuz style launch system. The payload is very light for this and so I have no aspargus staging and in fact the boosters are only 50% full of fuel and the center (spindly) stage 2 has the lower tank section locked or I could put this into orbit on the boosters alone.\u003Cp\u003EHere is a link to a video I made of the entire launch sequence.
