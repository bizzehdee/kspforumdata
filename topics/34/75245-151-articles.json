If you take a look at the \u0022ANTENNA\u0022 section of each station you will see that they have different ranges. For the launch sites it is 5 Mm, for ESTRAC / DSA stations it is 1.781 Tm and for the DSN stations it is 114 Tm. All the other \u0022uncategorized\u0022 stations have their own range.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAll the above apply only for RSS of course.[/QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSorry I thought they always had different ranges in rss.

The comm stream messages the player sees are all just for show - it just fires the triggered data transmission event at the end of the transmission and adds the science directly all at once, bypassing the science archives entirely. It will not degrade the science subject as it normally should, so the player could keep doing science in one spot indefinitely without it lowering the amount of science he gains. He also will have no record of this science in the science archives.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe purpose of triggered data transmissions is primarily for science that doesn\u0026#39;t come from one particular source. We can\u0026#39;t degrade this science, so it is good for things like the science lab that generate science over time.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nFortunately the RemoteTech data transmission module [b]does[/b] still use the comm streams, so this doesn\u0026#39;t affect it so much. Though I do wonder if he gets science twice perhaps? Once from the triggered event, and once through the comm stream? Anyway, the \u0022serious\u0022 edge case here is the player that uses RemoteTech, and then uninstalls it. Any data that was serialized with this fix in place will be flagged as triggered, and the regular module data transmitter will treat it as triggered data.\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-20T10:07:17Z\u0022 title=\u002211/20/2015 10:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Arsonide\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-20T10:23:18Z","Content":"\n[quote name=\u0027Arsonide\u0027]\u003Cbr\u003E\nFortunately the RemoteTech data transmission module [B]does[/B] still use the comm streams, so this doesn\u0026#39;t affect it so much.

The problem here is, with RT, stream doesn\u0026#39;t add science (this is expected), and after visual show is done, nothing happens (problem). So no duplicate here with my hack. For regular experiment, I think even if we do it twice, because the regular transmission/recover ratio is still honored, and given the current KSP design that second transmission will give you nothing, it might be fine even if there\u0026#39;s duplicate.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[quote name=\u0027Arsonide\u0027]\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnyway, the \u0022serious\u0022 edge case here is the player that uses RemoteTech, and then uninstalls it.
