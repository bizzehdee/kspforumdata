My first round against that was to introduce rate limiting (currently only supported by the Orbital pane) to prevent VOID from change values too often and making a blurry mess of things. The default value is about 15 updates per second, which to my quick testing had a good mix of \u0022not too fast\u0022 and \u0022not too slow\u0022.

This gives continuity in the units presented: no matter where you go or what you do, that value will be shown in megameters (unless you change it). I don\u0027t like this option, because it requires users to reconfigure values as situations change: on your trip out to the Mun, your altitude is relevant in megameters. When you\u0027re orbiting, it\u0027s relevant in kilometers. When you\u0027re landing, it\u0027s relevant in meters. When you change ships to your Eeloo probe, it\u0027s relevant in gigameters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you think?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"diomedea","CreatedById":93700,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-22T20:04:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@ toadicus: first, thanks for this excellent mod. One of the first I chose to install, and never had problems with it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you write \u0022always show this value at 3n orders of magnitude less than the actual value\u0022 I feel a bit confused, the values I need (and can find thanks to VOID) are to be precise enough. To make an example, when checking for a stationary orbit around a body, I go check Apoapsis and Periapsis to the last meter, even if the whole number takes 10 digits. For synchronization of orbits, I would like time with 0.01 seconds precision, but the orbit itself could even take years to complete. And that means using 10 digits to represent seconds, plus 2 decimal digits. Speaking of time, I believe it would be useful to change unit instead of scale (so to have all digits in seconds or the usual year day, h m s). Therefore, I like how VOID displays values now, but would not find it as useful if I had to choose a magnitude in Megameters and only have the last digit to show 1 Km. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI mean, precision and scale are two different things. I may at times accept to improve readability against less precision (changing number of digits used to show a value). Or, I want to change the scale to better read units (changing the position of the decimal place for metric units, or the system of units for time).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf at all possible, I would also like the possibility to show commas for any triplet of digits before the decimal place. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know that all is overloading the GUI, maybe you could use a single button for each value (like already you did for setting precision alone) to actually access a submenu where to access every setting about that same value. Even better, could you create a configuration window for each panel, to also be able to choose what values I want presented in that panel when opened (that would also help minimize the impact from the open panes on the GUI and the system).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tristavius","CreatedById":60879,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-23T00:32:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022toadicus\u0022 data-cite=\u0022toadicus\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first controls the magnitude relatively, i.e. \u0022always show this value at 3n orders of magnitude less than the actual value\u0022.

Anyway, I was certainly less than clear in my previous post, sorry. I failed to explain why I need such precision. Then, let me give an example: I want to build a station in a lagrangian point (I know KSP does not allow true Lagrange points as the gravitational laws are a bit \u0027tweaked\u0027, so let do with a fake one). I can simulate to be in a L4 or L5 point when relative position of my station to the minor body does not change with time (I suspect that L1, L2 and L3 points can\u0027t actually be faked in KSP). For L4 and L5 points, I need to have set my station with exactly the same orbital parameters of the minor body, but for longitude (that has to be apart enough to be outside of the minor body SoI). Because fake, my Lagrangian points are not intrinsically stable, therefore any minor deviation from the correct orbital parameters result in relative motion with the minor body. So, I want the upmost precision to keep such inconsistency to a minimum.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
