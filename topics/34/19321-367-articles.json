It deploys initially, but fails to unfold fully before the thing smacks into the ground. I thought it might be my reentry profile but I\u0027ve tried a few different ones and the same thing keeps happening. I don\u0027t think it\u0027s a bug but probably some feature of FAR that I haven\u0027t adapted my craft design to account for. Any ideas?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFAR includes \u0022RealChute Lite\u0022 which has a totally different method of adjusting the parachute parameters. If I recall the defaults are like 0.01atm 2 seconds and 700m 6 seconds. If the nuFAR-nuStock relationship is anything like the oldFAR-oldStock relationship, FAR is slipperier and 700m is too late for certain designs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDepending on what mods you have installed (e.g. Stock Fixes) the interface with these parameters gets a little cluttered and confusing with some being completely ineffectual and others quite hidden if you\u0027re used to the stock. I believe an installation with just FAR and its dependencies shouldn\u0027t have any adjustable bars. The \u0022toggle info\u0022 option is the one you want for adjustments to deployment parameters and/or the action menu and click the part in VAB.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jrandom","CreatedById":74522,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T18:30:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI built my first plane using the yellow cross section curvature guide to help minimize wave drag (and a \u003Cem\u003Elittle\u003C/em\u003E bit of area rule, but not much since I don\u0027t have Proc Parts installed yet), and this thing just \u003Cem\u003Escreams\u003C/em\u003E through the air.
