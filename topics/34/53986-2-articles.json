Right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChronicSilence: What engines do you have available? How much of a service module are you toting with the Mk1-2 pod? If you\u0027re lifting ~15t (Pod \u002B LES \u002B 6t SM/engine combo) you\u0027ll want something like 7-8MN of thrust. Assuming RSS, obviously. So you probably want a 6m core stage (or so) and maybe 3 Mainsails under it. Or you could do a core with boosters in 3m each, then a 3m upper stage, and an outward-fairing around the pod (like Soyuz).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have engine addons, you might want to use the Maverick V (if you run an efficient rocket) or the NP Quad Bronco (if you don\u0027t, and want higher TWR).
