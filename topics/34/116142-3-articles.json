The text box on the left is for text entry, this text string is what will show as the action\u0027s name in step 5 and you can type whatever you want in here.\n\n5) Go back to the Action Group Editor, this part works the same as stock KSP, you should just see new actions in the part\u0027s list that you added in step 4 and you can add them to an action group at this point.\n\n6) To confirm everything worked, launch to flight mode open the evelron\u0027s right-click menu, activating the action group will change the evelron\u0027s status in the right-click menu in real-time so you can confirm everything works on the runway without having to take off an test.\n\nHope that helps,\n\nD."},{"CreatedByName":"Deimos Rast","CreatedById":157420,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-05T04:18:31Z","Content":"[@Diazo](%7B___base_url___%7D/index.php?/profile/81549-diazo/) So I was actually going to make a video for as he requested, except not of FAR control surfaces, but of just switching SRB thrust values.

You can find it [here](https://youtu.be/7eTbta2fsbc). It\u0027s not the greatest, as I just discovered how to make videos last week (there is no audio, but I did edit out the unnecessary parts).\n\nIt\u0027s basically me using ModActions to make an ingame \u0022Thrust Curve\u0022 (aka hotkeys corresponding to different thrust levels) for an SRB, including 0 thrust, allowing me to stage the SRB and have it sit there idling at 0% thrust indefinitely, until I issue the next hotkey. Perhaps a bit cheaty, but that\u0027s besides the point - the point of the video is to show quickly and simply how to use ModActions and how it integrates with AGExt. The relevant part is only a minute or so long (setting up three hotkeys on an SRB), then it cuts to me showing it in action for two minutes (feel free to skip that part, it drags a bit).\n\n**Of importance**, and what took me a while to figure out (shown at the **0:40 mark**) is how to get the ModActions hotkeys to actually be recognized by AGExt. You have to \u0022refresh\u0022 AGExt by clicking on a *different* part than the one selected, then reselect the original part again and your hotkeys should be available. (This might be a bug, but it\u0027s always been this way).\n\nI assume you already know how to open the ModActions menu. If not, Blizzy\u0027s Toolbar --\u003E Configure Visible Buttons --\u003E Mod Actions. Same way you would open AGExt essentially.\n\n---\n\nIf you stick it out for the SRB portion, note that SRBs use engine response time, which is why the SRB doesn\u0027t cut off immediately and instead trails off slowly over the course of an *entire minute*. As I toggle the various thrust points (100/75/50/25/0 percent), pay attention to the KER deltaV display and the rightclick context menu info and you can see the relevant information change accordingly.\n\n[@Diazo](%7B___base_url___%7D/index.php?/profile/81549-diazo/)\n\nIf you have any ideas on how I could better improve the video to better demonstrate how to use your mod, let me know.
