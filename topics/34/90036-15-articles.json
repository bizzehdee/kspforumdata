You know those little rectangular things they pull out of the endurance cubes? I think it would be pretty easy to make them expand (animate) so it looks like inflatable habitats. It wouldn\u0027t be too hard to use some of the part_modules from the MKS/OKS mod, and end up with a full functional TAC compatible colony. Landing shouldn\u0027t be an issue. As I understand it, the lander goes upside down and uses the \u0027top\u0027 as a heat-sheild. Instead of using docking ports, we could use a part much like the asteroid claw, that way you don\u0027t need to make sure the part is oriented perfectly, facing the correct side, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E@benjee\u003C/strong\u003E I\u0027ve been thinking of making the wing of the ranger into multiple parts, that is, one for the wing for lift, and the wing tip bits will be the landing gear (could also be wing parts as well). I think this would help getting the gear to work, since the object (think blender/unity) that actually attaches to the ship will be stationary, and not animated, which I now think is the source of the problem I\u0027ve been having.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KrizzGaming","CreatedById":136752,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-29T02:34:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EThe Lander has 2 docking ports (top and bottom) It can be seen at the end of the docking scene \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/497203692_1280.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022497203692_1280.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xxhansonmaxx","CreatedById":130093,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-29T04:32:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KrizzGaming\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KrizzGaming\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EThe Lander has 2 docking ports (top and bottom) It can be seen at the end of the docking scene \u003C/span\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.vimeocdn.com/video/497203692_1280.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.vimeocdn.com/video/497203692_1280.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhen the lander comes out u can put however many docking ports u want....\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"benjee10","CreatedById":84110,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-29T21:06:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3AMRJi4.png\u0022 alt=\u00223AMRJi4.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETesting out placing the other vehicles on the ring to check scaling.
