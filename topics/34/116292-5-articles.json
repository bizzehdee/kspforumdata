The samples are good, the ones for SRBs make you feel all the power under the \u0022hood\u0022. But when played in a loop some of them feel a little monotonous like steam machines: \u0022choo-choo, choo-choo\u0022. I think stock engine sounds are played in a loop too but haven\u0027t such a noticable effect because they lack any significant peaks or distinct sounds that make ears catch the rhythm. May be the better way would be to play the samples in portions arranged in a random order rather than simply loop over the whole sample?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-05T09:11:23Z\u0022 title=\u002208/05/2015 09:11  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Ser**"},{"CreatedByName":"RyanRising","CreatedById":79932,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T02:51:11Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E What do you mean the jet engine are small?\n\nHe means that the turboramjet model seems to be scaled smaller than normal when you have this mod installed.
