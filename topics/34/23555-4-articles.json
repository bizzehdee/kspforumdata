I released the cable, retracted it, and grapple appeared again on the nose, but the cable was still not retracted.

I\u0027ve been looking for a method to deliver a rover I could pick up and move elsewhere since dropping a new one every time I move to some other exploration spot turned out to be tiresome. So I built a lander with two winched up DEMV Ant rovers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt worked fine in the space center, but it turned out that the force of winching is insufficient to produce a lock if the lander is on a 30% or so incline, so it keeps dangling.
