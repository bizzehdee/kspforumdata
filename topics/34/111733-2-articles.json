The perimeter of the tank barely has enough room to get enough landing legs and radial rockets on but my test rig managed a landed mass of 125 tonnes on Kerbin. The base diameter helps with landing on slopes, but the re-entry heating goes on for an awkwardly long time. The heat-shield doesn\u0027t get hot enough to ablate but the hot-gas flow fried the parachutes. The braking effect would have been small, but the engines ran out of fuel just above the ground.\n\nYeah, this sort of OTT Kerbalism does burn a lot of fuel, but the overall mass-ratio is going to be crazy-high without staging.\n\n(One of the spectacular ideas out in the real-world is the Russian use of rockets to augment the parachutes for heavy equipment. It lets them air-drop tank-like things. The trim-changes as they leave the aircraft must be exciting.)"},{"CreatedByName":"riocrokite","CreatedById":129319,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T07:10:48Z","Content":"great stuff! subscribed ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Temeter","CreatedById":58056,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T13:45:02Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E After much consideration and testing, I\u0027ve decided to update the engine ISP curves to make engines less powerful at sea level and a lot less fuel efficient in general.

In my effort to balance the parts to be truly stock-alike, I hope I at least made everyone equally unhappy.\n\nI wonder. Wouldn\u0027t that make single core rockets a lot harder to create? I honestly don\u0027t think stock is very well balanced in this regard. Even now stock favors using a bunch of 2.5m rockets to using a single 3.75m rocket, design/efficiency wise, and even more so ecnomically (aerodynamics hardly make a difference). KW Rocketry follows the stock formula, and their 5m engines perform even worse, being less costefficient in 90% of all cases. I did not test the behemoth engines for economics (lol), but i assume the will continue the trend of large rockets being worse and worse if they\u0027re balanced to stock.\n\nMind this is not just economically, but also design-wise: Large engines need to have huge thrust margins to be effective. Even heavy single core KWR rockets are often hard to create because of lacking thrust, and that\u0027s despite their largest engine creating 11kn of thrust. Beside being a lot more expensive, it\u0027s often just not enough thrust without a bunch of boosters, especially with the new ISP calculation. \n\nAgain, that\u0027s ofc a stock thing too. Imo KSP just isn\u0027t very well balanced in regards to super-heavy rockets. The 3.75m rockets do not feel to me like a continual, well scaled development, but rather a late-game tech with additional difficulty. Especially with the one being a pure high atmo/space-engine, and the other not supporting staging.\n\nWell, I think it might be best to wait for 1.0.3. There was some more engine-rebalancing announced.\n\n**Btw**, on a more general note: Some of the engine costs seem to be borked. I could see why the efficient Ajax costs a bit more than the boss, but it\u0027s rather weird how the double Ajax is the cheapest engine of the pack.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-04T13:50:54Z\u0022 title=\u002206/04/2015 01:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Temeter**"},{"CreatedByName":"greystork","CreatedById":131085,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T13:58:06Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E **Btw**, on a more general note: Some of the engine costs seem to be borked.
