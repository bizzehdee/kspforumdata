What does a nuclear detonation? It produces a lot of radiation(from heat to gamma) \u002B some particles that where the bomb before \u002B a decenct neutronflux. In the atmosphere, the radiation (and the neutrons) are superheating the atmosphere nerby, that causes the shockwave which do the \u0022work\u0022.\u003Cp\u003EBut in space, there is no atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat means, all radiation and neutrons and particles are going in every direction equaly. That means, even if the distance from the exploding bomb to the \u0022bumpplate\u0022 is zero (which can\u0027t be), only the half of the \u0022explosion energy\u0022 is hitting the plate. From this half, only a very tiny amount will be fast moving particles, that can actualy produce some sort of thrust. From these tiny fraction, only a tiny fraction will have the right angle to push the plate (the vast majory will be reflected without transferring kinetic energy). But the most energy of the detonation will be radiation \u002B neutron flux. What does that with the plate? It heats (and activate) it! Yeah! (Actual, the vaporization of some plate material will provide additional thrust, but it will be also very tiny)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yes, i don\u0027t think the \u0022orion drive\u0022 can work as told. Simply because it don\u0027t transfer the energy it produce in some kind of reaction mass properly. And it don\u0027t direct the reaction mass properly. And undirected energy/reaction mass don\u0027t produce thrust. No matter how many energy you have.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou simply need a kind of nozzle, that help you to direct the reaction mass, and you need a device that can transfer a decent amount of your energy into the reaction mass. (and not in the vessel superstructure)\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EThe entire body of the bomb \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E the reaction mass. For a 1MT detonation, the actual mass that has been directly converted to energy is less than 47 grams. If we take the W53 (America\u0027s highest-yield nuclear weapon ever in service - 9MT), then 418.6g of mass are converted to energy in the detonation. That warhead weighed in at 2800kg. That leaves ~2799.6kg which is now plasma moving at ridiculous speeds, because there is no atmosphere to impede it. In a vacuum, the speed of the plasma is proportional to the square root of the change in temperature of the debris. Since this is tens of millions of degrees in only a few milliseconds, the velocity is HUGE. The diameter of the pusher plate then becomes the determining factor for the specific impulse, expressed as what fraction of the plasma will hit the plate, which also depends on the distance from the fireball. \u003Cp\u003ESo, let\u0027s try this with a bog-standard W53 and a pusher plate 100m in diameter, with the explosion happening 1km behind the craft. I can\u0027t find any exact figures for temperature other than \u0022tens of millions of degrees\u0022, so we\u0027ll go with a 15 million degree change as a nice lowball figure. The fireball radius is ~1.2km, giving a surface area of ~1.8e7m^2. Our pusher plate is 100m in diameter, so our fraction is .0004. I also can\u0027t find anything noting exactly what is the proportional factor for the temperature to plasma velocity calculation, so I\u0027ll lowball that at .01, giving us a plasma velocity of about 1.5e6 m/s, or about .005c. Looking at bhangometer photos of nuclear tests, this feels about right. This (Isp = (C * Ve)/g where C is the fraction and Ve is the plasma velocity) gives us a specific impulse of about 61s. Fairly inefficient in this particular design, but I\u0027m worst-casing everything here, including design (plate much smaller than fireball, distance from fireball, etc). Plugging that into our handy-dandy thrust equation of F=Isp*Mf*g (specific impulse times mass flow rate times \u003Cem\u003Eg\u003C/em\u003E), we get a thrust from a single W53 hitting a 100m plate 1km away of about 1.7MN. That\u0027s only 1 bomb per second on a design produced by idiots. Optimize the plate/fireball diameter ratio with a spherical explosion, and the fraction goes to .5. That gives us an Isp of about 76452.6s. Using the same bomb (W53) at the same distance (1km), we now get 2GN of thrust. From one bomb per second.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAtmosphere vs. vacuum has nothing to do with it. Atmosphere is actually worse, because you encounter air resistance and compression heating. Look up the Pascal-B test from Operation Plumbbob: A 900kg steel plate was accelerated to at least 66km/s by the blast. It\u0027s figured that it didn\u0027t actually leave the atmosphere because of compression heating. Strip away the atmosphere, and it would have been single-stage-to-interstellar-space - the Sun\u0027s escape velocity at Earth is only 42.1 km/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENuclear Pulse Propulsion: Where bigger really is better.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jasmir","CreatedById":76744,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-18T19:14:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RabidMonkey\u0022 data-cite=\u0022RabidMonkey\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe entire body of the bomb \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E the reaction mass...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EYes, i know.

I\u0027m sure there would be a heck of an ablation if you use such a drive a lot to need thickness, but for structural strength a solid plate is not neccessary. In fact a lot of the mass of such a plate is the shock absorption mechanism that evens up individual pulses into something that won\u0027t shake the ship apart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I thought that the old designs included adding propellant around each bomb to increase efficiency of transfer of momentum to the vessel. This doesn\u0027t include the whole \u0027shaped charge\u0027 idea which generates a lobed blast, fore and aft less to the sides. True, you could never get 50% transfer even with a close blast, but with shaped charge you could start getting in that range. I was never sure how you \u0027lobe\u0027 a nuclear charge. It\u0027s hardly the same as chemical shaped charge after all which is vastly different in purpose and (I assume) mechanism.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlus, nuclear detonations do not vaporize as much as people assume. 1km seems an awful long way away for any kind of blast, especially as most pusher bombs were rated as (comparatively) small devices at less than a kiloton. With weapons tests in the ocean, and defunct vessels at less than a kilometer from the blast (and much bigger yields than we\u0027re talking here!) the hulks retained their form surprisingly well, despite not being designed to withstand that kind of force. A lot is simply because, just as in an orion ship, they could move freely and would be accelerated by the blast, riding the shockwave at least a little. True, that was primarily against concussive force in the atmosphere, but that actually makes ablation worse I believe.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RabidMonkey","CreatedById":76974,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-18T21:03:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Jasmir\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Jasmir\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYes, i know.
