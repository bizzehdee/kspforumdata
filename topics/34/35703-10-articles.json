Say you place 4 girders around a tank using 4x VAB symmetry and then you want to place wheels (or whatever) on just two of those girders, it will LOOK like it works, but will actually place 3 or 4 of the object on the opposite side from where you click to place it (so it would look like you placed the two wheels on two of the girders like you want to, but there will actually be one wheel on one side and 3 or 4 instances of the wheel on the opposite side). Playing around with this I can replicate it every time and it never works correctly -if you wanted to achieve the above example properly you\u0027d have to use SPH symmetry and add the other girders from scratch, rather than using the VAB symmetry to being with.
