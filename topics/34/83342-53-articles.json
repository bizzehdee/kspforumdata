Prior to that, procedural parts were stored like everything else (integer amounts and by part name) but the build times were still cost based, which meant you could build a tiny fuel tank, recover it, then build a huge fuel tank and it would still act like it was in the inventory. That\u0027s obviously not good. Without totally rewriting the inventory system (which is just a dictionary of part names and integer quantities), and since build times are cost based, I decided to store procedural parts as 100x their cost (which gives two decimals of precision). Essentially just the material is stored in the inventory, rather than complete parts, which gives you a lot of freedom. To make sure that procedural parts aren\u0027t then too powerful, they only have 1/10 of the inventory effect applied to them (which means build times are about 1/3 as long instead of 1/10).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt isn\u0027t an ideal system, but procedural parts make things difficult. As does TweakScale, which is also handled separately. In the future I might do a further breakdown where you can either store a procedural part as-is, or you can choose to break it into it\u0027s material components to use in different sized parts, which is the best of both worlds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RickKermen\u0022 data-cite=\u0022RickKermen\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHi, i\u0027m having a issue, when i press \u0022simulation\u0022 instead of \u0022build craft\u0022 in the VAB, i get no window to pick the simulation, and i can\u0027t do anything but kill KSP to desktop.\u003Cp\u003EAny idea what can it be?

KCT has a kinda weird way of handling KSC upgrades and I might actually change it since I can imagine some other cases where the current method would cause issues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now KCT waits until a building is upgraded, then downgrades the building and applies the timer. Unfortunately, downgrading a building triggers the building \u0022upgrade\u0022 event, but there\u0027s a workaround in place to prevent it from then further downgrading. Apparently, something somewhere breaks that workaround. I might instead override the upgrade buttons to call my own function, which will be incompatible with any other mods that do that (none that I know of right now, but the overriding of the Launch button has caused an issue or two in the past).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ebigunso\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ebigunso\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027d like to see how much time it takes for the rocket to roll out before I actually press the roll out button, so I can calculate more calmly on when I start rolling out.
