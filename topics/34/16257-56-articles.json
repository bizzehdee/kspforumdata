This is usually a bigger, heavier, setup where I have 4-5 large dishes (I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve ever managed to put 3 identical DSN\u0027s together as I always think of something between launches or a new mod comes out...) and an antenna or two and launch it suborbital. I use a *LOT* of parachutes and target it\u0027s landing to be about 120* east of KSC. I then make sure that I\u0027m still under TDRSS A\u0027s coverage for most of the flight so I can tweak the final landing, but I also have the parachutes modded to auto-deploy at 10KM on the way back in in case I loose connection.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext, I tweak TDRSS A\u0027s orbit so that I can communicate with both KSC and the new DSN station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext, I launch the second TDRSS satellite and deploy it to be about 50-55* EAST of DSN B (DSN A is KSC). I usually run the TDRSS A configuration on this satellite too. I always try to ensure that TDRSS B can \u0022see\u0022 both DSN B and TDRSS A with its omni antenna so that I have redundant connections.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext, I launch the second DSN and position it to be 120* WEST of KSC. This gives me 100% hemispherical coverage outside the Kerbin orbit. By deploying TDRSS B to a point almost over the horizon from DSN B, I get full connection to landing again. DSN C will then allow me to ensure coverage when I launch TDRSS C to a point between it and KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce the 5 stations are in place, I tweak the location of the TDRSS satellites so that they are as close to in synch with each other as possible (MechJeb gives a couple of readouts that I use where I can get them to have relative velocities that allow the network to stay in position for several years before needing to make any tweaks)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis gives me full coverage of all launches and most trips to the Mun and Moho from just the TDRSS network, and then the DSN with their big dishes gives me full coverage beyond that. I can continuously handle 4 long-range flights with this setup and \u0022comm share\u0022 several more, especially once I put manned flights up that can serve to \u0022supplement\u0022 the relay network.
