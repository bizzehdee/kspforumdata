It repeats dozens of times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I\u0027ve edit the group names back in. The AGExtEditor.cfg files updates and saves the config. Cool. As soon as I open up another ship, it reverts to a previous state, losing all the changes it had. (With the current instance of this issues, it will revert to an ~8kb file from a ~23kb file). This happens even if I reload the exact same craft I had just edited and saved. One other thing I notice is that my *.craft files have a lot of bloat for the AGX module. I\u0027ll find ACTION settings for groups I long since changed (or removed) and/or duplicate entries for the exact same action and group. In some cases, both. I do reused craft designs and fork them, so I know WHERE the old settings are from, but I have no idea why they are so persistent in residing within the saved .craft files. I can\u0027t tell if this is AGX\u0027s or just weird KSP behavior.

On the bright side, I no longer get a weird mish-mash of cross-craft group settings getting merged together. Since I re-used and edit/modify designs to fit whatever use I need (rather than from scratch each time), I used to get VERY OLD settings getting loaded with newer designs.

After my post, I went back and tried something:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI loaded a craft in the game I was playing when I made my post. FYI, this game instance had been running for a while (I passed out and forgot to exit...) I re-entered my group names for the craft and saved it. I alt-tab to double-check the AGExtEditor.cfg file for the savegame updated as it should. That checks out. I exit the SPH, exit the game, and quit KSP properly via the menus. I re-load the game, go back to the save, into the SPH, and load the craft file. BAM! Groupnames stuck this time.

It only reverts when I load a craft file while the bug is in effect (again, not really sure if it\u0027s AGX or inherent to KSP at this point...). If I do anything else, it keeps. I double check by Alt-tabbing out and opening the file in Notepad to be sure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far, now that I look back on it, seems to only really happen when a game instance has been running for too long (because of that, I have no idea what could be the actual cause for this in my case.) I do have a habit of using the Undo (CTRL\u002BZ) function in the Editor. I\u0027ve noticed many things KSP kinda dislike that function (I\u0027ll get sudden dupes of actions in the Actions groups; annoying when my engines DON\u0027T turn off because they now toggle an even number of times...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt happens with ANY vessel/craft file I use when it is in effect.

The bloated ACTION entries for action group inside .craft files really makes me think it\u0027s something in KSP itself. I can usually trim a few kB just from removing duplicate ACTION entries. I had similar problem even before I got AGX. I got AGX in the hopes it would solve THAT problem, which it has, sorta... I can post a *.craft file for the action group bloat if you want, though I\u0027m running a few dozen mods. The spaceplane example I have has dependencies on at least/around 5 mods minimum, so it might be hard for you to load in-game.

I\u0027ll have to do some part testing from that mod to narrow this down a bit more, assuming it\u0027s at fault...
