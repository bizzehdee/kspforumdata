The maneuver node integration featured is entirely done by myself, but it was so simple to implement that I\u0027d imagine the implementation in MechJeb is equally good, if not better. Also r4m0n knows exactly what I did to implement maneuver nodes since I told him the very second I did it. Developing for 0.18 was a very hectic period and us modders kind of stuck together in the process.

I launched 2x TDRS satellites last night and had no problem putting them in orbit working only with KSC active. Got the first one in orbit over KSC and was able to at least put the second one into Kerbostationary orbit although I need to spend some time phasing it into the right orbit 120* off the first (it\u0027s only about 50* off right now). It is still really satisfying, even using MechJeb2 to plan the maneuver points (and make a few of the maneuvers) to be able to successfully start launching these satellites into orbit knowing that one false move means I lose the satellite forever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and I\u0027m humbled to have something named after me.

A larger variety of antennas including ones that look snappy. Also, some sort of dish mounting system would be cool.
