There are 3 \u0022parts\u0022 which I would like to trim: the vertical speed (so that the set point is the speed it is actually going), the horizontal velocity autopilot (so that the craft doesn\u0027t rock back and forth) and the engines (so that it would take into account the time that jet engines etc. take to change throttle, stopping it from moving up and down). My idea for the vertical speed is that it would compare the set point and the actual speed then either change the set point it is using in its calculations or increase/decrease the speed as required. For the other 2 it would work out how long the craft takes to react to input and use that to decide when and how much to change the throttle/pitch/yaw/roll. I don\u0027t know whether this is possible or easy to code but it is something that I would like to see in all autopilot type things.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) it is possible with the proper PID controller on the vertical velocity instead of my black-magic controller I compiled with trial, error and some statistics. \u003Cstrong\u003EBut\u003C/strong\u003E, that would mean constant oscillations about the set-point, no way around it (just like with the horizontal speed where a PID controller is implemented). I\u0027ve done many tests with different setups of current and PID controllers for V-speed, and I reasoned it is preferable for engines and the whole vessel to have constant V-thrust and asymptotic velocity rather than constant velocity with jittering thrust and tremors all over the ship. Think about poor kerbals \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*also I could show you the figures and graphs some other time\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Well, I guess I\u0027ve just explained this too.
