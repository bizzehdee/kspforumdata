Hooligan, has any math been done to ensure that the balloons are a realistic size? By my calculations, on EARTH, you\u0027d need a spherical hydrogen balloon 44 meters in diameter to lift 50 metric tons at sea level. That balloon would have to expand to a diameter of 60 meters to lift 50 metric tons at 10 km, and it would need to expand to nearly 100 meters in diameter to lift 50 metric tons at 30 km. (Using helium, you need a balloon just slightly bigger than those numbers.) That is on Earth. The atmospheric pressure drops off much more quickly on Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) The balloons shouldn\u0027t work on Jool, if we\u0027re pretending that Jool is actually a gas giant. Gas giants have atmospheres composed mostly of hydrogen, with the remainder made up of mostly helium. So your balloons would sink (not even able to lift the weight of the gas bag) or, at best, be roughly neutrally buoyant on Jool. They shouldn\u0027t provide any real lift. That said, a \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Ehot air\u003C/span\u003E balloon would of course work on Jool, but you then have to actually provide power to keep the air warm.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUmm... that said, is there actually some way to test the air density on Jool and figure out if it is really hydrogen? It\u0027s green, so maybe, we should just throw all real world physics out the window in the case of Jool.

In KSP, any such layer on Jool would be well below the \u0022surface\u0022 of Jool. And realistically, any balloon would be destroyed long before it ever even got \u003Cem\u003Eclose\u003C/em\u003E to the metallic hydrogen layer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPressure is just half the story. You can have two different gases at the exact same pressure that have completely different densities- the helium inside a helium balloon is at almost the exact same pressure (slightly higher, in fact) than the surrounding air, and yet the density is MUCH lower. The amount of lift you get with a balloon is simply the weight of the air displaced minus the weight of the balloon. Internally, a balloon is at a pressure slightly higher than the pressure surrounding it- otherwise, it wouldn\u0027t put the gas bag in tension and hold its shape. But as an approximation, you can say that the two pressures are the same. Anyway, pressure and temperature determines the density of a specific gas. So if the external environment was hydrogen, and your balloon was filled with hydrogen, and they are both at the same temperature and pressure, then you get zero lift no matter what layer of the atmosphere you are in. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore density info and such for all planets is available on the KSP wiki.

The densities that are derived for the planets in KSP significantly exceed the densest known substances in real life (at least, at standard temperatures and pressures). However, the rockets we build in KSP are the densities of real-life rockets. So according to the wiki, Kerbals make rockets out of materials that are fundamentally different than those that comprise the physical universe of KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is important to realize that the wiki only derives the density of the planetary bodies in KSP based off of their gravitational field. It\u0027s not possible to break off a piece of the planet, apply a known force, and see how much it accelerates. So the densities of the planets as given in the wiki are determined in a very indirect way that assumes that gravitational constant of the KSP universe is the exact same as our universe, and these densities imply that the Kerbals construct their rockets out of some material that is probably unphysical to their reality. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA far more elegant and realistic explanation is that the gravitational constant simply has a different, larger value in the KSP universe than in our universe. As far as we know, the gravitational constant of our own universe was set somewhat arbitrarily, and it is easy to imagine universes where the gravitational constant has a different value. Anyway, with this explanation, the density of the planets in KSP is unknown, but at least Kerbals now construct rockets out of materials that they could actually exist in their version of reality.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I guess my point is that the densities the wiki gives for the planets are probably wrong, as they are using a poor set of assumptions, and are actually simply a measure of gravity and NOT density.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill working on graphics improvements for underwater.

The probes will jettison all fuel tanks (in other words, they will drop anything that has variable mass) before they begin their descents. The full list of components on each probe is just the probe core, four parachutes, two RTGs, a gravity sensor, a pressure sensor, a temperature sensor, and an accellerometer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, if I remember correctly (I will be checking this shortly), the drag model used in KSP has drag proportional to velocity squared. Once the probes reach terminal velocity, I will measure the descent rate, the atmospheric pressure, the temperature, and the acceleration due to gravity. Combining all this information, and comparing it to information collected from Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere, I can apply ideal gas assumptions and determine some of the properties of Jool\u0027s atmosphere- such as, the molar mass (relative to the atmosphere of Kerbin, at least). I should be able to tell definitively whether or not a hydrogen or helium balloon should truly float in the atmosphere of Jool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will probably also drop a couple of probes in on Laythe, and if I can find a way to use a Duna gravitational assist to get out to Jool, I\u0027ll drop a probe or two there too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENope.

Airships can barely float on Duna, but the tiniest envelope can lift a skyscraper on Jool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat would be the correct behavior if the atmosphere of Jool is made out of a gas significantly heavier than hydrogen or helium.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, let\u0027s say that it turns out that Jool\u0027s atmosphere REALLY IS made out of light gases, or, in some future patch, they make it so. Obviously, what you do is up to you, but as someone who favors realism over gameplay, I would not want to use a balloon in the atmosphere of Jool unless it was a hot air balloon. I do not believe that it would be a good idea for you to suddenly make it so that your balloons did not work in Jool\u0027s atmosphere either. I believe a better route would be to make a hot air balloon model, so that people who are anal about realism, like me, could use balloons on Jool with a clear conscience.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-23T20:23:38Z\u0022 title=\u002208/23/2013 08:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 23, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by |Velocity|\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bigred2989","CreatedById":3056,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-23T20:32:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnyone else see this at the top of the page when they open this thread?:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWarning: Illegal string offset \u0027link\u0027 in [path]/includes/class_bbcode.php on line 2777\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWarning: Illegal string offset \u0027link\u0027 in [path]/includes/class_bbcode.php on line 2791\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWarning: Illegal string offset \u0027link\u0027 in [path]/includes/class_bbcode.php on line 2777\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWarning: Illegal string offset \u0027link\u0027 in [path]/includes/class_bbcode.php on line 2791\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWarning: Illegal string offset \u0027link\u0027 in [path]/includes/class_bbcode.php on line 2777\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWarning: Illegal string offset \u0027link\u0027 in [path]/includes/class_bbcode.php on line 2791\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWarning: Illegal string offset \u0027link\u0027 in [path]/includes/class_bbcode.php on line 2777\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWarning: Illegal string offset \u0027link\u0027 in [path]/includes/class_bbcode.php on line 2791\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWarning: Illegal string offset \u0027link\u0027 in [path]/includes/class_bbcode.php on line 2777\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWarning: Illegal string offset \u0027link\u0027 in [path]/includes/class_bbcode.php on line 2791\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWarning: Illegal string offset \u0027link\u0027 in [path]/includes/class_bbcode.php on line 2777\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWarning: Illegal string offset \u0027link\u0027 in [path]/includes/class_bbcode.php on line 2791\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWarning: Illegal string offset \u0027link\u0027 in [path]/includes/class_bbcode.php on line 2777\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWarning: Illegal string offset \u0027link\u0027 in [path]/includes/class_bbcode.php on line 2791\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWarning: Illegal string offset \u0027link\u0027 in [path]/includes/class_bbcode.php on line 2777\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWarning: Illegal string offset \u0027link\u0027 in [path]/includes/class_bbcode.php on line 2791\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWarning: Illegal string offset \u0027link\u0027 in [path]/includes/class_bbcode.php on line 2777\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWarning: Illegal string offset \u0027link\u0027 in [path]/includes/class_bbcode.php on line 2791\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s only this thread.
