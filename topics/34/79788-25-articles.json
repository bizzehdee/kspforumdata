LAN describes the location of the ascending node compared to the fixed starfield, and since KSC is on the equator you should launch when the ascending or descending node is directly over KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo change the position of the ascending node when already in orbit (to precess the orbit), one way is to thrust normal to the orbit at the point 90 degrees past the ascending or descending node. This is most obvious (and correct) in a circular polar orbit -- thrusting out of plane at the poles won\u0027t make your orbit any less polar, but it will change the point at which you cross the equator. Be aware that this is NOT an efficient or even really correct maneuver otherwise, and it will change both your inclination and argument of periapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBetter for a circular orbit is to thrust at one of the two points at which your current and desired orbits cross. Better for an elliptical orbit is to scrub the mission and try again (seriously, don\u0027t look at the math for this one if you value your sanity). Your best bet for large changes is a bi-elliptic transfer, but figuring out where to start it can be fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELAN for orbits around Earth is almost always called RAAN (Right Ascension of the Ascending Node) for astronomical reasons (and to understand why you need other fun terms like \u0022obliquity of the ecliptic\u0022).
