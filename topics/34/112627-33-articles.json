ETT alone doesn\u0027t affect FPS, but only when YongeTech is in GameData folder too. I discovered this when I was trying to determine which addon slows down my game so much. I removed all the addons from Gamedata folder, and then added them back, one by one.

Otherwise, playing with only \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E as ground station could be next to impossible. Playing game without additional ground stations is pretty much next to impossible. You need to unlock several tech nodes that is only feasible if you go in space early and you can\u0027t do that without early low tech relay antenna.\n\nNext, SEP-MT3 Surface MAgnetometer (comes with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E, I belive) is useless without SEP Central Station Transmission that is available only in one tech node higher. Both should be available at same time.\n\nCX-4181 kOS CPU comes in more expencive \u00224 Bit Computers\u0022 node while being heavier and with less HDD capacity than CompoMax Radial Tubeless kOS CPU. It should be other way around. You still lack several other nodes for using CompoMax on very small probes very early on, it should be more inline with advanced probes capable more than just general stabilization. CX-4181 is more apropriate for early in game usage where you need to fight with much more weight, dragier parts and limited storage space for advanced scripts.  \n\nStill can be usefull early on to establish first primitive communication network if HG-5 antenna is also available earlier. Later on, that part becomes quickly obsolete.\n\nB9 Procedural Wings/control surfaces. It make no sense to have in separate nodes control surfaces and main wing element. If it is consideration science cost of those parts for being unlocked, more apropriate node is \u0022Aerospace Composites\u0022. Cost to unlock both is just slightly higher, but without need to unlock other nodes that would give parts you never need to use.\n\nB9 Aerospace mod also have Mk1 parts that are all over the different places, for examople MK1b Fuselage (2m) comes along with MK2 parts. Still need to go deeper in game to suggest what nodes would be more apropriate for B9 parts. Those parts have big advantage ove stock parts for being able to switch resources, meshes, textures quickly, without re-ataching parts on craft, but should not be way too far in tech tree compared to similar stock parts.\n\nI hope that I will be able to play KSP more to get much better impression and also being able to give bettter opinion on other stuff. Hope that you don\u0027t mind some criticism on ETT and give yourself time when comes to moding."},{"CreatedByName":"bartekkru99","CreatedById":76625,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-13T18:28:45Z","Content":"Hello, can I make a request to integrate a new mod into the ETT?"}]}
