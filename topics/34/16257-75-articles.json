So far, I have been able to put satellites as far as Duna without game-breaking issues. Everything is working surprisingly fine for a \u0022playtest\u0022-version.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only two issues I have encoutered are the following:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(1) After completing a scheduled burn with the flight computer, the throttle gets stuck at 100%. It does not go back to 0%.

Instead, clicking on \u0022node\u0022 results in the ship being pointed prograde.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBesides these two issues, the main problem I see is mostly concering the flight computer: Right now, it is very tedious to complete a node execution.

Without a flight computer, hand-flying via a delay is impossible. This feature was never very realistic anyway. Calculating in how many seconds a maneuver should happen was burdensome, especially as KSP does not provide proper thrust data until an engine actually starts. Asking a craft to execute a maneuver at a specific time, as opposed to after a specific delay, would be more realistic but difficult to implement given KSP\u0027s limitations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith those features gone, RemoteTechLIGHT would keep RemoteTech\u0027s concept of connected/disconnected craft (the antenna system) and could be released without major recoding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the meantime (since the current flight computer makes it almost impossible to execute complicated burns far away from a command center), does anyone know how to turn up the signal speed / speed of light?
