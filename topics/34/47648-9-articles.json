I can\u0027t figure out how to.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, make sure you have Module Manager installed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, make sure the plugin is installed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are not using RealFuel mod, things are rather simple:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E1. To ignite you may need certain resources. Normally you don\u0027t need to worry about it because either they are same as main propellants (to emulate hypergolic fuel) or they are carried with the engine itself already.\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E2. Some big engines like Mainsail or some KW/NP\u0027s heavy engines need external ignitor (you can check in part information panel to see if the ignitor type is \u0022External\u0022). The external ignitor is now integrated into the launch clamp. You just need to install the clamp as close as possible (or surface-attach if possible) to that engine. Such engine obviously can only be ignited when launched from pad and cannot be restarted.\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E3. Most engines (except those very small ones) need some acceleration to make fuel stably flow into pipes and pumps before they are to be ignited. You can use various ways to achieve that: RCS thrusters, small solid boosters, small auxiliary liquid engines that don\u0027t simulate ullage (as they are supposed to be pressure-fed) ...\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E4. Rocket\u0027s acceleration and rotate rates will affect fuel stability. e.g. Don\u0027t roll the rocket fast before a burn. Don\u0027t either roll it too fast during a burn (thrust can generate some acceleration which can compensate the centrifugal effect by the roll rate a bit), or you might get an ignition failure / a flame-out. \u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are using RealFuel, things might become a bit complicated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou might find that some engines requires LiquidFuel\u002BOxidizer as ignitor resources (by mouse hovering on the engine in VAB/SPH) while using MMH\u002BN2O4, LiquidFuel\u002BLiquidOxygen or LiquidH2\u002BLiquidOxygen as propellants. You need to add some small volume for LiquidFuel\u002BOxidizer using MFS\u0027 customize fuel tank capability to make it work.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-03T08:55:49Z\u0022 title=\u002201/03/2014 08:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 3, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by HoneyFox\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"J_Davis","CreatedById":10198,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-03T09:37:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022HoneyFox\u0022 data-cite=\u0022HoneyFox\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou need to add some small volume for LiquidFuel\u002BOxidizer using MFS\u0027 customize fuel tank capability to make it work.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe more daring can change the configurations for ignition to use realfuels.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HoneyFox","CreatedById":19237,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-03T09:57:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022J_Davis\u0022 data-cite=\u0022J_Davis\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe more daring can change the configurations for ignition to use realfuels.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s right.
