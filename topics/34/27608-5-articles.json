Maybe I misunderstood wing sweep / aspect ratio in FAR. This plane (entirely PWings) worked really well. It had much different wing sweep angle and lower mass - around 4.5 tons : \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/600/screenshot1bp.png/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img600/2598/screenshot1bp.th.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot1bp.th.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-04T23:02:05Z\u0022 title=\u002206/04/2013 11:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 4, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by localSol\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UAL002","CreatedById":57127,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-02T21:08:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs there a way that you could add another key function to control the thickness of the wing?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"White Owl","CreatedById":10849,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-02T22:13:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E0.4:\u003Cp\u003E-Added B9 aerospace wing, asset by Bac9.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESay what!?
