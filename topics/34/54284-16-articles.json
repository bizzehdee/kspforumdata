In the past a few people have, on occasion, commented on the fact that it\u0027s (comparitively) easy to launch the pad itself and get things running. Yes, getting things self sufficient is hard, shipping up the smelter, parts factory etc, but the pad itself is fairly light weight, and the new one is even fairly small packed. Is it realistic for a small ship to send a construction facility that can build ANYTHING in KSP?\u003Cp\u003EWell, leaving aside how to limit such small, portable construction facilities, I think a larger, base-like system could be the way to go. However, how to ship something up to another planet when you\u0027re trying to make it seem like a base rather than a ship component. Making it too heavy to mount on a ship stops it from being used... mostly. There\u0027ll always be people who can strap enough boosters on to make ANYTHING fly, but you know what I mean. This of course means you can\u0027t lift the base. So, the old tactic of taking a base and splitting it into dockable sections. Send them up separately and dock them after landing on a planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOK, docking on planetary surface. I tried doing this a very long time ago, using sideways docking ports and either landing legs or undercarraige to lift a rover up so the ports would mate. I gave up on this approach, instead trying Damned robotics (this was before Infernal robotics came out)... anyway, more recently I saw that Brotoro had done something similar to my old method, but he\u0027d got it to work by having vertical docking ports instead of horizontal ones. Thus since then I\u0027ve been redoing my old method with upgrades and had quite a bit of success. No KAS required.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, plan is a central base \u0027hub\u0027 with extendable support legs to stop it tipping sideways (see why in a moment). This hub has four arms spread out between the legs, and on the end of each arm is the equivalent of a senior docking port facing down. This hub (and all the parts docking to it) should be heavy, probably larger than an orange fuel tank. This makes it quite a challenge to design a rocket to take it off planet, but not insurmountable. The hub has docking ports and the launch pad itself, but none of the support gear. Docking to this are four modules. Two of these are just storage containers (one for liquids, one for solids), and the other two are processing centers (again, one for liquids and one for solids). Since even the modules will be heavy (perhaps not so heavy for the two storage units when they are empty of materials) even they will need quite a bit to haul it up into space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe modules have standard wheels but I think they\u0027d have to be welded on to the model to make sure the height is right. Similarly they also have undercarraige wheels welded on. These lift the module up when it\u0027s in position to dock. A bumper in the hub stops the module when it\u0027s at the right distance in so as long as the drive in is lined up right it should dock fine. The port should be sturdy enough to hold the module completely so it can retract it\u0027s undercarraige after docking. On my ships using the vertical dock technique I\u0027ve noticed that when the ship loads physics if there is any difference between the ground heights between different parts that are docked together, the wheels bounce them. Most of the time this isn\u0027t an issue, but if the modules hang from the central hub it won\u0027t be an issue at all. This is why it needs the long support legs. If you dock one module on one side it would throw the center of mass off and tip it over. With the legs this long the center of mass would still be inside the stability square of the legs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOK, now I\u0027ve bored you with tons of words, try pictures! OK, it\u0027s just a rough scribble and I know the different types of module will look different in the end, but it gives you an idea of what I\u0027m thinking of:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.clayspaces.com/videogames/Construction\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.clayspaces.com/videogames/Construction Hub.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone think this is a viable possibility for ELP? If so the current models (or replacements) would be slow, underpowered parts for mobile factories/processors. The heavy stuff would do things better for a central hub/base. I\u0027m not sure how you could restrict such mobile devices to make a significant difference between the two types of construction equipment without making it really annoying to use the mobile stuff. Maybe limit them to certain Techlevels? Maybe only nodes two or three below what you\u0027ve currently researched?

It was a way to have a segmented base you assemble later, but keep it simple. The total base would have five parts, plus extras like solar panels or kethane mining rigs. But each part would be large and heavy, the whole base being too much to lift in one go. Thus, as a base, you could have things more efficient or other advantages. I just like the idea of a facility being better than a mobile launchpad. It just seemed silly to be to have a (relatively) small part on a ship that can build anything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we can do a different mechanism, say invert the docking arms so they are down low with ports pointing up for rovers to drive over then dock, you could have a flat central pad that was low to the ground with some hefty equipment alongside it maybe. What would be tricky would be leaving both access ways on and off for rovers to drive away, but at the same time leaving ports on the side where the rest of the base attaches to. I\u0027ve tried to do something similar with the existing launchpad2, putting a base underneath it (and unfortunately making it\u0027s inbuilt engines useless as they are thrusting against the base) then extending superstructure sideways from that base, through the two holes in the unfolded base, and putting the docking connectors on those.

It was a way to have a segmented base you assemble later, but keep it simple. The total base would have five parts, plus extras like solar panels or kethane mining rigs. But each part would be large and heavy, the whole base being too much to lift in one go. Thus, as a base, you could have things more efficient or other advantages. I just like the idea of a facility being better than a mobile launchpad. It just seemed silly to be to have a (relatively) small part on a ship that can build anything.\u003Cp\u003EIf we can do a different mechanism, say invert the docking arms so they are down low with ports pointing up for rovers to drive over then dock, you could have a flat central pad that was low to the ground with some hefty equipment alongside it maybe.

But I do know that RSS allows you to adjust the size of the VAB, so I assume you have some kind of access to the VAB scenery. That means you could make a snapshot of the current area (the launch base, surrounding terrain etc) and use that as VAB instead. Pressing build on the launchpad would bring you to the VAB with altered scenery allowing you to build and position to your hearts content. Upon pressing launch you reset the VAB scenery to the default and spawn the craft on the EPL pad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdmittedly, this is probably a LOT of work.
