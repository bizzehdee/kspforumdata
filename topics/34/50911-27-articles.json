Maybe it can use some heuristics based on the masses of the specific parts and the vessel to decide that. In my case I referred to previously in my PM I have this tiny rocket develop serious orbital drift, which causes a 500km change in Pe height within minutes if amplified by an encounter. This happens on its own without doing any rotations or similar, but only if decoupler reinforcing is enabled. It also seems that the more links I eliminate by a mass cutoff, the more stable it is; I think that at the very least it shouldn\u0027t create any links to parts that are already excluded from changing attachJoint because of too small mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/Y2IUL\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

What this means is that the era of rockets \u0027dancing\u0027 on top of their engines is coming (finally) to an end.

We\u0027re not eliminating the wobble altogether, as that would actually be removing a lot of what makes failures fun. We\u0027re aiming to have better control over it, so we can have wobbly bits where we want them to wobble, and more rigid connections where things are supposed to be firmly attached.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/content/250-The-0-24-Update-Goals-Post\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/content/250-The-0-24-Update-Goals-Post\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat say you ferram how will this affect this mod and will it still be necessary to prevent wet spaghetti rockets?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ferram4","CreatedById":21328,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-04T22:17:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI know no more than you do.
