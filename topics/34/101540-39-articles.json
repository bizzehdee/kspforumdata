Simplest way on my 1,2 install to reproduce this is:  \n\n1. Place probobobodyne  \n\n2. Place modular girder segment on top  \n\n3. Make the girder 200% size  \n\n4. Clone the girder. The cloned one has attachment nodes misplaced like in the screenshot: [http://imgur.com/a/Jc5Tw](http://imgur.com/a/Jc5Tw)  \n\nThis also happens if you clone subassembly which contains scaled part. At first it\u0027s positioned properly.

Which mod is it? You have grown quite a collection by now :-)\n\u003E \n\nTurned out that the mod already had it.\n\nSo, I decided to take a quick dive into the code, and came up with the following for some documentation:\n\n    Tweakscale Documentation\n    \n    Table of Contents\n    \n    1. TWEAKSCALEEXPONENTS\n    2. SCALETYPE\n    3. Modules\n    4. Field Definitions\n\n    ==================================================\n    \n    1.  TWEAKSCALEEXPONENTS\n    \n    TWEAKSCALEEXPONENTS is used to define how much each value will be increased at each\n    increase in the scale.  The standard values are defined in the file ScaleExponents.cfg\n    The TWEAKSCALEEXPONENTS section looks like the following:\n    \n        TWEAKSCALEEXPONENTS\n        {\n            name = Part\n            breakingForce = 2\n            breakingTorque = 2\n            buoyancy = 3\n            explosionPotential = 3\n            mass = 3\n            CrewCapacity = 2\n        \n            Resources\n            {\n                !amount = 3\n                !maxAmount = 3\n                -ignore = ModuleFuelTanks\n            }\n        \n            attachNodes\n            {\n                breakingForce = 2\n                breakingTorque = 2\n            }\n        }\n    \n    The name references the section name, in the above it\u0027s referencing a part, but any\n    module can be specified.  The lines reference the same fields in the parts files.\n    \n    If the TWEAKSCALEEXPONENTS is inside a TweakScale node, then the name isn\u0027t needed\n    \n    If a field begins with an Exclamation Point (!), then the value is used for \n    relative scaling.  If it doesn\u0027t, then it is an absolute scale (needs more explanation)\n    the \u0022-ignore\u0022 means to ignore that module, not do any scaling of it (???)\n    \n    ==================================================\n    \n    2.  SCALETYPE\n    \n    SCALETYPE is used to define a group of standard values which can be referenced \n    in a module definition with a \u0022type\u0022 value.  A typical example looks like\n    this:\n    \n        SCALETYPE\n        {\n            defaultScale = \n            freeScale = (true/false)\n            suffix = \n            scaleFactors = \n            scaleNames =  \n            minScale =\n            maxScale = \n        \n            incrementSlide = \n            TWEAKSCALEEXPONEdNTS { mass = 2 }\n        }\n    \n    ==================================================\n    \n    3. Modules\n    \n    Tweakscale needs a module added to the part.  The module will look like, and need, \n    the following:\n    \n        MODULE\n        {\n            name = TweakScale\n            type = (scaletype)\n            defaultScale = \n            freeScale = (true/false)\n            suffix = \n            scaleFactors = \n            scaleNames =  \n            minScale =\n            maxScale = \n        \n            incrementSlide = \n            incrementLarge =\n            incrementSmall = \n            TWEAKSCALEEXPONENTS { mass = 2 }\n        }\n    \n    All of these values (except for the name and type) can appear in a SCALETYPE entry.\n\n    So, rather than having to specify all the parameters for each entry, you can define\n     a global SCALETYPE, and simply reference that scaletype as follows, using ModuleManager \n    syntax to insert the module into the part.  Note that any field in the SCALETYPE can be\n    overridden when defining the module;  the SCALETYPE defines the base values which can\n    then be replaced on a per-part basis as needed:\n    \n        SCALETYPE\n        {\n            name = stack\n            freeScale = true\n            defaultScale = 1.25\n            suffix = m\n            scaleFactors   = 0.1,  0.3,   0.625, 1.25,  2.5,  3.75, 5.0, 7.5, 10, 20\n            incrementSlide = 0.01, 0.025, 0.025, 0.025, 0.05, 0.05, 0.1, 0.1, 0.2\n        }\n        @PART[nuclearEngineLANTR] // LANTERN Engine\n        {\n            %MODULE[TweakScale]\n            {\n                type = stack\n            }\n        }\n\n    ==================================================\n    \n    4. Field Definitions\n    \n    The individual fields are:\n        name = TweakScale         Module name\n        type =                    References a defined SCALETYPE\n        defaultScale =            The default scale, i.e. the number by which to divide \n                                  tweakScale and currentScale to get the relative size \n                                  difference from when the part is used without TweakScale.\n        freeScale = (true/false)  Whether the part should be freely scalable or limited to \n                                  destination list of allowed values.\n        suffix =                  Suffix to the scale\n        scaleFactors =            The scale exponentValue array. If freeScale is false, the \n                                  part may only be one of these scales.\n        scaleNodes =              The node scale array. If node scales are defined the nodes \n                                  will be resized to these values.\n        scaleNames =              The names of each scale\n        minScale =                depreciated, the minimum scale for the part\n        maxScale =                depreciated, the maximum scale for the part\n    \n        incrementSlide =          Increment to be used at each level (????)\n        incrementLarge =          depreciated, not used\n        incrementSmall =          depreciated, not used\n\nFeel free to add it to the mod documentation"},{"CreatedByName":"Benji13","CreatedById":162932,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-19T20:19:42Z","Content":"Can anyone please help me with a config for my mod that would allow the part to be scaled from 3.75m (or whatever kerbodyne is) to 5m, 7m, 10m, and 20m?

First and foremost, scaling would be optional and support would need to be done by the authors of the part mods (today most patches are supported by me).
