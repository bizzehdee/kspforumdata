Removing RPM fixes the issue.  Also the Kerbal heads are removed from the lower right corner.\n\nI have read a few pages back and it seems this may be related to the transparency stuff but i cant match it to anything.  I can post logs if it would help but didnt want to take up the space if it was not needed and someone knew what the issue was.  \n\nThis is 1:v0.25.1.28297b installed via CKAN.  \n\nThanks.\n\nUpdate 1:\n\nHere are the logs that I also posted on GitHub issue [513](https://github.com/Mihara/RasterPropMonitor/issues/513?_pjax=%23js-repo-pjax-container).\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/sh/dxd9vmxko5jbe12/AAD4a-hKeDj47MhXZpif6FE3a?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/dxd9vmxko5jbe12/AAD4a-hKeDj47MhXZpif6FE3a?dl=0)\n\nUpdate 2:\n\nAfter searching there does seem to be several references to JSITransparentPod and JSIAdvTransparentPod.  And from the github issue conversation it seems those are not compatible with each other.  Unfortunately I do not know hoe to tell which mod is referencing JSITransparentPod.\n\nUpdate 3:\n\nThanks to MOARdV for helping with this through Github.  The issue is that Mk3 Hypersonic Systems when installed through CKAN is installing several outdated versions of mods nested inside its directory.  Including an outdated version of RPM.  cleaned that up and good to go.  \n\nThanks again all for your time and dedication to making this community amazing.  Your work is very much appreciated.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-26T20:42:38Z\u0022 title=\u002204/26/2016 08:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 26, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by terminalmonky**\n  \nConflict Found"},{"CreatedByName":"flatbear","CreatedById":143398,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-28T03:51:16Z","Content":"the monitors arent appearing for me in 1.1 anymore.  they used to work.

When [@blowfish](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/119688-blowfish/) took the lead on updating B9 to 5.3, I pitched in with some help with the RPM bits (as RPM updates at the time broke some of the graphical alignment). There was one issue I didn\u0027t resolve in KSP 1.0.5: the first two pages of the resource screens were supposed to show stage information with progress bars, but no longer did. It\u0027s still an issue that I\u0027m trying to fix. This was functional in B9 as of KSP 0.92, but stopped functioning afterward. Here are three images. The first is from KSP 1.0.5, running B9 6.0.1. The second is running a dev version of B9 for KSP 1.1 (similar issue, but appears different). The last is from B9 in KSP 0.92 (yes, I still have it) which shows what the intended functionality is. The third screen (on the right) shows total resources, and it is functional in all three.

These days, you have to use variables prefixed with SYSR\\_ (see [here](https://github.com/Mihara/RasterPropMonitor/wiki/Defined-variables#resources)) - but it\u0027d be something like SYSR\\_LIQUIDFUELSTAGEMAX.\n\nEDIT: Oh, and you can use [actual bar graphs](https://github.com/Mihara/RasterPropMonitor/wiki/Background-handlers#jsigraphingbackground) instead of text emulation of bargraphs if you really want to fancy up the page.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-28T18:08:24Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2016 06:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by MOARdV**"},{"CreatedByName":"danfarnsy","CreatedById":67183,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-28T18:13:51Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 9 minutes ago, MOARdV said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Short answer:\n\u003E \n\nThank you kindly.
