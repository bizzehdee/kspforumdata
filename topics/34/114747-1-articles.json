Some stock parts which don\u0027t \u0022fit\u0022 well with the nasa-theme are removed (the stayputnik, for example) and almost all of the dependent mod parts are renamed, re-arranged on the tech tree, or modified in some other way. Rockets tanks are grouped by name for easy reference. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E ships are also included for the major crew pods. Adds custom flags. Also, a placeholder IVA is added to crewed parts which currently lack one (the \u0022hitchhiker storage\u0022 IVA is used as the placeholder). Boosters and Capsules are named using original, but related, names to their nasa counterparts.\n\nRequires:  \n[Additional Progression Contracts](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/144401-additional-progression-contracts-10-72316/)\n\n[ModuleManager](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55219-1-0-5-Module-Manager-2-6-13-%28November-9th%29-With-more-SHA-and-less-bug-%28Upgrade-!!%29)  \n  \n[TRAILS Plus](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/150759-12x-trails-plus-gemini-alike-2-kerbal-parts-pack-2-dec-2016-1215/)\n\n[Contract Configurator](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/91625-12x-contract-configurator-v1222-2016-12-16/)\n\nOptional:  \n[Kerbal Planetary base System](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/133606-130-kerbal-planetary-base-systems-v143-1-june-2017/)  \n\n**This mod uses a modulemanager patch to handle parts - it doesn\u0027t delete or modify any of your existing files.**\n\nIncompatible: Any mods that contain extra parts. Sorry.\n\nCredits : This mod contains, with permission, parts developed (forked or were abandoned) by Beale, Ledenko, CobaltWolf, and SnowWhite, all under Creative Commons. A few were unfinished beta parts which I completed myself. Also includes some icons from [Community Tech Tree](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/90530-130-community-tech-tree-june-2nd-13-update/)\n\n**This mod uses modulemanager patches to handle parts - it doesn\u0027t automatically delete or modify any of your existing files.What you get:**   \n\nA bunch of new parts, which combined with the dependency parts allow you to construct NASA vehicles and launchers including **Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, Orion, CST-100, STS, Explorer1, Ranger, Redstone, Atlas, Titan II, Titan III, Saturn I, Saturn V, Ares I, SLS**  \n\nA generous amount of new contracts, based around specific program missions.  \n\nCompletely new tech tree, redesigned from scratch.  \n\nPruning parts out of the dependent mods that don\u0027t \u0022fit\u0022 with the overall theme of the NASA space program.  \n\nHeavy editing of parts in the dependent mods to fit in the modified progression tree, and for balance purposes.  \n\nCraft files for most major systems, including subassembly parts for boosters.\n\n**Installation Instructions:**   \n\nUnzip the contents of \u0022gamedata\u0022 into your \u0022gamedata\u0022 like most other mods.  \n\nIf you wish, copy the craft files from the ships and subassemblies folders into your save.\n\n**Gameplay Tips:**   \n\nTurn on advanced tweakables, and use autostrut for some of the larger boosters! The Saturn/Sarnus boosters in particular will wobble like wet spaghetti without this!  \n\nTry not to \u0022get ahead\u0022 of the objectives you get contracts for. (Wait to do an orbital EVA until you get the contract for it in the Castores program) Not required, but it makes the game more interesting.  \n  \n**Known Issues:**   \n\nA few of the included booster .craft are *slightly* overpowered, which is almost unavoidable in a KSP mod of this sort.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-06-03T16:22:57Z\u0022 title=\u002206/03/2017 04:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJune 3, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by tjsnh**"},{"CreatedByName":"minepagan","CreatedById":132643,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T11:13:39Z","Content":"Nice Job!\n\nAlthough I noticed on Kerbal Stuff this has the same description as the Soviet conversion.....SHAME......but you might want to update it a bit.

This is a longer term project as doing the conversions from \u0022real world orbital data\u0022 to \u0022KSP orbital data\u0022 is a time consuming manual process. There should be no reason you can\u0027t install the MissionController2 pack right now, but I don\u0027t plan to add it as a dependency.\n\nI can\u0027t speak to how other mods will interact that play with the tech tree or inject other parts. I\u0027ve intentionally tried to keep the two \u0022total conversion\u0022 mods as lightweight as possible.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-01T14:06:04Z\u0022 title=\u002207/01/2015 02:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by tjsnh**"},{"CreatedByName":"clivman","CreatedById":139191,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T14:30:49Z","Content":"Stayputnik should stay in US early sattelites were very similar"},{"CreatedByName":"tjsnh","CreatedById":108021,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T14:53:07Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Stayputnik should stay in US early sattelites were very similar\n\nThere is a different probe core available early in the tech tree that doesn\u0027t look quite so much like Sputnik 1."},{"CreatedByName":"ManuxKerb","CreatedById":139441,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T07:37:11Z","Content":"Wow great effor here, this could play well with [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/123453-1-0-4-Contract-Pack-Historic-Missions-V1-2-7-01-07-2015](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/123453-1-0-4-Contract-Pack-Historic-Missions-V1-2-7-01-07-2015) Maybe you should collobarate ?
