Electric Charge/Megajoules conversion works both ways. First Megajoule systems from this mod create is automatically converted into 1000 EC. So smallest nuclear reactor/generator combo is way more than enough to power ANY ship using stock parts. Or build some orbital power plants with microvave transmitters, and then put microwave receiver on your ship - you will get plenty of EC from it. I stopped covering my kethane miners with solar panels because of it - receiver provides more than enough power to run conversion and mining at full swing simultaneously.

The amount of delta-v required to slow down when you arrive at a different planet depends massively on the alignment of the planets when you make the trip. If you travel to the other side of the system, i.e. you fly past the sun on the way there, expect to need 15km/s of delta-v to slow down at a minimum. On the other hand, you can easily go to Duna or Eve for less than 1km/s if you time it properly. I\u0027m convinced that you can do it for less than this if you really spend a lot of time warping at just the right moments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can minimise the cost by making the journey when the planets are at their closest positions.

Electric Charge/Megajoules conversion works both ways. First Megajoule systems from this mod create is automatically converted into 1000 EC. So smallest nuclear reactor/generator combo is way more than enough to power ANY ship using stock parts. Or build some orbital power plants with microvave transmitters, and then put microwave receiver on your ship - you will get plenty of EC from it. I stopped covering my kethane miners with solar panels because of it - receiver provides more than enough power to run conversion and mining at full swing simultaneously.

For example, if you are at Kerbin, you are moving really rather quickly in orbit of the sun. If you move out to the orbit of Jool, say, the acceleration you experience due to the Sun\u0027s gravity is vastly diminished which means that Jool doesn\u0027t need to move as quickly as Kerbin in its orbit. If you arrive at Jool with your Kerbin orbital speed, you\u0027ll just fly straight out of the solar system because at that position, you have more than enough velocity to escape the other system. On the other hand, if you head towards the sun from Kerbin, your Kerbin orbital velocity won\u0027t be enough to keep you in orbit at that altitude and you\u0027ll find yourself with in an elliptical orbit with the far side dropping closer to the star.
