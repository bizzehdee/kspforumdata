Then would you move your .cfgs to a plugindata folder inside your mod. The reason I ask is I believe the fact that the files are quite likely to have changes made, and because they are just inside a regular folder in the GameData folder each time a user plays it will trigger MM to not load the cache due to file changes. So if they are in a plugindata folder inside your folder they won\u0027t be  read at least letting MM load the cache file and save time loading the game.
