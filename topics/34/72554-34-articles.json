Is it possible to investigate what will break/why if i delete redundant parts? I really like the idea of this mod, because it adds more options/creativity without adding too much options. In addition, it will also help collapse the part list, so that it is more manageable. Also, is it possible to have the available options for the tweakable parameters depend on whats unlocked in the tech tree?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Master Tao","CreatedById":110410,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-17T20:47:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022arkie87\u0022 data-cite=\u0022arkie87\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIs it possible to make tweakscale work in two dimensions (diameter and aspect ratio) for fuel tanks, thereby, requiring only one part?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf TS works the way I think it does (I haven\u0027t actually looked at the code), no, but Biotronic could explain it better than I could.

I realize stretching it in two dimensions separately will causing texture problems. Maybe it would be best if the part is merely a placeholder for the other stock parts i.e. you select which part you want in tweakable, and the part becomes the corresponding stock part?
