This would negate some or all of the lift of the wing, pushing it down while trying to tilt the plane back. If the control surface has enough deflection, this could even generate a stall.

Your weight is around 10kN per ton, so your lift should counteract this. Once you pitch your plane, some of your trust will go to vertical speed as well. Your lift is proportional to CL, atmospheric density, wing area and the square of the speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing is, in KSP wings have no lift at 0 AoA , so to take off the runway, you should somehow change the wings angle. In addition, you will use some of the engine for vertical climb. So either put your gear so that your plane is a bit nose up, or make sure your control surfaces can pitch it enough.

I also think the propeller thrust being under the CoM helped the nose come up and I should instead takeoff on jet power alone at first rather than move the gear too far back to make it harder to lift off. I could also angle the canard wings down a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe test was flown with only the main fuselage/nose cone and engine fuselage/nose cones filled with fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/yS1rT\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

Is there any good rule of thumb? Like the CoM ball resting fully on the forward axis indicator of the CoL? Currently where it is you can see the axis sticking out, and I\u0027m thinking of moving the CoM forward just enough to cover it up\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
