In most configurations that people use (symmetric antennas) they\u0027d only increase the range marginally. The real effect would be increasing the \u0027angular range\u0027, or, the area of the sky that the antenna covers. (Search google for \u0027antenna radiation pattern\u0027 for examples) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven the best omni-directional antennas have signal strength variation depending on the orientation of the antenna. For example, the ISS omni-directional antennas only cover the front 180 degrees of the sky (in the velocity vector direction) or so. The omnidirectional antennas suffer from a much lower data rate for the same power input, since you can\u0027t focus the signal power into the direction of the receiver. In normal ISS operation the omni-directional antennas are used only as a backup to the much more powerful horn and dish antennas, since the omni has only 1/6th the data rate of the horn antenna, and about 10,000 times lower data rate than the dish (24kbps vs 300Mbps).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s one thing that I wish was simulated with RemoteTech, it\u0027d be nifty to have your antenna choice affect how long it takes to transmit science data. It would be a function of distance transmitted relative to the max distance the antenna can transmit. Essentially, the further you are, the less power arrives at its destination, the harder it is to distinguish between 1s and 0s in the signal, so the slower you have to transmit data to get readable data on the other end.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGranted, a fair amount of this is off-topic for Realism Overhaul, but I find it interesting!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"walkinator","CreatedById":98493,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-23T00:25:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RedAV8R\u0022 data-cite=\u0022RedAV8R\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E@walkinator:\u003C/strong\u003E If you posted anything that resembled a proper bug report we might be able to help you.
