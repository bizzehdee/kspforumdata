Instead of the current auto upgrade in the VAB once tech is unlocked or useing science to upgrade inflight stuff what if you made the high tier versions require an \u0022Upgrade Parts\u0022 resource and define a price per unit for the resorce. As an example reactors would by default not have any of the upgrade parts filled in the VAB but it would have storage for the correct amount to do the upgrade. If you want a basic version of the reactor you just launch as is. IF you want the upgraded version you just tweek in the \u0022Upgrade parts\u0022 resource, which increases the cost of the vessel appropriately just like tweaking in/out fuel from a tank. Once out on the pad if you have the tech and full parts you just select the upgrade option and your reactor is the upgraded version. This would have the benifit of alowing both high and low tier versions of the reactor (an oft requested feature) and alow for the low tier parts have a more reasonable price instead of the price for the high tier. For upgradeing in flight parts just add a copy of one of the resorce containers for the upgrade parts so the player can ship out the parts.
