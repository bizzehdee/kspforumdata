Voskhod 2. Although I had not launched, nor even constructed, a two-man vehicle, I received notification that I had completed the contract. Notification mentioned that I received the payout (funds, science, rep). I checked the Active Contracts, and it was still listed. Eventually I constructed and launched my Voskhod 2 vessel, and I completed the contract. it is now listed in the Mission Archive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Luna 2. Had same problem \u003Cstrong\u003Eghost22\u003C/strong\u003E. The command pod vehicle was under my control; it was the active vessel. I did not get completed contract when crashing the vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. (is this yours?) Launch Company Satellite Into Orbit. I had not built nor launched a satellite vessel. I had accepted the contract. I received notification and payout for putting it into orbit. yet, it is still listed in my Active contracts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESidebar: Given the new stuff with KSP 0.25, the scanners deserve an update as well. I currently creating animated scanners (orbital, lander). Their operation will be via a partial MissionControllerEC class, so you can incorporate if you so choose. For instance, there will be class properties which indicate if the scanner is deployed or not. The rest of your class can check deployment status to determine if scan can be executed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@\u003Cstrong\u003Eghost22\u003C/strong\u003E: if you complete a contract, but you still don\u0027t get credit, then use ALT-F12. I do, without guilt.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPretty sure number 1 has nothing to do with Mission Controller.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. I have never noticed this in all my testing, are you sure you didn\u0027t confuse any old message? The reason I ask is because the message system is completely 100% Kerbal Space Program, and is not of my own creation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Yes, I will indeed investigate this issue more. Not sure why this did not pop up in testing though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Sounds like the same issue as 2? That should not ever happen, the very first goal is a Launch goal, and their is no way that\u0027s possible without actually launching your vessel. Again possible it was an older message?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne last thing to everyone that might have issues, like most other mods I do not support 64 bit Kerbal Space Program with mission controller. 64 bit is completely unstable and will cause strange issues with mods and the game itself. Just a warning. And its been posted on front page since 24.2. But I will update how to post bugs on front page and what I need to help me squash them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Apollo13","CreatedById":74572,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-14T04:16:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOrbital Scanner concept art:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rEeo5bl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022rEeo5bl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Peo6hZW.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Peo6hZW.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe box is attached as a surface mount to the vessel.

The problem of course is that people are so use to doing multiple contracts at once with different vessels sometimes (think you have a vessel on way to duna with duna contract) can cause problems. So I have to think of a way around all this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor instance you grab 3 contracts. One is go to duna.. Other is test a part. Last is satellite contract. The last 2 your going to use the same vessel, but your waiting on a launch window for duna, so the contract is sitting and waiting. You don\u0027t want your satellite vessel to be flagged to the duna contract. So I have to find a way around this. Of course this will only work for MC contracts and won\u0027t effect others.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA lot of times I have same ideas as you suggested. But I play a certain way, I only grab contracts I\u0027m using right away and for 1 vessel. But other players don\u0027t do this they grab all the contracts they can and just pound them out. Which is why I think people are having issues with the Crash Contract. I played it very simple and it always works. But I have to figure out what they are doing to break it. LOL.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo show you what I mean when I wrote the Agena Contracts I experimented with this exact way of doing contracts, and it caused all kinds of problems like I mentioned. People selecting 10 contracts and doing them in order or whatever. Not realizing that AGENA would record the next vessel as its vessel. Its tough to work around the different ways people play KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-14T12:30:34Z\u0022 title=\u002210/14/2014 12:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 14, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by malkuth\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"malkuth","CreatedById":57414,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-14T12:04:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Apollo13\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Apollo13\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOrbital Scanner concept art:\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rEeo5bl.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/rEeo5bl.jpg\u003C/a\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Peo6hZW.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/Peo6hZW.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe box is attached as a surface mount to the vessel.
