After digging around in the persistent save and finding the contract I found the cause - It needs to be the universal storage version of the gravity scan, not the stock one. If it is difficult to add a clause allowing any gravity scan part to be used, perhaps changing the descriptions to make it more clear? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, otherwise all is working fine.
