I thought, that it would be very nice if I could add the missing experiments to the craft while I am here. This also was the moment I installed KAS, because in some way it was what I wanted. I was able to upgrade my craft with new small parts while in flight. The problem was, that I had to bring the parts to my craft with a supply mission from kerbin. I wanted to be able to create the experiments in flight and so the mod was born.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MarcAFK","CreatedById":142340,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T10:02:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ACCount\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ACCount\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIs there part disassembly in this mod?

I\u0027ve had your mod installed for about a week or so, and have put OSE Orbital Workshops onto two of my orbital stations. During preparation for a rescue/contract mission where I would need to install batteries on a base, I realized I forgot a wrench! Silly me, I\u0027ll have to send up a supply rocket, but wait! I have a 3d printer on my Munar Station, I thought. The only problem was that, on arriving and docking, the Workshop didn\u0027t work properly. I have the workshop attached with Universal Docking Ports to the station core, and there is storage everywhere. When I hit Queue on the Wrench, it goes through to 100, drains rocket parts and electrical charge, but the wrench is nowhere to be found. Inspecting all accessible KIS inventories on the ship (not including empty crew), there were no wrenches. In exasperation I made about 8 wrenches and some batteries. My rocket parts and EC were gone, but I got no parts :\\\u003Cp\u003EWhen I decided to reload the game to see if that could fix things, it properly made the wrench, but the workshop became bugged at 100.5/100 and is now constantly draining EC. I am really confused, I guess it worked now but the situation is not all that better. If you need any logs I can get those.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Upon crashing and looking at the log, in this case it spewed\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[ERR 02:24:08.720] [KIS] AddItem error : No free slot available for Wrench\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[ERR 02:24:08.721] [OSE] - OseModuleWorkshop_OnUpdate - Object reference not set to an instance of an object\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Euntil it crashed.
