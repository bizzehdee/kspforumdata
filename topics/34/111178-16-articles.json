I\u0027m in the Apollo era and am just finishing the Apollo 8 contract, though I had the same exact problem with the Apollo 4 contract.  If you use the FASA Apollo parts, the docking probe on the Apollo CSM attaches to the \u0022Apollo Command Module Forward Heat Shield\u0022 which is jettisoned prior to splashdown so that the parachutes are exposed.  The problem is all the Apollo contracts have a requirement of having a docking port.  As soon as you jettison that forward heat shield, you lose the docking port which means you\u0027re missing one requirement to complete the contract.  This can be fixed by adding \u0022disableOnStateChange = true\u0022 to the DockingPort portion of each Apollo contract.\n\nOn a side note, this is the first time I\u0027ve ever played with the historical missions contract pack and I have to say I\u0027ve really enjoyed it.
