It is simple, but more importantly, it fits into the game unlike many other mods that try to shoehorn the human universe in. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpecific feedback:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would be in the camp that would see kerbals die from lack of snacks. I mean maybe I watch Danny\u0027s vids too much but death and kerbals seem to go hand in hand.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would like to see a snack container added to the base mod and here is why. Sure, I agree with the reasoning behind restricting storage to habs and pods. However, and don\u0027t take this personally, I don\u0027t like the idea of a mod that requires other mods simply because the author does not agree with certain play styles. I mean its your mod, but I can see where some folks might be put off by that attitude. Like I said though, I happen to agree with your view point, mostly. I would also say that containers are needed in the base mod for resupply missions. Again, I see your point about the habs being like the resupply tubs that visit the ISS. That being said, kerbal-kind would have no such concept and thus would, in my opinion, probably rather just strap a rocket to a box of snacks and hope it makes it to the station. Its more, Kerbally, to me at least. My last point on containers being in the base mod is that, if I were a modder and could do this stuff, I\u0027d want to give a really good basic all purpose toolkit to the folks downloading my mod without having to direct them to other folks to get things they might want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like the idea of a snack generator, to a point. My only concern with using surface samples for this would be orbital installations around bodies other than Kerbin. Resupply of these would not be possible for the most part if you need samples to make snacks. Though, to tie into my previous point, lightweight snack boxes would make resupply of these far flung bases easier. This leads me to my final critique...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile a one resource system is nice for simplicity\u0027s sake, a two part system if done properly would not be too overly complex I don\u0027t think. I feel that I can tie all of my points together with a second resource, being snack ingredients. Snack ingredients would be stored in snack containers. The density of the snack containers would be more space efficient than snacks stored in habs and pods. However, the snack ingredients have to be made into snacks before they can be consumed. For simplicity, you could simply have the oven for the snacks and the container for the ingredients be one unit. Or, you could have an oven part separate. This could also be tied into the surface sample idea you had by giving snacks made from samples a higher yield than that of snack ingredients or some other mechanic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo to sum up, adding a second resource that can be converted into snacks that is only stored in containers would, I feel, satisfy pretty much all requests and suggestions I have read in this thread thus far, and keep it just about as simple as it already is. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPseudo Edit: Just as I was about to hit \u0022post\u0022, I thought of something. You want to use surface samples to make snacks in the lab right? How about use the aforementioned container idea I just laid out as synthetic samples or \u0022Kerbin Samples\u0022. This would be a really elegant solution to the whole problem and only require one extra part, that being the sample pod. This plays directly into your idea while giving a few more options for players and sticking well into the overall idea of the mod. It might even be worth exploring the idea of using a \u0022sample\u0022 resource specifically for your oven anyway. Just add the menu button to the EVA GUI to collect a snack sample instead of using the science sample thingy already in-game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
