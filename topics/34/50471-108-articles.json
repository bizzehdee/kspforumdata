At least for now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have been looking at how kerbal does it default atmospheric properties and the way RSS does it. The basic model that default KSP does is the barometric/hpsometric equation. The problem with this approach is that it assumes that the temperature is uniform throught the atmosphere which is not the case. Now the behavior of temperature with altitude is not well understood so no true model exist for that which explains why you use pressure tables. Well their is the Schuster-Schwarzschild equation that might work. Because the barometric function assumes a uniform temperature this means that the Lapse rate is zero. Now their is a version of the barometric function that does take into consideration of the changing in temperature by using a nonzero Lapse rate.

At first I will calculate the pressure by hand and stuff it into a pressure curve table but if it works out I like to ask you if we do the calculation in the RSS mod itself. I will study the temperature change as I increase altitude in the game to create the proper pressure table. I assume you can get the current temperature at any altitude. Is that true?
