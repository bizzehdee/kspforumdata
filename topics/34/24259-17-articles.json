But you have to remember the other big factor in real-world ISP: exhaust velocity. NERVA had insanely high exhaust velocity, and it it obtained that high exhaust velocity due to a really, really high energy flux to heat and expand the working fluid to those high velocities. Without something like VASIMIR (which hasn\u0027t even reached scales of the Timberwind NERVA tests), the only way to get those high exhaust velocities at the same mass flow rates to give good thrust is to use a nuclear thermal core.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo .... anyway, just read Kommitz\u0027s plan for the next update and I can\u0027t wait.
