Have a treat!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main thing I\u0027d like to see is [orbital period] - [time to AP], and ditto for PE. I usually circularize my orbit by pointing at prograde and watching time to AP, increasing my Y pitch to increase time to AP and throttling down to decrease time to AP. By balancing on or very near my AP, I can circularize without fussing with a node and in a single burn. The only problem is that when I pass AP, I have to do a lot of rapid subtraction to figure out how far ahead I am. I\u0027d like to see a negative value for that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d really like to throw time to AP into your BAR function and get a nice indicator to balance around a zero point.
