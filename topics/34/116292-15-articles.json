Each engine has a config that someone took the time to write. Make sure the engine you\u0027re using is actually supported.

In ksp with realplume installed, the exhaust flames are massive when in space, looking at the second stage in this video, around 3:30, the flames barely escape the nozzle with a light haze around it. is it possible to scale the size of the flames back down after having them scale up in the higher atmosphere?"},{"CreatedByName":"mreadshaw","CreatedById":135349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-10T23:59:09Z","Content":"Is it possible to make the smoke slightly transparent?
