Which uses more memory. Using a MM config, alters the part that\u0027s already there, and doesn\u0027t have to create another, which saves on memory for those of us hitting the memory wall."},{"CreatedByName":"hazens1","CreatedById":129789,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T13:44:50Z","Content":"\u003E With MM, do you just have to add that file to the GameData folder and have MM installed? How is this better than how the mod is currently? (I am new to modding)\n\nYou should check the thread and documentation for MM. There is a lot of modding you can do that does not permanently change existing game data as well as adding modified parts without duplicating game assets.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E *Using a MM config, alters the part that\u0027s already there*, and doesn\u0027t have to create another, which saves on memory for those of us hitting the memory wall.\n\nWhile you can use MM to temporarily alter existing parts. The \u0022*\u002BPART*\u0022 (plus) command makes a copy of the part data in the game\u0027s part database leaving the original unchanged. The new part of course as you stated uses the same texture, model and sound assets of the original saving memory.\n\nThe end result is the same except using MM of course saves memory and if a value you are not changing gets modified in a future version of the game or textures/models/sound, your copied part stays up to date except for the values you are modifying of course :-D\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-08T13:48:46Z\u0022 title=\u002205/08/2015 01:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by hazens1**"},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T13:54:11Z","Content":"Aww, they\u0027re so adorable :\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"hazens1","CreatedById":129789,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T14:01:14Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Sorry for such a noob question but is \u0022@rescaleFactor = 0.5\u0022 the main bit of the code that determines the size of the part then?\n\u003E I\u0027ve never modded anything myself but would like to make a smaller size jet engine, is there a tutorial somewhere that says what the main lines of the part config file do?\n\nHere is a good place to look for part documentation :-D\n\n[http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/CFG_File_Documentation](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/CFG_File_Documentation)"},{"CreatedByName":"FishInferno","CreatedById":106219,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T14:16:16Z","Content":"Ok, I am in school right now so when I get home I can change it to a MM patch"},{"CreatedByName":"FishInferno","CreatedById":106219,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T11:23:51Z","Content":"I tried adding Hazens cfg file to the GameData folder to test out MM, but eve with MM installed it does not add the new part.
