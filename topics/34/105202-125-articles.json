In 1.1 I\u0027m pretty sure this could be covered by one Nom 5000 greenhouse, but clearly not under 1.2 - the changes Dstaal mentions are clearly worth noting here.\n\nThe changes do kinda make sense of course, I could definitely not grow enough food to keep me alive on a daily basis in a space smaller than my car.\n\n**edit 2:** So it looks like the Nom 25k producing 2.38 supplies/hour (14.28/six-hour day) will do the trick for your 2-kerbal MPL recycled station - this coming at a cost of 1.148t and 1.32/s electricities; or four Nom 5ks, at a cost of half a ton, and 1.04ec/s will produce 11.52 supplies/six hour day.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-17T19:13:08Z\u0022 title=\u002210/17/2016 07:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 17, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by MiniMatt**"}]}
