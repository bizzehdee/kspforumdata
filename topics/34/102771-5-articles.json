Distance was less than 50k. One thing pointing against this sigma/rescale is that I also can\u0027t get the flashometer to work on asteroids, where I usually just have the flashometer \u0027trailing\u0027 the impactor by slowing it down relative to the target once the impactor has been released. Again, distance was well under 500k, and the flashometer right behind the impact.\n\nThe thing about multiple craft having the same name IS interesting - nothing shares the name of the impactors or probes, but I do have other craft with identical names in flight. I\u0027ll try fixing this to see if that makes a difference."},{"CreatedByName":"Gordon Dry","CreatedById":163177,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-23T17:54:19Z","Content":"How can I make the mod stop spamming the log with \u0022Trying to generate an impact contract\u0022 in early career?"},{"CreatedByName":"tomf","CreatedById":57809,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-23T17:59:12Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 3 minutes ago, Gordon Dry said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E How can I make the mod stop spamming the log with \u0022Trying to generate an impact contract\u0022 in early career?\n\u003E \n\nUm download the source, comment out that line and recompile it? ![:rolleyes:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif \u0022:rolleyes:\u0022) Ok, new version coming."},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-25T19:38:56Z","Content":"I should have read how this mod works in the first place.
