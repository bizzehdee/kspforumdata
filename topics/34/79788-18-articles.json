Shortly after you launched Elloo Explorer 13, one of our engineers, Dimble Kerman, realized he had dropped the keys to his wife\u0027s rocket scooter in an access panel to a part we repaired for you. Now he needs the keys back before his wife discovers that he borrowed her scooter without asking. We believe it is in a Toroidal Aerospike engine on one of the pieces of debris from the flight. We are greatly concerned for our coworker\u0027s ability to go out to the next fireworks show, so in return we began to wonder how to solve this issue. After careful consideration we were stumped and decided to ask someone else. That\u0027s where you come in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. About the time you entered orbit of Duna with Red Rover, we discovered an unusual weight discrepancy in the telemetry results for the most recent staging. It turns out our janitor, Pantoro Kerbin had accidentally switched a stack of paper wrappings with his Master\u0027s thesis on rocket explosions in low gravity environments. Fortunately for Pantoro, the dean of his college was injured in a rocket-assisted para-gliding accident, and was given 4 extra years to get his paper ready. Unfortunately, the section used to line the Rockomax Jumbo-64 Fuel Tank, seemed to contain vital research information that cannot be replicated. We were initially unsure if it was worth the effort, but Pantoro has reassured us that the data included some nice pictures, not just confusing numbers. With the distance to Duna we thought this undertaking should be refereed to experts, and in the absence of that we chose to just call you. So, this puts it in your hands.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JeffreyCor","CreatedById":93167,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-14T03:53:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Arsonide\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Arsonide\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E I advise you to check the tracking station before accepting a rover mission to see where the agency is sending you.\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know if I\u0027m missing something but I have found no way of doing this.

What I have done is put limitations on my missions so that only a few can spawn at once. Beyond that I have little control over how the system chooses what it chooses. This is part of RNG.

However, I think the location parameters should be tweaked. I got a contract to build a space station on Duna\u0027s orbit, but the required orbit is beyond Ike\u0027s orbit. So, while building a space station on Duna is something I\u0027d do, I don\u0027t think it\u0027s worth it to build it in an orbit where vessels in the Duna system have to expend a lot of delta-v to arrive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also think contracts should have bigger rewards. I got a rover contract on Kerbin which pays something like 25,000 credits - but to fulfill it I need to deliver a rover either through a long and boring flight on a big cargo plane which might or might not have the fuel to get back to the KSC, or take a suborbital hop on a rocket (which would definitely won\u0027t be recovered at KSC).

I don\u0027t think your standard landing gears will work in this situation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAerial missions suffer an interesting problem balance wise, in that they are too hard for players lower on the tech tree, and too easy for players higher in the tech tree. I have to balance them carefully, and I will continue to look at this. Right now the main problem, I think, is that their difficulty is based solely on the prestige level of the mission, whereas it should also take into account what level engines you have. Keep in mind also, that these don\u0027t just spawn on Kerbin. They spawn on any planet with an atmosphere, and not all planets with atmospheres allow air breathing engines. That is why there is no requirement to use jet engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was initially an issue in older versions with waypoints bunching up near the poles, but this is no longer an issue. If you are getting a lot of contracts at the poles, it is because agencies want you to visit the poles. (RNG) Similarly, regarding your Duna station, I don\u0027t necessarily think it\u0027s a good thing to limit agency requests to \u0022realistic\u0022 constraints, because A: we do not know their needs, B: they are kerbals, and C: gameplay wise, if we constrain to realistic reusable situations, there will be less situations to choose from, and the game will get less replayable. The whole intention of Fine Print is to make KSP more replayable. You say there\u0027s a lot of delta V required to get to this orbit, to me that sounds like a challenge, and an interesting gameplay situation for you. Remember, these are stations you are building for the agency, not for yourself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI enjoy that the RNG occasionally throws oddball requests at you, because people have been playing KSP for years, and I like the idea that I might be able to confuse or challenge them with a request. This is a very intentional design decision on my part, to not constrain the output of missions too much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIndeed I am planning EVA contracts to easter eggs. New easter eggs that procedurally spawn in dynamic locations, as you can see in my signature. However, right now, I am trying to smooth out the satellite orbits.
