I\u0027m betting that\u0027s why you\u0027re seeing heating and it\u0027s probably by design as FAR is supposed to be a more realistic aerodynamic model. Believe it or not, in real life, you wouldn\u0027t see 100% occlusion on those parts either. Hot gasses would be slipping up the sides and scorching them. Even hitting the sides of the capsule, though heating would not be as severe because the shockwave expands and cools once it slips past the blunt end but even the sides have to be shielded to some extent.

A 1m thick wing and a 1mm wing will both give the same lift. It will affect drag/ area rule so it does usually help that to thin the wing.
