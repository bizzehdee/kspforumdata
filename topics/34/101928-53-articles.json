It should be Extraplanetary Launchpads, but I can\u0027t be 100% sure because I use a few different mods that might have introduced this option: while a Kerman is EVA, he/she gets an option in the right-click menu to \u0022Scrap\u0022 a part. This does explode the part to convert it into (I think) \u0022scrap metal\u0022 or maybe \u0022spare parts\u0022; but if you\u0027re dealing with parachutes, the explosion should just be cosmetic and not actually destructive to the rest of your vessel. Personally, I\u0027ve used it to \u0022clean up\u0022 my orbital space station--after assembly, I have a bunch of little bits like strut ends that I don\u0027t want sullying my pretty station, or fuel tanks that I emptied once I connected a new piece of the station. Rather than jettisoning such tanks to simply drift as debris (which clutters up my space as well as my computer memory), I just \u0022Scrap\u0022 them.\n\u003E Anyway, I suggest you head over to look at Extraplanetary Launchpads to see if it will give you the solution you want.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The Scrap function is part of MKS not EPL.\n\nThanks, both!
