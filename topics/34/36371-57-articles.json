Problem is, the sensors all have the same maxTemp as the probe core, which survived, as well as the fairings which have a slightly higher maxTemp. Chutes have a significantly lower maxTemp and were the first to burn up. If both the probe core and fairings survived, I doubt they burned up from heat transfer, which would imply they weren\u0027t being shielded from the heat. FAR also makes things worse because reentering doesn\u0027t slow you down nearly as much as with the stock atmospheric modeling. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know how exactly DR calculates reentry heat, but if it\u0027s purely based off of speed at a particular altitude, not slowing down nearly as fast makes for explosions everywhere regardless of how shallow or steep your reentry, even on suborbital flights. I actually launched a rocket straight up until it was barely in space, let it fall back down to Kerbin, and it still burned up (which is not realistic at all.)

So hole should be a smallest circle that can hold cargo. More wobbly instead of less? Well, one more Kerbal killed on duty. As long as it only happens for weird cargo, well, it happens.
