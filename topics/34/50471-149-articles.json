If you haven\u0027t changed EVE\u0027s settings (which are set up for the default Kerbol system, so Eve gets purple clouds, and Jool gets green ones) then...you\u0027ll still get those clouds. I thought you were talking about *surface* textures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I said EVE Overhaul works with RSS, I meant the clouds are at the appropriate height more or less, etc; not that the mod will somehow detect that RSS is installed and change what clouds it applies.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I am wanting to know is if there is a way for me to modify the settings in the EVE config. files so that this effect goes away? The only reason I ask is that I used EVE 7-3 with the very first RSS, RO version posted after 0.24 and this effect wasn\u0027t present so I figured there might be a way to make it work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI actually Figured out how to fix this more or less. Go to KSP\\GameData\\BoulderCo\\Clouds and find the cloudLayers.cfg file then edit out all the configs for Jool, Laythe, and Eve which will unfortunately get rid of clouds on those bodies but it does look better in my opinion. You can also change the colors of the clouds to white, or other things but don\u0027t ask me how, by changing what the r, g, and b equals to. 1 makes it white just like Kerbin.
