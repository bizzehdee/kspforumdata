My MiG-23 knockoff has large full span flaps on a high aspect ratio wing, much like the real aircraft, however If I deflect the flaps more than 15 degrees or so they inevitably stall, even when the plane itself is at low AoA. Many real-life planes deflect their flaps to much higher angles relative to the wing. Are these planes flying with their flap surfaces stalled, or am I experiencing some artifact of how FAR handles them?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, do you think we could have an option to adjust the upper and lower deflection limits for control surfaces separately?

So in the spirit of curiosity, I tried it again. Same thing, except this time the panel vanished into Krakenland. Third time around, it didn\u0027t shoot the view, but instead went into an endless loop of the GUI error. As usual I ask: Is this KIS\u0027s problem or something with the voxels again? Additionally every new panel I place down, following the NRE, is also \u0027stowed\u0027 and unable to be deployed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have no luck. I\u0027m constantly breaking the game.

B9 Procedural wings are broken on my craft too. Trick that I mentioned by attaching deataching wings only partly works. I loaded craft builded with FAR 15.1 that was worked fine and with latest dev build that i just downloaded have the same bug. Attaching/deataching wing forces new voxelization, it looks much better than from loaded craft, but still one side of wing have more voxel points than other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m using StockBug fixes from Claw, those are also messing with symetry, so it can be cause of that behaviour, although stock wings works just fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECraft file is \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/1o9b71lr7du37q9/Space_Plane_Mk2_B9PW_V100.zip?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eavailable here\u003C/a\u003E if needed.
