For the little extra push, I put a 1.25m decoupler with a SpaceY S109 under each corner tank (strutted criss-cross). When I staged, the falling boosters looked quite odd with a 3.75 m disk on a 1.8m stick. I have TweakableEverything, so I can disable the bottom cap, but maybe there should only be one on top?

Panels at both ends is nicer when you\u0027re building larger interplanetary ships, but at that point, you\u0027re mostly using them to help reduce part count rather than get around a lack of adapters. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen again, having it look weird like that is mostly a problem when mismatching in a direction that\u0027s not done as frequently, and while staging like that. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe one idea is to remove the lower panels from the larger-diameter parts but leave them on the smaller?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I don\u0027t know.

But that was also my thinking, is that it makes it consistent. At least for now, it let me create these with the existing textures, but I can also re-design them with a completely different look using the same colors. My original thought was something more cylindrical or like a set of raised rims inside the outer rim. I may still go back to something like that, but this was a quick and easy hack that didn\u0027t require a new texture, with most of the effort just in getting the scale and positioning right.

The color-coded cap on the KS-25x4 also sticks up a little just so that it\u0027s visible above the engine\u0027s surface.
