What I generally do (for rockets) is to put 4 sets of two fins on in the following setup (built from the top down, assuming two atmospheric stages):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the second atmospheric stage put 4 smaller fins in two pairs forming a cross when viewed from below (as if you were using 4x symmetry, but put them on using 2x twice so you can change them separately in FAR) located as close to the CoM as you can while still keeping the CoL behind the CoM. If you have a reasonable taper to this stage (including everything above it) this shouldn\u0027t be too difficult to achieve placing them pretty much right on the CoM - not necessarily at the \u0022rear\u0022 of the stage as a whole - and choose your fin size appropriately to get this positioning correctly. Now setup the left/right pair in FAR to be Pitch only, with AoA limited to about 3-4 degrees less than their stall angle. Do the same with the other pair, but set them to be Yaw/Roll only.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow attach the bottom atmospheric stage (not including any clamps/etc.), and repeat the process above, usually using larger sized fins. In this case you want to make sure that your CoL is well behind the CoM but still not all the way at the rear. My personal preference, launching without gimbals activated on the bottom atmospheric stage, is to try to get the final CoL about halfway between the CoM and the CoT. Exact position depends on the individual rocket and your personal control preferences. Again, make sure that the left/right pair is pitch only, and the top/bottom pair are yaw/roll both, with max AoA again a few degrees less than the stall angle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow when you actually go to launch, you may find that you still have a bit too much \u0022control authority\u0022 - if the rocket tends to waggle a lot under control input, or jerk around, then you need to go back to assembly and turn down the max deflection angles a bit. Personally I tweak the FAR dynamic control settings instead, so that I have the possibility of maximum controls if they are needed, and just use a \u0022light touch\u0022 on the keys, but it can be easier to setup if you just limit the control surfaces themselves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf this doesn\u0027t make sense, I\u0027ll try to get a few pics up showing the CoL/CoM indicators, but you can look at the first pics I posted above of my comsat launcher on the pad to see the general position of the fins themselves for that particular rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Pics included now\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i44.tinypic.com/r2m8bc.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022r2m8bc.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpper Atmospheric Stage\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i44.tinypic.com/kdok5y.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022kdok5y.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBase Atmospheric Stage\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote the use of two separate stretchy tanks in the base stage - this is just to make positioning the fins easier using the \u0022Vertical Snap\u0022 function in the Editor Extensions plugin, so the two pairs end up symmetrically located still in respect to each other.
