The problem? The capsule is the one-kerb cockpit part, with only one possible attachment point (which is now currently \u0022blocked\u0022 by the rest of the lander body). With this mod, I can select a docking port as the root, which not only makes the entire ship eligible for saving as a subassembly, but also makes it possible to attach to other vessels in the VAB/SPH, instead of forcing me to launch and dock the sucker separately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-HAzw1maxnzE/UoMfAYxswEI/AAAAAAAAXgE/vbVFNvJ1NxE/s800/screenshot38.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot38.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a docking port on the belly of the fuselage that is the root part -thanks to this mod- which means I can import it and attach it readily to any other vessel before launch. When it was initially built, this would have been impossible because the \u0022Root part attachment points are blocked\u0022. Before this mod, the only option I would have had available would be to re-build it starting with the docking port. Ever try to get another body part\u0027s longitudinal side to stick to a docking port (instead of vice-versa, or on the end)? Good luck with that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, my point is that, as long as the game places restrictions on building by disallowing use of a STOCK feature (subassemblies) based simply on whether the root part has an open attachment point, it\u0027s absolutely a great idea to open the creative floodgates even further to new players by including this functionality as a potential stock feature as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, to address the purism (cheating) aspect that was introduced to the thread: how is it at all possible to discuss what is or isn\u0027t \u0022allowed\u0022, in a game that is still in alpha?? Subassemblies used to be considered \u0022unclean\u0022 because they were only possible via mod. Then along comes an update that includes the functionality in stock. Whoops. Same for some of the additional parts that were previously only available by installing C7\u0027s pack. Now many of them are part of the vanilla install. Uh oh. Then came the tweakables that addressed the need to edit the ship files manually (a filthy CHEAT) to launch with landing gear closed or shielded docking ports opened. Arguing about what should or shouldn\u0027t be in a game that\u0027s still under heavy and active development is nothing but self-defeating, since popular mod-based features are inevitably going to be added into the vanilla game at some point one anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(I can\u0027t wait to read the threads that will be spawned if SQUAD decides to include MechJeb into the game.
