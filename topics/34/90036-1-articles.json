I\u0027m also increasingly becoming against \u0027kit\u0027 part mods (i.e. mods which can pretty much only be used to build one specific spacecraft) as I feel it limits the broad scope of\u00A0creativity which KSP is all about.

The pod undocks from this bracket and gets flown down by the Lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Full dis-assembly, the whole ring gets slowly split (undocked) into single modules, which then get ferried down. Downside of this is that the ship is kind-of only able to do a one-way-trip. With the above idea, one could use the ship to fly some cargo (hab-modules, etc) to a planet or moon, land the pods and return for another go. With half the ship missing, the rest would probably not have the structural integrity to not break apart once the thrusters fire.

Just have the game treat it all as one large short cylinder in a sense. That would also help balance weight from fuel usage. The whole ring could be one part with various functions in the config. The problem with short wide craft in general is they get top heavy and end up in a nose dive, especially when thrust is coming from the same level as the bulk of the weight. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou really almost can\u0027t build the ring any other way than what was intended either, since each end between segments will have a specific angle, only allowing you to fit 12 modules in the ring. If people want more of a given resource, they could use other parts to extend its capability. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI remember when someone came out with a stargate long ago that came in a bunch of segments, but it was just too many parts to sift through and work past in my parts tree, and extra work to piece together for something that was always going to be the same final form when assembled. Having to possibly strut segments of the ring would kind of break the theme aesthetics of the ship too. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI mean the ring alone would have to be like what......24 individual parts to have to piece together? 12 modules and 12 connectors between the modules....then attaching the docking ports, then the vehicles, etc...you\u0027re looking at about 30 parts or more for the end user to assemble the craft! That\u0027s like a whole page of the parts tree, that may also have other parts in between them in the tree....making you have to flip pages of the tree just to sift through the parts you need. Plus you have to think of the future, because the more complicated a mod is, the more updating it may need in the future. That means you may have to go back and run dozens of parts through unity, or reconfig them, etc....multiple times, otherwise the mod dies. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d say a ring with resources and functions, docking ports and engines, landers and rangers are plenty for people to play around with and add onto.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are some things you simply don\u0027t need to make modular. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI swear one day KSP is going to become soo bloated with modular-ity that it\u0027ll take 50 parts to assemble a command pod. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-14T02:59:33Z\u0022 title=\u002211/14/2014 02:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 14, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by trekkie_\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"akron","CreatedById":116554,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-14T06:48:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022benjee10\u0022 data-cite=\u0022benjee10\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E@akron:\u003C/strong\u003E I notice you\u0027ve made some lovely Interstellar flags for KSP.
