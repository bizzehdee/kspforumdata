It\u0027s a nice batch of things to do with stations other than them being mere fuel depots, and I haven\u0027t had any technical issues yet despite mixing it in with a bunch of other mods. And it\u0027s cool to see a mod that throws up contracts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, a bit of feedback on the contract thing. Every contract I\u0027ve gotten so far involving Station Science has been seriously unremunerative. Despite my rep now being over 900, all the Station Science contracts I\u0027m getting are 1-star things that only pay about 4000-5000 cash. Considering the cost of heaving the heavy station and cyclotron modules into orbit, this makes doing these contracts major losing propositions. Not that I expect to turn a profit on everything I do, and the main reward for such contracts is science, not cash, anyway. But the thing is, early in the game when these Station Science contracts start appearing, I can get the same amount of science AND turn a major profit doing part tests, and I can get more science for less money doing stock science missions. IOW, the Station Science contracts aren\u0027t economically competitive with the stock contracts or even stock science missions. This is especially the case when I\u0027m already having to set up a Remote Tech network out of my own pocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, when I 1st unlocked the Station Science docking port and started getting contracts, the 2nd one to appear was to do Plant Growth at Vall. This again was only a 1-star contract paying about $3000. Further, it had a deadline of only 2 years, which didn\u0027t exactly leave enough time to get there and return, even if that had really been possible with the very low-tech parts I had available at the time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ethernet","CreatedById":88537,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-05T13:55:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAre you playing the newest version (v1.1)?

I did 1 of them (taking a $83K loss on the launch when I only had about $200K in the bank) and have canceled all the others in hopes of getting new contracts with better payoffs. However, I\u0027m still getting only 1-star contracts that pay $5K or less.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the real issue on the payoff is that there are no contracts to launch the major station components that you need to do the experiments. Putting the massive lab and cyclotrons into orbit costs a lot of money (and is rather challenging with only 1.25m rockets, especially if you\u0027ve got FAR). But the only contracts you get are for doing the experiments. The experiment modules are light and reasonably cheap so once you have a station up there, the payoffs for the experiments themselves aren\u0027t that bad. But there\u0027s no way at present to recover the significant cost of building the infrastructure and this cost is a major deterent to doing any of the contracts, especially early in the game when money is scarce. Which is too bad because you obviously intend for Station Science to be an early-game thing, what with the low-tech docking port.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I\u0027m thinking that you need contracts to launch the big stuff, for each planet/moon in the system. These would be 3-star contracts that pay a lot of cash but little, if any, science. Then you\u0027d only get the experiment contracts for the same planet/moon once you\u0027d at least accepted the station-building contracts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ethernet","CreatedById":88537,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-06T14:15:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy thinking was you\u0027d send up multiple experiments over time, on multiple contracts as they come up again, to eventually recoup the cost of the initial investment.
