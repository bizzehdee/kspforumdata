I\u0027ve had no experience where KSPI parts are any less solid than other addon or stock parts.

So I put together the basics for an AMD propelled vessel. It has one of the largest of each aprt. The Thermal Nozzle, Antimatter reactor, antimatter fuel tank, and the regular fuel tank on top filled with LFO. 3.5m (I think thats what size it was last I checked). No struts, only the top cockpit piece of the five piece rocket to keep SAS going, and I decide to launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERickety as flying a flippy twelve inch hotdog.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing is, there are SO MANY Nodes inside the rocket itself. Plus, the points at which the parts snap together are all small and don\u0027t really aid in keepign the rocket stable. If I turned that rocket sideways on the pad and held it there with the pillar pieces (forgot what their called), it would bend and wobble. More than likely, it wouldn\u0027t break, but it\u0027d definitely bend and wobble.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI even forget to mention those extremely touchy, weak-pointed heat radiators needed to keep it running.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA lot of the parts within KSP Interstellar are weak to attach to one another and other parts, and they have small connection points. I don\u0027t know how to fix this. Ask Bac9, he definitely hass all of that down packed perfectly. I could build somethign with his parts and have absolutely no problem whatsoever. If I needed struts, it\u0027s because I decided to not use a node, and instead kept attaching a long strip of node-connected pieces on the side of the vessel. Then I\u0027d use struts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AetherGoddess","CreatedById":115971,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-06T23:45:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GrimT\u0022 data-cite=\u0022GrimT\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHmm I havent found a cfg file that I think would have caused a change, is there a specific cfg(or file) from the mod i can redownload and replace that you think would fix the issue?

I\u0027m underwhelmed by magnetic nozzles since I never really was a fan of any of the low-thrust/high efficiency options and sort of fail to see how this will be much different than using a fusion reactor with He3 to power a generator and thus plasma (except without the option to use beamed power), but I\u0027m sure it will be tweaked to be unique and I may be totally wrong and learn to love it. I am however stoked to hear about other tweaks to fusion power, what with fixing He3 (will the cryostats still auto-evaporate even when powered whenever He3 is used as fuel in a reactor?) and all.

(it\u0027s something I started arguing for back when Interstellar-Lite came out, as it didn\u0027t make sense for the Thermal Rocket Nozzles to be so expensive) I think you\u0027re missing the single most important feature about them- which is balance. With the Magnetic Nozzles, it will now be possible for the Thermal Rocket Nozzles to be realistically cheap, while still having expensive Magnetic Nozzles for the super-hot gasses that would probably melt a traditional Thermal Rocket Nozzle anyways... The creator of Interstellar-Lite, on the other hand, made the (entirely inaccurate) assumption that ALL thermal nozzles were magnetic- and thus made the nozzles unbelievably expensive- even when used for Microwave Beamed Power... (which operates at LOWER temperatures than conventional chemical rocketry, and DOESN\u0027T require magnetics in the rocket nozzle)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
