Before trying out the volumetric clouds beta, using the latest official release of this mod, the title screen was noticeably slower, but only slightly. There was also a slightly flickering cloud effect on Kerbin in the background (only on the Mun crash landing scene) which is still present in the beta. I\u0027ll see if Texture Replacer helps.
