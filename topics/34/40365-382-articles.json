Remove the reactor and generators entirely - a fission reactor doesn\u0027t supply enough power to lift its own weight with a plasma thruster, so you\u0027re only hurting yourself by having it on board.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemove the lithium, reduce the monopropellant to what you\u0027re going to need for RCS, and right-click the thruster and make sure it\u0027s running on argon or xenon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight-click each umbrella receiver to see how much power it\u0027s receiving. On the launch pad, make sure you have a receiver pointed directly at each of your ground stations. Atmosphere eats power, so most of what you have on the ground will come from the ground stations. It helps to put the receivers on Infernal Robotics hinges so you can fine-tune their angle without rotating the entire ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt sounds like you have a total of four Akula reactors across all of your ground stations. Upgraded, each of those has a maximum of 7.5 GW thermal power. Taking into account reactor power decreasing with core temperature, generator losses, and atmospheric transmission losses, you should be able to receive maybe 3 GW if you aim your receivers right, which should get you 176 kN on argon. Or about a third of that if the reactors aren\u0027t upgraded.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Darkeners","CreatedById":111508,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-22T22:14:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow to upgrade those? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI take other fuel only for testing (first try of Plasma)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have mostly Argon for that ( I saw table on trusters)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I have 8x satelites whit Akula all over the space, some on Kerbin orbit, some on other orbits (Eve x1, Jool x2), 2x Satelittes on sun orbit, but whit that other reactors, those have 2x 3,75, but i think that they doesnt work well, or at all. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn ground I have only support. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I watch plasma movies, I have feeling that they have 200kN trust at least.... my shows only 12,2 on Argon... my manouver node take 6h ; d\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ArcFurnace","CreatedById":109240,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-23T02:18:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou need to pump a LOT of power into plasma thrusters to get good thrust. Antimatter reactors are obviously more than capable of supplying such. Upgraded 3.75m fusion reactors are another good bet; my plasma-thruster based asteroid tug uses 5 of those to max out the power usage of 4 1.25m plasma thrusters, and it can take off from Kerbin under its own power using Argon propellant in drop-tanks, even with the hefty load of LiquidFuel for orbital maneuvering and Monopropellant for holding the craft straight when the asteroid starts trying to swing you around (and the substantial mass of the reactors themselves). With anything smaller and less high-tech, the power-to-weight ratio starts dropping pretty quickly, and that\u0027s what you need for high thrust-to-weight ratio with plasma thrusters, since their thrust is directly determined by the power delivered. At maximum throttle, the argon thrusters on my tug produce 2045 kN of thrust each, but that\u0027s at a power consumption of 32.9 GW* each. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternately, you can start spamming power transmitters and use microwave transmission to run your plasma thrusters, which takes away a lot of the TWR issues.
