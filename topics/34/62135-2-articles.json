In fact, at one point I believe I referred to this project as being \u0027vaporware\u0027. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy humble and very sincere apologies to Helldiver and everyone else who worked on this fantastic mod. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor everyone having trouble launching or flying this shuttle, MechJeb worked beautifully for me. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E I even reoriented the craft to the default position in the VAB because it was just too weird for me to look at, and when I launched I did a manual roll, The Resolute didn\u0027t bat an eyelash. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E This is with a MechJeb controlled ascent, you understand. I even left all the action group settings as they come from the factory. In future I\u0027ll tweak a few things for my preferences, but I assure you, she\u0027ll fly just fine straight out of the box. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, Helldiver, a few minor notes: RCSBuildAid seems to not be compatible with something in here. I don\u0027t get a CoM marker at all, the mass and TWR reading in both RCSBuildAid\u0027s panel and in MJ\u0027s Vessel Info window just show \u0027NaN\u0027 (I sure wish I could figure out what that stood for!). So I can\u0027t balance a payload in the cargo bay, vis a vis CoM, CoL, CoT, and RCS balancing, etc. At this point that\u0027s just a minor annoyance, because as I said above the shuttle flies (empty) just fine as is. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E But I thought I\u0027d mention it anyway. I suspect the problem is due to the use of some kind of non-standard module or resource or something in one of the components, like a different RCS resource or something to do with the engine gimbals, maybe. I don\u0027t know, just spitballing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, and I know this isn\u0027t a KSO problem because it\u0027s been happening ever since RasterProp went to the latest update, but none of the RP instruments or monitors work. At all. In ANY of my cockpits or command pods. Yes, I run a lot of mods with plugins, so I\u0027m sure there\u0027s a conflict somewhere, I just figured I\u0027d throw this out there to see if someone else had the same problem and has figured out a fix. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, fantastic EPIC mod, Helldiver et al.

I mean, the interior will be there, but all of the displays and instruments will be blank. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E My download didn\u0027t come with MechJeb, so not sure what you mean there. The only thing that should be required from Firespitter is the plugin itself, but I left the \u0027props\u0027 and \u0027spaces\u0027 folders in my files because the interior may need to use those. However, I think Helldiver inadvertently included Firespitter\u0027s example craft files, so you\u0027ll definitely want to delete that folder to trim memory. If you don\u0027t use SCANSat (like me), you can get rid of that folder. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, regarding ANY plugin that comes bundled with ANY mod download, all you need to do is check to make sure that you are using the latest version of the plugin, AND that you only have one copy of that plugin in your GameData folder. For instance, check the date on the Firespitter plugin that came with KSO. If that\u0027s more recent than the date on the plugin that you already have IN YOUR FIRESPITTER FOLDER, then replace it with the newer file, in the Firespitter folder. I\u0027m pretty sure the date was 1/19 on that, which made it the most recent in my case, so I updated it. But with RasterProp, the one in the KSO download was the same as I already had, so I just didn\u0027t transfer it over. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know that this can be kind of tedious, but it\u0027s the only way to avoid conflicts and problems. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of the above should be taken to mean \u0027as I understand it\u0027, so if I\u0027m wrong about anything I have no problem with someone with more knowledge than I have correcting me. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E I\u0027m basically just an interested player like you, and I don\u0027t mean to butt in or speak on Helldiver\u0027s or anyone else\u0027s behalf.
