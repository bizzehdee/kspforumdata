This is a preventative measure for 32 bit games, since this updating causes some small lag, although with 64 bit this is pretty much gone. However if you go onto the Ui, in the settings tab you can select the update planetarium tracking option and voila your orbits will update and continue updating. \n\n2. This is more serious, are you running with Rss or stock? I thought I had removed these kind of bugs before but obviously not, I will work on this today.\n\n3. Currently the mod is limited to using one fuel at a time for every vessel (selectable from the settings tab in the Ui) to Stationkeep, clunky I know but I will sort this out for the next update. Best thing to do: go to the spacecetre, select Xenon in the settings menu, then switch to your vessel and you should now be able to station keep!\n\n1.2.0 will be a fixing release to address the issues above and anymore that I can find - loads at the moment...

Still, it would be nice to have that while in flight.\n- Any debris on a sub - orbital trajectory are deleted if they get unloaded (outside of the physics range).
