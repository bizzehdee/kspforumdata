There is now \u003Cem\u003Eno\u003C/em\u003E hard-coding of any resource remaining in EL, other than KerbalHours (tbh, I forgot to tackle that before releasing), and a couple of hard-coded defaults for when certain recipes are not present.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[edit]Oh, the mass of a boarded kerbal is presently hardcoded, too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat must\u0027ve been poor communication on my part. My intent wasn\u0027t to request conformity with CRP, it was more to gain an understanding of your vision and direction for the mod so that Pathfinder can be on the same page as EL. Wouldn\u0027t want all those metal and metal ore cans to go to waste by replacing the established production chain. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-15T15:45:42Z\u0022 title=\u002208/15/2015 03:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Angel-125\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"taniwha","CreatedById":57176,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-16T04:19:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Egoldenpsp\u003C/strong\u003E, \u003Cstrong\u003EAngel-125\u003C/strong\u003E: it seems to be poor communications all round.

Probably the only item outstanding is that I wish RocketParts were a 1L resource since everyone else switched over to that model with 1.0, but that\u0027s Taniwha\u0027s call, and we\u0027d stick with however he defines RocketParts regardless.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main disagreement/bone of contention/what have you that I (personally) had with EL was the single resource-\u0026gt;rockets path. Regardless of what that resource was called. When plunked alongside UKS, it invalidated the UKS production chain (which is based on breadth not depth). So, the first choice was to just hide EL parts. This in turn caused a ton of unwanted support issues. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHence, with 1.0 I intentionally broke to separate resources so that people could use the EL chain or the UKS chain without us stomping on eachother. This is still far from ideal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGiven we now have recipes (and I need to dig into it), I\u0027m curious where this will put default EL. If it still remains MetalOre -\u0026gt; Metals -\u0026gt; Rockets, then I\u0027ll just need to override it via a lot of MM magic. the rub (and it is what it is) is that a single harvest resource model and a multi-harvest resource model are fundamentally incompatible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat being said, if EL ever moved to a multi-resource model, I\u0027d be the first to quite happily change all of my mods to follow suit. But single resource pretty much kills most of what UKS does, so until then I\u0027ll very likely swap to what I am doing with OSE, which is a lot of module manager tweaks - although I am working with that mod\u0027s author to get OSE Workshop and UKS working together straight off CRP and with no MM tweaks needed. Ideally that\u0027s where I would love to see EL land, but given it\u0027s Taniwha\u0027s baby and Taniwha\u0027s vision, I\u0027m fine with building out the middleware if need be. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESaid middleware could of course be used by other mods along the way, and would be available separately. This would help OSE and EL play nicely with or without UKS (there are some other exploit issues with RocketParts that having some revised recipes would help address).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"taniwha","CreatedById":57176,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-17T22:02:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo time for a proper response now, but I have never liked the single resource path (ie, [*]ore-\u0026gt;metal-\u0026gt;rocketparts).
