I just use the Lander for now ( too much mod...).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts kinda simple. As far as I know ,there is no way to change the center of mass in config. (if someone know please tell me!). So what I did is simple, I played with the weight of individual part until I had a \u0022decent\u0022 center of weight. Anyway I think the ranger is not heavy enough, so I raised its foward RCS weight. Note that the fuel is stored in the main body, so as the ranger burn its fuel the center of mass will slowly move foward... Not a big deal but the lift engine will never realy be under the center of weight. I think droped the ball at that point. But I know of too fix that part too, I did something similar to allow the lander to fly with heavy stuff under it. I created a mini lift engine (a moded vernier from B9 ) that I put under the nose. Then you just have to use Trottle controled avionics to balance it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Space Engineer","CreatedById":139166,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T01:23:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBenjee, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are some screenshots I have of the Lander from the movie, as you can see the cargo modules are actually much smaller and fit snugly even when the lander is landed on the ground..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/WyyHP\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/WyyHP\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-16T16:30:11Z\u0022 title=\u002204/16/2015 04:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Space Engineer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rolanvorxariat","CreatedById":117146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-17T01:25:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Space Engineer\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Space Engineer\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBenjee, \u003Cp\u003EHere are some screenshots I have of the Lander from the movie, as you can see the cargo modules are actually much smaller and fit snugly even when the lander is landed on the ground..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/WyyHP\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/WyyHP\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think That is because he made the lander too small, rather than the cargo modules too big.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DMSP","CreatedById":124853,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-17T08:14:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI downloaded the updated version.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWent to Jool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI played out Interstellar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETylo was bust, headed to Vall.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESwung around Jool, loosing fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERanger Landed, Thumbs Up!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELander brought down \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ewrong module\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPilot somehow hovers over and grabs the module, returns to Orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPrepares to dock...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Time to sleep!*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI quicksaved there.
