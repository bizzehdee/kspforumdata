First, the \u0022Lock\u0022 command doesn\u0027t seem to do much, either that or I don\u0027t understand it\u0027s functionality; is supposed to prevent the locked part from being actuated [from the IR controls] or is it supposed to lock the part as in make it rigid so external forces (gravity, bumping, collision) can\u0027t move it? I attempt to lock parts, but when I press the corresponding actuator after locking, they move normally. Also, the GUI option doesn\u0027t change to \u0022Unlock\u0022 or anything of the sort to indicate it has been locked.\u003Cp\u003ESecond, the toolbar. When in flight, the toolbar refuses to hide the IR controls when clicking. However in the VAB/SPH, it works as intended. No other toolbar-enabled mods I use have this issue. Is there any known incompatibility with other mods? I\u0027m running a lot; currently the ones that interface with Toolbar (off the top of my head) are: FAR, Targetron, RCSBuildAid, Kethane, CrewManifest and ActionGroupManager plus a bunch that don\u0027t interface with the Toolbar. They\u0027re all updated to the latest version; that\u0027s the first thing I check when something like this happens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnywho, love the mod aside from those hiccups, and can\u0027t wait for the redesign!\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELock prevents the parts from moving when accidentally clicking a movement button.
