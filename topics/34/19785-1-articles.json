The new parts protect spacecraft from the extreme conditions typical of re-entry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe two new heat shield models are the culmination of months of work that began with the development of a \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/showthread.php/13271-Re-entry-Heating-Model\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ephysics model\u003C/a\u003E to predict conditions experienced by spacecraft entering Kerbin\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s Atmosphere. Little progress was made after that however, until an agreement was reached between Mechanical Mouse Industries (MMI) and Procyon Innovations (PI) to work together on the project. MMI would provide the 3D model, while PI would provide the plugin. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen asked to comment, astronaut Jebediah Kerman remarked \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CI\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m not sure why we need this part, we never had any difficulty with re-entry before\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 He became more excited about the new heat shield, however, when he was shown the picture below:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/q4YsO.png\u0022 alt=\u0022q4YsO.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpacecraft using this new line of heat shields will be destroyed if they experience excessive g-forces or extreme temperatures during re-entry. And while the ablative shields will sustain heat loads typical of re-entry, some planning is required. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse of this heat shield requires steeper re-entries than you may be used to. Aggressive aerobraking and shallow re-entry angles will result in the heat shield burning up. Too steep a re-entry will result in excessive g-loads. The survivable re-entry corridor therefore gets narrower with higher re-entry speeds. Procyon Innovations has promised to provide a plot of the re-entry corridor vs. re-entry speed in the user manual, but no completion date has been given.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProcyon Innovations would like to acknowledge and thank the following people for their help with this project.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Dani-Sang at Mechanical Mouse Industries for his work creating the heat shield part and emissive animation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Tosh for making his FireSmoke particle emitter class library available for use by the KSP modding community.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- MrPwner for his efforts to create a transparent emissive texture.

Re-entry effects are calculated based on the atmospheric properties of the planet you are landing on. It takes a while to heat up. Think of it this way:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- You put a pot of water on a hot stove. The stove is already glowing red hot but it takes a while for the water to heat up. If you put the pot of water over a weak heat source (like a match or lighter), it won\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t heat up at all. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Just as thin atmosphere doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t slow the spacecraft very much, it also doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t heat up the spacecraft very much. Maximum heating occurs at maximum deceleration.

Great idea and thanks for the hard work, OP. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"internerd","CreatedById":39830,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-22T21:50:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell Bill Kerman survived re-entry despite the loss of one parachute.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceNavy","CreatedById":50182,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-23T00:48:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAwesome!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Egonna try this out!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JebThrillMaster","CreatedById":2434,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-23T02:07:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI just found a bug: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qOxvT.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/qOxvT.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DasPenguin85","CreatedById":16322,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-23T03:17:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEvery test, multiple installations, always gives the NaNm/s \u0026amp; black-screen bug\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"togfox","CreatedById":17083,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-23T04:29:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eblack screen as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWas something left out of the zip file?
