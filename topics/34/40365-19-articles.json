Human reactors don\u0027t run at full power constantly, they have management systems which match the power output to the demand (generator and/or thruster in this case). And flipping the things on and off manually is precisely what you wrote - instantly throttleable massive power generators - they go from 100 to 0 to 100 to 0 as I sit there flipping on/off so I don\u0027t waste anti-matter. Case in point, I took my 4 lab, 175t anti-matter ship from Kerbin to Jool (9000km orbit where the best particle density is) and it took less than 2,000AM but it was irritating to nurse it along.

How about this to bring it into line:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETransmitter - up the mass to 0.5, make it require 100 charge as surge buffer or some such BS. The transmitter isn\u0027t too much the problem and power sats are reasonably heavy as it is but 0.025 is kinda low.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReceiver - break into sizes. Tiny, small, medium, large. Mass 0.1, 0.25, 1, 3. Each size category has a limit on how much power total it can convert and differing sizes of charge/MJ storage. Tiny 20KW, no MJ. Small 150KW, no MJ. Med 500KW, no MJ. Large 1MW, 1MJ - this is scaled pretty low but then a 4kN Ion engine only needs to receive 40KW to run full power. Making 1000KW = 1MJ hurts you here badly as 1KW = 1 charge too. Change the charge to KW ratio would let you make the received amounts better. ie 50KW = 1 charge, 1MW = 1 MJ - tiny 500, 0. small 1500, 1. med 3000, 3. large 5000, 5. If you stipulated mounting on a generator to be able to get any MJ that might help too. Even with this though, 0.1 mass for 10 charge per second anywhere in the system (assuming enough power sats) is pretty awesome. But it\u0027d make small reactors useful in that 0.36t extra for masses more power (provided we find something that needs such power) would be worthwhile.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe power network would send whatever it takes to hit that limit at the receiver, so a tiny very far away would use a large portion of the network capacity but hey, you\u0027re getting your power.
