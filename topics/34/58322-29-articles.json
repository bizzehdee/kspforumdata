If your timer in KSP is flashing red... everything will be so slow that nothing works as intended.

The damage system seems to fairly consistently label the procedural parts as damaged immediately upon loading in the aircraft. This happens most but not all of the time and I wasn\u0027t really able to figure out what the conditions were. The procedural control surfaces that are also part of the Procedural Wings mod might somehow be involved. As far as I can tell it doesn\u0027t actually affect the functionality of the wings except in using the procedural control surfaces as flaps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, a suggestion I have for an improvement is expanding the action group functionality of the parts. The feature I would most like to see is the ability to toggle the \u0022Control This\u0022 of particular weapon parts using an action group rather than needing to individually click them on the craft, simply to make it easier and quicker.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the awesome work you\u0027ve done so far on the mod. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"InfiniteDice","CreatedById":57451,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-02T02:09:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHaving a peek at 0.23.5 now...
