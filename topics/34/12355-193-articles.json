Both of you definitely don\u0027t burn yourselves out on this. Believe me it sucks. I burned myself out on ArmA 2 modding and it\u0027s no fun having something you enjoy doing turn into work that you despise looking at (over 4000 hours combined between ArmA 2 and Operation Arrowhead).\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShad0wCatcher - thanks for the reality check, it is always good to take a break. To be honest I am about at the point now of going back to actually play the game. I am just a player, who sees working on mods as part of the game play - when NASA wanted to navigate to the moon they did not download a parts pack, they wrote a flight computer! I started working on parachutes because I wanted a solution to the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/61148\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ELaythe Kethane rescue challenge\u003C/a\u003E where by I did not have to worry about driving to the target after landing, did not have to carry heavy engines and fuel to power the landing but could just fly to Laythe on ions and then appear on the surface next to the craft that needed rescuing. The solution was to land accuratly with parachutes. So I feel I have achieved what I set out to do - I will probably step back now and play the game (and live real life - I have a house to renovte, a job to work, and need to get a new job by the summer).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever I have a few closing thoughts on parachutes. First is that obviously support for RealChutes is something a lot of folks would like. To get there the whole handling of the concept of parachutes needs to be abstracted out first, which may not be trivial, and then different parachute implimentations can be added. I am hesitant to start work on that at the moment as I do not use RealChutes myself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other thought I have had about parachutes is a different solution to the problem of landing in hilly areas where the \u0027chute is fully deployed the AGL changes (passing over a cliff) and puts the landing off. The problem is that we can\u0027t take the terrain under the landing path into account because the terrain system is not thread-safe and the predictions need to run is a seperate thread so as not to cause a performance problem. I wondered if a fun solution would be to work with the ISA MapSat mod (if you are using it). So instead to getting terrain data from the game\u0027s own terrain system, MechJeb is able to access the terrain data that you gathered earlier by scanning the landing area. If you did not do the scan, or the data is incomplete, then your landing would be less accurate. The same principle could be used for other aspects of using AGL data in the landing system - if you have not done the scan then how can you know the height of the target location? Obviously you would impliment it so that it would only be this way for people using the MapSat mod. I would love to hear your thoughts on this idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyhow I will be lurking around and if people get bugs related to the parachute targeting I will jump up to fix them, but otherwise I will be busy colonising Laythe by parachuting living modules directly into place on the surface \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-05T10:21:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Shad0wCatcher\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Shad0wCatcher\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHad an error earlier in 157 causing a powered landing failure.
