Besides that, the assumptions used in that analysis are violated by stalling anyway; they\u0027re intended to prevent stall. It looks like the main cause of Xw being wrong is that you have so many intakes; basically it indicates that it makes less drag at a slightly higher angle of attack than at the angle of attack it\u0027s currently at. That\u0027s the one deriv that does have a \u0022correct\u0022 sign, but it\u0027s okay if it\u0027s wrong. Temperature is best found by flying a sounding rocket with a thermometer attached; take a look at the display, and that will tell you the temp at that altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the static analysis, it\u0027s not Cm that you\u0027re really concerned about, it\u0027s the slope. And the sudden positive Cm slope when it stalls makes it stall more as it begins stalling; you want to have lower aspect ratio wings at the back of the plane, higher aspect ratio wings at the front to make it more stable during stalling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks, very useful info there, especially the part about stalling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@DaMichel, just so I can complete the picture in my head with the explanation ferram gave (and so learn something in the process), does the craft flip at mach 0.9 without touching the controls, while flying level and straight? If you did a pull-up before the stall, then would be useful to analyze the graph with the \u0022Pitch setting\u0022 to 1? \u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was in pretty much level flight, maybe in a few degree shallow climb with like 3\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 AoA when the nose began to rise.

You don\u0027t want me to address SAS\u0027 behavior, since I would basically just remove it entirely or limit it to very slight damping inputs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your plane always tries to pitch down, even at full pitch up, that means that it\u0027s too stable and you need to move the wings forward a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing to keep in mind about SAS is that it\u0027s designed to figure out what it needs to do after being activated without knowing anything about the vehicle it\u0027s on beforehand. But if the vehicle is rotating too much it will simply try to damp the motion rather than go crazy trying to hold a heading. It sounds like you\u0027re getting it to do the latter, which means that your plane needs to be designed with more of a zero-control input pitch-up tendency; angle the tail down a bit, angle the canards up a bit, put the engines below the CoM.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SnappingTurtle","CreatedById":69795,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-21T03:35:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESince .23 I\u0027ve been having trouble with my planes getting seemingly random but massive kicks in the roll axis under certain conditions (no SAS but FAR wing leveler on).
