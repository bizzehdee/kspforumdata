If you put 4 blocks of 1/4 power thrusters and fire all four forward...if each 1/4 thruster has a power of .11125kN (TL2) then one must multiply 4*0.11125kN = 0.445kN. I\u0027m guessing they are set at more than TL2 which would explain why it\u0027s at 493.2N rather than 445N. So seems like everything is right, but you are also correct you need either lower powered thrusters (a lot of satellites have 22N or 4N thrusters) and/or use another fuel (again a lot of satellite use straight hydrazine as a monopropellant rather than a bipropellant).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E@Mrnoname:\u003C/strong\u003E I\u0027ll look around, I at one time had a personal KSPX MM file around, I\u0027ll take another look at the parts itself, however, things like tanks are handled by Tweakscale, or PP, or the countless other mods we already support. As for engines...well there is no such thing as a 1.25m Ion engine...and we do RealEngines here, in fact there are so few ion engines out there, the stock ion is really all that\u0027s needed, if you want check out the RLA as that has the other ion engine in existence, and a radial and a set of 4.
