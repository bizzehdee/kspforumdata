If the mass exponent is larger than the thrust exponent, then downscaling will increase the T/W ratio (as now). If the reverse is true, upscaling will increase the T/W ratio. Therefore, I suggest using a mass exponent of 2 for engines if the thrust exponent is 2.\n\nThe current setting is an exponent of 2.5 for both mass and thrust of engine parts (this is done with the \u0022#@TWEAKSCALEBEHAVIOR[Engine]\u0022 statements). I started with an exponent of 2 like you suggest, but found that the resulting downscaled engines were often too heavy/strong to be useful. Or in other words the perfect engine for a tiny craft was too small to visually fit. \n\nAnyway, if there are engines where scaling does not preserve TWR I\u0027d consider it a bug in the TweakScale config.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Pellinor I am posting this here because I don\u0027t know how often you check github and want to make sure you see it.

So far I haven\u0027t found a fairing config that visually works (there might be some hardcoded component that would need scaling). \n\nHaven\u0027t used a single radiator yet, but I have hope that these will be easy to scale (ETA: before 1.1 hits).\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E On the whole \u0022unbalanced career mode\u0022 dilemma perhaps the mod creator could implement a similar dynamic of that which procedural fairings does. In PF certain sizes are locked until completion of a node on the tech tree where a \u0022part\u0022 must be bought that unlocks a different scaling size (such as 3.75m). I think if this was added to the mod it would increase its career playablility and also have players unlock techs they normally wouldn\u0027t like \u0022metamaterials\u0022.\n\nAlready done with the \u0022techRequired\u0022 config value. Some mods use it, but the standard tweakScale configs do not (mainly because nobody has included it in the configs). In my own game I actually don\u0027t scale that much and prefer to use common sense as a restriction. The problem with the way techRequired works today is that I\u0027d consider it a lot of error-prone work to include in all the patches (maybe even separately for stock and CTT), and a huge mess to maintain.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I generally play with the house rule that I can only scale engines up, not down. Sometimes I just play as though the larger engines are just upgrades, however,\n\nMy house rule is more like \u0022use something that is close to the scale you need\u0022. So downscaling is fine, but if I need 10kN of thrust I don\u0027t start with a 3.75m engine.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I cant scale command pods\n\nThere is a switch in scaleExponents.cfg to make them scaleable (which can be changed directly or via MM patch). \n\nSince this has confused quite a few people so far, I\u0027m considering to change the default back to allow crew pod scaling by default. So the people who don\u0027t like it have to flip the switch. It would also be more stable since accidentally reverting the switch to \u0027forbidden\u0027 can break crafts. Any thoughts on this?\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Is there a way to create a CFG which will scale Hotrockets effects? I searched around a bit and haven\u0027t found any recent hits on this if its been addressed. Thanks in advance.\n\nAny idea how those effects are placed/scaled? Usually TweakScale scales the local transform of the part, and this affects all the visual stuff and colliders. So there might be part modules with config values to scale. Or the hotRockets code might need to do something when a rescale happens.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-25T22:25:16Z\u0022 title=\u002209/25/2015 10:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by pellinor**"},{"CreatedByName":"123nick","CreatedById":27488,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-25T22:09:47Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Hi Pellinor\n\u003E I wrote some Tweakscale cfg files for some mods i was interested in and that are not in the Tweakscale release:\n\u003E \n\u003E AtomicAge\n\u003E \n\u003E MarkIVSystem\n\u003E \n\u003E MK2Expansion\n\u003E \n\u003E MK3HypersonicSystems\n\u003E \n\u003E OPT\n\u003E \n\u003E I only included the items i as interested in.\n\u003E \n\u003E So far, they are working for me on 1.0.4 and it\u0027s great!\n\u003E \n\u003E Are you interested I send it to you by mail so that you can check it and make a complete release?\n\nhas this been implimented yet? if not, can your release them , as is?"},{"CreatedByName":"pellinor","CreatedById":85299,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-25T23:04:45Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I was wondering if there were plans or a way to make it so that using techRequired would show something in the corresponding tech node in the science center?

I thought I would try this as a way to produce some larger parachutes to save on spamming dozens of small chutes on stages I am trying to recover after launch. I was using stage recovery for that, so at first I thought it might be that stage recovery was not accounting for the new parachute size. So I put a regular 2R parachute onto a fuel tank, put a 2R parachute resized to 200% onto a second tank that was 4x as heavy as the first, and with the aid of a few decouplers and a booster fired them a few hundred metres up, decoupled the two tanks and popped chutes. By my calculation, a 200% resized chute should have 400% greater open chute surface area and drag, so I would think the two tanks would descend at the same rate. But for whatever reason, the resized chute and larger tank fall at just under double the speed of the normal chute and smaller tank. Any thoughts / suggestions?\n\nScaled parachutes look fine to me.

I think the scaling of lifting surfaces is a bit odd... bringing a \u0022FAT-455\u0022 control surface down to 50% scale will bring it to a similar size to the 100% scale \u0022Elevon 1\u0022... So it should be capable of maneuvering the aircraft just about the same as the Elevon 1. But it doesn\u0027t, despite having a slightly greater surface area (even at 50% scale), the scaled FAT-455 is incredibly lethargic compared to it.\n\nThis is probably more a complaint about stock wings than about tweakscale? As a qick test of the scaling I built a simple plane with a control surface as main wing and measured the takeoff speed. Then I did the same with 4x the same part at 50% scale and came to roughly the same result. So from the TweakScale side the scaling of control surface lift looks fine to me. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E It seems like the scaling is taking into account the cross section of the wing in addition to the surface area in order to generate a lift (and drag?) rating. It\u0027s really odd to see a thinner wing and control surface at full deflection barely moving an aircraft when a fatter control surface with the same surface area results in quite a bit more maneuverability.\n\nLift should go with scale^2, so the lift currently scales with surface area and ignores the change in thickness. Again, to test the TweakScale side of the problem you need to compare different scalings of the same part. Otherwise there is interference from the balance of stock parts, which should be tested separately (like comparing 1xFAT against 4xElevon1).\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I get it reproducible when I used it as the second upgrade tech, not as a final tech.\n\nI still don\u0027t see it.

In my install I occasionally remove tweakScale modules when I consider stacking more important than scaling.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-02T22:12:43Z\u0022 title=\u002210/02/2015 10:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ObsessedWithKSP**"},{"CreatedByName":"xebx","CreatedById":150598,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-02T22:39:00Z","Content":"I\u0027ve been using TweakScale with success on lot of parts : Engines, Tanks, NoseCones, Girder Segment XL, Batteries, Solar panels, etc.\n\nI didn\u0027t see anything weird, but there is one thing people should do when using TS :\n\n- Delete the file \u0027PartDatabase.cfg\u0027 in KSP root folder, because \u0027it seems\u0027 KSP is not refreshing this file like it should, when new parts are created/imported.
