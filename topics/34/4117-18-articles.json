There was an all new shuttle under development by Pirate, but he seems to have moved on. So thats something \u0022down the road\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd to be honest, I currently find IVAs a waste of effort, KSP isn\u0027t very fun played in 1st person. You can see how much work has went into the Kerbin Minishuttle by helldiver and ZRM, and I\u0027m not sure the end result of lots of HUDs and such will ever be worth 6 months of development, since no one is really going to fly from in there anyway. We\u0027l need more KSP development in that area before I\u0027d make it a priority.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot sure what you mean by another engine mount; there is already a 2nd one without the built-in engines to use with the Buran snap-on engine. Both shuttles still had the RCS \u0022pods\u0022 sticking out to the rear with the maneuvering jets - really the only change I could make would be to remove the \u0022hips\u0022 from the top of the mount, but I think those are pretty important to the shuttle silhouette.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
