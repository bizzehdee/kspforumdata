How visual can an economy mod be? The main point is that whenever you launch ships from the SPH/VAB, it will deduct science based on the cost of the craft. That is real science, not fake science, the same science that you spend on R\u0026amp;D. So building a big craft could eat up all your science making it not possible to do any more research until you get more of it. Right now I\u0027ve just been just working on getting a base that functions, and will function well.

Vehicle recovery where the costs are put back into the system for recovered parts, will be one of the things worked on after the post-0.22 release.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Blaer","CreatedById":57404,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-17T02:55:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EREALLY looking forward to vessel recovery implementation...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce that plays... it\u0027s pretty viable in my eyes...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly worry is if science IS finite... then so will program be...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dlrk","CreatedById":60033,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-17T02:57:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDoes the science as currency functionality work in sandbox mode?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ymir9","CreatedById":68199,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-17T02:57:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis sounds perfect, looking forward to the release.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be nice to see hiring new astronauts cost money in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ymir9","CreatedById":68199,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-17T02:59:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Blaer\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Blaer\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EREALLY looking forward to vessel recovery implementation...\u003Cp\u003EOnce that plays... it\u0027s pretty viable in my eyes...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly worry is if science IS finite... then so will program be...\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith Kethane and a very smartly designed reusable program you should be able to get quite a bit of mileage.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Blaer","CreatedById":57404,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-17T03:35:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eoh for sure... but only once reusable/recovery works.. as it stands, alas...
