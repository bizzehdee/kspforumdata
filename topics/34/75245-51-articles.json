The game mechanics for RT2 are installed. I lose contact, and thus control, with unmanned probes almost immediately after launch. I will continue to look and see if there is anything else I can do to correct the issue, or if it was something I did.

This issue, for me anyway, was for the RT2 parts only. Everything else appeared to be there. Upon seeing your post above, I did get a fresh copy of 1.5.1 from the KerbalStuff link at the front of this thread, just to make sure it was 1.5.1. I went ahead and did a fresh install of the mod. The parts now appear.

I just redownladed a new 1.5.1 zip from the KerbalStuff link in the OP, and it now it appears to be working as intended. I have access to all the new antennas and I just lost connection with an unamnned probe I just launched.
