I managed to stop the spin using time warp (odd). I exited the scene and came back, where I then found the ship slowly disintegrating... pieces were falling off and slowly drifting away. I only have images saved of this, posted below. Again, there were NREs in the output_log, but rather than record it, because I suspected that maybe it had something to do with the parts I was using for the mapper (namely the Octagonal Strut for the body), and I decided to see if it would duplicate - hence Eeloo-Mapper2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/eQlLa8m.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EEeloo-Mapper1 before\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/kQGFYEz.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EEeloo-Mapper1 after\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy third ship, Eeloo-Mapper2 was the one I was discussing in this past previous post.
