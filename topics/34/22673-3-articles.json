But let me sum up how it works: pick an orbital period you would like your satellites to have. (For a geosynchronous orbit, that would be 6 hours.) You want your satellite deployment craft to get into an orbit with an orbital period of 2/3rds that. Release a satellite at your apoapsis, and have it burn prograde until it is in an orbit with the right orbital period. The next time your deployment craft reaches apoapsis, have it release another satellite, and have that satellite burn until it reaches the right orbit. It should be 1/3rd of an orbit ahead of the previous satellite. The next time your deployment craft reaches apoapsis, do the same thing with the last satellite.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can find the altitude needed for a given orbital period using Kepler\u0027s Third Law. There are calculators online that will let let you calculate it without needing to do any math, all you\u0027ll need is Kerbin\u0027s mass (which you can find on the wiki) and the orbital period you want. Keep in mind that you need to subtract Kerbin\u0027s radius from the altitude the calculation produces. If you use Kerbal Engineer or Mechjeb, they can tell you what orbital period your ship currently has, so that you can get in exactly the right position.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PakledHostage","CreatedById":8059,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-28T15:47:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SpaceRodent\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SpaceRodent\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis mod sounds fun.
