Liquid Booster: why is it labeled as \u00223.75 m\u0022? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Adv. Lifter Engine: add more weight - right now it\u0027s just a K2X cluster with added 2000 kN of thrust. I suggest something about 22.5-23 tons. Isp also should be lower than cluster, but there is a very little window for adjustments. Maybe 265-320?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Segmented SRBs - their stats are... unusual, at least. Why is 4-segment SRB has 25% more thrust than 3-segment SRB, if only difference between them is amount of fuel? I suggest identical stats (4800 kN from 4-segment SRB, maybe slightly less) - and tweak them to suit your needs. KW had two large SRBs before 0.23, X-5 and X-5HT - one at half-thrust and one at full-thrust. Last update removed half-thrust SRB and noted that \u0022you can tweak the full-thrust variant\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Soyuz-style boosters - they might look slightly overpowered, but again - you can tweak them to suit your needs.

You can\u0027t have another folder in the path like \u0022GameData/Mods/NovaPunch2\u0022 or anything like that (if you open some of the config files, they have file paths near the top, if the paths are wrong they won\u0027t load, so you only get some parts in game)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebio: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I called it \u0022Mini\u0022 at first and changed my mind, forgot to edit the description.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- New Odin is supposed to be black/dark, but I might be able to do a silver variant, or maybe a third pod way down the road.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- That example craft has that stretched 1st stage tank so it could do that, its basically hauling 2 stages of fuel and the boosters are technically stage 1. The real SLS is basically stage 1 \u002B boosters to orbit, stage 2 is the Earth Departure stage and that\u0027s it. You can build it 3 stage Saturn style too\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Funny story, that SLS liquid booster was originally 3.75m when I modeled it, and about 20% longer. A 5m stage big enough to use it basically wouldn\u0027t fit in the VAB. I shortened it, and it still looked strange, so I sized it back down. I wanted to make the parts a step bigger than the stock one, hence the engine being 5m, but I think it still works with it being 2.5m boosters \u002B the 5m stage (and it lets the new SRBs be used for the Block 0 config too)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Not sure what happened to the SLS engine config, I bumped it to 7500 thrust and 26 tons last night. Must have had the old version open in textpad. Try that out with your Isp recommendation and see how it works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The SRBs... in reality longer SRBs increases thrust, not burn time, so I worked out a Thrust, drymass, and fuel load per segment that ramped up the thrust but kept the burn between 50-60s with a pretty consistent TWR. It makes sense in my head anyway.. and its documented in the config file. In theory is should make each size functionally useful, and let them be tweakable for burn time per launcher (which is done with the shape of the fuel core in reality)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Soyuz boosters - I thought I erred on the side of too-little fuel for their volume, but I could be off. I just finished it last night, so there is definitely room for tweaking. That litle quad engine doesn\u0027t have complete geometry unfortunately, I pulled it out of the Zenit(h) booster from Tiberdyne and used it on Soyuz and that radial booster. There\u0027s already so many 2.5m engines in the pack, I can probably tweak one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I liked the fuel ducts too. Tried some out (hence the orange lines) but they had the same issue the old one does, they don\u0027t look right when using a decoupler. Might try again and work on an ultra-flat radial decoupler as well (lots of things need them) - but decoupler colliders are \u003Cem\u003Eannoying\u003C/em\u003E to get right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-PAMs are cool for sats or long range probes where you anticipate a long Ion burn - just cut out X amount of dV using a PAM and then get rid of it. I\u0027ve probably only used them twice ever, though \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that attach node/mouse grip bug is an legit KSP bug actually. If you open up a config file for one of those, you\u0027ll notice it\u0027s modular, I load the bottom segment with the motor and then stack segments above them, and finally add the top node. So the part origin is where the origin of the motor segment is. I adjust the node_attach up so its roughly in the middle of the cylinder\u0027s height, and also adjust the CoMOffset lower in the config file (which works if you check it with the VAB tool.) So everything should be in the right place, but for some reason the mousepoint is still at the part origin. Luckily you can just drop the part in the VAB workspace and grab it again wherever you like.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd in the middle of typing this out, I figured out a blatantly obvious workaround, so I\u0027ll probably fix it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the report.

It\u0027s only just come to my attention, and I just noticed it\u0027s also affecting the Freyja.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStock unity may be compressing PNGs that don\u0027t end in _NRM too; dunno.

Given how ATM works, it needs to know whether a file will be used as a normal map, since Unity stores normal maps internally as RGBA with R=G=B= Y axis color-inverted and A = X axis color-inverted (IIRC). (That\u0027s why many parts have those gray rather than purple normal maps btw; they\u0027re already in final form). The issue is that due to how ATM caches textures and override\u0027s Unity/KSP\u0027s normal loading, it needs to know what files should be stored as normal maps and what files shouldn\u0027t; if it gets it wrong, then a normal map is compressed (big whoop) but, much more relevant, it\u0027s stored in the wrong format and \u003Cem\u003EUnity can\u0027t use it as a normal map.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, a DRE shield texture I haven\u0027t fixed yet: \u0022GameDatabase: Texture \u0027DeadlyReentry/Parts/deadlyReentry_1.25Heatshield/model001\u0027 requested as normal map but texture is not a normal map and is not readable\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis means, of course, that your normal maps won\u0027t get used by most people using ATM.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
