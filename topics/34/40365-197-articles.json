The 3.75m has 2200 KN thrust with Thorium, but it weights...a lot. Add to that, that i like to build large ships that can be b*tch to lift from ground, but... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIF something i like to whine, is the power production, i usually fit my nuke powered ships with solar arrays even there\u0027s a reactor in the bottom of the ship. Its just that i don\u0027t wish to carry the proper size generator with the ship as i don\u0027t have the need for it\u0027s power. Fitting smaller generator doesn\u0027t look very good on the ship, nor very sturdy. Some sort of side mounted generators would become handy, similar like those small radiators...

They don\u0027t have a maximum power and never have, they just scale down power be size if you use a differently sized generator and reactor.\u003Cp\u003E...\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk, I did some testing and went through the source code and I get it now. There are just 2 problems :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- When I attach bigger generator, its power is scaled down. That is, if 1.25m generator gives 100% power, then 0.625m and 2.5m generators both give 25%. Not sure if that\u0027s intentional.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The bigger problem is that different generators can \u0022share\u0022 the same reactor. E.g. I have reactor A attached to generator A, and on a different part of the vessel reactor B attached to generator B. If I turn off generator A, the thermal/charge power from reactor A is fed into generator B. The same thing with turning off reactors. There is a \u0022link\u0022 between reactor A and generator B / reactor B and generator A that shouldn\u0027t be there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, could you respond to the quoted part of my previous message (the parts that weren\u0027t addressed already) ?

As long as you have a generator on board to provide the needed ongoing power requirements for the reactor\u0027s laser, you can also just strap a couple big batteries to launch clamps so you don\u0027t have to haul them around if you don\u0027t need them.
