KJR stiff joints in many different way.  \n\nIt was assumed that **MuMechToggle** is not respected in KJR regarding to allow IR parts to move. MuMechToggle is used to detect when IR part animation is triggered to release KJR stiffnes and when it is ended to turn on stiffnes, but now at different position of joint.\n\n**multiPartAttachNodeReinforcement** do different thing. Closest way to described it is like stock autostrut, but not only to grandparent part it put autostruts to many other nearby parts, doesn\u0027t looking is it IR part or something else. multiPartAttachNodeReinforcement is not aware of MuMechToggle trigger and \u0022autostrut\u0022 to closest part, regardless if it is IR part or not.\n\nI was saying in previous post that once multiPartAttachNodeReinforcement is disbled, you need to put regular struts on strategic places of your construction.
