I made a flying wing design after seeing one and the What did you do in KSP today thread, that combined with the fact I was having stability issues with conventional designs. I made a simple design and put the Bentley on it, and it flew pretty well. Decided to put the DB 605K on it (or KB 605K as I prefer calling it) and discovered just how powerful it truly is. at the minimum power to start the engine I was able to take off and hold around 127 m/s at low altitude. At full power I got up to around 280. I didn\u0027t test high altitude though. I have noticed an issue with the aircraft engine though. It seems impossibly to keep them from overheating. I didn\u0027t test the Bentley exactly though did notice constant overheating at power, and putting the 605K at the first big notch on the throttle thing on the navball heats up the oil to overheating pint, even with the 2 liquid radiators I put on at max flow rate.
