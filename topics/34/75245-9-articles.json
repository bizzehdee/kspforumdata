A value of 0 means only the longest-range omni matters, and the others are dead weight. A value of 1 means you add all the ranges together, and use that as the range of the spacecraft. Other values follow a line between those two extremes (so, for example, if you have four 2500 km antennas and a MultipleAntennaMultiplier of 0.25, your ship would have an omni range of a quarter of the way between 2500 km and 10,000 km, or 4375 km).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis will all be explained in the next version of the RT manual, but we\u0027ve got some other details we need to double-check first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes the multiple antenna multiplier only work with omni\u0027s, or are dishes included too?
