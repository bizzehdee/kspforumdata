These engines have better fuel efficiency than the KSP stock engines, up to 460s of Isp, but beware! They\u0027re more expensive and produce less thrust per unit weight.

These should work with most mod tanks, but no promises. However, Liquid Hydrogen is very temperamental and without the proper storage **it will** **slowly evaporate (\u0022boil off\u0022)**. You can activate cooling on all added tanks for a modest cost in Electric Charge, but this is inefficient. Therefore, I provide special cryogenic tanks bundled with the mod which have insulation to reduce the cost of cooling the tanks.
