Using a tag named \u0022stable\u0022. All .version files contain a URL to the .version file of the stable-tag on github. Thus as long as stable points to the same release, AVC will not know that there was a new release. Then after you tested and tagged your release (with the correct version number) you can simply move the \u0022stable\u0022 tag to the new release tag. I don\u0027t know if this will work with git but in other VCS I did something like this in the past.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.) Another idea is to have two branches: The master branch and the stable branch. Then you can let pointing all .version files to the .version file in the stable branch. Also here you can change on master as much as you want, without affecting the AVC. When you do your release, you can then simply merge the release tag (with the right version number) to the stable branch and since no-one is allowed to change anything on the stable branch, the merge will be trivial. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBest regards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGrafZahl\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Crzyrndm","CreatedById":92871,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T22:02:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s only two numbers if you happen to diff one file at a very specific time period.
