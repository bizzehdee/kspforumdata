However, I have no idea when this is going to happen, nor can I see it happening all that soon - it\u0027s certainly going to be a large feature for squad, and unlike DMP, they\u0027ve got to get it perfect for release.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;speculation\u0026gt;There hasn\u0027t appeared to be any clear step towards multiplayer with KSP 0.24, I didn\u0027t find anything too revealing in the KSP assembly apart from possibly starting to index kerbals by name instead of number (which definitely makes things easier). Contracts felt like a tiny step backwards. I guess they\u0027ll keep the MP stuff out until it\u0027s stable, but there should still be telltale signs of the future showing through\u0026lt;/speculation\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI believe squad is going to announce the feature list for 0.25 today - but I\u0027d be \u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E surprised if multiplayer was on that list.
