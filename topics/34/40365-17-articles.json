I need to spend more time looking at the second bug you submitted on bitbucket but for now I\u0027ll issue an emergency fix for this science lab problem along with the fix for the first bug (no science being deducted for plasma engine upgrade) that you reported. Unfortunately I\u0027ve just moved house and I\u0027m still waiting for installation of a decent internet connection which is posing me problems right now, in addition to bitbucket being down for maintanence. I\u0027ll *try* and get the fix up tonight.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fractal_UK","CreatedById":61595,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-03T00:55:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EVersion 0.4.2 Released\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChangelog\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EVersion 0.4.2\u003Cbr\u003E-Science Lab loading bug emergency fix\u003Cbr\u003E-Plasma Engine upgrade cost not being deducted bug fixed.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/43839-0-21-Warp-Drive-Space-Solar-Nuclear-Antimatter-Pack-Version-0-3-2-%28Alpha%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDownload links on first page updated!\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo backup download yet, due to connectivity issues.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"darksearth","CreatedById":76040,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-03T01:51:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Fractal_UK\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Fractal_UK\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EVersion 0.4.2 Released\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChangelog\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EVersion 0.4.2\u003Cbr\u003E-Science Lab loading bug emergency fix\u003Cbr\u003E-Plasma Engine upgrade cost not being deducted bug fixed.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/43839-0-21-Warp-Drive-Space-Solar-Nuclear-Antimatter-Pack-Version-0-3-2-%28Alpha%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDownload links on first page updated!\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo backup download yet, due to connectivity issues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis also seems to fix the problem I was having.
