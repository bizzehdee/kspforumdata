Glad it\u0027s an easily fixable problem.\u003Cp\u003ESince we\u0027re discussing realism and FASA rocket launches, I thought I\u0027d share my experiences with launching the Apollo-loaded Saturn V in the new KSP aerodynamic model.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI love the Saturn V, and spent a lot of time in 0.25 getting it to fly a realistic flight profile, so I was anxious to see how it flew after 1.0. As a quick test, I loaded up the SV from the FASA sandbox game and gave it a whirl. Using my old MechJeb flight profile, it would always tumble and die at around 13km (about the time the air got thin and the pressure got high). I assumed this was because of pushing against max Q, so I set up the engines to do what they do in real life, and had the center F-1 shut down at about 12km. This fixed the problem perfectly and it went into orbit every time. The only problem was that a launch TWR of 2 is way higher than reality, so my next step was to reduce that and see what happened...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a dirty job, I reduced thrust on the S1 engines until the launch TWR was about 1.2 (the real Apollo 11 SV was about 1.18). I didn\u0027t adjust the fuel amounts or anything, so as I said, this was a very dirty job just to see how the aerodynamics worked. The result was that soon after clearing the tower, the rocket would lean in some random direction (usually North or SW, for some reason) and fail. I tried over and over again with different MechJeb settings, but the lean happened too soon in the flight and could never really be compensated for. Finally, frustrated, I started taking the ship apart. That\u0027s when I noticed that the SV in the FASA sandbox save has tons of added vernier thrusters and struts to compensate for problems in flight...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E So I built a new one, 100% clean. Just the parts you\u0027d expect to be on the actual vehicle. No extra struts, no extra RCS, nothing but a pure SV with Apollo payload. It flew perfectly from then on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, this is the MJ setup I used, which will probably be surprising to folks that think you should head straight up through the atmosphere before turning, but it\u0027s quite realistic: Gravity turn start @ 0.2km, turn end at 69km, shape 75%. Limit AoA to 5deg (still experimenting with that), corrective steering off. Have the center S1 engine shut off at 12km, and the center S2 shut off at 40km (still experimenting).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing those settings a clean Apollo SV will make it into a 200km orbit with fuel to spare.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext comes trying to get it into orbit without having to shut off engines and coast at any point, and without having fuel still left in the S2. I think this is a MechJeb problem, though. It likes to outrun the Apoapsis and then have to coast to catch up before circularizing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps anyone having problems launching a moon mission!\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy bother going all the way to 200 km orbit when 80km works perfectly fine?

So 80km around Kerbin for boosting missions (going to further obits or other planetary objects/outside of Kerbin\u0027s influence), and then going above whatever height the Kerbin Terrain unloads is great for space stations so you can reduce some of your lag.

That might be your problem. I always build down from the Apollo Command Module.
