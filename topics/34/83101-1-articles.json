I really built it to fill a niche in my gameplay, but given the enthusiasm around Pteron, I thought it might be useful to others, at least until they finish their shuttle. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy idea was to create a craft that could handle rescue missions as well as providing a low-cost crew service vessel for my orbital station. I\u0027m also in the process of designing an educational simulator around KSP that will be used by kids... so I wanted a part that would be fun to fly... and a vertical launch/glider return vessel fit that bill and gives a flight profile similar to Dream Chaser and the Space Shuttle, so it\u0027s something familiar and educationally valid. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI ALSO wanted to make it an exercise in efficiency... and this is a part for those times when you want to fly... not build.

Because of the reasonably steep glideslope I haven\u0027t successfully landed it with wheeled gear without a lot of bounce and flip... though it might be possible? The engine also has sufficient TWR that you can operate in glider mode down to the last 250m, drop airspeed to 50m/s, and then turn the nose up and engine on and do a powered, vertical landing.
