I\u0027ve been able to make a 1 seat rocket that will orbit with ease but when it comes to launching a 3 seater command module with a munlander (in a similar set up to the Apollo program), I am running into problems. I can just about get the rocket in orbit but I seem to be lacking the power I need to get the performance I once had. Now I realise this mod adds realism and this is not a complaint I am just looking for some sound advice on how I could squeeze out the maximum amount of power I can get for the most simplistic design. My original Mun rocket had 4 stages, the original ground to space stage, a circular stage, transfer stage and finally command and munlander stage. At the moment I am having to burn all the fuel I have in what used to be the transfer stage to gain a sustainable orbit so its obvious that I am lacking in power in the previous stages.

The other thing is to try and keep as much drag as far back as you can or you\u0027ll get more unstable with speed. As an example: I was having some problems re-entering a plane which was stable up to 1.5km/s ( pretty much the limit using FAR jets, at that point transition to rockets and you\u0027re almost out of the atmosphere anyway ) because re-entry speeds were destabilising it and it\u0027d just go into an unrecoverable flat spin every time. The issue was solved simply by keeping the jet intakes closed until very late on ( with a decent design you can pretty much glide halfway round the globe or more on re-entry ) and adding some tiny speedbrakes at the very rear.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyHook","CreatedById":31496,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-10T08:18:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Netris\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Netris\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAs far as I can tell, my 2 shuttles in devellopement aren\u0027t even going higher than about 100 from the launchpad x) I need to understand a bit more of asymmetrical thrust I think\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell balancing thrust is one issue, but my theory is that the lift generated by the wings under FAR is affecting my flight path, eventually causing me to flip over.

Another method of determining stability is to use the static analysis or dynamic analysis tabs in the FAR editor GUI: If you do a static angle of attack sweep analysis, the moment coefficient (Cm, yellow line) will slope downwards for a stable plane; it will slope upwards for an unstable plane. If you do a dynamic longitudinal analysis the oscillations in the graph will converge to zero if the plane is stable; if it is unstable the graphs will explode. Honestly, the static analysis is easier than the dynamic analysis and is more accurate than the CoL method, though the CoL is better for doing very fast initial design iterations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for seeing if it has enough lift, figure that there should be slightly more surface area from the wings than from the fuselage. That should be about enough for the first iterations. Just make sure that your main landing gear are just behind the center of mass so that the plane can rotate on the runway and take off properly; no matter how much wing you add, if you can\u0027t angle it to make lift you\u0027ll have a bad time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope that helps, if you have any more questions, feel free to ask.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Netris","CreatedById":28791,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-11T05:28:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI got a question about the static AoA analysis.
