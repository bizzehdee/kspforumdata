This seems to have fixed almost all the issues. While increasing the resolution is an option, the issue isn\u0027t framerate: it\u0027s memory usage. The voxel model generation is rather memory heavy, and it also involves a fair bit of garbage, so if it runs at too high a resolution too often you get the garbage collection hitches. Also, we\u0027re heavily memory bound in KSP, so we can\u0027t afford several million elements for the voxel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe system is built in craft-space assuming an unflexed vehicle. Then cross-section data is taken from the voxel model and is used to generate aerodynamic properties that are stored for each section, and then the voxel itself is thrown away, because it\u0027s simply not needed anymore.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E@Zorbaq: \u003C/strong\u003EFunnily enough, the way that everything works out makes it seem to be approximately the same or even less expensive than what FAR was before. Most expensive stuff is in generating the voxel (which is multithreaded because it can be) and the initial geometry work for each part (which could be multithreaded as well, but that would require a large amount of work to prevent race conditions, I think).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-07T05:32:33Z\u0022 title=\u002205/07/2015 05:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ferram4\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gfurst","CreatedById":126201,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T05:32:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOkey guys, just reporting.
