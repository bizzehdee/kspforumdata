However, I\u0027d also like to point out that actual elevons aren\u0027t placed so close to the CoM/CoL, because at that position they don\u0027t provide much leverage. So they would act more like flaps and less like elevators.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EElevons need to be back away from the aircraft\u0027s CoM, or it pushes the Center of Rotation out in front of the craft. Actually, even the shuttle suffered from a Center of Rotation that was out in front of the nose.
