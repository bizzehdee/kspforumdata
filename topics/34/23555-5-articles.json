Also, ballast is a key component to airships and modulating the lift that the lifting bags exert. The craft uses fuel and a neutral or slightly negative buoyancy is what one wants close to the ground. Too much lift and you risk going out of control, exceeding pressure height and venting your lifting gas. Then when you come back down you\u0027ll be over weight. Look at the details on the US Navy\u0027s Airships. They went to great lengths to setup a ballast release system as well as condensers to retain some of the water from engine exhaust and to use that as ballast. This reduced the amount of lift gas venting necessary to maintain boyancy in a controllable range. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to anchors, correctly speaking, you need a weight of earth or material upon that anchor to act as enough ballast for such an object.

They can act due to weight, but the forces on the ship are laterally and not as much vertically. If a ship is anchored and very close it it\u0027s anchor it will pull it\u0027s anchor up and drag under the force of currents. Anchors work basically like a plow and dig in that way.

I\u0027ve been looking for a method to deliver a rover I could pick up and move elsewhere since dropping a new one every time I move to some other exploration spot turned out to be tiresome. So I built a lander with two winched up DEMV Ant rovers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt worked fine in the space center, but it turned out that the force of winching is insufficient to produce a lock if the lander is on a 30% or so incline, so it keeps dangling. Unfortunately, on the Mun, the ground is never quite flat enough, and in the physics system, the pendulum motion of the rover that produces \u003Cem\u003Enever, ever stops\u003C/em\u003E. Eventually after many a tense minute I was able to catch it quickly enough to get it to lock...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...but part of the rover got stuck inside a fuel tank and when I folded the landing legs, the whole lander suddenly disintegrated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next version holds the rover by a docking port instead and uses two winches to pull it up until the docking port sucks it in -- at least, this promises to avoid the problem because I can control the angle and rely on the docking port\u0027s magic to correct what I can\u0027t, but I guess I\u0027ll see if I have a spectacular disintegration again soon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI understand it might not be practical to limit the pendulum motion (probably impossible without getting at the engine itself), but could there possibly be a method to force the parts to align when the cable is pulled in almost fully and the connector is just caught on the edge of the model, kinda like the docking ports suck each other in?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, as far as I\u0027ve been able to determine, switching to docking mode if the cable is under strain is likely to immediately launch the objects into each other at great speeds, usually with disastrous consequences. Is it possible to have the winch check for that and prevent this from happening?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis reminds me of my problems with the previous version. I had an winch with an junior docking port. An ant rover with another port. On kerbin I was able to park the rover, lower winch and dock then retract and lock the winch. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn Minmus with low gravity and no atmosphere the rover started to swing wildly, this turned into rotation as I retracted. Trying to lock winch brake the junior docking clamp connection. As the ant rover with wheels retracted ignored collision this worked, with wheels out the lander was destroyed. Issue was worse on bodies with low gravity and no atmosphere. It worked nice on Laythe. On Duna it stabilized over time. On Mun this took an day or something.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"a.g.","CreatedById":59470,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-30T16:08:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf that rover was using the bobcat plugin, that is probably because in order to make rovers more stable and avoid all the complaints about difficulty of steering it applies artificial gravity of 1 kerbin g to the rover when wheels are deployed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"andysim212","CreatedById":51942,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-30T17:03:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewind is coming? awsome!!!!!!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-30T19:36:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022a.g.\u0022 data-cite=\u0022a.g.\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf that rover was using the bobcat plugin, that is probably because in order to make rovers more stable and avoid all the complaints about difficulty of steering it applies artificial gravity of 1 kerbin g to the rover when wheels are deployed.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks, however I was able to get serious airtime on Gilly however it might be that the gravity worked like ground effect and went away then airborne.

The blimp is anchored to the earth only at this one point, so it is always free to rotate 360 degrees around the mast as the wind changes.
