I feel that \u0022official\u0022 cost is somewhat too high - for example, HH-125-B and FL-T800 has the same cost (1600), but the latter holds almost 20% more fuel. So what\u0027s the point using HH-125-B? Sometimes, costs rival these of KW (KW tanks hold more fuel than NP tanks)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Engines: I balanced them with KW in mind; also, I\u0027ve accounted for size (of the engine itself, not its node size) - low-profile engines are more expensive in my version, because they offer more design flexibility (that\u0027s why Bertha Mini Quad costs more than small K-2X, although the latter has better stats). In general, \u0022official\u0022 is cheaper, sometimes way more than they should (AHL costs less than NASA KS-25? I agree that NASA engines are too expensive, but this is really strange pricing!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) SRBs: as with engines, \u0022official\u0022 is cheaper. BTW, why is Mk7 PAM costs more than 0.675 ASRB PAM?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Pods: these looks fine, although Freyja is kinda expensive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Structurals and other stuff:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- ASRB nosecones: I fail to justify these pricetags. 2500 for 2.5m nosecone? It\u0027s made from finest unobtanium?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Stack-mounted chutes: as with low-profile engines, these are far more useful than their stock counterparts, and should be more expensive (2x than corresponding stock chutes in my patch)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- 3.75x1.25 plates: I feel they should cost more, due to their usefulness\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wasmic","CreatedById":64885,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-09T13:34:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow, that IVA is amazing!
