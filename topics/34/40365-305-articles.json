This is evident by it not changing based on reactor size and input power; a thermal rocket attached to a fission plant will have the same ISP regardless of if that fission plant is putting out 5mW or 9000mW. The hotter the reactor, the better the ISP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) In the case of thermal receivers (which of course are NOT a reactor but can still power a thermal rocket) it seems to set the ISP rather low, in fact it places it lower than an un-upgraded fission reactor at 866 ISP. This makes a thermal receiving rocket slightly more efficient than a NERVA powered one. I guess this is for balance reasons; you can have a very high ISP rocket but you have to haul around all the power plants and other gear or you can receive the power to keep everything nice and light but you have only about the efficiency of the stock interplanetary engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) As well as being effected by the core temperature, ISP is also effected by atmospheric pressure... using in atmosphere will have a much lower ISP. A thermal receiver on baseline liquid fuel goes from a bit over 866 in vacuum to around 347 at the KSC. It does rise quite rapidly - just a couple of thousand meters and it\u0027s way up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) The thrust available is a combination of two factors, the thermal power available and the ISP. Basically the more thermal power just can pump into it, the more thrust you can achieve. This means ships receiving thermal power especially can have enormous power - though thrusting at above around 7000kn usually shatters the thermal receiver and breaks the craft. Fuels can also be used to increase the thrust - LFO by 3.7x! All fuels other than liquid have a lower ISP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) A high ISP actually \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Elowers\u003C/span\u003E your thrust. With fission reactors this means the upgraded versions actually give a slightly lower thrust (all be it by a tiny number). For fusions the upgraded version will still be better; the loss from ISP doesn\u0027t get rid of the gains from the extra MW\u0027s. What does suffer are anti-matter reactors which loose a significant amount of power once upgraded. For a thermal receiver this ISP is so low anyway you get a LOT of power to thrust to play with.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tristavius","CreatedById":60879,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-18T09:19:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022OmegaCenti\u0022 data-cite=\u0022OmegaCenti\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ztoYsBA.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/ztoYsBA.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Transmitter is actually engaged in that picture\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*snip*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOut of interest what are those radial solar panels in the picture?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jinks","CreatedById":69693,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-18T21:25:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey folks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI seem to have a problem with the ATTILA thruster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/OjE0f\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
