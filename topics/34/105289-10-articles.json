If I change the setting, hit update, change again, hit restore, it gives me back what I set at the update\n2. **Output stuck at 25%:** Sounds like a configuration issue, 25% is the default minimum deflection for Q in excess of 160. Since I see no errors in the log, the only assumption I can make is that the configured change from 25% to a much larger value was extremely abrupt. Need to see configuration to be of assistance, but that is a huge change from the default...\n3. **Exceptions:** Probably to do with the \u0022Remove\u0022 buttons. They\u0027ve always been a little funky\n\nAnd to reply to your post in the Pilot Assistant thread about the mods cooperating, they do, just not quite in the way you imagine. DD was originally designed as a component of Pilot Assistant (it worked for a broader range of applications so got to be standalone). The reason Pilot Assistant knowing what DD is doing won\u0027t do anything, is that PA knows **absolutely nothing** about the vessel it is in control of to start with. It flies purely on current Heading / Altitude / Velocity / Pitch / etc. (Hence why it requires manual tuning for best performance). With control authority at 1/3 of what the default DD config gives, yes PA will struggle unless you retune it to match (the shipping defaults for DD are designed for PA after all)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-06-16T22:01:13Z\u0022 title=\u002206/16/2017 10:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJune 16, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Crzyrndm**"},{"CreatedByName":"linuxgurugamer","CreatedById":129964,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-16T10:51:56Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 3 hours ago, Crzyrndm said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The only issue would be that the patch adding the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E node, didn\u0027t remove the stock one (and I\u0027m not even sure it\u0027s a problem.

Variable Trust Limiter was really nice because you could build SRBs to have 100% trust at the start of the launch and it would decrease as the fuel burned up. Really handy mod for building shuttles and keeping a nice trust curve during a launch. Sadly I don\u0027t know how to make dlls. Maybe someone could take a look at the source and update it. To be honest I have not even tested it for 1.5 since I have no time to play and waiting for one or 2 more mods to be updated. I just assume since its a dll it needs updating.  \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-11-07T16:36:05Z\u0022 title=\u002211/07/2018 04:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 7, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by dave1904**"},{"CreatedByName":"linuxgurugamer","CreatedById":129964,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-11-07T16:54:47Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 18 minutes ago, dave1904 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E But for srbs that is not an option.
