That said any chances of getting some \u0022Unique\u0022 contracts that help push the player to discover more? The game has some basic first time accomplishment ones to start out with and then just elevates to \u0022explore planet/moon\u0022. But other than it just a bunch of common easily repeatable, and eventually grindy contracts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe stock KSP already has two great sources for these types on contracts. The first is the achievement system, which when it was first add I couldn\u0027t help but think how great it would be to have some of those show up as missions. Since only the ones you have done show up you can\u0027t be quite sure what they all are. But if the contract system would check and only give you ones you haven\u0027t reach yet (much like how if you go past curtain altitude on your first mission you won\u0027t get contracts for the other altitudes) then it won\u0027t be offered. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo you\u0027ll get missions like gather science from materials on a curtain body in specific biome. Which encourages players to get out and explore more than simply \u0022get science from surface\u0022 or \u0022get science from space\u0022 which people have shown are very exploity since they just park ships there and keep sending the data when one of those missions appears for instant complete. The science from locations could be gated behind explore missions so you don\u0027t get them before you have even been to planet to begin with. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other is missions to explore the anomalies(aka easter eggs). I know they would effectively overlap the rover mission type but honestly those are rather boring and not worth my time or effort for their payout. I tried a few but just going to the middle of no where to look at nothing was very dull, plus the waypoints were so far apart it took over an hour since time acceleration causes bad things to happen to rovers. The aerial ones are nice though as it gives me a chance to work on plane designs and test them out on actually missions instead of just seeing how well some plane I made flies around KSP airspace. But the ground ones while a nice idea just feel dull. But if one of those locations was an anomaly than it would feel a bit more like sight seeing and actually worth while. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso for all of these missions you could have higher payouts since they would be one time missions. The science achievement ones I\u0027d say have little to no science but decent rep and high cash on. The anomaly ones It think should have high payouts in all three areas since their one time deals but also to encourage players to actually do them and go sight seeing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHonestly I think a system like this would feel more real and less grindy than the endless parade of cardboard cut out contract missions. Also the unique missions should have higher payouts on average than grindy missions to encourage the player to try new stuff instead of simply doing the same easy ones over and over.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fingal","CreatedById":109326,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-27T20:49:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe DMagic mod now has contracts that include the anomalies: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/64972-0-25-DMagic-Orbital-Science-New-Science-Parts-V0-8-6-1-%2810-20-14%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/64972-0-25-DMagic-Orbital-Science-New-Science-Parts-V0-8-6-1-%2810-20-14%29\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"juanml82","CreatedById":105344,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-27T21:23:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Hodo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Hodo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOk, so basically I just drive around the three points on the map till it completes?
