My favorite parts are how accessible certain technologies are- Rover science, for example, shouldn\u0027t logically take a huge amount of research to unlock like in stock/CTT, and the same can be said about many other tech nodes.\n\nWith that all said, I\u0027ve found it doesn\u0027t play totally well with KSPIe.  \n\nMany upgrade nodes are missing (All 4 thermal rocket/jets are missing some of their upgrade nodes and don\u0027t properly shift to closed-cycle), and the pebble bed is way too far down the tree.  These both hamper any career efforts to create functional early-lategame spaceplanes (where normally, spending a few thousand science is rewarded with multimode engines with decent vacuum isp and infinite atmospheric thrust). As it is, only the large TORY and nuclear turbojets have an accessible closed-cycle mode"},{"CreatedByName":"Probus","CreatedById":102512,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-15T02:32:11Z","Content":"[@bartekkru99](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/76625-bartekkru99/) Ask away ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\n[@Maffif](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/183533-maffif/) The mod was originally made for KSPIe (many revs ago) but the parts keep changing on me.

After some more digging I\u0027ve found the thermal turbojet closed-cycle/rocket upgrade isn\u0027t visible (its node is experimental rocketry, which in ETT is at the very end of the rocket tree- far removed from the rest of the nuclear/thermal power, but I leave that choice up to you; perhaps it should require a great deal of rocketry research to unlock)\n\nAgain, very much enjoying this tree.
