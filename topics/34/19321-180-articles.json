Flying planes really is a lot of fun with this mod.\u003Cp\u003EOverall, although the mod adds a lot of variables and complexity to the game, it\u0027s quite overpowered. My first plane with the mod got an apogee of 75 km. Let me say that again. My very first \u003Cem\u003Eplane\u003C/em\u003E - not a rocket, it only had one jet engine - could, in theory, get involved in an accident with my space station.

I managed to make a 2-seat plane that could land on the mun and that was my record. Until now, that is. My second plane with this mod was a 3-seat plane with 2 rapiers and a nuclear engine, and it got to duna and back! (no landing) It didn\u0027t even have lights, landing gear, docking port, because it was a test flight to see it achieved orbit. I admit that climbing to orbit was a bumpy ride (its Lp is positive and I have no idea how to solve that).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, that\u0027s my general opinion so far.
