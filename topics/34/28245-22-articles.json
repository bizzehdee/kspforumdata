The other major roadblock to this (for me at least) is that right now this is just a parts pack, so game updates are unlikely to break it, but making it plugin dependent would probably make it susceptible. I have been looking at options on accomplishing this, since the pack got so large, however.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can always leverage off of existing plugins. Firespitter has a module for changing textures that might work. I\u0027m looking at one of the part configs that uses it, and it looks like you target a sub-object of the unity model and then provide a list of possible textures. If you separated the colored bands off to their own texture, it would let you change band colors with a little popup in the action editor. I suppose, theoretically, you could add the module twice and have the ability to switch band colors and tank skins independently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for customizing the contents, there\u0027s always Modular Fuel Systems.

Moreover, looking at some of my ships in the persistence file, if an update breaks the plugins existing ships would still work. MFS changes the resource values of the part in the ship itself, so the plugin doesn\u0027t need to be active for ships to load correctly, and if Firespitter can\u0027t load it should just revert to default textures and probably re-assume the chosen textures once the plugin is restored.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Talisar","CreatedById":62035,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-27T12:15:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Rybec\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Rybec\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou can always leverage off of existing plugins.

Compressed gases would force flat-ended cylinders out into such a shape anyway, so containers for compressed gases are given that shape to avoid fighting the natural forces. It\u0027s similar to the reason plastic soda bottles are shaped the way they are. It took decades of engineering for Coca Cola to produce their trademarked curved bottle in plastic, because the CO2 dissolved in the liquid would cause it to bulge out without special reinforcement. Up until then, and still now with other brands, the basic domed cylinder remains the standard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could argue that an exposed truss of some kind might give a weight advantage over a cylindrical shroud over the domed end of the tank, and that certainly might be the case with very large ones, but aerodynamic drag would be substantially increased, likely negating the effect of any weight advantage at launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI still like the spherical tanks.

I\u0027ve been playing around with several different things lately and not making enough progress on any of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToroidal Tanks - I\u0027ve been playing around with these, trying to come up with a design that will allow several sizes but allow the sharing of textures and models in order to keep the memory footprint low. I\u0027m thinking that the current 7.5m diameter would be the smallest size for a 2.5m attachment and the largest for the 1.25m attachment. I\u0027ve also been playing around with a design that is basically surface attached which should allow you to place it anywhere along a part of the correct diameter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECommand Pods - I think I\u0027ve managed to get the design bugs worked out of the ones that I made earlier, so now it\u0027s time to apply what I learned to some better looking ones (both spherical and non-spherical). I\u0027d definitely like to see more variety in command pod/crew tank choices out there, and I have a few ideas.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBase building parts - I\u0027ve also been playing with designs for some modules to be used in space station/ground base construction. The ones that I\u0027ve made I\u0027m pretty happy with, but I think they\u0027re a bit too similar to some of the things in Lack\u0027s LLC pack (which is what I generally use for ground bases), so I\u0027m trying to modify the aesthetic on them so they\u0027re distinct.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModular SEV - This one kind of combines a lot of the stuff from the command pods and base parts. I\u0027ve been making some models for a SEV that has interchangeable parts so it could be used for multiple mission profiles depending on what parts you choose (Rover, space station tug, crew transport, science vessel, etc). My goal with this is to have it completely modular among the parts made for it, as well as for the individual parts to be able to be used with the stock sizes through adapters if people wanted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpherical tanks - I\u0027ve been looking at some designs for radially mounted spherical tanks as well, also thinking about possibly custom mounts with included decouplers for those and the current models.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStructural components - I\u0027ve made up a set of structural girders to use in lieu of the stock ones. The core piece is exactly 1m long in game, and they are modular, so by reusing models I\u0027ve made configs to add lengths from 1m to 10m, and done a resize to add slimmer versions with half the length. I actually made these for my own personal use to decrease part counts, but they\u0027re pretty much ready for release if anyone is interested. I\u0027ll post screenshots later today.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see, lately I\u0027ve been kind of like a kid at the circus who wants to see EVERYTHING FIRST so can\u0027t get anything completed at all. I\u0027ve also been working on improving my texturing skills (which I\u0027m sure all will agree are probably my weakest skill when it comes to these parts). If you\u0027d like, I\u0027ll post renders of some of the stuff I\u0027ve been playing around with later on and see what you all would be most interested in first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*edit* I\u0027ve also been thinking that the current pack of spherical tanks grew a bit out of control with the amount of tanks that it adds due to the different resources. I think for future releases I\u0027ll pare it down to just LFO and Monopropellant for the core pack, and add download links on the main post for zips containing the cfgs and textures for additional resources.
