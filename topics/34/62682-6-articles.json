Also their close proximity makes it difficult to plan slingshot maneuvers with Jool and Hercules to further destinations. Maybe you can push the system back around 20-30 Gm further as well as Titan. Whether you want to do this or not is totally up to you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KingCam26","CreatedById":114266,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-03T01:33:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat angles do you need to do a transfer orbit from Kerbin to Hercules, and from Kerbin to Hypatos\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tychochallenge","CreatedById":85444,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-03T03:13:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KingCam26\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KingCam26\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhat angles do you need to do a transfer orbit from Kerbin to Hercules, and from Kerbin to Hypatos\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ein fact, Hohmann transfers would be more inefficient to traveling there, it would be better to get a fly by of jool, but then again hercules would need to be in the right position.
