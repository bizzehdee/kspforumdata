The feature was inspired by the Mouse Drive mod (and the fact that SAS doesn\u0027t work too well with FAR, so you want some kind of precise analog input for things like landing); however there are large differences in the interface. The general points are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E In order to enable mouse input it is necessary to activate the relevant option, and lock window positions so that dragging the mouse won\u0027t move the HUD window instead. In the options you can also switch whether the input would affect Pitch\u002BRoll (airplane) or Pitch\u002BYaw (rocket mode).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E The general metaphor is that you grab the \u0022--W--\u0022 thing in the center with the mouse and drag it in the direction where you want it to go. The actual sensitive area where the drag can start is significantly larger, but the current input value is always calculated from the relative position of the cursor to the center indicator. Since KSP interface is based on clicking and right-clicking buttons and things on the screen, I thought that the press and drag mode of operation is less confusing than the stateful toggle mode Mouse Drive is using. It also means that there is no need to suddenly disable input when the mouse leaves the \u0027proper\u0027 area; it can just be clamped to 100%.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E The feature is aimed at smooth high-precision input, so there is a large dead zone, and sensitivity is nonlinear, with significantly more precision near zero. When mouse input activates, a mark appears to show how the horizontal and vertical dead zone stripes meet in the center.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E If you hold right Ctrl when pressing the mouse down, the Pitch\u002BYaw vs Pitch\u002BRoll choice is temporarily reversed until you release the mouse. If you hold the modifier key (Left Alt or right Shift depending on os) as you \u003Cem\u003Erelease\u003C/em\u003E the mouse, the input is added to trim instead of simply being reset to zero. This trim feature allows easily releasing active control after guiding the plane into a stable mode.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Since SAS only reacts to actual user input as implemented by stock, and othewise suppresses any control input from plugin hooks, when it is active the mouse input switches to a different mode where it directly controls the orientation SAS tries to hold. A mark showing the current value of that orientation appears, and moving the mouse adjusts it on a rate of turn basis.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E When mouse input is enabled, a minimized form of HUD appears on all screens where HUD is not normally shown like map mode. In the passive state it consists only of the mouse input dead-zone crosshair, and pressing the mouse down directly over it activates mouse input and shows the pitch ladder and vectors. Setting HUD alpha to zero using the slider forces this minimized mode everywhere. The minimized mode HUD is always locked and cannot be moved.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, as another aid for landing at a specific spot, when you target a landed object, like for instance a flag you planted at the runway, the targeting data displayed by HUD is now computed differently based on surface speed, latitude, longitude and heading data (these are always valid for landed objects, unlike orbits which often don\u0027t make any sense). Relative inclination is actually difference in current and target heading, and closest approach is sea-level distance ignoring altitude of both objects.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"asdfCYBER","CreatedById":94319,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-28T16:02:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Egood! can the hud be toggled? if not: maybe the H?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Trueborn","CreatedById":65830,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-29T22:47:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe HUD can be toggled by the button in the Steamgauges main window.
