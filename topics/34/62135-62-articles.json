I have no problem with, and Naz and I actually tried to do DDS originally (I wanted to use DDS as opposed to TGAs). We weren\u0027t able to figure it out until someone suggested to change the referencing manually in the actual file.\u003Cp\u003ESo converting to DDS or any other texture compression standard isn\u0027t an issue and I encourage it. The issue is with the Alternate Texture download v1.13. That one is a fast solution that really just halves the texture sizes and it was designed for people that do not have the texture compression mod you are using. You then have folks that are using that texture set in addition to the texture compression mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m an avid supporter of the mod and many times brought it up to Naz that I wanted (and still want and may eventually) do away with the alternate texture download entirely. Folks that want the extra memory space will have to use the texture compression mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat being said I never wanted to distribute TGAs. I always wanted to use DDS\u0027s from the get go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[Edit] Had our experiments using DDS worked, you guys would have all been using the equivalent of the textures used by the texture compression mod on \u0022Aggressive\u0022 (I wanted to use DXT5 DDS).\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo having read this, I decided to take a look at the Active Texture Management plug-in. It\u0027s not exactly apparent how it works, but it supposedly converts all the textures you point it at to DDS (or DXT, not exactly sure since I\u0027m not familiar with the file format) but all the files it saves in its cache have no file extension. Maybe it\u0027d be possible to fork this plugin to allow your mod to use DDS natively? By default, the Active Texture Management plug-in halves everything, but correcting it to scale everything 1:1, it does compress your original kerbin_orbiter.tga from 16 MB to just shy of 6 MB as a DDS. According to the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.etc.cmu.edu/unity3d/index.php/Importing_Textures\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis Unity wiki\u003C/a\u003E, the engine doesn\u0027t support DDS, but apparently user rbray89 has figured something out.
