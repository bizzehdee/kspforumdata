I greatly appreciate the system you\u0027ve set up, the experiments and the parts you designed, but I think this mod would be much more useful if offered a slightly different approach to things. I realised that basically all the real station modules that have been up in space have been used for SCIENCE. And I think it would be nice to have options to start your Science Stations small, or to be able to expand them piece by piece, not requiring large additions of \u0026gt;2,5 m modules every time I want to add some more science capacity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it would be possible to add a ModuleManager script of some sort which would add eureka generation to all non-piloted crewed parts (e.g. not to capsules and cockpits, but to all Hitchikers and mod parts, airplane and spaceplane crew cabins, even orbital modules). This would allow the player to gradually build up the science generation capacities, even allow performing experiments while flying in atmosphere (I know doing science on Kerbin is something you discourage, but the concept of research airplanes seems to make sense to me).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, the amount of eurekas generated would be miniscule by comparison so that your original station part still has its use - there would be no other part which would allow 4 kerbals to generate that many eurekas.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI still don\u0027t know how to incorporate the Kibbal and Quark generation - and the Cyclotron and Biolab are parts I would esthetically appreciate during late game, but I can hardly bring myself to attaching them to basic MIR and ISS-style stations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you find this concept interesting at all?
