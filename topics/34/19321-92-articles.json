With this you could have better maneuverability at low altitude and better sensitivity during transonic and higher speeds at high altitudes or on other planets.

In those cases, you will only increase the number of things the user has to do to get what he wants (download and install two or three files instead of one) and you will possibly add more calculations to KSP because things overlap.
