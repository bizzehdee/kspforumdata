Farm always says \u0022no inputs\u0022 and Recycler always says \u0022no space\u0022.\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://i.imgur.com/FSFL0eJ.png](http://i.imgur.com/FSFL0eJ.png)\n\nOk first the simple things. in your second pic ignore the State: Not Enough Crew. Means nothing. As for Population you need to be making food (I know that is the problem) you also need space for civilians and a civilian dock to start building a civilian population. The population will not start making home grown civilians until you have 50 civilians onboard. Now for your not making food. I think it\u0027s 1 of a couple of problems. I don\u0027t know what gear your using as a center mount but make sure it has crossfeed. I put the same farming module you have with the same tank on top (full) with a batter on my runway and it makes food. I don\u0027t have some of your options so it could be mod related as I have no buttons for \u0022auto pump, balance, and pump options. So just try this ...farm, battery, small fertilizer tank, and a control module...put it on your runway and try to make food. That should tell you if it\u0027s a crossfeed or mod problem. As you can see from my pics this simple design works.\n\n![EQkdNEZ.png](http://i.imgur.com/EQkdNEZ.png)\n\n![Zrup2tO.png](http://i.imgur.com/Zrup2tO.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"michaelhester07","CreatedById":96470,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-19T22:12:33Z","Content":"From the pic your ship doesn\u0027t have any civilians onboard. You need a civilian dock in order to receive them while in kerbin\u0027s SOI. If you\u0027re outside kerbin space or don\u0027t have the civilian dock your population onboard will not start growing unless you have 50 or more civilians on the ship, assuming all of their needs are met.\n\nThe farm missing inputs... I\u0027d suspect something is incompatible as your ship has the biomass and water. The farm requires electric charge too (the stock one). Do you have another mod that uses either of these? There could be a resource definition clash.\n\nThe recycler missing inputs is usual. It takes waste and converts it to biomass. Since you have no civilians you\u0027re not getting any waste output.\n\nIt is also very likely if you activate more than one farm that one will be resource starved."},{"CreatedByName":"michaelhester07","CreatedById":96470,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-19T22:58:18Z","Content":"[https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_ag2O0IQABwaThQa05LakRIYlU/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_ag2O0IQABwaThQa05LakRIYlU/view?usp=sharing)\n\nHere\u0027s a craft file that shows a simple full working civilian loop. Craft needs Kerbal Engineer and Civilian Management, but is otherwise stock. It uses parts from a fairly deep tech tree so try it in sandbox or a fully unlocked career mode.\n\nIt can also qualify for a 5 man ground base or spacestation (6 crew capacity, power, docking port, antenna)\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
