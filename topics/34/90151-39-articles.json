Having some sort of additive value for multiple antenna seems absolutely necessary, as without it, the antenna with the greatest range wouldn\u0027t even be able to keep in contact with Mars at its greatest distance from Earth. But it just seems unrealistic that two dishes would give exactly twice the range of one of them. Or maybe it\u0027s not. I don\u0027t know.
