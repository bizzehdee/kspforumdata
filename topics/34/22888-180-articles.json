It\u0027s a very specific problem and, having attempted my own troubleshooting, I am entirely sure that it is not memory related. I hope someone will be able to help as it\u0027s a mod I really want to be able to make use of. I\u0027ll try to go into as much detail as I can about the issues I\u0027ve been having.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst things first, I\u0027m running KSP on a mid-2011 13-inch non-Retina Macbook Pro, currently running OSX 10.9 (Mavericks). I\u0027m using the version of KSP downloaded directly from Squad\u0027s own website.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI first started having issues when I first tried installing FASA. At that time I believed it was indeed a memory issue as this is a 32-bit build of KSP and not a 64-bit build. I therefore followed the instructions in the following video to convert the Mac OSX version of KSP to 64 bit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/sTtOy4tQzt4?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis has worked, and I\u0027ve been able to run KSP with plenty of texture-heavy parts mods installed with no issues - SpaceY, Infernal Robotics, B9 Aerospace, KW Rocketry, Lithobrake, etc etc. Just not FASA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe specific nature of the problem is a bit weird. I am able to take the pre-existing FASA save file and load any of the pre-saved vehicles just fine within the VAB - all the way up to the Nova, there\u0027s no issue loading these stacks. However, when I click \u0027launch\u0027, the game immediately crashes while still on the loading screen, and requires a Force Quit. There\u0027s only a couple of exceptions - the Mercury Redstone works fine as does the Explorer stack. Nothing besides that seems to work though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve used Activity Monitor to keep an eye on my RAM usage as this happens and, when FASA is the only mod I have loaded into the game, memory usage peaks at about 2.6GB. Even when FASA is the only mod loaded, though, these issues still occur. All this information put together has convinced me this is not a memory issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have looked at the changelog for FASA on kerbalstuff.com and I have tried three separate builds of FASA - 5.36, 5.35 and 5.30. The same issues occur in precisely the same manner in all of these builds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have tried a complete reinstall of KSP from scratch and re-added FASA to that new install, both in the 32 bit and 64 bit versions, and these issues persist in all circumstances.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a side-note, before I made the alterations to KSP such that it was running as a 64-bit app, I was still getting exactly the same issues. The only difference was that, in the 32-bit build, I was regularly getting crashes in the VAB as well as upon hitting the launch button. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan anyone help me out with this? It\u0027d be much appreciated as this mod looks amazing from everything I\u0027ve seen of it and I\u0027m itching to be able to use it - sadly, I just can\u0027t get it to work at all no matter what I try. I would hugely appreciate any insight any of you can provide.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StoryMusgrave","CreatedById":131938,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-02T12:35:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWithout a log file, people can only guess.
