It probably will, and means I will not have to worry about everyone laughing at my crappy control box (I am a coder at heart, not a modeller).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever this will not resolve the breaking of backwards compatibility I am afraid. The issue is that version 0.0.3 would store the vector from the part to the target CoM location after making the assumption that the vessel was pointing up (and trying to take account of this in the SPH where the vessel is not pointing up. However this did not really work, especially if you started rotating the whole vessel in the VAB or moved a vessel from SPH to VAB, (ie a rover), rotated it and mounted it on a launcher. So in version 0.0.4 it store the orientation of the part and the vector to the target CoM, so you can rotate your vessel all you like and it works. If I was willing to put more effort in I could have written code to attempt to migrate, but it probably would not work for all scenarios - I will give it a go for the next release, so not all is lost (in space!).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother reason for keeping my ribbish control box is so that you can mount more than on on a vessel. I have discovered that this is quite handy for my universal tug / lander that can carry payloads either ontop or slung underneath (for landing) or have none. I can have two sets of RCS (ie the classic 2 rings of 4 4way thrusters) and use an action group to turn them on or off, which give me three locations for the CoM (either set or both together), and therefore I have 3 of my control units and be able to use one of them to balance the vessel even when I have lots of differing irregular payloads.
