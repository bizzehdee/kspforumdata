If you follow your launches you can how much off the mark the time to apoasis is, having it higher usually just means full throttle all the way. For example, very rarely you will even have a higher than time for AP than 20s below 15km altitude, unless on a very high thrust ballistic missile.

In the first picture here you can see the apoapsis is near the 30s but not quite there, yet still full throttle, but when it will reach it will start throttling back, however the time to APO target is also varying as it goes through. My thinking is that the optimal delta-v usage is achieve by having the least throttle that still gets you to orbit (literally doesn\u0027t fall short), the default suggested values work very well for this (constant 50s time for APO), the one I picked above was a bit too short for me, but one like 30s initial ~120s terminal should work as well with the caveat of being a more sub-orbital trajectory, on the other hand a inverted value alike \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/128005-ohiobob/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022128005\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/128005-ohiobob/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@OhioBob\u003C/a\u003E suggest is interesting to ensure thrust initially but fine curvature at the end of the ascent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe mess with my rocket above was because I was experimenting with two different versions of it, both a sort of asparagus staging, but one with crossfeed enabled, the other with direct fuel lines, the difference being that, the crossfeed one the lateral engines would still keep burning with their tanks empty, but as soon as noticed the throttling back (due to lower time for APO) I could drop the stage dead weight with it (as now I didn\u0027t need the extra thrust), the difference was just a few seconds apart, so I figured it wouldn\u0027t have that much, but indeed that little bit extra thrust time could make a difference between making it to orbit or not. Eitherway I digress, my point is just that throttling back could prove beneficial in the case of excessive drag, I think the mod does take drag into consideration but still makes a bit a bad guess on how steep it needs to go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EAnyway,\u003C/strong\u003E completely unrelated to discussion above, but I had another crash, seems to me related to the mod and memory leak.
