However, if you simply compress the original, it will typically in the the region of 6MB - 10MB. Compressing the low-res will be smaller again, but I\u0027d actually recommend that you try switching to the highres packs for everything, since one of the features of aggressive is that it will resize larger textures down (selectively, the individual mod config files can control this), so starting with the high res stuff and seeing what happens should go okay, and minimize the drop in (or even potentially improve) graphics quality.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: It is completely safe to just install aggressive over the top of basic - it is only going the other way that you would need to delete the texture cache to re-allow the loading of the original textures.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-28T11:11:10Z\u0022 title=\u002203/28/2014 11:11  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 28, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Crater\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rbray89","CreatedById":48847,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-28T15:53:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Green Skull\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Green Skull\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAm using the experimental version now on my personal install and I\u0027m having absolutely no problems so far - a couple of minor tweaks to my configs but only to optimise my game how I like it.
