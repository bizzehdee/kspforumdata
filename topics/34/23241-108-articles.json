Sure, I suppose a few people may have installed some things in the wrong place, or not properly updated all of the plugins, etc., but I can assure you that I have everything installed correctly, including the reduced texture pack, and I\u0027m still having problems. And the sheer number of crash reports since the new version came out should indicate that not all is well in B9 land, at the very least, and they can\u0027t ALL be \u0027user error\u0027, I should think.

After updating B9, I was using MJ dev build 84, crashed. After a few tries, I thought maybe it was MJ, so I reverted to build 83. Kept crashing. Went back to 82, which was working fine for me before updating B9, still crashing. Last night I went all the way back to Sarbian\u0027s hot fix from September, same problems. So tonight I\u0027m going to revert B9 back to 3.4 and go back to MJ 84, or whatever the newest build available is, and I\u0027ll bet you a dollar that it stops crashing. Again, this isn\u0027t an indictment of B9, I think it\u0027s just one of those software things where MJ and B9 conflict somehow.

But Taverius, it\u0027s not very constructive to call us all stupid because we\u0027ve started having problems since installing R4.0c. Sure, I suppose a few people may have installed some things in the wrong place, or not properly updated all of the plugins, etc., but I can assure you that I have everything installed correctly, including the reduced texture pack, and I\u0027m still having problems. And the sheer number of crash reports since the new version came out should indicate that not all is well in B9 land, at the very least, and they can\u0027t ALL be \u0027user error\u0027, I should think. So, maybe take another look at B9 from your end? That\u0027s all we\u0027re asking for, man. \u003Cp\u003EAnyway, here\u0027s my experience. I, like several others, have been experiencing crashes when going from launch to VAB, SPH, etc. But I\u0027ve also had several crashes when flying with MechJeb as well, and I can only surmise that R4.0c and MechJeb don\u0027t \u0027work and play well together\u0027. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E I\u0027m not assigning blame to one or the other, I\u0027m just suggesting that this may be a place to start investigating. After updating B9, I was using MJ dev build 84, crashed. After a few tries, I thought maybe it was MJ, so I reverted to build 83. Kept crashing. Went back to 82, which was working fine for me before updating B9, still crashing. Last night I went all the way back to Sarbian\u0027s hot fix from September, same problems. So tonight I\u0027m going to revert B9 back to 3.4 and go back to MJ 84, or whatever the newest build available is, and I\u0027ll bet you a dollar that it stops crashing. Again, this isn\u0027t an indictment of B9, I think it\u0027s just one of those software things where MJ and B9 conflict somehow. I\u0027m sure we\u0027ll get it figured out, it\u0027ll just take a little time. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, Taverius, I know you\u0027re frustrated, and I don\u0027t blame you, dude. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E So are we, and we\u0027re all just trying to fix the problem, it\u0027s not a personal attack, \u0027k? \u0027K.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@Neutrinovore,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou are running out of memory, what you described is exactly what happens when KSP hits the 4 gig limit, its actually around 3.6. They added quite a bit more parts to the B9 pack in the new update and the reduced textures don\u0027t seem to be enough to compensate. You can find out how much memory KSP is using by going to the task Manager while the game is open or the equivalent for Mac and OSX, go to the processes tab, find KSP and look at the number next to it, it should be 7 digits long, mine starts at the 2,700,000k or thereabouts when at the game start menu. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou need to check this number regularly at different points in the game if you are experiencing crashing, the start menu, the Space center screen, when in the VAB or SPH, when on the launch pad, and right before finishing a mission. The number should be at its largest right before you are finishing a mission, if the number shows 3,700,000k give or take 100,000k or so, your game will crash, lock up, or generally be highly unstable at this point. For those who don\u0027t know yet, It doesn\u0027t matter how much RAM you have in your computer, this is a hardwired number that is part of KSP, its a software limitation not a hardware limitation, if you do not understand the difference you probably shouldn\u0027t be modding this game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts probably been said somewhere before but I will say it here again, KSP has a mod limit, that limit is memory and every mod out there takes bits of that memory, B9 is a hefty one, mostly because of part count and probably some from the other features, animated parts, the MFDs in the cockpits, and so on. Think of it like a 20 gallon gas tank, you put in 15 gallons (B9 pack), you only have 5 gallons left before the tank overflows and douses you with flammable liquid. Each and every mod takes memory, its not just part count that takes that memory its just a big one, im betting things like computing physics or automating something take quite a bit of memory, I heard that Ferram Aerospace mod is a memory hog and yet it adds no parts to the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t see anywhere in the above post by Taverius where he called anyone stupid. He probably is frustrated, considering many people new to the game post their problem before doing any research what so ever, and just 5 minutes of reading would have showed them their issue and probably a lot of ways to fix it. If you are modding a game you should know what you are getting yourself into, do your research!! Watch several tutorial videos by different people, and maybe learn to make your own mod so you can see the other side of things. If you don\u0027t know how to mod a game, look for your problem with that mod first before posting it, most forums have a known bugs section and some modders put them on their front page. You could also use Google or another search engine to find your problem. If that is too much for you I recommend you go back to stock and stop trying to mod your game, modding requires work from both the mod dev and the mod user.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease remember these modders are doing this for free, they are doing something they enjoy and want to share it with others, they don\u0027t \u003Cem\u003Ehave\u003C/em\u003E to fix the mod because it doesn\u0027t work for you, but most do because they want to and they want you to enjoy their mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: @Bac9 or Taverios,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just noticed Bac9s post that said this mod peaked at 2.2Gb mem usage, is there a way to determine how much memory a mod uses at peak, any mod, because that would make things a lot easier on determining what mods we want in our lineup. Iv been trying to trim my part usage so I could have B9 in my lineup but if its taking that much room by itself I may have to nix it altogether, I love the pack, but I don\u0027t make a whole lot of space planes or jets and most of the parts don\u0027t seem practical for me. Plus there are other mods id like to use and if B9 is that big, it pretty much means no other mods but this one.
