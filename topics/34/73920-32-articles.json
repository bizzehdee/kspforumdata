I just feel for me having every repair only be an engineer makes all the other classes obsolete. I mean once I have a probe core I slap that on everything for sas and I have no problem with gaining science without scientists resetting anything. So I have no use for anything other than an engineer after getting a probe core. I want to make it so any class that is level 1 can repair med priority failures and take most of the engineer exclusivity away. I know this is mainly a stock issue as the whole class system is just about useless beside engineers as their ability are the only ones not replaced by mods or stock(add more science experiments. Don\u0027t need scientists or just use stock probes. Don\u0027t need pilots).
