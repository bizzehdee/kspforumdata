For MOL there were various configurations planned, each allowing different kinds of science to be done. That\u0027s why I suggest modularizing your MOL components. This would prepare the mod for the next update, allowing different kinds of science being done based on the modules and it\u0027d allow for more variety in MOL designs. The Air Force/NASA hoped to put multiple MOLs into orbit, each doing something different. The image above shows some of the layouts. It includes a telescope module (telescope parts in KSP will be used to discover all the planets and moons), earth resources module (short-range science gathering), habitat module (basically the Hitchhiker), a biological lab (could work similar to the science bay part we\u0027ve seen in KSP Weekly two weeks ago) and an equipment module (RCS and rocket fuel). Making it modular would also make the design below possible. You\u0027d simply need two of the 2.5 to 2.75 adapters (which could also act as the decoupler that separates the Gemini craft from the MOL), an equipment module and a habitat module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/Big_Gemini.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Big_Gemini.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"frizzank","CreatedById":57210,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-02T02:42:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat\u0027s why I suggest modularizing your MOL components.

The basic MOL configuration would only need four unique parts, with only one of those perhaps having an IVA: an adapter/decoupler (2.5 to however wide your MOL is), a habitat module, an equipment module (RCS/fuel) and an experiment module. With those parts you can make the design below. Don\u0027t know how much time you have for this, but if you make it modular from the start it save time if you ever want to expand MOL.
