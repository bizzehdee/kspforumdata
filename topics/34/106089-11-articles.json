So when it says 0.5 ore turns into 0.45/0.55 LF/Ox, it really means 1 unit of ore turns into 1 unit of LF/Ox mix. When it is doing single outputs (LF, or monoprop, or oxidizer) the input ore is only half of the output.\n\nStrangely, this means that Ore can turn into ANYTHING. It can all turn into LF, or it can all turn into Oxidizer, or it can all turn into monoprop, or it can turn into any mix of those, and mass is completely conserved. Obviously the ISRU is powered by electrical charge and dark magic.\n\nSo if mass is still being conserved, then 1 unit of ore should turn into 1 unit of oxidizer or 1 unit of LH/OX mix (by mass). So you need to know the ratio of density between LH and OX, and then the rest is just algebra."},{"CreatedByName":"Hoddd9000","CreatedById":142572,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T08:02:09Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Hoddd You could always re-write the configs on your end, there\u0027s only six engines.

What would it look like for straight Hydrogen?\n\nMy problem is that Interstellar Fuel Switch breaks the tanks in the game BUT KSP also breaks if this (Cryoengines) mod is installed and not IFS. If I can run the game without IFS, everything will work fine. I will try that, thank you.\n\nEDIT: FOUND A THING!!!!! If I delete Patches/CroenginesFuelTankSwitcher (which seems to be what forces the game to use IFS as mentioned above) and Interstellar Fuel Switch, I can probably run the game without IFS.\n\nAlso, what would happen if I put the LFO .cfg in the CryoEngines/Patches folder instead of in its own GameData file (excuse my stupidity if that\u0027s where it was supposed to go in the first place)? So much testing to be done!![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nEDIT2: YEEEEEEEEESSSS!!! It worked! I can now enjoy the beauty of these amazing engines ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-18T08:32:25Z\u0022 title=\u002206/18/2015 08:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Hoddd9000**"},{"CreatedByName":"Starbuckminsterfullerton","CreatedById":117494,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T00:13:40Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E For some reason, the input flow is half of the output flow. So when it says 0.5 ore turns into 0.45/0.55 LF/Ox, it really means 1 unit of ore turns into 1 unit of LF/Ox mix. When it is doing single outputs (LF, or monoprop, or oxidizer) the input ore is only half of the output.\n\u003E \n\u003E So if mass is still being conserved, then 1 unit of ore should turn into 1 unit of oxidizer or 1 unit of LH/OX mix (by mass). So you need to know the ratio of density between LH and OX, and then the rest is just algebra.\n\nI assumed the input/output difference was accounted for in the ore resource def; I never actually checked. \n\nThat\u0027s about what I did for my ratios though, I saw that the outputs added up to 1 unit, and adjusted for the hydrolox ratios. I added .1 so the ratio would be exact, thinking if there are already some mass shenanigans going on a little extra for precision\u0027s sake wouldn\u0027t hurt. Definitely room for improvement..."}]}
