Finally, after being able to duplicate the crashes, (they are pretty consistent, though WHEN they will crash is a bit less so.), it comes down to MJ and FASA/ESA not playing nicely together. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESymptoms: When adding MJ202-AR case to any craft while FASA is installed, hard CTD. Adding any FASA part to a craft while MJ parts or embedded MJ functionality is installed varies... leads to either hard CTD or *MASSIVE* VAB lag. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was duplicated numerous times. I will get a crash log when I have time to, if you need it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-31T01:19:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBug in MechJeb. I can confirm that both RPM and reflection plugins work, and this is all FASA adds. ESA pack is pluginless. Since RPM integration is MJ-side, take it to MechJeb thread.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
