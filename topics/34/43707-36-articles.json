Thanks to the new update I was able to create the best criteria that I can think of for getting a rocket to the correct (and nearly perfect) circular orbit! Here is a list of the implementations I have added to my launcher that I set out to accomplish:\u003Cp\u003EDuring the vertical ascent and beginning the gravity turn: I created a loop between ground and 25,000m that adjusts the throttle so the craft is always flying at terminal velocity. This from what I have read is the most optimal solution.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce desired circular orbit altitude has been reached: I created a control logic that keeps slightly adjusting the apogee during atmospheric ascent. This produces consistent results of the apogee being within 10m of desired circular orbit altitude. Example: if I set my desired circular orbit to 100km the biggest difference I have seen is 100,010m.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpon reaching apoapsis and beginning burn to circularize orbit: I created a control logic that adjust the angle of the burn so the craft is always behind or at the apoapsis until the vehicle reaches the appropriate orbital velocity. With arcsin arccos and arctan functions (which I hope will be implemented! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E ) I can make the logic more concrete and physics based.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am really proud of it and I wanted to show it off for people to see and comment on it. If you have any questions, comments, or what to know more feel free to ask. Also if you have any other challenges you think I can take up please let me know!
