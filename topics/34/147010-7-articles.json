so back up your saves, as something may break (at the very least I think it may trigger a budget straight away).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs I re-wrote a big chunk of the mod, I\u0027m expecting something to not be working properly that I\u0027ve missed, hence the pre-release.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo far, no issues, seems to work as expected!\u00A0The only thing I noticed was that the Big Project Fund amount doesn\u0027t need to display more than 2 decimal places. Will run through a few more months and see if anything goes off the rails.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"severedsolo","CreatedById":80345,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-06T12:32:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223166219\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022147010\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221504692857\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022163218\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Jade_Falcon\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, Jade_Falcon said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo far, no issues, seems to work as expected!\u00A0The only thing I noticed was that the Big Project Fund amount doesn\u0027t need to display more than 2 decimal places.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAh yes, I always forget that Funding is a double, when the game displays it as an int.
