What if the g\u0027s drain a new resource. Ah let me start over.\n\nYou lose control of a craft if the probe runs out of electricity. You dont have this problem with manned flights. What if the g forces could drain a new type of resource, that if drained would make you lose control of the craft until the resource came back.\n\nFor example pulling too high g\u0027s will lead to the resource rapidly draining. When drained. You cant control the craft.

In the source code it is called \u0022cumulativeG\u0022. It \u0022accumulates\u0022 the harm of g forces applied to a kerbal. When it is high enough, the black/red out starts, if rises further then the kerbal loses consciousness and control. When the g forces go down it \u0022replenishes\u0022 at some rate.
