The first part of the video was doing a comparison of the old version (that didn\u0027t work properly) then the new version that works much better. I also don\u0027t think that the high altitude deceleration you are talking about in the video is KSP relative. The Apollo capsule hits the dense atmosphere then raises back up; that is not the same as setting a high PE and decelerating in the thin atmosphere. The video indicates they get to 2.5g before pulling up. In KSP if you hit 2.5g you have pretty much stopped already.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do think though that the atmospheric model is still not 100% even with FAR.
