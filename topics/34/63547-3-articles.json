Turbos are nothing more than exhaust gas driven compressors. They can increase the air pressure inside the intake manifold to above ambiant pressure to maintain or increase power with a good air to fuel ratio (usually around 14.7:1). A supercharger works pretty much the sameway but is mechanically driven and often robs power from the engine because of the mechanical linkage to the engine to work the compressor blades. Granted it isn\u0027t a great deal of power loss compaired to the power gains. But superchargers have a much more straight power curve than a turbocharger. But you have several types of superchargers and really only one type of turbo. There are twin screw, centrifigual, and roots style superchargers.

Isp for jet engines is defined based on mass flow of fuel. The ModuleEngines and ModuleEnginesFX code defines Isp based on total mass flow through the engine. So due to the difference in the definition of Isp used in real life (which was also used for specifying the jet\u0027s Isps) and the definition of Isp used by the ModuleEngines code, the code is burning 1/16 the amount of fuel it should be burning, since it\u0027s counting the mass flow of air in the calculations even though that\u0027s supposed to be taken for granted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe error is due to the fact that the Isp numbers reported by the jet engines(stock at least) are bogus.

RPM doesn\u0027t exists. The thrust is calculated according to the power-thrust relationship mentioned in the material I linked in the OP. Power is a constant value. Propeller efficiency is 85% at \u0026gt;40m/s. Below 40m/s the thrust is linear to speed. \u003Cp\u003EIn reality how does power change with altitude?

In a plane you choose a fixed RPM (maximum torque) and change your speed by changing manifold pressure and propellor pitch. An increase in altitude makes a supercharger running at low gear less efficient, you see a drop in manifold pressure. That\u0027s why they used gears to increase the RPM of the supercharger above a certain altitude. The turbocharger provides a near constant boost from sea level all the way up, until max RPM is reached (around 10K during the 1940\u0027s) after which manifold pressure dropped as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am not sure if I said it in my previous post but each style of supercharger is different in how it creates boost and when. A twin screw setup is very flat and controled and will go up with the RPM of the engine till it reaches its max gear limited speed. The Roots style is very much like the twinscrew but suffers from a much lower top end production of boost than the twin screw.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Centrifugal is very much like a turbo, and many WWII aircraft used this style of supercharger as it was the smallest most compact design but has a very sharp power curve. Which can be akin to the turbo lag of a turbocharged engine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the topic of these engines, I feel I may have to alter the cfgs in this mod because after doing some more reading I confirmed what I had feared, the engines in this are outdated in specs. The current as of 1989 PW-F100-229 which is used by the F-15E and the F-16s now creates 80kn of dry thrust and nearly 130kn of thrust in afterburner. And the F119s create to little thrust also, they are listed at over 150kn of thrust in afterburner.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have also run into another issue. My test aircraft I mounted a SABRE S engine on it. I know they are not fully supported yet but I can repeat the same problem with the Turbojet/ramjet. I climb under the power of the two F100s to my test altitude of 10-15km ASL. I then level off to level flight, and accelerate to 300m/s or better on the F100s, engage the SABRE-S or the turbojet engine. They both create power as the aircraft accelerates till it hits mach 1.7-1.9. Then they begin to sharply drop off in power. So bad in fact that it begins to slow down the aircraft and that reduces the power created by those engines. I have tried switching over to closed cycle on the SABRE-S and using it as a rocket to accelerate passed mach 3, and then switch over to the jet mode again, and it goes from creating over 200kn of thrust to less than 10kn of thrust. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI use a pair of divertless intakes on the sides of the body of the aircraft as a source for air for the engines. The airflow speed on inlet is over 600m/s when the ramjet or the SABRE is engaged in open cycle.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-02T16:01:46Z\u0022 title=\u002203/02/2014 04:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 2, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Hodo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kellven","CreatedById":16971,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-02T18:40:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOnly read the Op, and the one above, just wanted to mention a couple things.
