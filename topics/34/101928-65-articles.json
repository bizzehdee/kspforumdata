It doesn\u0027t matter how many children the part has. When you press H the two parts to be separated (parent and child) should both be highlighted in blue.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Need a little help here. Yesterday I practiced building a rover and base on the launch pad. Everything went well. I launched a supply ship to the Mun and then followed with a manned lander.\n\u003E When my Kerbals (Bob and Bill) reached the lander, neither of them was able to attach one part to another. They could bring things out and drop them on the ground, but not attach them to each other. \n\u003E \n\u003E I had messed around with the Traits file in GamePlay/Squad/Experience, so I figured that might be the cause of the trouble. I exited the game to restore the file to its original settings, but that did not help.\n\u003E \n\u003E Can anyone tell me what the trouble is and/or what I\u0027m doing wrong here?\n\nThe easiest wait to allow pilots/scientists to use tools is to edit the tool\u0027s part file and comment out the repair skil requirement. In terms of your install either re download KSP or copy the files from a clean install (I strongly recommend that everyone keep a clean install for this purpose. It\u0027s also great for keeping older versions of KSP)."},{"CreatedByName":"Odyssey","CreatedById":28858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-06T23:13:26Z","Content":"\u003E The easiest wait to allow pilots/scientists to use tools is to edit the tool\u0027s part file and comment out the repair skil requirement.
