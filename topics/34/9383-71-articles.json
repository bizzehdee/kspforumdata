Let me just clarify that while watching my Task Manager, ISA MapSat always skyrockets my physical memory usage to about 38% - 40% capacity, in my case this is around the neighborhood of 3,000,000 K (around 5.0 GBs give or take. I will usually experience crashing situations when my memory hits about 3,900,000 K or beyond (around 5.5 GBs).

Still very stable, no CTDs to report.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP w\\ KSPX Parts Expansion, NovaPunch 2.02, and B9 Aerospace Pack - Memory usage signifigantly spiked with the addition of B9, right around the neighborhood of around 2,700,000 K. There was on instance of a CTD during my transition from VAB to Space Port, but no others the hour after that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP w\\ KSPX, NovaPunch 2.02, B9 Aerospace, and Kosmos Space Station Parts Pack - This increased memory usage to the neighborhood of 2,900,000 K. CTDs were more prevalent after the addition of Kosmos, roughly once every 10 - 15 minutes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP w\\ KSPX, NovaPunch 2.02, B9 Aerospace, Kosmos, and Kerbal Engineer Redux v0.6.1.1 - No major increase in memory usage.

Still around 2,900,000 K of memory in use according to Task Manager. CTDs still happening due to addition of the other mods. No reason to believe this mod causes crashes. Will test individually upon request.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP w\\ KSPX, NovaPunch 2.02, B9 Aerospace, Kosmos, Kerbal Engineer, Chatterer v0.5, and ISA MapSat 4.0 Dev Build - Immediate crash to desktop upon launching craft equipped with ISA GPS and ISA Dish. Memory spikes to around 3,900,000 K, sometimes surpassing 4,000,000 K (approx 5.50 - 5.75 GBs of RAM).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I am using now, and have not had ANY CTDs at this time since I\u0027ve started:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSPX Expansion Parts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENovaPunch 2.02\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Engineer Redux v.0.6.1.1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChatterer v0.5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EISA MapSat 4.0 Dev Build\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe above combination has my phyiscal memory usage at approx 3,300,000 K. To test, I left a MapSat running last night when I went to my girlfriends house and when I returned this morning 6 hours later, it was still running perfectly. Also, please note I updated the map resolution in the Kerbalpedia section to 720 from 200. I navigated around the game very comfortably also with no CTDS (navigated from VAB to Space Port, SpacePort to Tracking Station, ect.). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in summary, I removed B9 and Kosmos and the removal of these two seems to have freed up a lot of system resources to be used with KSP. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust wanted to share with everyone. Please feel free to shoot any questions my direction!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tiron","CreatedById":51836,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-08T06:48:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TheCrows1\u0022 data-cite=\u0022TheCrows1\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E*A lot of stuff*\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EParts packs are generally the biggest memory hogs, because the thing that really seems to cause memory hoggage is textures.
