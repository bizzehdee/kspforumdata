Curiosity question. Should the H-1 engine be more efficient than the RL-10? For grins I put them on the Centaur plate and got better efficiency out of them (I did have to enable collision avoidance during construction to pull this off.) I get that the INITIAL RL-10-RD-xx variants were not as efficient as the H-1 (hence the sub out of the J-2 and H-1s for the RL-10s on various Saturn proposals.)

I had the \u0022gemini Lander\u0022 stage below it with spearatrons so that when I was less than 50m above Mun surface I kicked it to the side and had just enough time to maintain my typical 3.5m/s landing speed.

Co-incidentally even though I no longer run B9 Aerospace, the standard Airbrake is a common fixture in my game now (created my own folder for such gems.) If you are putting the Air break on your capsule FLIP it UPSIDE DOWN because otherwise it will point your Capsule NOSE FIRST.... (Ignore this for Winged Gemini/) While I don\u0027t use Deadly Re-entry or similar mods, I DO like my capsule to fly properly. Two on the Gemini Capsule does amazing and since it unlocks before the Drogue chute, I use them (1 pair) as a drogue chute analog for my Gemini capsules.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pappystein","CreatedById":85755,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-23T07:37:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NathanKell\u0022 data-cite=\u0022NathanKell\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAll RL-10s ever were about 1.5x as efficient as the H-1 on its best day.\u003Cp\u003EEven the early prototype RL-10s got ~420-430s vacuum, and later got to 440 or more.
