It only occurs after several hours of play. It occurs at the point of scene change from Space Center to R\u0026amp;D and once it has ensued it seems to carry over (sometimes) to any scene change from Space Center to any of the other scenes.

Mouse moving can cause the Tech Tree and other R\u0026amp;D visual elements to flicker in and out of visibility briefly; clicking on the graphics for the other centers does not allow you to transfer to them like you would if you were actally in Space Center.

It would be nice at some point to have a friendlier way of displaying the procedural parts inventory figures in the GUI, because it does look a bit strange with two of this and a million of that. Maybe some kind of scientific notation for such parts, e.g. \u00222.6E5 mat.\u0022, to indicate a large number of \u0027material\u0027 present.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: Please chime in with a good and simple notation for procedural parts stored as material by fund value [my notation above isn\u0027t really that good].\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSounds interesting that the sim-debris can spill over to the inventory.
