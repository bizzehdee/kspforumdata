First off, the mistake was mine... though, I can imagine others making the same one. Perhaps my confusion is borne not just from the contract text but also from the part description in the VAB. If the VAB / SPH part text could read something along the lines of, for the test module, \u0022This module can of course be permanently attached to a station or non-Kerbin base for ongoing Science gains, if its prerequisite accoutrements are also provided. That said, most contracts involving this piece call for new modules to be custom-launched and manually landed back at Kerbin for retrieval in order to discharge them -- be sure to pay keen attention to the exat details-text of the contract for further guidance. This is because MisterFister Laboratories advises us that sometimes we just cannot trust the reported observations of snack-addled kerbonauts in orbit, even if they manually extract the findings-payload from this pod and return it that way so as to continue reusing the pod for future contracts or ongoing research; the actual module-pod itself is needed by the contract sponsor back on Kerbin in order to confirm findings for certain types of research projects. NOTE: When launching these modules for contracts, be sure to use the staging function to activate your initial launch stage, INSTEAD of right-clicking or action-group-toggling the launch engines.
