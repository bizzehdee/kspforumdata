Our scientists have found two experiments that will return useful data from the resulting explosion.\n\nThis mod has two new science parts, the Bangometer (seismometer) and flashometer (spectrometer) as well as contracts for performing experiments with them.\n\n**Bangometer**\n\n![o52ZsHQl.png](http://i.imgur.com/o52ZsHQl.png)\n\nThe bangometer is available in the Space Exploration tech tree node\n\nThis experiment will analyse the seismic waves generated by an impact in order to get information about the interior of the body.\n\n1. Land a vessel with a bangometer anywhere on the surface of an atmosphereless body.\n2. Crash a second craft into the body as hard as you can. (You must be controlling this craft until impact.)\n3. Switch back to the landed craft. There will now be an experiment registered in the bangometer.\n4. Recover or transmit the result back to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\n![b4Z9GqY.png](http://i.imgur.com/b4Z9GqY.png)\n\nA seismic study on the Mun\n\nThe amount of science resulting from an impact is proportional to the kinetic energy of the impact. Once you have acheived a high enough energy to get the maximum science no more impact will give any further data.\n\n**Flashometer**\n\n![2ASmPTzl.png](http://i.imgur.com/2ASmPTzl.png)\n\nThe flashometer is available in the advanced exploration node\n\nThis experiment analyses the spectrum of radiation emitted by the debris thrown up by an impact\n\n1. Put a vessel with a Flashometer in low orbit around an atmosphereless body.\n2. Crash a second craft into the body. (You must be controlling this craft until impact).\n3. The craft with the Flashometer must be above the horizon in order that it can see the ejecta.\n4. Switch back to the orbiting craft. There will now be an experiment registered in the flashometer.\n5. Recover or transmit the result back to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\nThe science from this experiment is not related to the impact speed (although there is a minimum energy in order to create the debris). The science is linked to the biome in which the impactor crashed and is repeatable for each biome.\n\n![WSrzImI.png](http://i.imgur.com/WSrzImI.png)\n\n**Career mode**\n\nIn career mode you will be given contracts to perform impacts on bodies you have previously visited. Both are completed by receiving the required data back at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. Bangometer contracts will specify a minimum kinetic energy required to complete the contract (KE=1/2mv^2^). Flashometer contracts specify a minimum latitude where the impact has to occur.\n\n**Asteroids**\n\nThe Flashometer (spectrograph) can analyse impacts into asteroids if it is with 500km of the impact. As with the other experiments you should control the impactor until the moment of impact. Don\u0027t try to crash at to high a speed as it is quite easy to simply pass through the centre of an asteroid without triggering the KSP collision code.\n\nChangeLog\n\nv 1.8.0 Support for KSP 1.8\n\nv 1.6.4 Fix bug generating spectrometer contracts for outer bodies\n\nv 1.6.3 Support KSP 1.4\n\nv 1.6.1 Support nationalization and fix smaller impacts sometimes overwriting bigger ones\n\nv 1.6.0 Support KSP 1.3\n\nv 1.5.1 Fix the bug that prevented impacts near the instrument from registering\n\nv 1.5.0 support KSP 1.2\n\nv1.4.3 - minor fix to display asteroid orbing body in contracts.\n\nv1.4.2 for KSP 1.1 is released - see download links below\n\n         V 1.3.0\n\n- Support for KSP 1.0.5\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E V 1.2.0\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E - Automatically reveal the name of asteroids subject to new contracts\n\u003E - Track asteroids for accepted contracts to prevent despawning\n\u003E - Add MiniAVC plugin to track versioning\n\u003E - \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nTo celebrate Asteroid day Impact! now includes asteroid impacts.\n\nAll code is released under the apache license included.

However universally it\u0027s a pretty dull process; you just put some tiny things on your ship and click on them when you go to a new area. This adds a big dimension to that process and it\u0027s a very fun one. Setting up to collect data from an impactor; getting the sensor in place on the ground, making sure you\u0027ve got orbital LoS and then of course the awesome part - intentionally crashing stuff into the ground at the highest velocity possible. \n\nOn my recent Duna mission I ejected the transit/deceleration segment of my ship a bit early and built it with a drone module and a battery on it. That way I could slam that bugger into the planet and collect data both from the guy in the lander and the orbital return module with the spectrometer. \n\nSure, I had a thermometer, seismic sensor and such on the lander but, well, so what? Getting science that way is less involved than opening/closing solar panels. \n\nAwesome mod.
