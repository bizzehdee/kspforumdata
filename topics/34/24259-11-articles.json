And squad can\u0027t just change how the decoupler fairings work. Why? Because they\u0027re created from the engines, not the decouplers. Changing this would involve placing a decoupler on a node placed some distance under a tank, which then creates a fairing, and then placing an egnine cluster inside. This would also be wonky, as fairins would now have a set legth, and long engines might not fit, and small engines would look awkward with so much empty space. The easiest thing to do is to use Procedural Fairings, unless Kommitz is willing to redo the engines completely. Why would he have to redo them completely, you ask? Well, to avoid making 12 new engines (every combination of baseplate and engine, not counting those already made and the ones where the baseplate would be too small for the engines), he\u0027d have to create five base-plate parts, and remove the baseplates from the engines. Since the baseplates are baked into the engines, he\u0027d have to do some drastic changes to the engine models, and a re-export.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL;DR, install procedural fairings, problem solved.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Surefoot","CreatedById":89084,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-27T18:37:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022wasmic\u0022 data-cite=\u0022wasmic\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ETL;DR, install procedural fairings, problem solved.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot totally true: this doesnt replace 3.75m and 5m engines (which would have scaled properties from the current 2.5m series, with further weight of course).
