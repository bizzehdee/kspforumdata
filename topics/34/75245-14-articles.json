At least in a way that is simple and requires no maintenance. At this stage I\u0027m thinking of three highly elliptical orbits that are 120 degrees apart.

Fact is, it is obtained by using 24 GNSS satellites as comms relays, each one equipped with just one Communotron 32 Omni. As everybody knows, Global Navigation Satellite Systems provide for continuous coverage with at least 4 satellites in every spot of the globe (and generally there are about 8-10 always above the horizon); so I can assure the comms capability is highly redundant. The picture shows my network around Kerbin, apart from some KSO satellites with dishes, there are those 24 satellites placed in 4 orbital planes in circular orbits at 1588 Km altitude, 55\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 inclination.

But you are neglecting to realize that the player base for this mod is ALREADY strapped for understanding of how to do these things to this level of precision, or are unwilling to expend that much effort. You don\u0027t need to explain to me in rigorous detail HOW to do it. I \u003Cem\u003Eknow\u003C/em\u003E how to do it already. But the problem isn\u0027t knowing how to do it, it\u0027s whether one feels it is worth the expended effort to do it if they also know they\u0027ll have to tweak it, no matter how long down the line. Yes, it may drift over a longer period of time than most orbits, but when it comes time to \u0027fix\u0027 the phase angles, does the player really want to drop whatever else they\u0027re doing to do a tedious maintenance task?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s the dividing line between what is fun, and what is retentive tedium that becomes the problem here. I could, with some work, likely get my constellation into lockstep like a champ. I did it once before just to prove to myself it could be done, but it\u0027s not something I want to have to make a routine side task. Why would I force other players to do this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENobody is forcing you to do anything. Play as you see fit. This is most certainly pretty hardcore mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESignal is not blocked by relief (as far as I know), so 3 sat configuration works just fine, and is by far the simplest to build and maintain, and gives you almost 100% coverage. Math is pretty easy too, you need the minimum altitude - which for 3 sat is the radius of the planet. The higher away you put them, the less precise you need to be with the phase. If you put them at 750km round kirbin (2500km antenna), you\u0027ll need to be precise, or fix them often. If you put them at 2000km (you\u0027ll need the 5000km antenna), they can drift much further before the planet blocks them off. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other thing to \u0022calculate\u0022 is the distance between the sats. You don\u0027t want your omni antennas to go out of range. This also tells you how far they can drift apart before they disconnect. This is pretty easy calculation as well, but if you can\u0027t be bothered with trigonometry, just take the antenna range, divide it by two, and subtract the planet radius. This will give you relative clue about how much drift room you got. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am not sure what is tedious about matching periods. As I said, 3 or 4 sats are more than enough if you put them on the right height . You say most people can\u0027t be bothered, I\u0027d say takes much less time and effort to match 3 orbits than any alternative. Again, atmospheric issues and huge planets excluded, 3 sats will do just fine, you might get very small uncovered points on the surface of the poles, but that\u0027s about it. Adding 2 polar sats will make sure that does not happen. In reality I have found out you don\u0027t need them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really think I could never make the effort to add more than 5 comsats around any planet other than Kirbin, and 3 around any moon. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe are not talking about n-body mechanics here, but matching periods. Anybody who has ever made an orbital rendezvous knows the concept of orbital period, and how to increase or decrease it.\u003Cstrong\u003E Match 2 numbers, it\u0027s really as simple as that.\u003C/strong\u003E All it requires is getting the sat in the roughly the needed distance from the other sat (which you need to do one way or another, you can just eyeball this), orienting prograde and nudging it with rcs until the 2 periods match. This is difficult or impossible to do with signal delay, but you can easily use manned mission or a node. If you are using a node, you need Pe\u002BAp (the sum) to match, which will cause your semi-major axis (which is half of that) and therefore period to match. Your apoaps and periaps don\u0027t need to match, your sats will oscillate, but will not drift apart if they have the same period. I cannot understand someone will go through the trouble of installing this mod, launching satellites, getting them connected, and will not bother a minute to match their periods. (Edit: you might get more precision matching semi-major in some cases)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou don\u0027t need your sats to be exactly 120 degrees apart either, your phase wiggle room will depend on your altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as interplanetary communication goes, easiest way is solar orbit close to the planet\u0027s, with similar period. Pretty easily accomplished as well. If you manage to put it on slightly inclined orbit, you can prevent some 3rd bodies blocking it. In any case, the sun will block direct communication between 2 planets at some points, other planets and moons can cause this as well , this is most notable around Jool. I usually make network only around the moons, with 2 interplanetary sats.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact one of the biggest issues you will face with this mod is signal delay, and powering your active vessel.

If that\u0027s acceptable to you then more power to you. Unless your satellites are crashing or you\u0027re not getting any connection whatsoever, there\u0027s no right or wrong way to play this game or this mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing is they can drift for years before they disconnect. Unless they are too far 1 sat will cover half planet. So as long as you have 1 sat between them to connect them, you can leave them to drift very long time. The other thing is no matter your configuration, they will drift apart to some extent, so the fewer sats you got, the better. The problem will generally won\u0027t be the precision of KER, (using semimajor will give you pretty good precision for large orbits) but the sensitivity of the controls (rcs), if you have signal delay, oh well. You can use Kerbulator for high precision readout, or kOS to do it automatic semimajor match(program you\u0027ll need is just few lines), and you\u0027ll still have problem matching them completely. As lazy person, I just tend to fix them if they disconnect and I\u0027ll be performing mission nearby, which usually takes a decade or so. The drift problems we are having are nothing compared with what we\u0027d face in reality, so I take it as degree of realism, challenging me to figure out simple network which works well despite of drift. You\u0027ll likely have other things in orbit too to provide redundancy. Likely scansat/kethane sat space station. Depending on how many other mods you happen to be using, and the degree of re usability you prefer, how comfortable you are with orbital rendezvous. F.ex I usually use few nuclear tug/skycranes and they are hanging in orbit for ages. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn any case 3 sats will need less work than 10. One of the other reasons I prefer 3 sat configs is dish management. Say you send a probe to eve. Most omni antennas with big enough range will just break in atmosphere. So I place 2 dishes on the probe, and connect each one to a sat. I\u0027ll have at least one connection going. What if I had 4 or 5 sats? Where do I point the probe\u0027s dishes?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou might be fine putting 10\u002B sats in Kirbin system, but the amount of work (and dv) you\u0027ll need to do this around moho, dres or the Joolian moons is just much more than fixing your sats every 10 years or so. My intent is not to tell how to play the game \u0027properly\u0027, but to show there is simple, low-maintenance configuration, and how you can reduce the drift, or problems it causes. Sure if the mod would keep them in sync would be nice. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Rayder\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Rayder\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe method I\u0027ve bee using is having two satellites in a polar orbit, but offset by 90 degrees. This means that as long as you can see the planet, you can see at least one of the satellites. Both satellites will never be out of view at one time and they can\u0027t bunch together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInterestingly, I have thought about having two satellites both leading and trailing a planet along its orbit. This would be great as you could route signals around the sun if you needed to. I didn\u0027t end up going with it though, as even these satellites will drift and eventually you will need to do some maintenance.

I put it there, as powering some 20 dishes can end up badly if you load it and happens to be dark. It depends on the planet really. For example joolian moons have a \u0027harmony\u0027, and you can use that in your benefit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne polar sat on highly elliptical inclined orbit will give you pretty good coverage. Two sats on 90\u002B degree inclined orbit, should be generally enough, with your major problem still being the sun (and some extent other planets, but this happens really rarely (if at all?). Still if you are planning on actually landing a probe, you\u0027d likely send a command center along (unless you have delay off)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen there is always kOS. Not sure how well it plays with current version of RT, but it used to be pretty great for sat maintenance and unmanned missions (especially rovers). Though turning off delay or sending command center is easiest way if you are planning unmanned landings.
