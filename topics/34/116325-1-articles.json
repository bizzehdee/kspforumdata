This file will be automatically created after installing this mod\n\nand running KSP with it for the first time.\n\nThe default looks like this:\n\n    Settings{  safeColor = 0,1,0,1  riskyColor = 1,0.9215686,0.01568628,1  unSafeColor = 1,0,0,1  clearBackground = False}\n\nThe three colors are stored in [Unity\u0027s color format](http://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Color.html). Each component is a floating point number between 0 and 1. In order, they denote the red, green, blue, and alpha (transparency) channels. \n\nSetting \u0022clearBackground\u0022 to \u0022True\u0022 will remove the default grey gradient background that\u0027s present on the staging icons. Doing this will make it easier for color blind users to find a workable set of colors, since the background texture will no longer interfere.\n\nChangelog\n\n    1.0.2 - 2015/08/06- added a new \u0022clearBackground\u0022 setting to the config file which will  completely remove the grey gradient texture from the stack icon  background.  Setting this to \u0022true\u0022 should make it easier for color  blind users to find a workable color combination.1.0.1 - 2015/07/31- stack icons will now only change colour when the vessel is actually in the atmosphere.1.0.0 - 2015/07/19- initial release\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-15T00:16:56Z\u0022 title=\u002208/15/2015 12:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by seanmcdougall**\n  \nAdded YouTube video."},{"CreatedByName":"HoloYolo","CreatedById":138353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-19T16:59:30Z","Content":"Very useful mod.

RealChute appears to completely replace the stock parachute module with its own version, and its menu doesn\u0027t contain the \u0022safe to deploy\u0022 feature.

If you have RealChute installed and right-click on any chute (even a stock one) it will only display the RealChute options and you no longer have the \u0022safe to deploy\u0022 status field that I rely on.\n\nFrom my (admittedly limited) experience with RealChute I haven\u0027t seen a similar \u0022safety\u0022 flag I could check instead.
