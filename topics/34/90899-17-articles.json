I think one would need to do operations on vectors. You\u0027d convert your orbit to an angular momentum vector on activating the drive, then on SOI switches you\u0027d compare vectors and do operations on yours as appropriate for your new frame of reference. Such as upon leaving Kerbin SOI going to Duna you\u0027d add (?) Kerbin\u0027s angular momentum vector when you went to Kerbol SOI. Then when you got to Duna SOI you\u0027d subtract (?) Duna\u0027s. Kerbin to Mun I think it would work the same way, you\u0027d subtract the Mun\u0027s from yours, and add it back when you left its SOI. If you could feed back that velocity data from the vector as your altitude changes I think it would keep the map and KER, VOID, MJ, etc working. But, further orbital parameters may need to be defined on the fly... don\u0027t have any idea how that system works or what the game needs. Good news is any body on rails will have a constant angular momentum so could be pre-calculated (or defined) and stored in a database.

I had that thought too that as your orbit becomes more and more a straight line with you sitting at apoapsis as you warp away from the planetoid that what momentum you do have grows increasingly inaccurate as your angular velocity increasingly approaches zero.... which is fine with me. I think we (the players), need to simply deal with that. As orbital velocity approaches zero it might as well be zero from a player\u0027s stand point, and you put in something to prevent it from actually reaching zero to prevent division by zero problems. However, that would mean that you could essentially get \u0022free\u0022 momentum by warping away towards the edge of the sphere of influence and then back in... maybe.
