I have done some additional tweaking and can now succesfully fly my design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem was not the Firespitter parts as the plane flew fine with straight wings.

I have read already the incompatability with ASAS due to control delay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe design can take off fine without using ASAS as long as using MechJeb Smart ASS Surface, guidance set to 5degree pitch, then it takes off under low speed by itself.

It was fun and I was surprised at how well it flew even above mach, but no chance for this particular test getting to orbit because of (understandably accurate) whacky yawing I think because of the changing position of the control surfaces relative to the fuselage as the wing went to oblique mode, or my lack of ability to know how to deal with that. A month ago I tried a regularish swing-wing too with infernal robotics that was very stable and worked just the way I wanted it to in FAR, and as far as I know, realistically too. Most of the drawing-board caffeine-work for me was figuring out how to strut it to the hinge for better rigidity. At some angles the struts prevent the hinge from moving, which makes sense but I had to work on it and look extra closely.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-11T06:54:31Z\u0022 title=\u002201/11/2014 06:54  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 11, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by localSol\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NWM","CreatedById":67386,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-11T08:45:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDear Ferram!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think there is a little but ugly bug in the control system of your mod!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the reference command pod is built in reverse(for examle docking lander) or the aircraft or rocket flies backward, the aerodynamic control elements start to work to the opposite direction.
