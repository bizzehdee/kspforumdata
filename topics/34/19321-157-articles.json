The C-5 has its wings mounted high so that its engines have more ground clearance, so it can land on less-than-perfect runways. Most jet airliners have their wings mounted low so they can save weight by combining the structural elements of the wingbox and the main gear into a single structure. However, it does have some interesting effects on aerodynamics (that FAR currently doesn\u0027t simulate) due to the way air flows around the fuselage; it causes slightly different angles of attack at the wing root, which leads to different amounts of lift on each wing. This is essentially another contribution to the dihedral effect (like wing dihedral angle and wing sweep); high wings make the plane more stable, low wings make it less stable. However, more stability makes it more prone to respond strongly in roll to sideslipping, so you generally want to keep the dihedral effect in check; too much or too little can always cause problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn FAR, often the reason to choose one wing placement over another is to either get more ground clearance, have a good place to mount landing gear, or to control how the plane behaves at higher velocities, where the wing\u0027s drag will help contribute to the pitch-stability of the vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor horizontal tails, those are generally used if you\u0027ve constructed a high AR, low sweep wing that will lift the plane, but it isn\u0027t far enough behind the CoM for any control surfaces on it to be effective. Often for subsonic flight it ends up being more efficient to use a horizontal tail than deal with whatever weird wing-interaction effects occur when you\u0027re trying to create positive lift at the front of your wing and negative lift at the back (as is necessary for a stable tailless aircraft). However, at supersonic speeds, having the separate tail can often add more drag to your vehicle, so it\u0027s better to go for a single wing there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E@DailyFrankPeter: \u003C/strong\u003ESounds like you\u0027ve got a vehicle that took advantage of some unrealistic behavior.

You appear to be suffering from the standard effects of changing the rules of the game but trying to use strategies that only work using the old rules. As an example, this would be as if you were playing chess and you had changed the rules so that pawns couldn\u0027t be promoted, but then in the end-game you race to get your pawns to the end of the board to promote all of them to queens. Consider how much of your earlier piloting and design is focused around dealing with stock \u0022aerodynamics\u0022 and then adjust to account for new aerodynamics.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fraz86","CreatedById":90101,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-27T02:22:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m writing a ModuleManager file to provide FAR support for Porkjet\u0027s wings, and I have a config question.
