I\u0027m still puzzled as to how to run magnetic nozzles at full power, though - in the VAB, it says their maximum thrust is 650 kN and max Isp is 32000s, but I don\u0027t even get a third of that when I hook them up to a 3.75-meter fusion reactor. I also tried putting an antimatter reactor behind the fusion one to see if jamming more electricity into the system would help, but that didn\u0027t do anything either. I\u0027m still confused: can the magnetic nozzles even be run at full power? If so, how?

Not from what I saw anyway. I developed TechManager specifically against the tree.cfg that comes with Interstellar. Install TechManager and KSPI, but without TreeLoader, and you should be good on a new game. KSPI itself will put tree.cfg into your save game folder if you click on the \u0022Interstellar tech tree update\u0022 box that pops up (and a restart is NOT required). If not, just manually put tree.cfg into your save game folder. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can test by creating a custom game, giving yourself 5000 science and then digging deep enough into the tree to get at least one KSPI tech.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-27T18:19:19Z\u0022 title=\u002210/27/2014 06:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 27, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by anonish\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
