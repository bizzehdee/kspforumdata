If you wanted a sense of progression you could award yourself points when you complete tasks (first pass the Karman line, first orbit, Mun impactor, etc), or you could just set it to a number that gives you build times that you find reasonable and leave it at that. Just don\u0027t forget to actually spend the new points.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA final option would be to tweak the formulas themselves, but that\u0027s a bit more involved.
