I have 2 computers. One of them, KS works fine. Great, actually. The other, KSR doesnt work. #2 (which KSR doesnt work on), i normally run 2-300 mods on, but even with the bare minimum (quite literally KK, Preflight Launch Checklist, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, and KSR) it still doesnt work. I do not know which kind of .log you need, but i can get it. What could be the problem? I\u2019ve tried damn near everything. Reinstall, save deletions. Even sifting thru the files for just the statics (the real thing i want from this mod. The bases are plenty nice too.) now either the game just freezes at end of the loading menu when the orbit wheel is going before the main menu, or the CTRL-K menu doesnt open. I know, lot of text. But any help?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
