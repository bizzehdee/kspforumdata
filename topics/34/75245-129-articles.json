If all your satellites have orbital periods that are only within ~3s of each other, it is going to take a lot of time to cause significant drift. To fine tune the orbital period, limit the throttle on your engine as low as possible to get maximum precision. If you want to get extra precise, limit the throttle again with the flight computer and burn for something like 0.000001m/s through it, repeatedly.
