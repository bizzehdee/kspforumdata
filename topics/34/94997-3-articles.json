Due to the number of items in my saves folder, this mod started to cause some horrendous hangs when saves occurred. I had the mod set to backup everything on every save. What the mod is set for doesn\u0027t really matter...as whenever the backup happens, it will cause a hang because of the number of items it has to backup. In addition it slows down transitions between scenes. After removing it the difference is night and day.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo there\u0027s two problems when you have a lot of items in your saves folder:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. when the game performs the backup it will hang for a time depending on how much is present in your saves folder. For me, right now, the hangs last for 15-20 seconds. Sometimes as long as 30 seconds. After removing the mod the saves are instantaneous.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. when switching between scenes this mod causes hangs. For me this meant switching between scenes lasted the better part of 30 seconds. After removing the mod, switching takes maybe 5 seconds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis happens on all of my systems. Everything from my gaming system at home to my ultrabook. On Windows 7 or Linux...it doesn\u0027t matter....it happens. Regular hard drive or SSD, doesn\u0027t matter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now on my Linux install...where I did get the mod working....I have two saves, one totalling 39.5MB and the other totalling 27.3MB. That\u0027s NOT including the Subassemblies directory which doesn\u0027t get backed up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow for me, these issues are moot....since I recently switched to Linux for KSP to use the 64 bit version, I\u0027ve found it to be incredibly stable (just got done streaming for 7\u002B hours without a single crash). I don\u0027t really need a special mod for backups now tied to the in-game saving. That was only necessary because of the inherent instability of windows versions of KSP either due to the unstable 64 bit version, or the memory limited 32 bit version. As I said, this mod saved me a couple of times, but the hangs that it has caused have stressed me out at times. I will not miss it because of that alone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to see examples of the issues I state above, you can view them on my past broadcasts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample from Sunday night WITH the hangs: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.twitch.tv/thundergod97/b/643326839\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.twitch.tv/thundergod97/b/643326839\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to see how it now plays without the mod, you can watch any of my streams from this point on...or any of my past broadcasts from this point on.
