This is because, to solve the issue, I angled 2 of the thrusters by 3.5 degrees so that the thrust goes through the CoM (Pretty much what the shuttle did with its SSMEs for those that don\u0027t understand) which means either making a space between the tower and the capsule or adding a lot of weight between them is going to throw off the CoM and make the tower go crazy. Remember you do not need decouplers for the tower either, so that\u0027s one less problem. Adding a stack parachute clipped inside the pod will work, and I believe adding a rescaled (to fit R.O.) docking port/chute from sumghai\u0027s mod will also work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW, I\u0027m working on the \u0022Big Gemini\u0022 escape tower you requested.
