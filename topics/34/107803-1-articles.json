For Science! is designed to remove the science grind by automating it. Simply taking a thermometer into the ocean will automatically record that reading and store it in the command module. Arming a plane with a few experiments and flying it across Kerbin will bring in a steady stream of new science points. No more guessing if you\u0027re over a certain biome or trying to fly and press go on an experiment at the same time.\n\u003E \n\nPCGamer: [http://www.pcgamer.com/the-best-kerbal-space-program-mods-2/](http://www.pcgamer.com/the-best-kerbal-space-program-mods-2/)\n\n**ForScience! is an autopilot for running, collecting and resetting experiments.**  \n\nScience can start to be a little grindy or tedious after some time playing KSP. This plugin is intended to help improve the experience in various ways.  \n  \n\u003Cu\u003EWhat it does:\u003C/u\u003E  \n\nAutomagicly detects and runs experiments that have science available, when they are available. (Even those special biomes around \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E.)  \n\nAutomagicly collects the data from those experiments into a science container (command pod).  \n\nAutomagicly resets experiments that are \u0022run once\u0022, when you have a scientist onboard. (mystery goo, sci jrs)  \n  \n\u003Cu\u003EWhat it does not do:\u003C/u\u003E  \n\nGive you science you could haven\u0027t gotten otherwise.  \n\nRun experiments that do not implement the stock science modules.  \n\nRun \u0022run once\u0022 experiments without a scientist on board.  \n  \n**How to Use:**  \n\nThe Green FS toolbar icon means it is running.  \n\nThe Red FS toolbar icon means it is not running.  \n\nNo toolbar icon means you have no containers onboard, (And that it is not runnning).  \n  \n[Download](http://mods.curse.com/ksp-mods/kerbal/220264-for-science)  \n[Source](https://github.com/WaveFunctionP/ForScience)  \n[Change Log](https://github.com/WaveFunctionP/ForScience/blob/master/Source/GameData/ForScience/ChangeLog.txt)  \n[License: CC by SA](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)  \n  \n[Coffee Fund (donations)](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick\u0026hosted_button_id=VQWK2AHCDMR9Y)  \n  \n**Known Issues:**  \n\n- none - let me know in this thread if you have one  \n\nAcknowledgements:  \n\nSpecial Thanks to stupid\\_chris, DMagic and xEvilReeperx for helping me navigate the many issues I had while developing this plugin.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-04-12T21:43:31Z\u0022 title=\u002204/12/2018 09:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EApril 12, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by WaveFunctionP**"},{"CreatedByName":"acerola","CreatedById":92738,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T02:44:44Z","Content":"Interesting mod.

Just like all stock engines use a module called ModuleEngine to do their enginey-type things. So do all command pods have a module called ModuleScienceContainer that handles the storage of science data. You can see these module references in the part file, and they are associated with bits of compiled c# code that handle how they behave."},{"CreatedByName":"ndiver","CreatedById":60662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T22:18:08Z","Content":"At the current point what is the link between ForScience! and ForScience Continued?"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceTiger","CreatedById":133800,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T22:48:17Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E At the current point what is the link between ForScience! and ForScience Continued?\n\nForScienceContinued is a derivative work from for ForScience (code base was taken from version 0.25).

If you run one of those manually, the data is automatically collected and made inoperable. It will not reset experiments without a scientist onboard. If you don\u0027t want the data collected manually, simple toggle the FS icon to red to turn off the addon.

But basically it avoids several bugs and avoids the review data spam.\n\nAnd unless you\u0027ve encounter an detection issue that I\u0027m not aware of, you should have no need to run anything manually with scientist onboard.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-11T20:30:08Z\u0022 title=\u002205/11/2015 08:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by WaveFunctionP**"},{"CreatedByName":"WaveFunctionP","CreatedById":104784,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T08:00:36Z","Content":"ForScience! was mentioned in PC Gamer! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nWho\u0027da thunk it?!\n\n[http://www.pcgamer.com/the-best-kerbal-space-program-mods-2/](http://www.pcgamer.com/the-best-kerbal-space-program-mods-2/)\n\nThis made me more happy that it probably should. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"WaveFunctionP","CreatedById":104784,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T21:50:05Z","Content":"I\u0027m considering removing the filter for low value science to allow for auto collection of data to be used in the science lab.
