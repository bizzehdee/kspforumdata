With the ~ 30GW of power in the network, even a poor connection is giving thrusts of over 2000kN with the 1.25m plasma thruster. \u003Cp\u003EThe thermal engines paired with the thermal receptors are giving some ridiculous multiplier of that, like 10MN. I had a probe hit 5000 m/s under 10000 meters before it ran out of fuel. It was like a gun. Fun stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell ive done a lot of research with this mod and power plants are great for charging your alcubierre drives and even getting thermal powers to your ships but i think that some tweaks have to be done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you use microwaves you should use infernal robotics and plant some hinges rotors and strut bodies to orientate the antena, its not like remote tech and im glad but the thing is that when you use a transmitter, the generator will work at 100 percent even when there are no recieving ships and thats nasty cause everytime you use a power plant you should switch to it activate the generator orientate the antena and switch back to the vessel youre using.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIve even done a jool power station that collects antimatter and sends the energy back to kerbin getting 54 gw even at such a long distance, but it varies depending the position of jool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENuclears reactors are the best ones and thats sad, theyre the best because theres only 1.25m fusion engines and because antimatter is really difficult to collect, you need like 1000 antimatter collectors in jool to keep a 3.75 upgraded antimatter drive to work at 100% if you set it to transmit it as i said before, you will even need 20 huge radiators to get rid of the waste heat, (i should post a picture of my station)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENuclear reactors are then the best ones but they need maintenance, launch them with and isru refinery attached to get rid of the actinides and a lots of fuel, you will only need a simple ssto travel to recover the depleted fuels and refuel the reactor\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo my conclusion, nerf nuclear reactors, compensate the fusion ones and 2.5 and 3.75m version would be awesome, increase the antimatter collection rate and make the transmitter only transmit the needed energy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs always thank you fractal for this great mod\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
