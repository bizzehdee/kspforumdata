Personally, I am thrilled to dig into the realism overhaul and launch my own Proton or Soyuz rocket but unfortunately that means having to download the entire collection of mods, installing them and making sure everything is in the right place. This process takes at least five hours to accomplish and after a couple of weeks, it has to be repeated all over again. I would have had no trouble spending time on the process a few months ago but ever since I went to college it just is not possible to re-download everything because of the time needed. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know that packing up all the mods is not very practical as you will need the permission of every modder but please think of a way to solve this issue.

In essence, there are a few deeply-throttleable lander engines (those used for Viking and the LMDE) and some 1980s\u002B vintage booster engines that are shallowly-throttleable (SSME, RS-68, NK-33, that sort of thing) to reduce crew G load or for tricore efficiency. Throttling is \u003Cem\u003Ehard\u003C/em\u003E BTW: the usual way is to run the combustion chamber at lower pressure, but that does great harm to sea level Isp in real life (not modeled yet in KSP obviously).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrbital maneuvering engines are usually *not* throttleable (they\u0027re usually super-simple, super-rugged pressure-fed hypergolics...throttling is complexity and therefore bad for reliable restarts). Fine-tuning is done by RCS anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMakeone: RealEngines follows one very simple rule: whatever an engine does in real life it does in KSP. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t use KSPI; RF still uses the compatibility file Fractal_UK made for RF many moons ago.
