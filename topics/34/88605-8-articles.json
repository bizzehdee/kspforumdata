But there\u0027s more to it than that. MCM provides just a few modules (the Multipurpose Colony Module, Homestead, and upcoming Ponderosa) that can be dynamically configured to the desired colony module (Colony Hub, PDU, etc). The storage units can be configured dynamically as well, as can the efficiency parts. Plus there is an MM config for Porkjet\u0027s Habitat Pack to turn them into efficiency parts as well. For the classic look, there is a MM_USI config file that hides the classic modules (coming in release 4.1), but you can easily delete the file if you want to keep the classic modules around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn a nutshell:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMultipurpose Colony Module, Homestead, and Ponderosa replace the classic MKS/OKS modules\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMultipurpose Base Unit replaces the classic base unit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMultipurpose Storage Module, Inflatable Multipurpose Module, Homestead (when used for storage, it can be storage or a colony module) replace the ILM and storage drums\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInflatable Extension Module, Inflatable Orbital Workshop Addition replace the hab dome, inflatable greenhouses and hab ring- but you can still use them as efficiency parts (I do on my own stations, they\u0027re cool)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPortable Crew Tube replaces the FlexOTube\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESkydock250 and Skydock375 replace the orbital dockyard- and can tear down vessels in addition to building them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll the parts are made to blend well with stock parts as much as my art skills currently allow- and I think my skills are getting better, the Ponderosa is the best I\u0027ve done to date, IMO. Additionally, all the parts fit inside the KSOS Super25 shuttle, though that\u0027s a moot point now with the new stock MK3 parts. Actually the whole reason Multipurpose Colony Modules exists- aside from the fact that RoverDude\u0027s generous licensing and support allows it- was because the classic MKS modules didn\u0027t fit inside the Super25 particularly well, and I was tired of my parts catalog getting so cluttered.

Ponderosa is the penultimate colony module in Wild Blue Industries\u0027 product line. When deflated, it can be carried on the back of a Kerbal on EVA, fits standard KAS container bays, and is easily deployed in the field. Once deployed, it will require Machinery to configure into the desired colony module (this is in addition to the Machinery required by most modules to operate).\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould this be a mistake?

I originally intended to release the Ponderosa with 0.4.0. I\u0027m tracking down some issues with it but hope to have those done this weekend. One thing I don\u0027t like is that due to being inflatable, I don\u0027t know how to trick KAS into adding attachment nodes once inflated.
