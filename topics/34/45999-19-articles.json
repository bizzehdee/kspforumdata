For example if you are painting a wing that has a symmetric clone, you simply copy the set from the wing you first painted and re-paint the cloned wing with the paste set button, even if the wing shows already painted. The other bug is with the copy set itself, and the work-around is to simply click the paste set button once on 2 of the 3 colors available. For instance, if you copy the set color for the wing, in order to paste the set on the cloned wing you pick any of the 3 layers (primary, secondary or tertiary), click paste set, and then pick another layer and paste the set again. It *is* a bit of a hassle but at least you don\u0027t have to repaint the entire part all over again or re-create your custom color \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E Keep those 2 tricks in mind and paint will work 100% of the time =D\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Espresso","CreatedById":68432,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-15T07:06:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBut what about the unincluded features?
