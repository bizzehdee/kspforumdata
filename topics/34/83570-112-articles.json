There seems to be some kind of unstable equilibrium where you can go quickly at altitude, as long as you make it to a certain speed at a lower altitude. If you slow down at the higher altitude, you and your thrust drop, I think. I didn\u0027t do a detailed check of the thrust values, but I\u0027m going to make an educated guess that it\u0027s the intakes switching between the subsonic and supersonic modes. If I can get it to supersonic mode, I can head up to 20,000m and cruise along at a comfortable Mach 2.35. Much faster than that and my plane burns up, but that giant tub of bolts WILL go faster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m using a combo of RBM and DSIX intakes in the new design. I guess my observation is that they seem to have an abrupt change of thrust when going between modes at the given intake velocity, rather than being able to smoothly ascend and accelerate. Not sure if this is a (minor) complaint, or if the intakes are supposed to work this way? Anyway, I can fly the plane, it\u0027s just a bit more of a challenge piloting the thing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JaredTheDragon","CreatedById":137445,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-18T04:57:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022barfing_skull\u0022 data-cite=\u0022barfing_skull\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAfter playing with a slightly modified version of my above plane, I think it\u0027s the intakes.

No intakes at all, since no jets. Sure, it\u0027s ridiculous and I tweakscaled all the parts down one notch, but with no air intake variations it certainly made for a more predictable flight. I generally use the same intakes you do, and my planes are otherwise rather unpredictable.
