Providing more options however is always welcomed. i.e. don\u0027t change the default propellant RCS ports use, but provide configs using other types of propellents in the RCS port\u0027s configuration dialog.\u003Cp\u003EAnd to make those options like \u0022Hydrazine\u0022 attractive, since they are tougher to use (not transferring through ALL_VESSEL), you can give some advantages (like higher Isp, higher max thrust, part being lighter etc.) to it, or nerf the MonoPropellant mode a bit also.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlus, if you can make RCS port thrust tweakable that would be even better, especially when satellites need real small thrust to accurately adjust its orbit.
