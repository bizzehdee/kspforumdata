I am planning an upgrade release to DeepFreeze Continued... to implement a new transparent freezer part and plan to use JSITransparentPods.\n\nDuring my testing I discovered a bug. \n\nJSI Transparent pods work fine. The issue is related to JSINonTransparentPod. Or more specifically. When you leave flight scene or recover a vessel with a transparent pod the Culling masks of CAMERA 00 are not having layer 16 and 20 turned off correctly. Then if you launch a new vessel with no transparent pods on it the internals are showing in flight view ([picture](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Byg_V2NhUC_ZazNIMm11SGpJZkk/view?usp=sharing)).\n\nThis is supposed to not happen through the use of JSINonTransparentPod module being added to all parts that don\u0027t have a transparent pod. BUT - as I mentioned, the culling masks are being left on from a previous transparent vessel. So the next vessel that doesn\u0027t have any transparent pods is NOT executing OnGUI or LateUpdate correctly because in both of these it is checking a Variable JUtil.CameraMaskShowsIVA which is actually out of sync with the actual camera mask.\n\nI thought this should be easy to fix. I noticed in JSITransparentPod tries to set the culling mask off in OnDestroy and OnPartPack. But I picked up this error message:-\n\nCould not find camera \u0022Camera 00\u0022 to change it\u0027s culling mask, check your code.\n\nSo I dug further, seems the Camera 00 is being disabled BEFORE OnDestroy fires, and this happens only SOME of the time. In my testing though it was happening about 8 times out of 10.\n\nSo I tried adding a onGameSceneSwitchRequested GameEvent (in my own dev copy). But like OnDestroy this does not seem to ALWAYS happen before Camera 00 is disabled.\n\nSo then I thought remove the JUtil.CameraMaskShowsIVA variable and actually check the culling mask , but that is a bit of a performance hit which is probably why it is a variable.\n\nIn the end I added an actual check of the CAMERA 00 Culling Mask in JSINonTransparentPod.OnStart and resetting the JUtil.CameraMaskShowsIVA var. It doesn\u0027t seem to have any ill effect on non transparent or transparent pods and it only Fires ONCE, so no performance issue.\n\nso, do you want me to raise a github bug report with all this in it? do you want me to push the change to you in github?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-02T10:55:26Z\u0022 title=\u002208/02/2015 10:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by JPLRepo**"},{"CreatedByName":"luizopiloto","CreatedById":97503,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-02T11:22:21Z","Content":"( WIP ) New set of pages for RPM MFDs... ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\n![757VLOH.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/757VLOH.jpg)\n\nIs there a way to change the prograde marker textures on JSIHeadsUpDisplay, for heading bar and horizon ladder separately?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-02T17:31:03Z\u0022 title=\u002208/02/2015 05:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by luizopiloto**"},{"CreatedByName":"MOARdV","CreatedById":60950,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-02T13:32:27Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E (snip excellent bug report)\n\u003E \n\u003E so, do you want me to raise a github bug report with all this in it? do you want me to push the change to you in github?\n\nThank you for a clear and detailed bug report. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nIf you\u0027ve already found the fix, please feel free to push a change to the Mihara/RPM repo.

This doesn\u0027t include the JSINonTransparentPodFix, and it doesn\u0027t have much in the way of new features. The main change with this dev release is internal, where the main computational module was moved from an InternalModule to a VesselModule (if you don\u0027t know what that means, don\u0027t worry about it). I would greatly appreciate additional eyes testing it - I\u0027ve looked at it with my own Mk1-2 custom cockpit, and I\u0027ve looked at it with a fairly brief test in the ALCOR lander pod, but that hardly covers the gamut of RPM uses.\n\nWhat I\u0027m specifically looking for:\n\n- Any difference in performance (laggier / less lag / memory hog / whatever)? My PC is fast enough that I don\u0027t hit a lag problem like some people have reported, and there seem to be plenty of memory leaks in KSP (at least my installation), so I haven\u0027t noticed a difference, although that also wasn\u0027t my focus.\n- Anything broken?
