The way \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E syntax works, applying both the AirbreathingBanshee and the ElectricBanshee patch would either result in it requiring Ec or both Ec and Oxidizer. The other reason for the patches is the stock engine code does not allow tri-mode engines.  \n\u003E \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E part duplication is easy.
