Since 1.0.5 changed the water physics substantially. My seaplanes don\u0026#39;t float or land the way they used to. Now parts using the module from the floats don\u0026#39;t float same. Upon landing the plane will nose dive and chop the propellers off.

I really think just increasing the modules buoyancy upper limit of 50 to maybe 100? may really go a long way to helping with the new physics introduced for 1.0.5. The issue I\u0026#39;m seeing is the floats cannot support the weight they previously could. Now messing with the buoyancy in flight does have an effect. So the module still works. It just doesn\u0026#39;t appear to be as effective as before. And the planes I have will just over submerge. And dip more parts into the water causing excess drag. I don\u0026#39;t have the know how to recompile your source code to try my idea.
