Set it to auto launch, auto stage, and I don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t even check the box to prevent it from going faster than is optimal for its height to test this out. Then basically press the go button. Now, the ship launches. So the boosters kick in and the ship takes off, then the boosters run out. Mechjeb stages automatically perfectly. So far everything is smooth sailing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen it stops, it simply doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t up my throttle.

I\u0027d like to stick it on the side of a command pod or other sloped surfaces, or sometimes even stick it sideways so that I can cram more things on a probe, but it wreaks havoc with the navball. It also changes the headings of the navball.
