It was handy... in any case thanks for the porting to 1.0.x!\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe inflatable was (and has been for quite some time) broken in various ways. The first (obvious) way in which it was broken was that if it were ever deployed and retracted (even in the VAB) forever after it would load into the game in a deployed state. When the craft was launched, the shield would be deployed for example.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other, not so obvious way, was that KSP 1.0 was not recognizing that the shield had expanded. Therefore it would not update its drag cubes or recalculate its radiative area. FAR likewise has never recognized that the shield was open and adjust its drag. My ability to workaround these issues has been compromised more and more with each KSP update and I am no longer willing to support it. Attempts to recruit others to fix the problem (linked to its animation) have not been successful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tyren\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Tyren\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAll useful decouplers there. .625, 1\u002725, 2.5... the odd ones were 3 and 4m iirc?\u003Cp\u003EYeah i wondered about the missing inflating HS, too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a 3.75m..... dunno about the 4m.
