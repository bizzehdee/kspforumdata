So please don\u0027t go blaming poor old KW, it may not be perfect, but it really doesn\u0027t cause any crashes!\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry, but this is NOT accurate info...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKW can very well cause crashes, any single part can, under the right conditions, cause the game to crash. KW is kinda a high footprint pack.

It snaps to backwards, if you turn it yourself it tries to snap to the wrong node, clipping it into the winch.

My little rovers kept flipping over so I just drive over with the big Crane Rover and grab it with a connector and drop it back on its wheels. Doesn\u0027t fix any parts, but so long as the power source and the engine remain in tact I can still drive them. (Of course all the batteries in the world are useless if all the solar cells are broken. Have a couple of the small rovers at the base now with limited range because they need to be refueled from an external source. Usually using the KAS link to the base and drain juice from the main batts.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlacrity\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Firenexus13","CreatedById":67143,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-29T00:15:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan anyone confirm this works in 0.21.1?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"russkey","CreatedById":75757,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-29T00:20:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Firenexus13\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Firenexus13\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ECan anyone confirm this works in 0.21.1?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWorks with no problems for me on 0.21.1 on OS X.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KhaosCorp","CreatedById":61149,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-29T00:25:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyep, it works..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebut going mad dreaming of new feature Kospy spoke of...WHAT COULD IT BE!?!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebet its gonna be awesome\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Firenexus13","CreatedById":67143,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-29T00:25:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022russkey\u0022 data-cite=\u0022russkey\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWorks with no problems for me on 0.21.1 on OS X.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, i dont think there is any large difference in mod compatibility with windows and mac, so i will test \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"taniwha","CreatedById":57176,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-29T00:27:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI did some \u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E quick testing last night, and KAS seems to work in 0.21.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"iueras","CreatedById":76413,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-29T01:56:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENow that I have the connections fastened the right direction \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E KAS is working great for me on 0.21.1.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
