It never worked too well in the 2.0.9 release.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a bit of a bobble in it where when a rocket begins the gravity turn it\u0027ll pitch over onto the uncorrected trajectory then turn back up to as needed angle to keep on the path. Not really a problem but with large and somewhat low TWR rockets it looks like it\u0027s first going over then \u0022Oh, wait, I don\u0027t have enough thrust to aim my nose right down the flight path!\u0022 then it tips up to correct.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs it waiting to engage corrective steering until after the initial pitch over is complete? It\u0027s nothing that needs fixed, haven\u0027t had problems from it. It just looks odd.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have a rocket that struggles to reach orbit, try corrective steering. Could be that spending some of the available fuel thrusting in a more upward direction starting as soon as it completes pitch over will get it there. \u0027Course if your upper stages have a TWR or 1 or less, you will not go to space today no matter how hard you point the nose up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do like how the pitch over seems to be much less abrupt, which with the 2.0.9 release caused no end of problems with rockets coming apart, especially when being pushed by a lot of Mainsails. \u0027Course figuring out that locking the Mainsails\u0027 gimbals, at least during pitchover, makes rockets tend to hang together in a single tight collection of parts also helped with reducing failures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIIRC, the Space Shuttle throttled down some for its pitch over, then after completing it (by which time it was above the thickest part of the atmo) they\u0027d throttle back up to full blast. \u0022Roger, go at throttle up.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf MechJeb could have a way to fire the engines then wait to release the clamps until full thrust was reached (with a settable delay for engines that need time to reach full thrust) and a settable throttle reduction for starting the gravity turn, it could help many more delicate rockets or ones that are a bit iffy turning at full throttle make it to orbit. Even a fraction of a second delay would reduce the abuse because instead of the thrust meeting the instantaneous downward fall of the rocket, the rocket would already be supported by the thrust and be released to gently begin to rise, or crumble in an exploding pile if the TWR \u0026lt;1. Sure this can be done manually by putting all the launch clamps by themselves in the second stage*, but more automation is nicer for those who want more automation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother one for the wish list. Suborbital hop guidance. Click on a target and have MechJeb launch, maneuver and land all in one control. Could have the island runway, the KSC runway, old KSC in a list of presets for Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*I wonder why KSP has the stages numbered top down, starting from 0?
