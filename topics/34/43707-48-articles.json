You\u0027re comparing the suggestion that had been stated to a different suggestion that existed in your head but hadn\u0027t been stated up to that point so we had no way of seeing that that\u0027s what you meant. That makes more sense. I thought you were saying the suggestion was worse than what exists NOW, which is no checking ahead of time either in game or out of game. And THAT is not true. Pre-checking syntax does not take longer - it merely shifts the time burden earlier. If it takes time T to parse a typical line of code, and you have 10 lines in a program, pre-parsing just means that all of that wait time of 10*T happens before line 1 executes, compared to doing parsing like it is now where it happens on the fly, where each statement takes time T per line, for a total that still adds up to 10*T by the end of the program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, if you talk about statements in a loop, then not only is pre-parsing not slower, but it is in fact actually FASTER. An on-the-fly parser interprets the syntax of a loop\u0027s body each time the loop executes. An up-front parser does the parsing work on the loop body just once no matter how many times the loop executes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour claim that editing on the launchpad is not practical I agree with. But it has no place in a discussion about whether or not the comments should be counted toward program size, or a discussion about whether the Mod performing pre-parsing would affect performance. And those two things were what the suggestion was about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe advantage to pre-parsing the code is that it finds syntax errors in code whether it gets executed or not, rather than waiting until it is executed to find the errors. When there\u0027s if-conditions that trigger only some of the time, that matters. You can write code to respond to an exception case and never realize it has a syntax error until the exception case happens and the on-the-fly parser finally gets around to trying to read it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suspect that if it ever does switch to using a parser generator tool, it will end up having pre-parsing anyway, as that\u0027s how most of them work. They build a grammar tree and then you iterate through the grammar tree executing things as you visit the nodes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-29T22:40:12Z\u0022 title=\u002209/29/2013 10:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 29, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Steven Mading\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KevinLaity","CreatedById":68050,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-29T23:40:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022drtedastro\u0022 data-cite=\u0022drtedastro\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe Changelog in the Wiki shows \u0022You can now get the distance to an arbitrary latlng with :distance\u0022\u003Cp\u003EHow is this distance being computed?
