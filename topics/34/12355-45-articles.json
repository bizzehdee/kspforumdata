KSP is one of the funnest and most challenging games I\u0027ve ever played. Can\u0027t believe it\u0027s only at 0.19 and runs better than supposedly complete games like simcity.\u003Cp\u003EFew things, thank you for an amazing mod. Much more entertaining being able to concentrate on building and exploration and allowing mechjeb to do the routine stuff. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI too have had the menu gui issues with 2.0.7. This might help you track down the bug. Deleting the settings.cfg file in the root KSP folder fixes it (temporarily at least, but whatever is being changed gets reset deleting that one file), although you have to redo all graphic settings again. No idea why, but it works for me every time the menus go bonkers. Not a huge issue, especially for an alpha game with so many mods already. Nor is it game breaking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd last, this and Ferram\u0027s FAR don\u0027t seem to play too nicely together, at least when in atmosphere. Especially on automated orbits, mechjeb sends my rockets into deathspins and usually misses gravity turns. Any way around this, or must I choose between the two? Easy choice, but some of the changes FAR makes are quite fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks again, great work...they need to make this mod part of the game itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your experiencing the same bug I am (i.e. MJ2 windows go completely transparent) then I\u0027ve got to ask what, if any, other plugins you are using?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tigermisu","CreatedById":58477,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-25T21:54:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have a question, how do I uninstall the 1.9 version to use the 2.0.7?
