I have been trying to figure out what is going on with my game for weeks now and I am rapidly going bald as I pull my hair out trying to fathom what is going on!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically in a new save the part test contracts aren\u0027t showing up, so I guess the first question would be what are the requirements for these contracts to start showing up? Am I a dunce and miss remembering and you have to have the R\u0026amp;D building upgraded once in order to start getting them?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey are a fantastic source of funds and science, some may consider it cheaty, however I am using CTT which adds a lot more nodes and needs a lot more science to unlock, and I am running a scaled up kerbol system so rockets need to be larger and therefore more expensive. Plus I am not a huge fan of the visual survey contracts, while I enjoy occasionally flying planes around if I have to land them somewhere other than the runway that is just a recipe for disaster, they take a decent chunk of time to complete, and I would much rather be launching space station modules and Mun bases than flying planes most of the time. Also once I complete those first initial contracts I prefer to do mostly unmanned launches for the majority of the early game, I do my own little roleplay realism thing and I think it is absolutely ridiculous to launch a single man in a tiny can to the Mun, I don\u0027t start doing manned missions until way down the line, unfortunately a large number of the parts I need to send probes and \u0022realistic\u0022 manned missions are way down the tech tree, so having the part test contracts to build up funds and science to get to those things works fantastically for my roleplay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is basically what happened and what is now going on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had a good career game going, lots of part testing contracts, I had established a RT comms network and sent probes to the Mun, however memory usage was quite high and I was getting a little tired of crashing every hour or so. I had already pruned a number of my mods and some of the stock squad and NASA stuff. So I decided to prune further and remove a majority of the stock squad lifter and upper stage engines, I pretty much never used them since I have KW installed and use those instead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the same time that I removed the squad engines I also updated \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79588\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMKS/OKS\u003C/a\u003E to 0.22.8 from 0.22.6 and \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/98251-Alpha-90-Multipurpose-Colony-Modules-for-MKS-OKS-%280-4-5%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMCM\u003C/a\u003E from 0.4.4 to 0.4.5 I also updated this to 0.6.6 around the same time, although I think I did it before hand. These are the only significant changes I made to my game that I can remember at the moment, and this is when everything went to hell.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I reloaded my save after updating the above mods and removing the stock parts all of the buildings at the space center were max level, also I had no active contracts, I went and took a quick look into my save file to see if there was anything obvious, first thing I saw was that in the save file it stilled showed the appropriate upgrade level for all the buildings, but no matter how many times I loaded my save they all showed up as fully upgraded. I declared that save to be dead, deleted it and went ahead and started a new game, I assumed one of the parts I had removed was needed for an active contract and my removing it corrupted my save.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever in the new save I wasn\u0027t getting any parts request contracts at all. I decided maybe something in my install got corrupt, so I reinstalled KSP and then moved the majority of my mod folders over from my old game. I didn\u0027t move anything that to my knowledge involved the contract system, like this mod, contracts window\u002B etc. those I did a fresh install of.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYet in this new game I am still not receiving any part test contracts \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E other seemingly weird things that are happening:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I keep getting launch a new vessel contracts, Iv\u0027e completed that one like 8 times now just cuz.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI only get like the same 5-6 contracts offered.
