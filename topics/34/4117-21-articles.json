Tanks now include an upper section that interfaces with the nosecone or interstage adapter and includes flight computer (SAS) and reaction wheels as well as fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. The engines exist in single standalone versions (1.25m but quite powerful) for use on 2 new adapter plates (3.75m) or with other parts. They have normal gimbal ranges appropriate for traditional rockets. There is also a \u0022packaged\u0022 version in 3x (for the shuttle) and 4x (for the Blizzard main tank) that have the high gmibal ranges (and thrust vectoring) needed for use with the shuttle stack\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. The inclusion of optional engines and adapters means that traditional rocket launcher stacks are possible to build. These represent shuttle-derived launchers like Jupiter DIRECT, Ares and SLS as well as the standalone Energia and Vulcan launchers from the soviet era.
