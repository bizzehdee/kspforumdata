For an atmospheric VTOL I think you\u0027ll want most of your engines to be \u0022Balanced Thrust\u0022 which only control vertical velocity, while minimizing torque. Then if you want longitudinal engines for rocket-orientation burns at maneuver nodes and the like, you\u0027d put those on \u0022Manual Control\u0022 and switch them on and off as needed. You -could- put them on \u0022Maneuver Engines\u0022 and use your fore translational control to activate them... but that would mean giving up throttle control, which can be very helpful for precisely hitting maneuver nodes. Still, if you also have RCS, you could use that to fine-tune once you\u0027ve done the bulk of the burn with the maneuver engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut I\u0027m not an expert, so if anyone else has a better idea, feel free to correct me!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was thinking more like a VTOL that would be good at following waypoints, like in the video in the OP.

It\u00A0is entirely comprised of RoverDude\u0027s Karibou Rover parts (very tubular rocket-like rover with segments with VTOL engines). It has a cockpit that is oriented just like a rocket\u0027s, only no engines aft. Instead the only engines are the VTOL engines (perpendicular to the cockpit\u0027s axis). Therefore, it also has a probe core oriented such that its vertical is normal to the thrust vector of the rockets, for easier manual control.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith stock SAS it works beautifully. If I control from the cockpit, it orients just like a rocket. If I control from the probe core, it orients according to the engines (so if I set it to Retrograde for example, it will thrust retrograde and decrease orbital velocity appropriately). The only problem is that (predictably) as fuel burns, it grows increasingly unbalanced, until engine torque can no longer be compensated for by reaction wheels and RCS. So that\u0027s where TCA comes in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnly... most settings for TCA don\u0027t act anything like what the manual says. First off, the manual says that it should orient the thrust vector, regardless of the orientation of the command module. This is clearly not the case for this craft, as it definitely -tries- to orient according to the active control module.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI say tries, because the only modes that really seem to work at all are Kill Rotation, and Hover. Any other mode causes it to begin oscillating, seemingly at random but dynamically unstably, about all axes, \u00A0until the ship is wildly spinning and gyrating out of control. Meanwhile TCA is quite happily firing engines and RCA thrusters to -increase- the oscillations rather than stabilize them. The error reads correctly, oddly enough. So for example, if I have the ship under the probe core\u0027s control, and have Jeb point the engines Retrograde, it orients so a burn would slow it down. I then activate TCA, and push the Retrograde switch. It turns green, it shows Error=0.0. Then it starts to slowly oscillate in all three axes, swinging back and forth about three times before the error gets to about 180\u00B0. There, it seems to dampen briefly, before it, for all intents and purposes, completely loses its mind and just starts spinning the ship wildly and indefinitely, with engines and RCS all firing at random.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis behavior persists no matter how I set up the action groups, and no matter whether RCS is on or off, the engines are on or off, the engines are set to a group or not, the engines are set to Main Engines, or Balanced Thrust, no matter whether I\u0027m controlling from the cockpit or the probe core...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStop seems to make it choose a random vector and thrust to match it while gyrating wildly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBoth stock SAS and MechJeb behave as expected, though both orient according to the active control module. But MechJeb\u0027s PID tuning is way too weak to even begin to control a craft with any degree of torque, and even the stock SAS gets overwhelmed once fuel is at about 2/3.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo... what am I doing wrong? Is there something about the Karibou Rover that is incompatible with TCA?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe described behaviour is definitely out of the ordinary for TCA.\u00A0Could you post a craft file so that I could test it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEDIT\u003C/strong\u003E: in fact, I see the problem in the AttitudeControl module.

and even so they don\u0027t balance *enough*.\u00A0 I\u0027m working around it now by doing some painstaking parts placement and adding a LOT of RCS authority (KSPIE RCS is more powerful than stock) to hold attitude.\u00A0 It works OK on Mun/Minmus/etc but on bodies with heavier gravity and atmosphere (like Kerbin, Duna, Eve, Laythe, etc) it\u0027s a bit more dicey.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI
