The StockPlusController.dll needs to be installed because any StockPlus capable module will communicate with it, whether you have StockPlus enabled or not. (It needs to talk to the controller to find out if it should be active.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you do NOT want StockPlus, you simply download/install the bugfix package and do nothing else. StockPlus is disabled by default. If you want to turn StockPlus on, then you have to download the StockPlusController.cfg file (not the .dll, which is included in the base bugfix download), which acts as the global light switch. The StockPlusController.cfg tells the StockPlusController.dll that the user is allowing StockPlus. Individual modules will have the plusEnabled = true set by default, but without the global setting on, all StockPlus functions will still be off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI see that the install instructions might leave a bit of a hole. They state to install the mod, and then delete the module folders you don\u0027t want. I should probably add a note for people who only drag and drop folders. And it doesn\u0027t specifically state that the controller.dll is required.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a side note (because I\u0027m sure people will ask), the controller was put in a separate .dll for a variety of reasons. Historically, I had changed how StockPlus was enabled/disabled several times, which started causing problems for people. While still not ideal, this was the method I settled on. Partly to stop the flail, and partly to allow the most flexibility since I wasn\u0027t sure of StockPlus\u0027 future at the time, where it would grow to, or if it would get deleted entirely. As it stands, maintenance of StockPlus still eats a significant amount of time and isn\u0027t necessarily the focus.
