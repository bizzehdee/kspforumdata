Specifically, they get read as being slightly lower or slightly higher than they actually are. This causes the suspension on the wheels to either slowly compress or slowly extend as you drive across the segment. Speed doesn\u0027t matter. It DOES stop and reset to neutral if you stop moving entirely, but ANY movement, no matter how slow, triggers the bug.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027d be an entirely visual problem if not for one thing: If, on one of the segments that causes the suspension to extend, it actually reaches full extension... it doesn\u0027t stop there. It continues to pull upward on the rover even with the suspension at the stops, in essence trying to pull it off the ground. It obviously can\u0027t completely do so, but it does PARTIALLY do so. This results in traction and steering authority going very nearly to zero, as well as inducing extreme lateral instability. Some people call it \u0027wobbly wheels\u0027. The problem isn\u0027t the wheels, it\u0027s the suspension basically pulling the rover almost out of contact with the ground. It\u0027s caused nearly every single rover accident of significance I\u0027ve had since I started trying to use built rovers instead of downloaded ones when the command seats got added in 0.20.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Rollkage wheels are for whatever reason resistant to it. The suspension still drifts towards the stops, but it does so quite slowly, and I\u0027ve yet to see it actually hit the stops in either direction while doing so. The only time I\u0027ve had the suspension-induced instability occur with Rollkage wheels was when I\u0027d just gone over the crest of a hill and was going down the slope on the other side. Even then, it\u0027s rare.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis bug is one of the major reasons for some of the weirder things people do to try to keep their rovers stable. Rockets pushing the rover onto the ground. Driving around in docking mode with the SAS. It\u0027s also pushed rover designs towards greater stability than is strictly necessary, because the lateral instability has a tendency to flip rovers if they\u0027re even remotely prone to it (which makes it massively worse on sloped terrain.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs it stands, with Rollkage wheels I was (barely) able to drive my rover design clear up to the top of the one of the tallest peaks in the range west of KSC without having a single suspension-induced crash. That\u0027s never happened with any other set of wheels I\u0027ve ever tried.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust a tad bit more grip (not too much, we don\u0027t need another TR-2L, where the grip causes as many problems as it solves, and most of them are worse than the ones it solves), and they\u0027ll be, by FAR the best wheels made for the game. Heck, in a lot of ways, they already are. But it\u0027d be all but indisputable then.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-28T03:12:05Z\u0022 title=\u002209/28/2013 03:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 28, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Tiron\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zitronen","CreatedById":11842,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-28T11:49:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s easy to add more grip, but how much more? 20% more? 10% more?
