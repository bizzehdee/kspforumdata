I\u0027ve constructed a space station using the stock node for docking ports (the Rockomax HubMax Multi-point Connector).

For some reason, CLS isn\u0027t recognizing the node as a passable part (it\u0027s not highlighted in yellow like it is in the picture on the first page of this thread).

When spaces merge (because you opened a hatch) the new joined up space will have a name that has been taken from the stored space name for one of the parts in the space, but the different parts will still have their own stored space name (unless you manually renamed the space), so when the hatches are closed, the names of the spaces should be restored. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have not paid much atention to this recently.

These spaces are refered to as \u0022living spaces\u0022. In order to be able to create such an understanding, CLS needs to know extra information about each ot the parts, so that it can distinguish between a crew pod and a girder. This extra information can be provided in one of two ways:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) By the part mod author including this extra configuration in their mod.

It is great when players do this as it expands the range of mods that CLS can work with.

However in practice config for CLS is usually shipped as a config file for Module Manager that patches the config for a part. Read the documentation on module manager, and look at the examples that ship with CLS to see how this works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConfiguration\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Econfiguration for CLS is added by adding a ModuleConnectedLivingSpace to the part that you want to provide configuration for in its .cfg file. Lets consider an example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPART\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E{\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E // Fuselage Fuel Tank\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E // --- general parameters ---\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E name = Mk1FuselageStructural\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E // --- node definitions ---\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E node_stack_top = 0.0, 75.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E node_stack_bottom = 0.0, -76.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E node_attach = 0.0, 0.0, -51.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E MODULE\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E {\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E name = ModuleConnectedLivingSpace\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E passable = true\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E surfaceAttachmentsPassable = true\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E }\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E}\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this example the part that has been added is a MODULE section which adds the ModuleConnectedLivingSpace to the part. All parts that are understood by CLS need to have a ModuleConnectedLivingSpace added to them. However any part that can house a kerbal (ie has a crew capacity greater than 0) will automatically get CLS support added to it which works for most scenerios - it would be better if they were explicitly configured though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* The name value is required to indicate which Module to add to the part - for our purposes this will always be ModuleConnectedLivingSpace\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* The passable value indicates if the part can generally be passed through. If this is set to true then it will be assumed that a kerbal can enter / exit the part via any of its attachement nodes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* the Mk1 Structural Fuselage part has a special value set, which is surfaceAttachmentsPassable. This means that if another part is attached to the surface of the structural fuselage, CLS will allow kerbals to pass into it via that connection. If this is not set it is false by default.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are several other values that can be set:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* impassablenodes\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* passablenodes\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese two values allow a list of attachment node names to be specified where the passablity of those nodes is different from the passable for the whole part. This allows parts to be entered via some nodes by not others. The names of the nodes are the names specified in the Node Definitions section of the .cfg file, but without the \u0022node_stack_\u0022 prefix. In the example above there are two node that are defined \u0022top\u0022 and \u0022bottom\u0022. (note that node_attach is used to surface attach the part and can not be specified).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* passableDockingNodeTypes\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* impassableDockingNodeTypes\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome Docking Nodes in a part are specified by reference to a transform in the 3D model, rather than an attachment node in the .cfg file. In order to override if these docking nodes are to be passable, you can specify a list of passable or impassable docking node types. These values ned to match up with \u0022nodeType\u0022 specified in the ModuleDockingNode for the part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*surfaceAttachmentsPassable\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESetting surfaceAttachmentsPassable to true (as shown in the example above) means that kerbals can pass into a part that has been attached to the surface of this part. It is false by default, and its use is discouraged as using it for a part with an internal model will not make sense visually.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* passableWhenSurfaceAttached\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESetting passableWhenSurfaceAttached to be true means that it is possible for a kerbal to pass into another part that this part has been surface attached to. Effectively it allows kerbals to pass through the \u0022node_attach\u0022 node. Be aware that a kerbal can only pass through a surface connection is both passableWhenSurfaceAttached and surfaceAttachmentsPassable are set to be true for the respective parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn practice setting passable=true is all that is required for most parts forthem to work with CLS, however the config does allow for more subtle configurations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHatches in docking ports\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECLS provides an update to the stock docking port functionality to allow docking ports to have hatches in them the can be closed. This allows docked vessels to be separated into 2 living spaces before undocking so the player can double check which kerbals are in which vessel. The functionality is provided by adding ModuleDockingPortHatch to a part INSTEAD of ModuleDockingNode. The default config files that come with CLS will replace all the ModuleDockingNode modules with ModuleDockingNodeHatch modules, however if a part mod provides a new docking port part, then it would be best for it to be explicitly configured with a ModuleDockingNodeHatch.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Waggy909","CreatedById":109378,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-01T20:06:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust patched 1.0.4.0 and nothing else and now in career mode all my vessels which had docking ports are gone.
