If you are sliding horizontally at 10m/s, it only requires the ground to be rising at a 20\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 angle for the ground to be rising faster then the mod is trying to raise you up.

However, this is the primary reason I recommend using Davon Throttle Control as well, it does offer this functionality for the player and I do officially support the two mods working together.

Note that setting this mod to 0 (zero) will cause it to try and maintain a vertical speed of 0, you will want to turn this mod off once you are using the plane functions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, the wildcard is that you are using movable engines. Right now, the procedure is to use the Davon Throttle Control mod and leave your (non-movable) vertical lift engines on Throttle 0, and put your horizontal thrust engines on Throttle 1. This mod will only try and control the engines on throttle 0 to control your vertical speed, it will ignore any engines on throttle 1. In this setup, this mod even detects the lift from your wings as your horizontal speed accelerates and will throttle down automatically as your wings generate more lift.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe catch is that this mod assumes all the engines it controls point straight down, relative to the set Up direction. (The red line display under settings.) Moveable engines will not stay pointing straight down and so I\u0027m not sure exactly what will happen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason I\u0027m not sure is that as the engines turn from vertical to horizontal, the lift compensation will kick in thinking you have \u0022negative lift\u0022 happening and boost it\u0027s output to compensate, but I\u0027m not sure how fast or how smooth it would do this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo keep me posted, I have not used VTOL\u0027s extensively myself and I do want to make sure my mod correctly supports stuff like this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ED.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AntiMatter001","CreatedById":100129,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-26T20:43:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eok... ok... looks like the mod you suggested is the one i wanted... good mod though. i never would of thought of something like this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Diazo","CreatedById":81549,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-27T00:50:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are actually several mods out there to auto-balance unstable craft, Davon throttle control is my preffered due to the other, additional options it offers.
