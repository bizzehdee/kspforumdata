For some reason, the CFG that comes with BA includes data for a \u0022DEFAULTS\u0022 setting and for a \u0022SAVED\u0022 setting. Which are different. So even without changing anything yet, when I click the revert buttons I find two options available.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJudging by its appearance, I presume the SAVED version is V4. I do like it better. But for some reason my attempts to clear the skies of Eve a bit by reducing the alpha on the clouds... always fail. I get a perfectly good setup, and then click \u0022Save\u0022, and then I find that if I click the revert button it either goes to DEFAULT or a slightly different version of SAVED. And then it gets weirder - next I go to tweak Kerbin, and I find that Kerbin is at the DEFAULT setting. So I revert to saved, and that makes Eve go back to DEFAULT with those horrible opaque clouds. (Not that they\u0027re ugly, they\u0027re just impossible to see through, so a horrible nightmare for prospective landers).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also skimmed through the CFG file and found that there seem to be a lot of redundant cloud layers for Jool, including some that appear to have multiple DEFAULT settings, which I have a hunch is leading to confusion for the game engine. Could you see about releasing an optimized CFG that gets rid of the extra fluff, and also doesn\u0027t have all those Planet Factory configs in it (A lot of us don\u0027t have PF and thus have no use for those, and I do believe they are slowing things down at least a bit)?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI love the idea of this mod, but for me it seems a bit unstable at the moment.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbrud","CreatedById":92900,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-05T08:20:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis mod truly makes the Kerbol system look really beautiful!

Now I\u0027m going to retry this after making a fresh install of my build as it may have been a one off occurance, but is this a possible glitch with either BA or EVE? Not to point the finger at BA but I did not have this issue with EVE alone. Will keep an eye on KER also, see if the current version is bugged in some way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain it may have been just that install. I regularly back up my saves so I can test this reentry time and time again \u0027til it works, over different installs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for your time if you get to read this, and any response or comment will be great \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen Rbray brings out the next EVE release, it\u0027ll have several fixes to make it work with RSS. I\u0027ve been waiting on this to produces an RSS config for BA, but until then it really doesn\u0027t look to great on real sized kerbin. The cloud meshes have far too few vertices given the radius of earth/kerbin and thus sometimes dip below terrain. This is something that\u0027ll be fixed in next EVE release, hence why I\u0027m waiting on it, not much point until it\u0027s out, I\u0027ve tried already.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lei07","CreatedById":110324,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-05T14:33:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for your response Pingopete!
