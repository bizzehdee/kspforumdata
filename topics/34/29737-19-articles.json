The reason for this is simple: The shockwave temperature is equal to your airspeed velocity - 275. Since almost every part has a maxTemp of 1700 or higher, and damage doesn\u0027t start until around 85% of that, you have to be going at LEAST (1700*.85 \u002B 275) = 1720 m/s in order to be in any danger of heat-related catastrophe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, spaceplanes do NOT have ablative shielding. They have passive thermal shielding. This means that keeping your belly to the wind (even slightly) will reduce the rate of heat exchange between the shockwave and the shielded part.
