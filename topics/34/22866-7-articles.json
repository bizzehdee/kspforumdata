Like harvesters note regarding development, things get slower the further along you get. More things added means more things to double check, since things may interact differently under various situations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust when you think you have everything sorted out, something tends to come back and bite when you least expect it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust so you guys can have an idea of what I\u0027ve been up to...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom the very beginning Boat parts have had a few issues. 1) lag - ships are large, this means usually having many parts to build one. This is why stock part boats suck, and the reason for my creating Boat Parts in the first place. 2) world interaction - Boats don\u0027t fly, boats don\u0027t usually fall apart easily unless you are talking about racing boats, or wooden boats. Making ships not fly in KSP is a challenge as we all know that things get really strange and floaty at times. Further to this is the fact that water doesn\u0027t really behave like water in the game. Yes parts float on it... but you can toss any fluid dynamics out the window.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrial and error is essentially what it takes to find solutions (workarounds) to some of these issues. I\u0027ve spent crazy time on this and it\u0027s coming along.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe one issue I had was with the ship hitting land and flying up into the air. This has been solved for the most part, not saying it can\u0027t happen but it should be now greatly reduced.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother issue was controlling floatation, not only is this needed for load leveling, but also for damage, and damage control simulation (for later). Now I have a ship which we can balance each section to float exactly how we want. Goodbye splashing parts! Goodbye lag!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe current carrier I\u0027m testing with is the KCVN Grasshopper Mk2, it\u0027s still large and can easily hold more than enough aircraft. It can move at 40\u002B m/s at 4x warp, without any deformation, wobble, or splashing. Only slight load leveling and trim setting is needed and it\u0027s pretty much \u0027hands free\u0027 right across the ocean.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince summer is upon me, that means reduced computer time. Some days I can get 8 hours in, some days nothing. On average perhaps 2 hours a night now for mod development. Since R3 is so close to being finished, and I really want everyone to have it, I\u0027m considering scaling back a few of the \u0027bonus\u0027 stuff I had planned and stick to the basics.
