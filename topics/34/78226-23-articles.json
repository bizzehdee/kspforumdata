If it\u0027s consistently showing up wrong (which sounds like it\u0027s the case) I added a hidden setting in the development builds that lets you override the distance calculation. You make the change through the settings file rather than the in-game settings.

It should fix issues with powered recovery (now requires 300m/s of dV [if you aren\u0027t using parachutes as well]), should now support RealChute Lite in FAR without requiring the full RealChute mod, and should hopefully eliminate the issues with huge distances from KSC being reported.
