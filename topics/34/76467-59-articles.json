However I used the Apollo CSM as a base and even though the storage phase is liquid, the tanks only ever output as a gas. In each tank there is a heating element that causes some of the contents to vaporize, this gas is then piped to wherever it needs to go (ECS and fuel cell in Apollo). As the tanks empty the heater has to be turned up to keep a working pressure. There was never an ability to tap off liquid in use (although the tank could be de-fueled on the ground). This is also why the tanks have a reduced capacity compared to their volume, the tanks were not filled up to allow room for the contents to vaporize. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course this doesn\u0027t mean the technology isn\u0027t available to pull liquid resource from the tank, just that they were based on a real world system where it was designed to output gas only.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RedAV8R","CreatedById":94171,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-30T22:11:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E@Paul Kingtiger:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESure thing.

But much more important they behave weirdly and I am in doubt if this is a purely visual effect or there is something wrong with the actual thrusters. In particular some thrusters do not respond to their respective control inputs but sometimes do respond to inputs on the other axis or when more than one button at a time is pressed. However I am not sure if those thrusters that are not firing still provide torque and some times it seems like they do. What can be wrong with them?
