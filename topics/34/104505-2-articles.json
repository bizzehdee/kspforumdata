Problem was solved when I removed EditorCamUtilities.\n\nAdded support for the keyboard controls with the new update.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Couple of issues.\n\u003E 2. Zoom in/out seems to be backwards compared to default KSP. For example, in the VAB Shift\u002BMouse Wheel Up zooms out instead of in.\n\u003E \n\u003E 3. Some funky interaction with Editor Extensions. EE has a spacebar hot key that re-centers your view. After using spacebar when the scroll view up/down is used camera switches to the default VAB viewing angle.\n\u003E \n\u003E Thanks!\n\nSwitched zoom in/out. Now it should be just like in stock. And added a simple check if EditorExtensions resets the cam.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Found out about this mod because of the TempGauge issue, I also like the FPS background limiter. Any plans to incorporate this to use Blizzy\u0027s Toolbar?

They need a tiny bit more thrust to take off the short runway. This required more engines but these engines would not be needed shortly after taking off. So they were trying to solve this problem without adding even more mass to their crafts. During one night the lead engineers woke up in the middle of the night and had a brilliant idea: Why not just increase the fuel flow ? This would result in less efficiency and more heat generated but since it was only needed for takeoff that wasn\u0027t such a huge deal.
