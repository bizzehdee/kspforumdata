Thats the link to the discussion started a month ago on it on github. There has been a bit of talk on irc as well. Its a bit more complex than many may realize, because it affects authors a lot. Basically if someone gets bugs that exist because they installed an unverified version against a new KSP version, and it fails, and they go posting to the author\u0027s thread \u0022installed via CKAN\u0022, then the fault is usually laid on CKAN for cluttering up the author\u0027s thread and taking their time chasing a bug in code that should not have been installed anyway (sometimes justified, sometimes not). This is what the CKAN crew is trying to balance, among many other things. And yes, some mod authors have snits about CKAN, but those are generally not done in public. What they run into is dependencies and/or interference between mods: this is an issue -and a complex one - of which part of it is handled by CKAN in their metadata to help keep the end users informed of such issues (and prevent them when practical).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah, they are hashing out a solution, but feel free to contribute.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Poodmund","CreatedById":128643,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T19:20:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022plague006\u0022 data-cite=\u0022plague006\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027ll have a look as soon as I can....

Used CKAN successfully back in v0.9 on my old PC, and am now running KSP 1.04 on this PC. My first attempt to install CKAN on this PC a week or so ago didn;t get very far. This time, after getting myself confused over whether I was supposed to be installing mono in Linux or mono for Wine, CKAN is installed. However, on startup it errors as follows: Unable to load mono library from \u0022Z:/home/esme/Games/KSP/KSP_linux/KSP_Data/Mono/mono.dll\u0022 (error = 126). - which is perfely reasonable as that file is indeed missing. WHen I try to use synaptic to see what might install it, it tells me I already have stuff installed that should include it, but using locate - I can;t find it. In any case, running CKAN without it it seems that CKAN knows about lots of mods, but can;t download anything. Your advice would be greatly welcomed, as I\u0027m out of ideas (bet I\u0027ve overlooked something somewhere!). Thank you in anticipation, Esme Additional - restarting my PC, it now no longer throws that error message. It can definitely update the repository data - I\u0027m seeing traffic on the ethernet connection when it tries, but no mtter what I try installing (eg: Kerbal Alarm Clock), when I tell it to install I see a brief spike on the network connection, but it never actually downloads the mod (all network connections are wired btw, no mucking about with wireless connections here).

To create a new modset, rename the current CKAN and GameData to CKAN-default and GameData-default. Create empty CKAN and GameData, copy Squad from the default into the new GameData.
