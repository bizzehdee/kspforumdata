As that implies, you could create a few sub parts if you wanted to complicate it a bit more. You could create specialized tanks, that were relatively small, with a half life, or better, a complete decay over time. After it lost a specific percentage, it would destroy the tank and most likely the attached part. \n\nFiguring out the plugin or module for this to work, with the heating/cooling addition, is something I know you can do. Maybe the guys at \u0022Dangit\u0022 could whip up a lubricant to stop corrosive damage, like the WD-40 clone used to free stuck parts. \n\nYour Mods are in the top 5 of \u0022must have\u0022 for many of my friends and the community. This would add such a huge factor in long term power solutions, that it will soon become a quick must have addition. Nert please consider this man, I have tried to propose such a part or module a couple times and for some reason no one thought it a good idea. I\u0027m sure you can think of the creative ways this could extend and increase the long term planning of most missions. Its exactly within the parameters of your most recent adaptation of squads heating cooling updates. The heat transfer Pipes are excellent supporting parts for your Heat Control pack, and this would add new depth for damn sure.\n\nPlease consider, but if your not interested, let me know either way.\n\nDren"},{"CreatedByName":"PickledTripod","CreatedById":135197,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-01T03:42:48Z","Content":"Nertea hasn\u0027t made a single post in two weeks...

First, been a fan of your mods since I first got into KSP back in like March. High quality stuff that goes well with some of my other favorites (like OPT).\n\nNow for what looks like a odd issue I\u0027ve had with heat control.\n\nI tried out this mod with an OPT-based spaceplane design. I was having heat problems and the stock radiators weren\u0027t well suited for my intended design (at least aesthetically). The static radiators you have in this mod seemed like the perfect fit (they look like lifting surfaces on a spaceplane).\n\nHowever, I noticed an issue during testing that the radiator tended to spontaneously explode. Further testing indicated that your custom radiators (ones using your heat plugin and not the stock module) would for some reason start generating internal heat after reaching some sort of temperature threshold. I would have to deactivate them to get them to cool. The minute I turn them back on, they heat up again (despite the rest of the vessel being essential in equilibrium with the environment, be it space or atmosphere.) Given time, they would explode due to overheat. They would work fine for a while initially.\n\nThey seem to have issues with time warp as well: time warping cooled the rest of my vessel while your custom radiators would seem to loop back to cold and heat up again. I had the colored heat overlay on to test that.\n\nCould this a plug-in bug or do you think it\u0027s a mod conflict? I wound up testing the stock and stock-based Atomic Age mod radiators and had no issues. Your heat exchangers work fine as well.\n\nI understand if you don\u0027t/can\u0027t touch your mods until after 1.1 is released. This is just something I thought I should mention for the future."},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-13T11:01:50Z","Content":"Three things:\n\n- You\u0027re playing a 1.0.2 mod on 1.0.4.

Each engine has an \u0022electric efficiency\u0022 - not as a stat ingame, but rather as a balance target. If an engine is set as 70% efficient, then 30% of its Ec/s usage is set as heat output (this has no effect on its performance, it\u0027s simply a useful method to have heat output scale with power consumption). Then the heat output is multiplied by five to produce heat values that actually have an noticable effect ingame. (Originally this multiplier was x10, but people felt the engines ran too hot, so it was reduced.)\n\nElectric efficiency varies mostly between engine technologies: gridded ion thrusters have a very high efficiency, for instance, while the VASIMRs have the worst - partly to balance out just how good they are in other respects. So you\u0027ll find that a pair of VX-100\u0027s will affect the cooling design of your spacecraft more than a DS4G will, even though both setups consume about the same amount of Ec/s. Efficiency varying between individual engines of the same technology is rare.\n\n(I\u0027ve been thinking about ways to better advertise the heat output in the VAB, though since not even stock engines do that, it\u0027s a bit tricky.)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Will this mod get support for 1.0.5 and 1.1?\n\u003E I like the radiators very much\n\nIt\u0027s possible, but we don\u0027t know yet. Many of the parts in this mod are no longer really relevant since stock KSP basically abandoned part-local heat management. Nertea planned at some point to make this mod convert the stock parts back to that model for people who liked it, but then Life Happened. And if I were to guess, such a rework is lower priority than converting the active packs to 1.0.5.\n\nIt\u0027s also possible though that the radiators might make it back into NF Electrical... note: possible, not guaranteed."},{"CreatedByName":"Nertea","CreatedById":83952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-25T00:49:43Z","Content":"**A return from the dead - version 0.2.0**\n\n- Updated for KSP 1.05\n- Deprecated Heat Exchangers, Heat Pipes and Insulators\n- Deprecated plugin component in favor of stock modules\n- Added conformal radiators from NF Electrical\n- Re-specced radiators as high temp radiators - will perform better when removing core heat than stock radiators\n- Adjusted many mass, cost and capability parameters to match\n\nThe removal of some parts may displease people, but frankly those parts are significantly less useful with 1.05\u0027s heat system.

It turns out that there is a stock bug that means that a radiator always pulls \\*all\\* of its power radiation capacity out of a part, even if the part\u0027s rules say that it can\u0027t (the small reactor for example is supposed to only allow the extraction of 200 kW of heat). The giant radiators you are using are pulling thousands of kW while the reactor is generating 100 or 180 kW. What this means effectively is that if a reactor is overcooled, it will have trouble starting up. Either use somewhere around the recommended value of radiators or retract some radiators until the reactor gets started. The Garnet needs up to 1200 kW and the smaller needs 200 kW. \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-28T01:21:24Z\u0022 title=\u002212/28/2015 01:21  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Nertea**"}]}
