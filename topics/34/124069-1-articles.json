The main difference between this solar system and stock is that the entire solar system has been rotated to simulate an axial tilt for Kerbin, the same concept that gives Earth an axial tilt in Real Solar System. Also, the Kerbal Space Center has been relocated to a higher latitude. The combination of these two changes forces players to plan launch windows for things that did not typically require them, such as LKO rendezvous and going to the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOther Changes\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Mun now has an identical inclination to the real-life Moon, relative to the ecliptic. Minmus was changed so it would not have a similar inclination to the Mun. Jool\u0027s mass has been increased to be more comparable to Jupiter\u0027s, relatively. Dres and Eeloo\u0027s orbit inclination has been altered to be more like Ceres and Pluto, respectively. Everything else is stock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOuter Planets Mod Support (v1.8.x)\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is compatibility with this awesome planet pack. Only thing is I retained the same orbits for the inner moons of Sarnus because of the rings. Sarnus, Urlum, and Neidon have had their masses increased similarly to Jool\u0027s. Instead of Eeloo, Plock has had its orbit inclination to more like Pluto\u0027s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERemote Tech Support\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemote Tech is actually a little easier than stock, because I added a Deep Space Network on Kerbin! I personally find it tedious and non-challenging to have to setup a satellite network in Kerbin orbit to communicate with distant planets (if Kerbals can launch rockets to space, surely they can setup ground stations around the planet \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E). I also have two short range ground stations specifically for launches (one for eastward launches, and one for polar orbits); not sure how useful this will be since they quickly become redundant once a simple comms setup is achieved, but added just in case.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EVarious Scales\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot only is this config available in stock size, I have included 2x, 3x and even 4x scales for additional challenge! A few notes: planetary rotation periods have been adjusted, atmospheres do not scale, and potato moons (Gilly, Pol, Ovok from OPM, etc.) do not scale.

Ultimately, the only elements affected by this rotation are inclination, longitude of the ascending node, and argument of periapsis.

Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere height is ~12% of its radius, but Earth\u0027s atmosphere in RSS is ~2%. That\u0027s one reason Earth looks so huge in RSS (and real life), not just from the simple fact that it is much larger than Kerbin, but also that you are orbiting very close to the surface, relatively. You would need about a 5x scale for a 70 km orbit to have Kerbin look as large as Earth from a 130 km orbit. I didn\u0027t release a 5x scale version because it\u0027s getting pretty close to 6.4x scale, which I may release a MM patch for sometime soon to accomplish the same thing I have done here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, another challenge is having to spend more time burning horizontally since you do not gain as much horizontal speed when getting out of the atmosphere since you do not have to go up as high. That is a big thing in RSS. Doing an efficient launch to get into a 80km orbit in 4x scale requires a lot of time burning towards the horizon, and it\u0027s easy to fall back to Kerbin before circularizing if your launch profile is off.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stevehead","CreatedById":137745,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-01T03:05:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EVersion 1.0.1 released\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFixed a small scaling issue for a couple of RT ground stations.

It\u0027s a little discouraging to put a good bit of time into researching how to properly rotate the 3D space of the solar system, writing a python script that generates all 4 configs with a press of a button, and making sure I have compatibility with OPM and RT, only to end up (so far) with a 1 star rating on the forums. If there is a legitimate issue with what I have released, please report it here or on the GitHub issues page--it\u0027s the only way I can know, and AFAIK there is nothing wrong with the configs from what I have tested and played. If this is just not for you, please respectfully move along and not low-rate this thread just because this doesn\u0027t fit your play style. I know the distribution isn\u0027t optimal at the time of this posting, but once CKAN gets the configs listed, it\u0027ll be easy to install.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: This thread is getting a little more love now.

The visual differences would be the orbits relative to the galaxy plane in the stock skybox, and the fact that Kerbin (actually all the planets/moons now) has seasons: at UT time 0, it is the vernal equinox (aka first day of Spring for the northern hemisphere).
