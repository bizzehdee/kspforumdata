Why not add hybrid rockets to MFT lineup? Basically, it\u0027s an SRB with an oxidizer (usually LOX) tank on top. Pretty non-explosive, medicore Isp (but higher than pure solid), but cheap, very throttleable and easily restarted. I imagine that the most basic implementation would be SolidFuel\u002BLOX. Not entirely realistic (hybrid fuel and pure solid fuels are different things), but should work for a proof-of-concept. It\u0027d work like a normal SRB that you need to provide with some kind of oxidizer for it to work, either from a stack tank or through a fuel line. This could be implemented as a \u0022fuel mode\u0022 on existing SRBs, so it\u0027s only config-side work, not even needing a plugin change, just a few additions to the spreadsheet.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"soverign","CreatedById":91688,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-06T05:10:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDoes this modify the Tiberdyne Shuttle System parts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
