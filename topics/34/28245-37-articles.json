This made for easier placement, but would require more tanks in the VAB to allow all the variation of attachment points\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second way was to use surface attachment rather than an attach node to attach the tanks around existing pieces. The problem with this method was similar to the first one. I could make it work, but they only worked properly if the part you were attaching them to was the correct diameter. If you attached it to something of larger or smaller size, the toroidal tank would be off center. The only way around this that I saw was again, more tanks each with different surface attach placement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI finally settled on this third way, which allows each of the 4 tanks to be used with any of the hubs for the most flexibility with the least amount of parts (you should have seen this mod before I started going modular... It added over 150 tanks to the VAB). This way seemed to be the best compromise between the other two methods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA workaround to do what you suggest is possible. Just edit the config of the tank that you want to put the toroid around to add another attach node centered inside it where you\u0027d like to place the toroid, then attach the toroid to that without using the hub.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlong those same lines, I\u0027ve been looking at possibilities for a different attachment method, so if I can get it working it may be more along the lines of what you are looking for.
