The good news is that I did some work on the code and fixed quite a few issues.\u003Cp\u003EThe bad news is that a lot of the bigger issues are still prevalent and I honestly have no idea how to fix them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome of the updates:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHad to take away Laythe\u0027s new terrain, reverted it to stock and it works fine now\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFound out how to minimize the Spawn in Space bug (go down to see an explanation)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFixed Vall, but also had to revert it to its stock proportions due to a major terrain issue that would freeze ships\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETried and failed at fixing Bop moonlet far terrain bug\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETried and failed at fixing comet tails\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFound a new bug where Tylo, Gilly and Ike all orbit Kerbol WAY to fast (pending a fix, will update soon)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIke is using the stock terrain bug so therefore from a far orbit and from the map it will appear as stock Ike but in reality it\u0027s a spiky hell hole\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuna, Dres, and Tylo all seem to have a bugged to hell sphere of influence (tried and failed at fixing) that sends (hypereddited at least) probes on an interstellar adventure, same bug also seemed to occur with Vall\u0027s bugged sphere of influence but the fix with vall doesn\u0027t work with Duna, Dres, and Tylo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProbably many more issues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHonestly at this point a complete rewrite is looking 10x more appetizing. I would suggest trying it with Planet Factory seeing as how the existing code is a mess and Nova (he even comments it himself) didn\u0027t know what any of it did.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh and the Spawn in Space bug is caused more than half the time by the Mechjeb AR202 case part, no idea why.

I attached an image with some comments on it to aid you. Though I have been to a LOT of Minmus I have NOT been to all of it so you might want to give some more threshold just to be sure. Vall also has a small issue where on the map you will appear to be floating above the planet (but landed and does not have a visible orbit). Actually now that I look at it, Minmus has the same issue.

I ended up creating a version of it that was somewhat cut down (and I did later arrange the planets in different places because i had some artistic choices), but I mixed that with parts of EVE (Well I mostly used better atmospheres for guidance for clouds and the auroras) and added in the new textures with the Texture Replacer which solved that part of it (Mainly because I believe i broke how it imported textures). Although Tylo remains without a atmosphere and some little details than that. But I decided to throw out my two cents/experimentations that i have done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry, after a bit more testing I found that career seems to work flawlessly. I first had the missions to achieve orbit around kerbin. Then the next mission was to achieve a orbit around Jool, then go to the Mun. I have to say career is pretty flexible in terms of planet locations. Although I will say that some planets look a bit funky when shrunken/enlarged when playing with better atmospheres (I believe it just might be the height its atmosphere is set at), so thats a bit weird.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-31T14:14:14Z\u0022 title=\u002207/31/2014 02:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 31, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Artouris\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdditional Experimentation/Fixing Spelling\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"_Augustus_","CreatedById":115084,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-14T20:45:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlternis Clouds do not work for me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PoorYorick","CreatedById":116759,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-16T18:17:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe config file for the clouds is for an old version of EVE.
