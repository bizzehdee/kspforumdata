Thanks for the quick Reply and fix to the Centaur, you save my KSP program!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the exception of an Air Brake I moved off of B9, I am exclusively using your mod at this point (sans background mods like Enhanced Nav Ball and DLL enhnacements) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am wondering if I could make a small request. The Rescue Gemini, Love the idea but the textures freak out on my monitor. I have traced it to the color of white used for those textures (it is more of a blue white vs the natural white of all the rest of your mod but I won\u0027t bore you with CIE color chart information.) This color difference can clearly be seen if you put the white lander legs on the standard Gemini Service Module. Would it be possible to switch the color when you have a chance to the standard white that the rest of the mod uses? It would help me because the texture won\u0027t fritz out and should clean up the look of the model (Less blurry due to the glare issue from the Blue-white color.) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in Advance!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPappystein\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
