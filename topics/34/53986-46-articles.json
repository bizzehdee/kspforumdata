Not ideal. I accept that larger bases will need to support more mass above, and probably more thrust from below, and so besides being larger, will likely also need to be sturdier as well. And I readily accept that sturdier and larger means heavier. Nevertheless, I feel like 90 tons for a 14m interstage base is off by at least a factor of 10.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI looked through the Realism Overhaul configs override, and saw that it kept the same value for specificMass (0.263). I tried changing it to 0.063, and also 0.030. 0.030 looks close-ish, and I want to run these numbers by people. Personally, I think that although things are less massive, I believe a tweak to the mass algorithm may still in order, but would love to get some feedback from someone who knows more about this before suggesting any changes to e-dog, the procedural fairings maintainer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EspecificMass=0.063\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2m - 0.1t\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4m - 0.5t\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6m -1.7t\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8m - 3.9t\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10m -7.9t\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E12m - 13.6t\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E14m - 21.5t\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EspecificMass=0.030\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2m - 0.1t\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4m - 0.2t\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6m - 0.8t\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8m - 1.9t\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10m - 3.8t\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E12m - 6.5t\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E14m - 10.2t\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would love to see interstage adapters follow a curve that starts at roughly 100kg for a 1m adapter, 1t for a 3-6m, and 6-12t for 14m. Those are just my suggestions. If someone else with more actual real-life rocketry experience (or internet sources) wants to claim something else, I\u0027d love to hear it. The 0.030 value seems pretty close to that, so I suggest using it as the new value for the specificMass value in GameData/RealismOverhaul/Parts/ProcFairings/adapter2.cfg.

There\u0027s currently only one deeply throttleable engine in RealEngines, the LM Descent engine, and man do I want more! (viking lander engine?). Given how far along it is in testing, I think it\u0027s reasonable to include this engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore Engine Nerd Out on the CECE:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.rocket.com/common-extensible-cryogenic-engine-0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EEngine stats\u003C/a\u003E and alternative configurations (Isp, thrust, and CH4 usage).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.ulalaunch.com/site/docs/publications/LunarLanderConfigurationsIncorporatingAccessibility20067284.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EPDF\u003C/a\u003E of possible descent configurations using this engine and techniques for minimizing liquid hydrogen boiloff while on the moon for extended periods of time.
