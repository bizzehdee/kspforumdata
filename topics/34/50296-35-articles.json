I have logged the shield temperature at various heights whilst it is open and closed and the results are virtually identical. When closed, the shield detonates at ~1450C (Which is the lower value in the MM cfg) but when open the shield detonates at \u0026lt;1450C (There is no maxtemp lower than this specified anywhere).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have tried inverting the key values as you suggested but that doesn\u0027t seem to make a difference.
