So I admit I could be easily misinterpreting the intent of \u003Cem\u003Eif (FlightGLobals.ActiveVessel)\u003C/em\u003E. But on the surface of it, if the intent was \u0022don\u0027t respond to the event unless it\u0027s for the current vessel\u0022, then that code \u003Cstrong\u003Edoesn\u0027t do that\u003C/strong\u003E at all. Just saying \u003Cem\u003Eif (FlightGlobals.ActiveVessel)\u003C/em\u003E by itself is doing nothing more than just ensuring that globally an active vessel exists *somewhere* in the loaded universe. It\u0027s not doing a thing to check whether or not the currently crashing part is in any way related to that active vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat happened in my game is that my active vessel did NOT crash in the slightest. My spent stage did, as it *should*. I was being a good space citizen and avoiding Kessler Syndrome. My landing was smooth as silk and nice. But it was the crash of the spent stage that falsely triggered the mission failure, and I think this is why - any crash that occurs in the loaded 2.5km universe anywhere, regardless of which vessel it is for (and spent stages count as separate vessels) is triggering the failure. I suspect it would happen as well if you had say a heavy craft with small starting boosters that separated and fell back to Kerbin very early in the flight and fell to ground before you were 2.5km high. The OnCrash events those boosters would undergo because they didn\u0027t unload before impact would be falsely interpreted as crashes that occurred to the main vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-13T09:38:22Z\u0022 title=\u002212/13/2014 09:38  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 13, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Steven Mading\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"malkuth","CreatedById":57414,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-13T14:16:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI will test things out when I get chance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFightglobals.active vessel does the same exact thing your code does only difference is your matching an event vessel name with flightglobsls.activevessel.

No shame in that, as the KSP API is horribly documented and most of the documentation of it is coming from the user community\u0027s own guesswork. There\u0027s no shame in guessing what it does incorrectly, as it\u0027s all any of us are doing is guessing. I wish SQUAD would document their API if they claim they like having modders around so much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m suspecting that when a part of vessel is destroyed via the 2.5 m distance this bug is not showing. But a direct in gsme vessel destruction via hitting ground is showing the event, which in my case would explain why never seen this bug. In most my ship builds most my stages are destroyed via distance destruction, and not direct destruction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMine as well. It\u0027s actually abnormal to build a rocket in which the first stage hits the ground before you reach an altitude of 2.5km. But that 2.5km value can be changed by other mods. Being reliant on the short unload distance for it to work right is a fragile assumption.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"malkuth","CreatedById":57414,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-14T05:17:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethanks for pointing this out Steven no acess to my pc to look at this issue but thinking about it you must be right I have to check the event origin vessel as active vessel.
