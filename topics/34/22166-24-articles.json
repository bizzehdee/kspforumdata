This was absurdly powerful, and it meant you could nearly double the overall specific impulse of any rocket by converting Kethane to fuel on-the-fly. The converter was slow, so you couldn\u0027t do this with large rockets, but it made small interplanetary miners way too easy to build.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen the conversion rates were reduced below 100%, it became more efficient to convert Kethane to fuel on the ground.

The dominant strategy simply changed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy goal with this update was to eliminate either option as a dominant strategy and give players more interesting choices. With the better-than-perfect conversion, it may be economical to haul Kethane and convert it closer to where it\u0027s burned, but since the gain is fairly small, the mass of the converters and electrical hardware may end up overwhelming the benefit. It might be most economical to have Kethane converters stationed at a fuel depot, or as part of a service module, or on a transport, or... you get the idea. There\u0027s no longer one obvious \u0022best\u0022 way to use Kethane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you need a way to rationalize the \u0026gt;100% efficiency, it\u0027s been suggested that the excess could be coming from Kerbal flatulence.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KhaosCorp","CreatedById":61149,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-06T06:43:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u002B1 for fart powered space ships!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I made a mistake, honestly thought that big tanks were 4t mass before, my bad on that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ANWRocketMan","CreatedById":65251,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-06T07:50:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks so much for the update!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ep.s.
