I never would have thought to check AGX. I kept thinking it was related to a physics-calculating plug-in or something along those lines (I have several flight assistance/related plug-ins, like MechJeb, NEAR, Trajectories, NavHUD, etc.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI only thought that because the stuttering only hit under certain conditions, namely high-speed atmos travel (\u0026gt;1000m/s and/or aropund the near transition from atmos to space) and long/hard burns in space. And my 32-bit sessions have been lasting longer per play; back to what they used to be, give or take... That memory leak was horrid...45-60 minutes of flight time max from a 2GB initial load. The stuttering required quicksaves and loads to manage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking back, I guess my problems did occur around the same time I updated AGX to 1.3 or so.
