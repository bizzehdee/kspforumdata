code\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esadly, it requires a complete overhaul of the whole mod, so essentially im forced to recode the entire thing from scratch\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eonce turrets are coded, itll be very very easy to make them non moveable (either via model itsself, or just setting a flag to flase to disable rotation ability)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eissue right now is that the code is coded to fire forward in worldspace, not forward relative to how the gun is rotated (eg i could rotate the gunpods right now in any orientation, and itd still fire forward relative to the plane, working on making it fire wherever the barrel is pointing)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei will upload my final alpha version today lateron, it works, has a few small bugs, and alot more features then before (tracer colors, random spread, ability to ricochet a bullet from one target to another, some gun handling improvements, ect)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esadly in doing something i broke recoil, so you will have to live with either no recoil and these upgrades or stick to the original release that still works perfectly fine\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eif officially discontinuing support for all versions that do not support turret code, since adding the turrets cant be done without essentially redoing the whole base code\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Estill, for those who have been waiting go ahead and install the next alpha version, its better in all ways except recoil is messed up (i know i could theoretically fix it if i had the time, but id rather spend it doing the beta version that has turrets working)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eif there is enough requests for a recoil fix, i will be happy to do it, but id rather spend all my time modding at making the new one, again, post here if youd really like the recoil fixed in the 2nd alpha\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecurrent working features:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*guns shoot\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*guns have spread\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*guns damage things to varying degree\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*tracer color choices and enable/disable tracers\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*2 muzzle flashes to choose from\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*easier way to determine initial velocity/firepower, now you set it velocity and mass, mass doesnt change the velocity anymore, only increases firepower/decreases drag effects, velocity only increases velocity and hence firepower\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFew featires im working on with the beta code:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eworking turrets (i have gotten them to rotate and elevate the gun, but still working on making the bullets spawn in varying orientations, a bit hard to figure out how to work)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eworking on giving bullets different ammunition types: AP, HE, I, and AM rounds:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAP or armor piercing will function more or less similar to the guns now\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHE or high explosive will create a small explosion with varying amount of force based on the caliber\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI or incendiary will increase the heat of a part by a set amount based on caliber (im also considering particle beam weapons that fire a short burst increasing the heat of the target, similar in concept to the sunbeam laser but different implementation, an actual stream of bullets essentially that each heat a small amount, and have very very slight target seeking ability, as well as limited velocity and dont aimbot things like the enemy cockpits ect)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAM or anti matter rounds will force delete a single part it touches (as in the only round guaranteed to do damage, but as a balancing effect other then deleting the target part, it will not do anything else, no forces exerted on the target or collateral damage, only for use on battleship class guns, 210mm or more caliber to keep the ammo useage very high and to keep the rate of fire extremely low\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esome guns may have selectable ammunition, meaning a toggle from say AP to HE, with different resource useage as one may have a different mass then another\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eresource usage per shot and a few ammunition bin parts to go with it (ammo production will be in final release, its not hard to code, but i dont really have the time to do this as i have other priorities)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etarget tracking and lockon will be in final release, 1st i gotta get the turrets to work semi decently with manual controls\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eim also switching over to a new style of the guns and turrets, old ones are most likely going to be scrapped in beta release, since there is too much i need to do in terms of proper bone orientations, that the old models lacked, essentuially since new code will look at orientation of barrel and shoot straight out of it, i cant use my old randomly oriented models\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efinally, im hoping to release at least a few turreted guns, im working on making the code work with a dual 88mm flak cannon designed for smaller scale destroyers or as cruiser secondary armarment, a bit too powerful and low rate of fire for shooting fighters, but also too weak to take down huge ships\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eturets will also have toggle on/off and return to default position, allowing only one turret to be used at a time, or as many as you want (since each is going to be bounce to the same numpad keys), and also a option to return turret to default forward facing (so that if you used a turret and want to then face all guns forward, allows the ability to then use them as essentially forward firing emplacements)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ealso working on ingame hotkey binds so each gun can be fired with a different key

I was playing around modding config files, making \u0022decoupler bullets\u0022 and such but it isn\u0027t very realistic and a decoupler cannon mounted on a rotating robotics turret turns out to be pretty big, unwieldy and hard to reload.

I ended up making a pretty complicated system with a rotating turret that turned backwards and could pick up a string of decoupler bullets from a rotatron assembly that carried like 4 \u0022magazines\u0022 of them.

Very lightweight, small, negligible recoil, and with a very high rate of fire, the Mg-13 machine gun will expel bullets at a high velocity (if it doesnt just go buy a new one, and dont tell anyone that only 3% of our guns pass the firing test without exploding or not working at all!). Its major drawback is very low firepower, barely enough to damage a exposed fuel tank, but still enough to take down anything that is not armored such as probes and small fighters. All in all, the perfect weapon for being a royal pain in the butt, annoying, fun, spammy, and best of all guaranteed to increase the amount of rage quitting, swearing, arguing, and general hate towards whoever dares use such a device. At least the bullet\u0027s velocity is very high making hitting things that are moving (lets face it, in space objects have a tendency to be in motion) somewhat easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E// attachment rules: stack, srfAttach, allowStack, allowSrfAttach, allowCollision\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EattachRules = 1,1,1,1,0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E// --- standard part parameters ---\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emass = 0.15\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EdragModelType = default\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emaximum_drag = 0.2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eminimum_drag = 0.3\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EangularDrag = 2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EcrashTolerance = 6\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EbreakingForce = 50000\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EbreakingTorque = 50000\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EmaxTemp = 3400\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMODULE\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E{\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E name = AKSKineticEnergyWeapon //change to \u0022dyjmachinegun\u0022 if using DYJ\u0027s plugin\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E ProjectileType = bullet\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E keyFire = f\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E keyFirealt = [0]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E BulletMass = 0.1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E BulletDrag = 0.02\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E BulletPower = 35\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E RocketPower = 35\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E recoilreductionfactor = 0.005\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E fireRate = 0.08\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E //lackofkrakensbanontrailrendererscompensation = 0.1 //nolonger used with AKS plugin, uncomment when using DYJ\u0027s original plugin!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E rotationSpeed = 300\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E animatedlinkfeed = true //replace with original isGatling cvar if uring DYJ\u0027s plugin, renamed to a more appropriate term given some guns have animated ammunition belts that move while firing and it doesnt make sense to rotate the barrel of a single barrel cannon? or at least the marketing department keeps complaining about customers feeling uneasy around moving parts, so we try to keep this to a bare minimum\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E shellejection = false //new cvar to designate if a gunpod will eject shells when firing, set to false if you want a small FPS boost or dislike the effect of shells ejecting from a gunpod (note: some gunpods arent designed for this, so setting it to true if it was originally false can have side effects like shells coming out of weird places, or spawning in mid air 20 meters behind the ship, or even not spawning in the 1st place, you have been warned)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E heatProduction = 500\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Muzzlesize = 0.5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E}\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMODULE\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E{\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E name = ModuleAnimateHeat\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E ThermalAnim = Thermalanim\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E}\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E}\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the \u0022keyFire = joystick button 0\u0022 you need the change the \u0022joystick button 0\u0022 to whatever button on your keyboard that you like.
