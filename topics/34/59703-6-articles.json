It doesnt appear to change anything for me, and the readme indicates that it should change the hangar scale? It does nothing for me. It seems to jet out to max distance for my bigger ships forcing me to scroll for almost a full minute just to get close enough to work, and the camera becomes super slow and lethargic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERealistically, I only need the camera to zoom to about half again it\u0027s default. Is there a way to set that up? I use mostly the SPH, and the largest ship i\u0027ll ever build will be about 100 meters (which is my space carrier).\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, that\u0027s a bit too much zoom out then for sure.

It appears that it is scaled based on the size of the ship. My 100m long carrier zooms way ridiculously out but smaller fighters are as close as i\u0027m used to. The issue is that with my bigger ships (I have 2 i\u0027m working on) the zoom it\u0027s set to on load is unusably far. I still like to be up close so I can adjust all those tiny details, but it seems it\u0027s almost all the way out to max.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gimpy","CreatedById":139860,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-22T05:46:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirstly, thanks Snjo for creating this awesome tool. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do have a problem however.
