To remedy this, I made a series of graduated decouplers based on NovaSilisko\\\u0027s mini-decoupler from the SDIR pack, released here with Nova\\\u0027s permission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bar6o.png\u0022 alt=\u0022bar6o.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJettison force is scaled for a variety of stacks, with masses increasing for the higher-force decouplers. At the low end, there\\\u0027s a null-force (violet) decoupler for precision payload launch; fire then gently scoot away with RCS. On the high end, the Zenith (red) version is enough to clear huge stacks quickly. Medium (green) is a drop-in replacement for the standard decoupler. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EDownload:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./?47ta308a273v9ao\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ETuned Decouplers (Main Edition) v1\u003C/a\u003E For use with mainline KSP \u002B mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./?4hyh361p4bd644m\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ETuned Decouplers (Silisko Edition) v1\u003C/a\u003E This release is balanced for KSP Silisko Edition.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease let me know if you have issues or would like to suggest different settings.
