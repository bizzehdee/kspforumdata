Hell, he was just \u0022some bassist\u0022 until he hooked up with them. Because of this band, he got to be in a few movies, date a few supermodels, write a few songs, and in a few years will be the only one in the band left with money because he\u0027s been shipping it home to mom and she\u0027s been hanging on to it. While the drummer, guitarist, and vocalist are all screaming in the background about the new direction for their music, they forget about the bassist. He\u0027s in the back practicing for the show and glueing up his fingers like it\u0027s no big deal. He knows that as a bassist, he\u0027ll be able to get a job in just about any band that needs one.
