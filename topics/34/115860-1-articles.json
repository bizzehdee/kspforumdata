There are three variants of the M134 Minigun, a fixed one, good for helicopters, a rotatable one, good for a tail turret or anti-air and lastly a aerodynamic one, great for use on high speed aircraft.

A mini gun is man portable like the M134 that uses Nato 5.56x51 ammo. What you have is a Gatling Cannon or Rotary Cannon like the GE GAU-8 on the A-10 Thunderbolt 2 (AKA Warthog).

Mini-guns are not man portable. It is an electrically powered gun, not exactly logistically sound to carry it around in the field. They are called mini because they are smaller than other weapons with similar firing mechanisms (ie the Vulcan). The gun comes from the fact that it uses a gun caliber (smaller than 20mm). The M134 uses 7.62x51 Nato and weighs between 41 and 85 pounds, and is usually mounted on helicopters, Humvees or boarding craft. I have never heard of the 134 being carried and fired in combat."},{"CreatedByName":"Vahal","CreatedById":93285,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T09:43:32Z","Content":"NO gatling gun was a man portable weapon, even the XM214 who is the 5.56x45 variant, M134 being 7.62x51. Reason one, battery supply, the XM214 drained power wuite rapidly from its 6-pak. Reason two, the weight, the lighter of minguns weight 11kg ALONE and empty. with battery, ammunitions and pack, it\u0027s barely bearable... Enjoy your 39kg for several seconds of fire. Reason three, recoil, the XM214 who is the tiniest produce ONE HUNDRED kilos of recoil M134 Minigun is one third bigger... Of course you can lower the rate of fire to reduce the recoil, but in this case what\u0027s the point to have this heavy and cumbersome stuff when you can have a nice and effective SAW. \n\nM134 was never used as man portable weapon, 25kg empty, 60 with it\u0027s standard load, it will throw its shooter after one second due to is 135kg of recoil at 6000rd/min."},{"CreatedByName":"sashan","CreatedById":98897,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T11:06:43Z","Content":"There was a proper model of Minigun but with improper ammo and setup in one of BDarmory addons.
