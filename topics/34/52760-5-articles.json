The light itself is provided by the Unity scene, which means its brightness and range is preset. You can make the light dimmer by lowering the RGB values across the board as peteletroll said. I often do that with the landing gear lights because I think they\u0027re overly bright.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately there\u0027s no way to as far as I know (short of making a plugin) to change the intensity of the light. This means if you wanted it to be brighter, then you\u0027re out of luck.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI specifically designed these to be darker and with a yellow tint when compared to the stock lights, as before tweakables you couldn\u0027t adjust the stock lights in any way. I wanted something a little darker, and something that would sit more flush. With tweakables, the lights now annoyingly default to pure white, and you can lower the brightness of the stock model as well as clip them into stuff if you want.
