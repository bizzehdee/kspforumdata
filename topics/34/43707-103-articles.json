As you point out, travelling at exactly the same direction as a slope will return a gradient of zero - which is nonsense, or more correctly, there is a gradient of zero in that direction only. Conversely, approaching a slope at 90 degrees would yield the correct slope, but again, only in that direction of travel. One may argue the chances of travelling EXACTLY in the same direction as a grade is 2 in 360 degrees. That is, you would have to travel exactly east or exactly west in your example to get a gradient of zero. The chances of that happening is less than 1%. However, you do have a point in that the closer an approach to a slope is to perpendicular, the more accurate the reading of the slope will be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs stated in the blog, this is not a perfect solution but I\u0027m hoping a C# programmer can recognise there is a huge void in this space and even if terrain can\u0027t be avoided on all axis, then avoiding terrain on just one axis will give a bot a fighting chance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother approach I considered is to get a better idea of terrain all around by moving laterally across a 200m x 200m area during descent and then having a genuine idea of the terrain below it and deciding where to land accordingly. You would need a minimum of five data points (middle \u002B four corners) or for better resolution, nine data points (middle plus 8 points around it). You could go 4x4 data points or 5x5 etc for more sophistication.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll this is probably well outside the realm of kOS at this point unfortunately so this moves into the space of a c# plugin. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirine","CreatedById":74830,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-06T09:14:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi all, Sorry to say that I do not have times to browse through 257 pages of thread...Just a few question needed some answer.

As you point out, travelling at exactly the same direction as a slope will return a gradient of zero - which is nonsense, or more correctly, there is a gradient of zero in that direction only. Conversely, approaching a slope at 90 degrees would yield the correct slope, but again, only in that direction of travel. One may argue the chances of travelling EXACTLY in the same direction as a grade is 2 in 360 degrees. That is, you would have to travel exactly east or exactly west in your example to get a gradient of zero.\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI picked the simplest example to illustrate the problem and assumed you\u0027d extrapolate from that to understanding the more general case problem. It\u0027s still a problem if you read a much flatter slope than is really there even if it\u0027s not reading all the way down to zero. Reporting a slope of, say, 0.2 when it\u0027s really 0.8 is still a major problem. So the problem will happen a LOT more often than you\u0027re claiming. Slopes in KSP are rarely going to be zero. Only on a few worlds that have \u0027sea level\u0027 ground, like Minmus, will that happen. So the code will actually have to have a tolerance cutoff to be effective, say for example, \u0022it\u0027s okay to land on a slope of 0.2 or less\u0022, rather than trying to find an absolutely zero slope. And that means, that the problem doesn\u0027t just occur when going only exactly perpendicular to the slope. It happens when going *close enough* to perpendicular to the slope to read falsely small enough numbers to fall below that tolerance window (which is NOT going to be zero) when the terrain isn\u0027t really that flat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow do I know?

My lander has exactly this problem and it happens a lot more often than you imply.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo make it work in kOS is going to require either arrays (to store a grid of different measurements as you drift in multiple directions, to make a small surface map), or directional ground radar that realistically aims in the direction the bottom of the ship is pointed rather than radar that aims straight vertical regardless of the craft\u0027s orientation (which is what KSP has now). With radar that aims with the craft, you could just rotate a bit in the crosswise direction to check the slope perpendicular to your travel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"togfox","CreatedById":17083,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-06T11:18:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks Steven.
