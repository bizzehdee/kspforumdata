Installing B9 on my old install worked fine, and everything worked...but due to old and outdated mods and having a messy bunch of files of forgotten purpose, I chose to completely reinstall KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far, all I have installed is KSP, MechJeb, and B9. But NO MATTER WHAT I DO, when I load up the game, most of the B9 parts don\u0027t have proper context menus. For example...the Strugatsky (large plane with cargo doors that comes with B9) loads up missing most of its control groups...and when I go into the action groups screen, most of the parts don\u0027t have their proper clickable buttons that would allow me to assign them. Whenever I click the cargo bays, there are NO options to open/close it. etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS.............. I merged all the necessary folders in the right places. As I said before. The install works, but I only get the full features on the older version (all the parts are there on both, but I only get functionality on the install I did on the old/non 21.1 install). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother example is with any of the VTOL craft. You have to use control groups for them, and since the normal options don\u0027t come up, I can\u0027t use them at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing I\u0027ve noticed is that NONE of the popup boxes show up anymore, like the ones that show up when clicking a cargo bay door in the control-group screen, or when using the \u0022data chip\u0022 part that brings up a message every time you hit the launchpad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve done everything I can think of and have reinstalled everything multiple times, and I can\u0027t find a post anywhere about it.

Firefox and Chrome store the link for failed and finished files even if the download was incomplete or corrupt. Paste the link inside FlashGet and no more failed downloads.
