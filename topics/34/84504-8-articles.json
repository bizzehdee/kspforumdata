Say you\u0027re going to land with a spaceplane, maybe you want to descend fast (assuming you don\u0027t use deadly reentry), so you can set 0 or even a negative AoA for \u0022entry\u0022 and \u0022high\u0022, then give time to your plane to slow down by setting a small horizon angle for \u0022low\u0022 (for example -5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0), and finally set horizon to 0\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 for \u0022ground\u0022 so that you arrive with a low vertical speed. The mod assumes your craft is oriented as specified during the prediction, and interpolates between each angle for intermediate altitudes. This is exactly what the square indicates on the nav ball if you set the impact position as target. The circle on the other hand adds an offset showing the general direction you should point at to correct the trajectory (if you have drifted from it) ; but that\u0027s only a general indication, you don\u0027t actually have to point at it (for example if it\u0027s way above the square, you can just point a little bit above the square which should make the circle go down slowly until you\u0027re back on a good trajectory). Oh, and I\u0027m not responsible if you break your craft by using aggressive AoA, you can blame ferram4 for that though ;-)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Youen","CreatedById":116909,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-24T10:32:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Jasmir\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Jasmir\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHi there,\u003Cp\u003Ei tested it yesterday, and i found out that the firespitter airbrakes are not accountet in the prediction.
