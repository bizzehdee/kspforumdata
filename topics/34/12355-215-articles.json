To keep one rover from drifting off while replacing the rover stacked in the middle, I docked it to a port on the side of the ship\u0027s core before undocking and landing the kethane conversion rover to land and recover.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter bringing up the replacement conversion rover (with moar quantum struts on its Rockomax decouplers) and getting it docked butt end first after first nose to nose docking to transfer fuel and mono from the booster - I undocked the other rover then gave it a little boost away with RCS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce it was far enough off, I slowed up with a counter-burst then used PAR\u002B to rotate so I could use RCS to thrust towards the nose of the ship. Then I set control to the bottom docking port and used TGT- so it\u0027d point away from the target port. I then started thrusting forward a bit so the rover would cut across the nose for easy docking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce out in front, I shut off SASS and enabled the docking AP with force roll.

After it did the initial deobit burn it kept flipping this way and that, constantly doing corrections and overshooting about 100%. It settled down when I clicked abort autoland then immediately clicked VAB and land at target. It did one more correction burn then settled down to a proper landing, but missed the VAB, landing on the track between it and the pad. Oh well, down safe!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve noticed this same overcorrect this way, then that way, then another way on craft with the ability to rotate quickly.

The default is pretty low 0.5? 0.05? Setting it higher will let MJ decide \u0027ok that\u0027s close enough\u0027 which will also stop that bit where it keeps turning 180 to trim the delta-V because it overshot.
