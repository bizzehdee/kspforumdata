I say this because current plans for human exploration involve asteroid visits just out of Earth SOI. Therefore this may be very realistic and eventually exciting to do exploration missions to an asteroid. It also may make carreer with this mod fairly easier scince after Mun missions players could turn on to explore something gives them quite a lot of science points before taking a way too huge leap after Mun to Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MedievalNerd","CreatedById":84735,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-28T15:11:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHowdy,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I\u0027ve been messing around with the weird launch pad issue that makes the clamps either disconnect or the whole ship.

But I was hoping that more information about the symptoms might help uncover what is causing this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeems everytime the physics engine kicks in, it shoves things to the side.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrying to compare it to the stock way this happens, it appears that when the physics kick in, rather than applying a force that runs down the lenght of the rocket. (IE, when you appear most of the time you can see a slightly bouncing up/down going on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut with Real World, it seems to be applying it sideways. So each time you load physics the rocket gets a kick to the side. Which probably why the launch clamps hate this. I noticed that if I use a pair of launch clamps, left \u0026amp; right, the left one always seems to disconnect. Which seems to confirm this weird \u0027push to the right\u0027. To be more precise a push towards the 90\u0027 heading.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill, using Nathan\u0027s tip of using a decoupler with struts as a \u0022base\u0022, in combination with Ferams new plugin with stability joints, it seems launching rockets isn\u0027t impossible anymore.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully this is somewhat helpful.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dimovski","CreatedById":53976,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-28T16:08:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWould placing them on headings 180 and 0 fix it then?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AndreyATGB","CreatedById":62674,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-28T17:13:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022dimovski\u0022 data-cite=\u0022dimovski\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWould placing them on headings 180 and 0 fix it then?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInteresting, I\u0027ll definitely try this.
