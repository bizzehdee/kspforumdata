The latest version\u00A0is built against the 1.2.2 release assemblies and should work with any 1.2.x version but is unlikely to\u00A0work in any older version. For compatibility with older versions of KSP, please see the older versions available on the Curse download page or\u00A0from DropBox below.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSimply put, the plugin allows you to display a small window in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E that displays the orientation of the currently selected part as pitch, roll and yaw angles and it also allows you to enter increment values for the pitch, roll and yaw and to apply these to the selected part.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00229ylEWvW.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9ylEWvW.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt originally used a single hotkey of Mod-P (Mod being KSP\u0027s configured \u0022modifier\u0022 key which defaults to Alt on Windows and RightShift on Linux) as it doesn\u0027t clash with any of the mods I use. If you don\u0027t have a part selected then it will show or hide the window. If you do have a part selected then it will apply the angle increments to the part by simply adding the increment values to the displayed Euler angles and re-setting the rotation of the selected part. This has strange effects caused by the way that Euler angles work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVersion 0.2 introduced a new way use the plugin. The original Alt-P hotkey still works the same way but it also now overrides the handling of Mod-WASDQE in the stock game (the standard part rotation controls with the configured modifier key held down do the same as the unmodified key, rotate by 90 degrees) to instead rotate by whatever angle increment is entered into the respective field in the dialog. This allows you to set increment values to 1 (or 0.1 or even 0.01) and then have seamless, accurate rotation of parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVersion 0.2.1 fixed the handling of the standard pitch keys and makes the angle increments they use configurable. W/S and Shift-W/S no longer go in opposite directions. The \u0026lt; and \u0026gt; buttons can be used to cycle the angle setting through 120, 90, 72, 60, 45, 30, 15, 10, 5, 1, 0.1 and 0.01 degrees. The F key also adjusts the \u0022Fine\u0022 angle control (F to cycle down, Shift-F to cycle up and Mod-F to reset to 5).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVersion 0.2.2 introduced \u0022Part-relative\u0022 mode. This changes the rotation keys to act around the axes of the currently selected part rather than the usual fixed axes. E.g. if you rotate a Mk 1 plane cockpit to an odd angle and then switch to \u0022Part-relative\u0022 and roll using Q and E the part will roll around its own axis.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVersion 0.2.4.2 added the saving and loading of settings (window position, visibility and all the control settings).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVersion 0.2.4.3 made the keyboard shortcuts configurable in the settings file. To change the shortcuts you will need to run the game and enter and exit the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E once for the default settings file to be written out (in GameData\\PartAngleDisplay\\PluginData\\PartAngleDisplay\\settings.cfg). Then simply edit this file (you shouldn\u0027t even need to quit KSP) and change the three lines starting \u0022key\u0022 to be the keycodes you desire. Note that the \u0022toggle window\u0022 and \u0022apply Euler\u0022 operations always use the configured modifier key and the \u0022cycle fine\u0022 operation uses plain, shifted and modified keypresses.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVersion 0.2.4.4 added support for both the stock and Blizzy\u0027s toolbars. The use of the stock toolbar can be disabled in the settings file (useAppLaunch).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVersion 0.3.0.0 for KSP 0.90 has had to change quite a few things. The key to cycle the fine angle increment now defaults to G because the stock editor uses F. The normal angle increment can be cycled using B. The modifier key for the WASDQE keys to use the separate axis increment values now defaults to Ctrl as Mod is used to disable surface attachment which would make it impossible to adjust surface attached parts in place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVersion 0.3.0.1 for KSP 1.0.2 is simply a recompile for the new version and a minor bug fix.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVersion 0.3.1.0 for KSP 1.1 has been significantly refactored to simplify it and fix the part relative rotation that has been broken since the editor changes in KSP 0.90.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVersion 0.3.1.1 for KSP 1.1 enables the part rotation keys when the dialog is closed making it usable without ever opening the UI.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVersion 0.3.2.0 for KSP 1.2 is a straight recompile.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVersion 0.3.2.1 for KSP 1.2 now stores the key bindings as strings rather than integer values.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVersion 0.3.2.2 for KSP 1.2 fixes the loss of the toolbar button with Contract Configurator.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVersion 0.3.2.3 for KSP 1.2.x optimises the GUI code to reduce garbage creation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVersion 0.3.2.4 for KSP 1.2.x is built against KSP 1.2.2 and fixes the .version file.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca

To try reiterating : the suggested workflow is that user activates plugin GUI (the window with numbers and few buttons), then clicks the target part, now plugin is in \u0022target\u0022 mode, and all operations from there on are applied to target part. Any click on next part, any selections in part tabs, action groups, pretty anything other than going straight to editing angles CANCELS target mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis will most likely be frustrating, but it ensures that plugin does not further block any user input. Or it could be (via GUI) set to some kind of \u0022lock\u0022 mode (to keep plugin in \u0022target\u0022 mode) but that is a risk that user should be warned about a taking it on their own responsibility.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, the action group mode does just the above, but i somehow do not see it used for part geometry editing.

What if you can use same right click menu item to show GUI, or have all buttons and angle numerical feedback labels right there INSIDE menu ! That way you maintain \u0022targeted\u0022 mode of part.

If it is possible then I\u0027ll look at reading the actual key bindings so it always uses the same ones as the 5 and 90 degree rotations. I have also not tested it in the SPH so the axes for the rotations might need switching around.
