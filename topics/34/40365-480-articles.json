You can see that their max MJ usage scales up with size. The next higher size is always slightly higher than 4x of the previous, so if you want to be able to use more MJ, use a bigger engine.\u003Cp\u003EAs far as the thrust of electric engines, they have a conversion rating of x.xx kN per MJ listed for each type of fuel. Simply multiply the available MJ in the craft by the appropriate fuel type rate for your total thrust. You can easily see that the Attila\u0027s have a much higher thrust per unit MJ, but the plasmas have a much better ISP so you\u0027ll get much higher dV per unit fuel. The mission profile will dictate your engine needs, as 50k dV is useless when you can\u0027t complete your captures because you sail right out of the SOI before completing your burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI got to say that the new magnetic nozzle engines are far superior to the rest of the electric engines. They run on charged particles, not MJ, so you have to have upgraded reactor technology to use them. Simply connect a reactor that doesn\u0027t have 0.00 charged particle ratio listed; no generator needed. Also, they have zero thrust in atmosphere, so you won\u0027t be getting into orbit with them. Sadly, they don\u0027t work with microwave receivers, as those collect MJ, not charged particles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t have any information about the different microwave receivers. I only ever use the \u0022umbrella\u0022 type because being able to point the receiver regardless of craft orientation outweighs any omnidirectional efficiency the \u0022barrel\u0022 types may offer (IMHO.) With that said, though, you\u0027d imagine that the \u0022barrel\u0022 types would be better for space planes that don\u0027t need the funky drag, and are bathed by microwaves if they\u0027re close to your MW transmitters. On the other hand, if you\u0027re far enough from your transmitter that the MW source looks like a point in space, then you\u0027d think that being able to point the umbrella at that point would be better, as all receiver area is pointing at the source.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope that helps,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBolter\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe barrel types are thermal receivers; they are used for thermal rocket nozzles and thermal turbojets.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bolter","CreatedById":118092,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-16T23:33:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Lightwarrior\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Lightwarrior\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis is incorrect.\u003Cp\u003EHe3 is now tweakable in VAB, it is expensive, but available.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd you do not need to shutdown fusion reactor and use EVA, modes can be switched in context menu.

I\u0027ve actually found my warp ships to be more fuel efficient than my conventional ships most of the time. The trick is to use physics to your advantage.\u003Cp\u003ESay you want to go from Kerbin, which is orbiting at about 9.3K m/s, to Eve, which is currently on the opposite side of the sun orbiting at about 10.8K m/s. If you warp straight there the total delta-v difference is about 20.1k m/s which is a huge difference compared to the 2.3K delta-v of a rather optimal transition. But you can actually off set that by using gravity assist to change your speed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo let\u0027s say looking at the solar systems straight down Kerbin is on the bottom below the sun and Eve is on the top above it. I set the ship to warp past the sun on the right side but break out of warp just before passing the sun. So now you are in fairly close elliptical orbit of the sun. It will slow you down fairly quickly and then send you heading back towards the sun which also happens to be in the same direction Eve is traveling. Wait until you speed gets fairly close to that of Eve and then warp out towards Eve. Sometimes it can take a few micro warp jumps near the sun to get your speed just right but when you do it makes up a huge difference in the amount of Delta-v needed to enter orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor planets with an atmosphere like Eve I often try to align my approach vector so I can use atmospheric breaking. Skimming the atmosphere can slow you down to orbital speeds and really cut down on the need for fuel on your limited Delta-V. For planets without atmosphere I try to do as many micro-warp jumps around the planet to use it\u0027s gravity to slow me down until I get into an acceptable window where I won\u0027t use that much Delta-v to achieve orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will admit this method requires a huge amount of skill as there are currently no tools to automate it, as far as I know. It requires a lot of eye balling and winging it since you can\u0027t directly compare trajectories along with speed, as well as not being able to directly target locations with warp drive, you simply have to point in the direction and hope the angle is correct along with hitting the stop key on time. I recommend putting the warp go/stop in an action group. But even if you can\u0027t get it exact being able to at least ball park could be the difference between spending 20K Delta-V and about 3-5K Delta-V on a rough guess method. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far I think my one trip to Eve where I only used up like 300 Delta-V was best. Most of the times it\u0027s a 1-2K Delta-V burn to enter orbit around a planet which is about what you\u0027d need to burn to leave Kerbin orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAwesomeness.
