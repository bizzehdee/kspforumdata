I seem to be having an issue tho with my station, I\u0027m attempting to complete 4x creature comfort experiments, (I have previously completed 2 or so before) the Eureka Resource is acting normal (Will continue to be produced while away time-warping) but the bioproducts will not produce if I do not have my station active? I\u0027m sure I\u0027ve done this before with them producing normally if I\u0027m not focused. When I am focused they do produce so its not seemingly an issue with production.

I think that maybe KSP couldn\u0027t keep up with the calculations? Considering that the station was only orbiting at 75km from Kerbin this would seem resonable.

Only problem I\u0027ve found (and am now trying to solve) is that rounding errors seem to be preventing Eurekas from accumulating while playing at real-time (outside of Time Warp).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E0.23 changed Science a lot less than I expected. The Science Lab (which ended up being the Processing Lab) turns out to not have any real overlap with my mod, so things won\u0027t be changing all that much. I\u0027ll be releasing models for the experiment pods, but the rest are still in-progress. Biggest new feature will be a \u0022prototype\u0022 docking port that can\u0027t transfer fuel that I\u0027ll place early in the tree, so I can place my other parts earlier in the tree where they\u0027ll be more useful.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
