Helicopters are hard!\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyou could probibly support both libraries, conditionally using one or the other based on your platform. the data they output are pretty much the same, though linuxtrack has a few other functions to export. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eit would be nice if we could support all tracking devices on all platforms, but no unified multiplatform head tracking library exists. for example linuxtrack doesnt look like it supports inertial trackers. ftnoir and opentrack, don\u0027t support trackir cameras, freetrack does albeit kind of unofficially, but it is the most cumbersome to setup and quite well aged. i suppose its possible to support all the interfaces (except, ironically, naturalpoint\u0027s), having some kind of autodetect. the freetrack protocol does seem to hit most of the bases though, except for linux/osx. so two protocols is probibly enough.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Carcharoth","CreatedById":108687,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-15T16:15:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello, I have a little question, this mod is broken on KSP v0.23.5?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"z26","CreatedById":91677,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-17T06:55:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat would be pretty cool combined with the first person eva of lazorsystems!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Carcharoth","CreatedById":108687,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-17T16:03:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks, I made a mistake and did not put the dll in the KSP main directory.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Persa","CreatedById":83164,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-17T20:08:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u002B1 for this to continue development!
