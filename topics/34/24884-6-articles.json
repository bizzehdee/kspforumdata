My fear is that my Kerbals will die when I switch to a different ship/mission for too long of CO2 poisoning. I havent confirmed this but I believe this will also happen with the Oxygen recycler since its also activated via menu. Do the Kerbals consume/produce O2/CO2 even when not switched to that flight? (I am assuming yes but not 100% sure)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf yes is there a way around this problem??\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe module only runs if the ship is currently active. I am working on adding consumption calculations for inactive ships but even when that is added kill checks will only ever be done on the active ship and they\u0027re only made once every hour after at least one hour (though this interval can be changed in the configuration file). Worse case you\u0027ll ever have is switching to a ship to find it out of oxygen and needing to switch off of it before the hour has elapsed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022mdosogne\u0022 data-cite=\u0022mdosogne\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFirst, thank you so much for writing this mod!\u003Cp\u003EI have an idea regarding the intakes killing Kerbals: use two resource types to distinguish between \u0027ambient CO2\u0027 and \u0027compressed CO2\u0027? Scrubbers could then convert ambient CO2 into compressed CO2. Intakes convert atmosphere into compressed CO2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf there\u0027s an excess of CO2 and nowhere to store it, it could be vented (no need for a separate part here; it can be done automatically by an overpressure valve).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving worked in the aerospace industry for nearly 10 years on cockpit display systems, I must insist that ALL command modules should consume electric charge. Modules with crew should consume more than unmanned modules because in addition to the communication systems and the built-in SAS, the flight instrumentation consumes power. Once a command modules is hacked to consume power, it becomes inoperable when you run out of power. As such I see no reason to kill the crew simply for lack of power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you consider that the crew could freeze without power, remember that in space there is no atmosphere into which heat can be lost due to convection (it is lost through a process called black body radiation). That said, decompression of oxygen requires heat for it to be breathable (ideal gas law); you could also model oxygen in two forms (ambient and compressed) but I don\u0027t feel it\u0027s necessary since the crew will die from CO2 build up while the scrubber is unpowered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like this idea for handling CO2 though I\u0027m not sure it\u0027s worth adding an additional resource. There\u0027s also the fact that unless there\u0027s a use for uncompressed CO2 there\u0027s no reason to not use the scrubbers to convert it to compressed CO2. I think if a system is added it should be there to give the player a choice. Still automatic systems to vent excess CO2 make a lot of sense and I\u0027ll keep this in mind when I move on to focusing on the intake systems\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Moon Goddess\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Moon Goddess\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDoes custom resources mean I can track water?
