I\u0027ve built the ship from the pod down (guess I\u0027m having trouble getting used to the newfangled \u0022anything can be root\u0022 idea), I attached decouplers in 6x symmetry, and then added tanks in 6x symmetry but it still refuses to place any fuel lines. If I build from the bottom up it works fine. Unfortunately that just isn\u0027t how I build things, I tend to create the payload and then guestimate what I need to lift it (none of these Manley-style, pen-and-paper calculations for me, that sounds like work).\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can have your command pod as the root part. The restriction is that the central tank needs to be higher up in the internal part tree than the tanks in symmetry.
