Bonus points if you can scan from orbit so we can put probes in orbit to scan for usable resources.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScientific Potentiator - Enumerates the science generation potential of the location. (I know its been suggested before, I just liked the name)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThermal Management:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECooling Vent - A part attached to a water(or whatever else) tank which uses up water to remove waste heat from the craft. Gives you a consumable coolant to cool the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThermal Recyclonator - Takes in waste heat and outputs thermal energy into an attached generator. It could be attached to a generator and turn waste heat into thermal energy at a loss, generating more energy at the cost of extra weight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThermovoltaic Cell - Captures thermal energy from the sun and directly feeds an attached generator. A different way to capture energy from the sun, would be more efficient the closer you are with the benefit of perhaps being less prone to breakage than solar panels. Probably less efficient overall than a solar panel but not as fragile. Could also work from atmospheric heating?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPower Management:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHV Transformer - When activated, turns 1000 electric charge into 1 MJ allowing the use of other power generating parts (stock or mod) to produce MJ. Could be lossy at your discretion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESupercapacitator - Stores up a large amount of MJ for use and MJ are pulled from the supercapacitator first. Place some of these on your small ships and dock ships to recharge! This would let me build small autonomous utility tugs that run on a battery rather than including generators or power dishes on every ship. Also lets you keep some power in reserve in case you unexpectedly (or due to bad power management) run out of power and need to use a reserve. Should have a button to allow/disallow the ship pulling MJ from this (but always allow filling) so it can act as a proper reserve.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ashtoruin","CreatedById":83692,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-03T18:41:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlright...
