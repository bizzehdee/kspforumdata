I can get things off the runway and have them fly straight, but if I try to maneuver, unless I turn veeeeeeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrryyy slowly (as in a few minutes to complete a full turn, just barely tapping controls), just about every plane I\u0027ve built flips over or goes into a spin. It\u0027s as if there\u0027s not actually any lift perpendicular to/pushing upward from below the wings anymore if I move the plane off of straight and level, so if I pull up - the angle of the plane changes, but not its actual direction of movement, if that makes any sense - or at least it doesn\u0027t change at a rate that that makes any sense for the size of wings or how the plane looks.

I\u0027d post some crafts, too, if exchanging them wasn\u0027t so problematic right now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess one thing that worsens the issue is the lack of any meaningful statistics - all the display mods I tried (VOID, NanoGauges) that display info for FAR don\u0027t seem to work with NEAR yet - basically, with NEAR\u0027s simplified model, wouldn\u0027t it be easy to display one drag coefficient for going up (VAB) or forward (SPH)? And perhaps a center of drag marker... If I don\u0027t forget something obvious, that\u0027s all that\u0027s needed to predict vehicle behaviour (you could check angles of attack by turning the whole vehicle in the editor).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eninja edit: Question - has the center of lift shown in the editor any relevance with NEAR?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dzikakulka","CreatedById":116606,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-11T12:11:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would also enjoy some info window or right-click-debug toggle - if it\u0027s not already implemented and I\u0027m just dumb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESometimes I build... weird... things and it would be great to see if drag is distributed properly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the graet mod!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
