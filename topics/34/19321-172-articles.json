The phantom resistance amplifies absurdly, much like the old rigidbody issues in earlier KSP versions caused parts to jostle themselves into oblivion, and the whole plane inevitably breaks apart due to aerodynamic failure or goes into an impossible-to-correct spin that leaves the plane only able to face nose-first towards the ground at any altitude. It\u0027s somewhat of a problem to be unable to reach any speed greater than mach 2 when you\u0027re trying to get to space, I find, so it seems to me that either some suggestions for a workaround solution to this issue or a proper fix is in order.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, make sure everyone knows how ticked off you are!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDefinitely do not post any example craft that you might be having trouble with.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRender","CreatedById":10651,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-19T21:29:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Starwaster\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Starwaster\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYes, make sure everyone knows how ticked off you are!\u003Cp\u003EDefinitely do not post any example craft that you might be having trouble with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPardon me for not being particularly inclined to be polite about an issue that\u0027s been getting on my nerves for months on end.
