The primary difference is that there is no indicator on the small map for scanning altitude (the blinking orange/green lights). Instead, all SCANsat sensors display an altitude indicator in their right-click context menu. Scanning altitude is also indicated in the VAB for each part.

But the process will basically work the same way. Module Manager configs (MM isn\u0027t included with SCANsat or Kethane, so you\u0027ll need to have that) add SCANsat modules to the Kethane scanners. These can be used directly in the same manner as the ORSX scanners; they work in the background and save their scanning data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is also possible to take scanning data already collected using standard Kethane scanners and incorporate those into SCANsat. This is done automatically every time you load or switch to Kethane resources. Data can also be transferred from SCANsat, back to Kethane using a button in the settings menu. It is a little finicky about updating the Kethane grid (it usually requires a reload, or changing scenes), but that obviously isn\u0027t a problem right now.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CowsCantFly","CreatedById":116711,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-04T01:53:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eam i the only one that didnt get the MapTraq part in the download and if so any ideas on how to get it?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ExplorerKlatt","CreatedById":107424,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-04T02:56:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe maptraq part has been deprecated.
