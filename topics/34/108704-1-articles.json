Do you also own the Making History Expansion? Do you also not really care about the Mission Builder aspects of Making History? And do you also maybe want to use the Making History parts? And do you like it when KSP uses a bit less memory? And do you also not care about using alternate launch sites without using other mods? ![:blush:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif \u0022:blush:\u0022)\n\nIf you answered yes six times then this mod is for you.\n\nIt simply prevents KSP from loading all of the Mission Builder components of Making History, allowing for shorter load times and less memory usage in-game.\n\n- 15 - 30s shorter load times\n- ~250 - 350MB less RAM usage\n- All Making History parts still available for use in game\n- Fully reversible by removing the addon\n- It also has the side effect of not allowing launching from the alternate launch sites, as those are a feature of the expansion\n\nIt works by temporarily renaming the Making History expansion key file at the start of the loading process. At the end of loading it will rename the file back to its original name, it will also reset the file name if you close KSP before it has loaded. If KSP crashed during loading then it will try to reset the name the next time KSP successfully loads to the Main Menu. If you remove the addon Making History should load and function as before.\n\nReleased under the [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)\n\n**One Window - 4.0**\n\n![vXBpqGw.png](http://i.imgur.com/vXBpqGw.png)\n\nDownload from [Space Dock](https://spacedock.info/mod/1493/One%20Window) | [Curse Forge](https://kerbal.curseforge.com/projects/one-window)\n\nDownload from [GitHub](https://github.com/DMagic1/KSP_OneWindow/releases/latest)\n\n[![CKAN-Indexed-brightgreen.svg](https://img.shields.io/badge/CKAN-Indexed-brightgreen.svg)](https://github.com/KSP-CKAN/CKAN/)\n\nSource is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/DMagic1/KSP_OneWindow).\n\nThis addon provides a single window to store all of the screen messages that KSP displays. The name (One window... to rule them all, screen messages, not other rings ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022;)\u0022)) and idea is shamelessly stolen from [@Spricigo](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/166502-spricigo/) in this [thread](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/163869-one-window/).\n\nThere are four icons in the top-right corner that are used to select which messages to display based on their location on-screen:\n\n- Upper-left\n- Upper-right\n- Upper-center\n- Lower-center\n\nA note on usage: it is recommended to leave the Lower-center messages disabled. Some of these (the fairings messages in the editor and the messages for EVA Kerbals interacting with ladders in particular) are handled somewhat differently by KSP and can result in numerous repeated messages being logged to the message window. This location is rarely used for important information.\n\nAll messages are logged and stored, even if their display is inactivated in the window, simply activate the desired message location and all messages will be displayed in order with the latest messages on top.\n\nThere are five icons in the top-left. The first three toggle additional information:\n\n- Message location icon\n- Message real time from your PC clock (time display format can be edited from the GameData/OneWindow/PluginData/Settings.cfg file using the TimeFormat line and standard C# time string formats, default is H:mm:ss, which uses 24 hour clock notation)\n- KSP time and date\n\nThe fourth icon controls whether messages are displayed in both the window and their standard on-screen location. If a particular message location is disabled (using the icons in the top-right), they will automatically display in their standard location on-screen.\n\nThe fifth icon is used to toggle the settings menu, shown along the bottom of the window. This menu has three functions:\n\n- A button to print all of the currently displayed messages to the log file\n- A button to cycle through four different font sizes for the messages\n- A slider and button to adjust the UI scale for the window\n\nThe location and open/closed status of the mod is saved separately for each scene (Space Center, Tracking Station, Editor, and Flight). The little arrow at the bottom-right can be used to re-size the window.\n\nChange Log:\n\nSpoiler\n\nv4.0  \n\n- Update for KSP 1.8\n\nv3.0  \n\n- Update for KSP 1.4\n\nv2.0  \n\n- Added additional settings menu  \n\n     - Cycle between 4 different font sizes  \n\n     - Adjust window UI scale\n\nReleased under the [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)\n\n**Science Relay - 6.0**\n\n**![LsStoDH.png](http://i.imgur.com/LsStoDH.png)**\n\nDownload from [Space Dock](http://spacedock.info/mod/988/Science%20Relay) | [Curse Forge](https://kerbal.curseforge.com/projects/science-relay)\n\nDownload from [GitHub](https://github.com/DMagic1/KSP_Science_Relay/releases/latest)\n\n[![CKAN-Indexed-brightgreen.svg](https://img.shields.io/badge/CKAN-Indexed-brightgreen.svg)](https://github.com/KSP-CKAN/CKAN/)\n\n![Spanish](http://i.imgur.com/TilRiNO.png) By [@Deltathiago98](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/163909-deltathiago98/)  |  ![Russian](http://i.imgur.com/FIMWlqt.png) By [@KerbOrbiter](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/58103-kerborbiter/)  |  ![Chinese](http://i.imgur.com/Pcstl5v.png) By [@Summerfirefly](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/107915-summerfirefly/)\n\nSource is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/DMagic1/KSP_Science_Relay).\n\nThis addon provides a new button for the Experiment Results window that allows for the transmission of science between different vessels. With CommNet on, clicking on the button will provide a list of all connected vessels (all vessels are shown if CommNet is off). Any vessel with a ModuleScienceContainer (can also be limited to only Science Labs) can receive transmissions; several probe cores, all command pods, the MPL science lab, and the new science container use this module (only stock ModuleScienceContainer, and ModuleScienceLab are recognized).\n\nExperiment transmission has several factors:\n\n- If the experiment has a transmission level below 100% a transmission boost will also be calculated.\n    - This value may not match the value shown in the main window, since it is calculated separately for each connected vessel.\n- The amount of science data transmitted is dependent on the transmission level\n    - If it is below 100% then not all of the data will be received\n    - This is represented by the \u0022Data Size\u0022 field in the experiment results window\n    - The data received by the other vessel will have its transmission level set to 100%\n        - This allows for subsequent transmission without further losses\n    - The logic behind this is that only a certain amount of data is transmittable, but that amount can be repeatedly transmitted\n- Data can be transmitted between two vessels without relay antennas\n    - The stock CommNet does not seem to model this, so the connection network in the map does not represent all available targets\n    - Anything in direct transmission range of the current vessel, or within range of any vessel connected to the current vessel through relays is available\n- The system will attempt find containers that allow for repeat experiments, or that don\u0027t already have a copy of the same data\n    - If nothing is found it will be returned to the source vessel at the full value\n- Transmission uses antennas the same way as standard data transmission\n    - This applies to the out-of-power data return as well\n\nDifficulty options are available to limit the receiving vessels to only those with an MPL science lab, to require a relay antenna, to limit transmission boosts to only vessels with a crewed lab, to disable the transmission boost, and to reduce the value of the boost.\n\n**Possible Issues:**\n\n- It is possible that some vessels may be improperly marked as receiving targets, or missed as targets\n- There may be issues with attempting to transmit all open science results\n\nChange Log:\n\nSpoiler\n\nv6.0  \n\n- Update for KSP 1.8\n\nv5.1  \n\n- Fix bugs with detecting connected vessels\n\nv5.0  \n\n- Update for KSP 1.4\n\nv4.2  \n\n- Lots of data printed to log file  \n\n      - Info about connected vessels detected  \n\n      - Info about transmission success/failure  \n\n      - More error messages  \n\n- Recompile for KSP 1.3.1\n\nv4.1  \n\n- Added Chinese (Summerfirefly), Spanish (Deltathiago98), and Russian (KerbOrbiter) translations\n\nv4.0  \n\n- Updated for KSP 1.3\n\n- Localization support added  \n\n       - Partial support for all stock languages  \n\n       - Translations required for the settings text and some of the UI text\n\nv3.1\n\n- Fix transmission boost penalty slider in settings menu  \n\n- Fix for bug when aborting transmission to another vessel\n\nv3.0  \n\n- Preserve science data transmission level for results with 0 remaining science\n\nv2.1  \n\n- .version file update for AVC; no code changes\n\nv2.0  \n\n- Add an option to require a relay antenna on the target vessel\n\nReleased under the [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)\n\n**Debug Input Stifle - 1.0**\n\n**![tu3jdU1.png](http://i.imgur.com/tu3jdU1.png)**\n\nDownload from [GitHub](https://github.com/DMagic1/KSP_DebugStifle/releases/latest)\n\nThis is a little utility mod probably best suited for other modders, or anyone who spends a lot of time with the debug panel open.\n\nI\u0027ve noticed that the debug console\u0027s input field can sometimes just randomly steal the focus and start intercepting key commands, it\u0027s really annoying (though maybe I\u0027m just doing something weird and this only affects me ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022)).

In the dark?\n\nDo you love finding *another* tiny part when you want to change KerbNet modes?\n\nDo you love navigating overcrowded right-click context menus to find the right button?\n\nIf so, this mod is not for you, scroll down the page and download Portrait Stats.\n\nFor all of the sane players out there, this addon provides a new Toolbar button used to control KerbNet on a vessel-wide basis. Click the button and the program will scan your vessel for all available KerbNet parts and open a window with all accessible modes.\n\nIt allows for a map orientation toggle to be added to the window, and allows for adjusting the UI scale of the window.\n\nIt also features a number of options for saving the last used state and for determining the FoV range for each KerbNet display type; all of these options can be found in the in-game settings menu under the \u0022DMagic Mods\u0022 tab:\n\n- Remember the last used display type: Terrain, biome, resource, etc...\n- Remember the last used grid overlay setting\n- Remember the last used auto refresh setting\n- Remember the last used FoV value\n- Disable tooltips\n\nAll of the above settings are set to off by default.\n\nThe FoV range calculation is determined by another setting with three different values (this is controlled by a slider in the settings menu, with three possible values).\n\n- On Easy mode the best possible minimum and maximum FoV values are used for all display types\n    - For instance, if you have a terrain scanner that ranges from 15-45^o^ and a resource scanner that ranges from 150-175^o^, all display types will allow for FoV values from 15-175^o^\n    - The best Anomaly Detection value will also be used for any display type\n- On Medium mode the best possible FoV values will be used for each individual display type\n    - If you have multiple terrain scanners, the low FoV range will be set by the lowest FoV scanner, and the high range by the highest scanner - this is the setting I would recommend\n    - The Anomaly Detection range will also be set for each individual type\n- On Hard mode the scanner with widest FoV range will be used for each individual display type\n\nThe addon attempts to preserve things like requirements for scanners to be deployed (such as the Narrow-Band Scanner), or any other specific requirements that would normally prevent KerbNet access. If no KerbNet modules are found on-board the Toolbar icon will be disabled.\n\nFuture plans include Blizzy\u0027s Toolbar support.\n\nChange Log:\n\nSpoiler\n\nv5.0  \n\n- Update for KSP 1.8  \n\n- Change in game settings page name\n\nv4.0  \n\n- Update for KSP 1.4\n\nv3.1  \n\n- Recompile for KSP 1.3.1\n\nv3.0  \n\n- Updated for KSP 1.3  \n\n- New toolbar icon by [@ZobrAA](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/65233-zobraa/)\n\nv2.1  \n\n- Updated for KSP 1.2.2  \n\n- Fix for scale slider in settings menu\n\nReleased under the [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)\n\n**Flexible Docking - 8.0**\n\n![U9qPilL.png](http://i.imgur.com/U9qPilL.png)\n\nDownload from [Space Dock](http://spacedock.info/mod/838/Flexible%20Docking) | [Curse Forge](http://kerbal.curseforge.com/projects/flexible-docking)\n\nDownload from [GitHub](https://github.com/DMagic1/KSP_Flexible_Docking/releases/latest)\n\n[![CKAN-Indexed-brightgreen.svg](https://img.shields.io/badge/CKAN-Indexed-brightgreen.svg)](https://github.com/KSP-CKAN/CKAN/)\n\nSource is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/DMagic1/KSP_EVA_Struts).\n\nThis addon provides a set of 0.625m, 1.25m, and 2.5m flexible docking ports. These allow for a limited amount of side-to-side translation and rotation at the docking port head. This facilitates surface docking where perfectly lining up two ports can be challenging.\n\n- The amount of movement is limited and is indicated for each port in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E info panel\n- The ports can be operated in standard mode when retracted (they will behave the same as any other port) or in flexible mode when extended\n    - When in flexible mode they will automatically seek out nearby ports when they enter the acquisition range (which can be adjusted in the config file)\n    - The magnetic strength is reduced in flexible mode (also adjusted in the config file), and is indicated in the right-click context menu\n    - A toggle is available to completely disable the magnets; this applies to both retracted and flexible modes\n- All ports use textures from their stock counterparts\n    - They will not load correctly if the stock parts are removed or altered\n- A Module Manager config file is included\n    - Support for stock contracts that request a docking port is included\n    - Connected Living Space support is included\n    - Module Manager itself is not included but is recommended if running in Career Mode\n\nBelow is a video from [@vardicd](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/75832-vardicd/) playing around with some flexible ports and demonstrating their use: ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022)\n\nSpoiler\n\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022 data-embed-src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/2YUNJzULUa0?feature=oembed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nChange Log:\n\nSpoiler\n\nv8.0  \n\n- Update for KSP 1.8\n\nv7.0  \n\n- Restock support  \n\n    - Includes white list file to prevent unloading of standard stock docking port texture files\n\nv6.0  \n\n- Update for KSP 1.4\n\nv5.0  \n\n- Updated for KSP 1.3  \n\n- Fix a bug when trying to dock two flexible docking ports together\n\nv4.0  \n\n- Fix a problem that caused docking ports to be misaligned in some cases\n\nv3.0  \n\n- Update for KSP 1.2  \n\n- Recognize ports as contract objectives  \n\n- Move parts to Coupling category\n\nv2.0  \n\n- Fix an issue with the Jr. docking port deploy animation  \n\n- Use the max rotation value set in each part\u0027s config file\n\nReleased under the [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)\n\n**EVA Struts - 6.0**\n\n![zAOQLpi.png](http://i.imgur.com/zAOQLpi.png)\n\nDownload from [Space Dock](http://spacedock.info/mod/553/EVA%20Struts) | [Curse Forge](http://kerbal.curseforge.com/projects/eva-struts)\n\nDownload from [GitHub](https://github.com/DMagic1/KSP_EVA_Struts/releases/latest)\n\n[![CKAN-Indexed-brightgreen.svg](https://img.shields.io/badge/CKAN-Indexed-brightgreen.svg)](https://github.com/KSP-CKAN/CKAN/)\n\nSource is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/DMagic1/KSP_EVA_Struts).\n\nThis addon provides a simple EVA strut. It is connected while on EVA and can be used to reinforce the connection between two parts on the same vessel.\n\nIt borrows heavily from the system designed for EVA Resource Transfer, found below, and shares the same basic functionality. The tutorials below apply, with the exception that this strut can only be used to connect two parts on the same vessel. This also prevents the strut from clipping through other parts when making the attachment.\n\nReview by KottabosGames ([@Kottabos](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/36583-kottabos/)): (note that the issue describing struts that don\u0027t detach in some situations has been fixed in version 2.0)\n\nSpoiler\n\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022 data-embed-src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/vb8da_5hVEQ?feature=oembed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nChange Log:\n\nSpoiler\n\nv6.0  \n\n- Update for KSP 1.8  \n\n- Restock support\n\nv5.0  \n\n- Update for KSP 1.4\n\nv4.1  \n\n- Fix for errors while holding EVA strut in KSP 1.3.1\n\nv4.0  \n\n- Updated for KSP 1.3\n\nv3.0   \n\n- Update for KSP 1.2  \n\n- Use Experience Effects rather than experience trait type  \n\n- Fix error on loading struts\n\nv2.0\n\n- Updated for KSP 1.1.3\n\n- Fix a bug that prevented struts from detaching after decoupling without reloading the vessel first\n\nReleased under the [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)\n\n**EVA Resource Transfer - 9.0**\n\n![LEckmBh.png](http://i.imgur.com/LEckmBh.png)\n\nDownload from [Space Dock](http://spacedock.info/mod/134) | [Curse Forge](http://kerbal.curseforge.com/ksp-mods/231830)\n\nDownload from [GitHub](https://github.com/DMagic1/KSP-EVA-Transfer/releases/latest)\n\nNote about upgrading from versions of KSP before 1.4.x:\n\nA change in the directory name for the stock fuel line required a change made to this mod from version 8.1 onward. Anyone upgrading KSP from an earlier version may have the directory name with the old spelling, as it is not overwritten during the upgrade. Anyone installing 1.4.x fresh will have the new spelling and should use EVA Transfer version 8.1.\n\nThe old directory name was:  \n\nGameData/Squad/Parts/CompoundParts/**f**uelLine\n\nthe new name is:  \n\nGameData/Squad/Parts/CompoundParts/**F**uelLine\n\nNote the difference in capitalization of the **F** in **F**uelLine. If you are using version 8.1 and the EVA Transfer part is not loading you can either use version 8.0, or change the config file in the EVATransfer folder to refer to the old spelling:\n\nThe file is:  \n\nGameData/EVATransfer/EVAFuelLine/EVAFuelLine.cfg\n\nThe line needing a change is at the top:   \n\nMODEL  \n\n{  \n\n         model = Squad/Parts/CompoundParts/FuelLine/model  (change FuelLine to fuelLine if you have upgraded KSP from an earlier version to 1.4.x)  \n\n}\n\n[![CKAN-Indexed-brightgreen.svg](https://img.shields.io/badge/CKAN-Indexed-brightgreen.svg)](https://github.com/KSP-CKAN/CKAN/)\n\nSource is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/DMagic1/KSP-EVA-Transfer).\n\nThis addon provides a simple Fuel transfer and Resource transfer pipe. It is connected while on EVA and can be used to transfer resources between two separate vessels.\n\nWhat doesn\u0027t this do?\n\n- It does not seek to replace the functionality of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E (it does, however, support \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003Eattachment while on EVA).\n    - Vessels are not actually linked together.\n    - No manual resource transfer is possible between individual resource containers; everything is handled the through the transfer window.\n    - The base of the part is not attachable on EVA (unless you are using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E), it must be added to a vessel while in the editor; only the end-point can be attached during flight.\n- It does not provide any advanced resource management options like TAC Fuel Balancer; there are only a few options for how resources are transferred, ordered by container size: smallest to largest, the reverse, or no specific order.\n\nWhat does this do?\n\n- It provides a highly configurable interface for transferring multiple resources between disconnected vessels during flight.\n- The resource transfer pipe can be attached and removed from any two vessels that are within the maximum allowable distance.\n- Individual resources can be transferred to or from each vessel using adjustable sliders.\n\nKnown Issues\n\n- The logic for preventing the pipe from clipping through other parts or terrain while connecting to its target does not work correctly.\n- The pipe end-point does not attach to the EVA backpack in the right orientation.\n- There are possible issues with connection persistence through saving and loading.\n\nSee the [GitHub documentation](https://github.com/DMagic1/KSP-EVA-Transfer/blob/master/README.md) for more details.\n\nAnd thank you whoever at Squad came up with the new CompoundParts modules and code.

You have no ... wait, as you made the mod, you probably know exactly an idea of how frustrating it is / has been to identify the damn kerbals ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nI have been looking for something like this for a while, and will most definitely check it out later today. \n\nBtw, I think it looks better with the stars horizontally than vertically.\n\nedit:\n\nI havent checked it ingame yet, but if the stars is interfering with the face of the kerbals, might be a solution to have them even smaller ?
