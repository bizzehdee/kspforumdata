Make sure the Kerbal Engineer window is not behind the mouse cursor when you press the simulate button. If you do that then you won\u0027t have this happen. What\u0027s happening is that Engineer thinks the mouse cursor is still over its window, but then the scene changes and they stop checking, so the lock gets stuck on. If you move the cursor off the window then it will clear the lock, then press the simulate button (bit don\u0027t put the cursor back over the KER window, aka, move the window out of the way)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut yes, this is a bug in engineer (that doesn\u0027t come up in normal gameplay).

The problem, and solution, are exactly what I thought (and have laid out in previous posts). KER has a lock that\u0027s getting stuck on, and not having the KER window under the cursor makes the problem not appear. Until the KER devs put out a new release that removes that lock correctly, it\u0027s up to the players to not keep making the mistake of placing the window at that location.
