I had read up on calculating the deltaV for multi-stage vehicles, and did it for one or two just to see if I could, but I can see how that would get tedious. The Flight Engineer part of the Mod is great too. I just noticed this morning that the total deltaV for my craft changes slightly when I go to the launch pad. For the first second or two it\u0027s identical to the total deltaV on the KER window in the VAB, but then the ships kind of \u0027settles\u0027 and wobbles a bit on the pad, and the deltaV total drops by a few hundred. I thought it might be something like the weight of the Kerbal himself doesn\u0027t get added until the launchpad, but the total mass doesn\u0027t change between the VAB and launchpad. Maybe it\u0027s something to do with that settling...I\u0027ll have to check and see if it happens with every craft, and to what extent.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-31T21:16:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Luckfish\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Luckfish\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFor the first second or two it\u0027s identical to the total deltaV on the KER window in the VAB, but then ... the deltaV total drops by a few hundred.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s because engines have 2 ISP values: Atmospheric and Vacuum, and as you rise you slowly go from one to the other as air pressure decreases.
