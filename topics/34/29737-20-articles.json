Also note that this addon has been updated from older KSP version. Model has .dae extension (which AFAIK is an old one since all 0.20 addons I used have .mu extension but I don\u0027t know if it works like this) and it uses some part modules which are apparently out of date (e.g. stock parachutes have \u0027module\u0027 set to \u0027Part\u0027 and there is a subsection MODULE with name=ModuleParachute, while in this addon \u0027module\u0027 is set to \u0027Parachutes\u0027 and parachute parameters are put directly into part section (and they\u0027re a bit different than for \u0027ModuleParachute\u0027)).

You get progressively greater acceleration as you get deeper into the atmosphere (each change of the colour bar results in stronger deceleration). I had read the issue was that some of the parts included the wrong node scaling, so FAR couldn\u0027t calculate the size. But that should have been fixed now in v2.3 (except for the 6.25m inflatable, that will act weird).\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, without a properly sized heat shield, deceleration happens normally for me on the kerbal X mk 1-2 pod.
