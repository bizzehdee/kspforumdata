Initial small scale tests were good, not too much in the way of camera weirdness, it occasionally reverted to the root part\u0027s COM but upon exiting and reloading the craft it managed to fix it. But large scale tests rarely ended with the craft breaking up if it was loaded from a landed position on the sea floor. Gameplay-wise this does open up more opportunities for Kethane and the like but it is very time consuming when compared to extra planetary mining and exploitation. Unless there was a specific reason to go to the ocean floor there isn\u0027t much reason, the process was extremely slow and frustrating. Perhaps better craft design on my part could have solved this problem. But for anyone willing to replicate this, inside the underwatercamera.cs is a public double Crushingdepth I set mine to -4200 figuring that would be deeper than I would ever need.
