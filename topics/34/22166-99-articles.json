If you equip that vessel with KAS, you can then very easily land tankers, that have nothing but lots of storage space for the material you are interested it (a fuel tanker, an RCS tanker, a Kethane tanker, etc.) close to the drilling rig, which can connect up a hose, suck the green goop out of the ground, convert it to whatever you are after, and pump it straight into the waiting tanker, it doesn\u0027t need much storage on the drilling vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis means that your tankers will only be lifting to orbit the essentials - their own fuel, engines, etc. plus their cargo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther people swear by the all-in-one design, where the tanks are on the driller/converter rig, which simplifies the process, but does use more fuel as you are lifting more weigh more often.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rassa Farlander","CreatedById":63627,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-08T08:45:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmmm Ive never used KAS I think Ive heard of it though.

For example, using a small converter, the efficiency for monopropellant is 0.3 - that would mean that for every ton of monopropellant that you create in orbit, you would have had to lift 3.3 tons of Kethane up to orbit.

The large converter runs at about three times the speed, and uses about 65% of the power per unit produced.

This is a much better case than LF/OX.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor Xenon, things get a little squirrelly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe conversion efficiency actually drops from 0.4 to 0.25, which means that the large converter takes 60% more Kethane than the small, to produce each unit of xenon. This also means that the large converter only produces xenon at 83% of the speed of the small converter, and that it uses over 300% of the energy to do so.

Of course, if your satellite is built such that going to that higher time warp reduces idle time, you may not be incurring a game time penalty, but you also won\u0027t make it faster.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0027s the chance of you being able to make the scanned path wider with higher altitude, as if the scanner beam is cone-shaped? Doing so would resolve the current conflict where reducing game time increases real time and vice versa. For instance, if you gave the scanner the same beam width as the ISA MapSat, with a proper orbit you could reduce the game time required to 15-20 hours instead of the current 7 days, while at the same time being far enough out from the planet to use 100x or higher warp, thereby also reducing real time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
