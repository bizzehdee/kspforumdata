Too many plugins (including stock) simply dump text on screen which does not persist long enough for player to read all of it properly.\n\nThis is especially useful when doing science missions - if you execute many experiments in a single shot, you can easily miss important messages for example about experiments not being reset (remotely or by a scientist) or science not transmitted entirely or ... you get the picture ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\nI like launching satellites with experiments bound to action group and running them all at once at the right biome/situation (science-bomb style ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022) )\n\n~~Ahh one more thing : does One Window have an option to ignore specific messages ?

The print-to-log button has been replaced in the top-left corner with the settings toggle button. Clicking this will cause the new settings menu to slide in at the bottom. It has three functions: The old log file button, a button to cycle through four different font sizes for the messages, and a slider to adjust the UI scale for the window (the stock, master UI scale also affects the window scale).\n\nAs for filtering, there isn\u0027t much that can be done. The only things inherent to messages that can be used for filtering is the screen position, the actual text content, the color, and the duration of the message. Color and duration wouldn\u0027t seem very useful, and text filtering is tricky, since it would just rely on matching exact text patterns. And once a screen message gets to the point to where it can be detected externally (i.e. the point where it is actually moved to the screen canvas) any information about its source is gone.\n\nFor the most part the messages that most people are probably interested in are posted in the upper-left corner. The lower-center and upper-right positions are rarely used, and don\u0027t usually contain information that you would want to store. The upper-center position has lots of important messages, but these are usually things that only matter at the time they are posted. So I would just leave the upper-right and upper-center positions on, and forget about the others, but if you need them for some reason the messages are always being logged, so they will appear if you turn them back on."},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-16T17:46:52Z","Content":"Brilliant!
