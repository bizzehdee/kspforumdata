As you can see its putting out 1.4GW of Thermal Power, now look at the AM Collector, it is collecting 4.612306e-5 AM per second. Now lets do the math here.... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(AM Collection amount x Seconds in a day x number of collectors) 4.612306e-5 * 86400 * 10 = 39.85mg/day\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk now the reactor can use up to 3.324 mg/second and output 120GW of power or 36.1011GW/mg\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow lets do some more math here... (GW per mg * mg / seconds in a day) 36.1011 * 39.85 / 86400 = 0.01665GW/second Thermal Power\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the math says 16.65MW per second but the part says 1.4GW per second??????? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/Tw7Ytu8.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Tw7Ytu8.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EItem number 2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow lets try this with 100 collectors..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe get 4.5GW Thermal Power, we are in the same 900K orbit so the amount we are collecting per collector is the same but instead of 10 we have 100 collectors. 398.503mg/day and the same 36.1011GW/mg\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(GW per mg * mg / seconds in a day) 36.1011 * 398.503 / 86400 = 0.1665GW/second Thermal Power\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo hmm, math says 166.5MW and part says 4.5GW.....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/kunA9DT.png\u0022 alt=\u0022kunA9DT.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EItem number 3\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELets try a more extreme location and hit Jool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo lets see, 54GW Thermal Power looks pretty awesome right? But wait why does it say 19.981% that cant be right???? I mean think about it 19.981% of 120GW is 23.977GW not 54GW!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo lets do the math.... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(AM Collection amount x Seconds in a day x number of collectors) 6.64172e-3 * 86400 * 100 = 57384.461mg/day\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(GW per mg * mg / seconds in a day) 36.1011 * 57384.461 / 86400 = 23.977GW/second Thermal Power\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo now the math says 23.977GW and the part says 54GW.....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/FFX8lEu.png\u0022 alt=\u0022FFX8lEu.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI even tested with my large 226 AM collector and had similar results.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbin orbit, math says 376.31MW and part says 6.7GW.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJool orbit, math says 46.484GW and part says 81GW.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-20T01:18:59Z\u0022 title=\u002204/20/2014 01:18  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 20, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Donziboy2\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Einarr","CreatedById":4809,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-20T00:38:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAny tips for using the Solar Sail?
