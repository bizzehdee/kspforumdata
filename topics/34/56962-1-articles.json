Its purpose is to provide an increase in thrust, usually for supersonic flight, takeoff and for combat situations. Afterburning is achieved by injecting additional fuel into the jet pipe downstream of (i.e. after) the turbine. The advantage of afterburning is significantly increased thrust; the disadvantage is its very high fuel consumption and inefficiency, though this is often regarded as acceptable for the short periods during which it is usually used.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI added a file to use with Deadly Rentry.

You can see it on the RAPIER as the smoke. Another difference from the .22 code and the RAPIER code is the point the particles, and thrust, come from. the old is \u0022thrustTransform\u0022 that is use for everything. In the new FX definition on RAPIER they use thrustTransform for the Multi particles shock diamonds, \u0022smokePoint\u0022 for the smoke trails, and thrustpoint for the auctual thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TomatoSoup\u0022 data-cite=\u0022TomatoSoup\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFor a first mod the level of polish here is fantastic!

One of the things that took longer than expected was the sound effects on the engines. The multi mode engines ignore the old FX definitions. all effects go under the EFFECTS tag. The problem happened when the sound didn\u0027t sound anything like the stock engines. With the new sound FX you can control the volume and pitch based on the throttle or actual engine power.
