The volume name is something KSPAPIExtensions comes with. I think its meant to provide the possibility to differentiate between different types of volume a part can have. For example a part can contain a 1m\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B3 fuel tank and a 3m\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B3 habitat at the same time.
