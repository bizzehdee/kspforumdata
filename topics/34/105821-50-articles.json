Both of these are excellent choices if available and the two are designed to integrate.  If not, Unity updated their HTML renderer to full HTML5/CSS3\u002B support and substantial DynamicSVG support.   This rendering pipeline (shared with Unity2D) can output to a texture or overlay and it supports most web-font types.  For scripting it integrates fully with Unity\u0027s mono substructure as well."},{"CreatedByName":"MOARdV","CreatedById":60950,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-19T11:57:30Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 9 hours ago, Ruedii said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Second question, is switching to Unity\u0027s HTML5 canvas utility (the second option for nice text canvasing) or the standard mono one also out of the question?\n\u003E \n\nI don\u0027t know Unity, so I can\u0027t say.  Text rendered by RPM outside of the previously mentioned classes all use an enhanced TextMesh class that I rolled to provide some features the Unity TextMesh didn\u0027t support, and any replacement for that would need to be close to a drop-in for all applications - render-to-texture for the MFD and other screens as well as rendering in scene with custom shaders for labels on props.  In either case, I am not developing new features for RPM at the moment, so any such R\u0026D won\u0027t be any time soon.\n\nFor what it\u0027s worth, the default font used in RPM\u0027s sample MFDs is low fidelity - it looks like it was upsampled using a point filter.  For comparison, look at the fonts used for the ALCOR lander - they\u0027re rendered at the same resolution, but they don\u0027t have the same blockiness.  So, if the issue is the blocky nature of the MFD text, that can be changed by replacing the font texture JSI/RasterPropMonitor/Library/Fonts/baseFont.dds"},{"CreatedByName":"Mystique","CreatedById":95628,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-19T21:08:57Z","Content":"Any chance of 0.28 being available via \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E?\n\nEdit: sorry, missed \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E disclaimer in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Original Post(er).

I believe the issue is the way KSP handles undocking.\n\nWhen two vessels are docked, they are treated as one single vessel.\n\nWhat happens when you undock is that KSP creates a new vessel.

If it\u0027s the \u0027current\u0027 vessel, you remain in IVA.  If it\u0027s the \u0027new\u0027 vessel, you\u0027re kicked out.  I\u0027m pretty sure that\u0027s how it works, but there may be some additional factors that I don\u0027t know about.\n\nSo, if KSP decides the CSM is the \u0027current\u0027 vessel, you can stay in IVA only if you remain in the CSM.  If you ride the LEM all the way, you\u0027ve got to find a way to make the LEM the primary component on docking.
