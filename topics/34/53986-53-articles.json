But beeing a newcomer, I had some problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. The description here in RO on the first page is not very helpful. Lots of mods are listed, but few with links. I can google them, still its not helpful. There is also little description how to make the mods work together nicely. I understand the topic is presented for advanced players who deal with mods on a daily basis. Its a hassle for newcomers like me though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Too many parts and no idea what does what. The ingame texts are often not helpful (enough). This goes to the modmakers of the individual mods, but it is really also a problem of RSS, because of the setup, lots of mods are required and that cant be avoided.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Too many obsolete parts. Even after changing the multiplier factor in FAR, there are LOTS and LOTS of obsolete parts. Engines with the wrong size, fuel tanks that are not needed because of the stretchy tanks, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is something I would need that solves all the problems above: A neat starters pack. It should include all essential mods, a working set of config files and all the mods should be cleaned such that only the relevant parts are left. Including removing stock parts. And an install instruction. Like: Copy your unmodded game folder, remove all folders in the GameData folder and extract \u0022downloadable file\u0022 into the empty GameData folder. If any changes to the mods are necessary, than at least you have a starting point. (I would for example rather use the 10x kerbol system instead of the real solar system.. but thats more a matter of taste..)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan someone please assemble something like a RSS starter pack?
