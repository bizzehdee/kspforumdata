This is why MM can have no effect on his settings file.\u003Cp\u003E@Diazo\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe best way I found to do this is to load the settings file into an object the first time you enter the main menu that persists while the game is running. Thus it is affected by MM \u003Cstrong\u003Eand\u003C/strong\u003E persistent between flights and saves. Any changes made you write to that object and to hard drive (or rather, update the object and then save it).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can see this approach \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/Crzyrndm/Pilot-Assistant/blob/master/PilotAssistant/PresetManager.cs\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E where I have a class handling all my presets for Pilot Assistant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGameDatabase.Instance.GetConfigNode(string url) would be the load function needed for AGX I believe\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf this is about the global AGExt window placement, it\u0027s also affected by where AGExt stores its window locations, in the file AGExt.cfg which is included with every release of the full mod. That way installing a complete new version or otherwise copying in the original files will overwrite the window locations with their defaults in the shipped AGExt.cfg.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way some other mods handle window locations and other configs like that is to having the defaults in the code and no window config file shipped, so when it\u0027s not there, the code sets the defaults and writes them out to a new file which won\u0027t be overwritten by future releases.
