The launch Rendezvous alarm sets an alarm to go off when your vessel is under the orbit path of the target. ie. so when you launch you can burn straight into the right orbital plane. The position of the vessel you are targeting when the launch vessel passes under the orbital path could be on the other side of the planet so it may not be very close, but by launching into that plane you can avoid having to change the inclination of your orbit later and makes docking against vessels in inclined orbits much easier. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Closest distance will find the time at which the distance is at it shortest, regardless of the position of the launch site in regards to the orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically if you want to launch straight into the orbital plane of an existing vessel the \u0022Launch Rendezvous\u0022 alarm gets you that point on teh plane, but it may be better to wait an orbit or two to have the orbiting craft in a closer position.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope thats not confusing it more \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Starman4308\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Starman4308\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIs there any way to force KAC to start killing time warp sooner?

In the settings.cfg file you will find WarpTransitions_UTToRateTimesOneTenths = 14 . If you increase the number it will start to step down rates further out from events\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EChange the transition method back to the instantaneous one which will be more accurate at stopping in time, but also more likely to cause an orbit bork if the transition is too much\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m gonna look at doing the following:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003EExpose the transition variable as a slider or similar of changing that is helpful - instead of just in the settings.cfg file\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Elook at when the amount of time left isn\u0027t enough to gracefully transition then fall back to instant changes till we can get it under control\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Re the quickload issue - the WarpRate calculator looks for changes in warp rate every 5 secs or so - also configurrable in the save file. So I think the issue Master Tao hit before is that after a quickload the warp is being performed before the rates are updated with the new values and thus it shoots past and halts immediately. I\u0027ll also add some extra checks in there for the first few secs to generate those rates sooner after game load\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-02T07:24:18Z\u0022 title=\u002211/02/2014 07:24  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 2, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by TriggerAu\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TriggerAu","CreatedById":57838,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-02T09:56:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECodes all in for these changes - will be in the next version - would love to know how yo go with tweaking the settings manually\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Master Tao","CreatedById":110410,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-02T16:33:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TriggerAu\u0022 data-cite=\u0022TriggerAu\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe installation of lots of mods may be affecting how quickly the transition can occcur and thus the miss occuring\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWow!

Looks like Tarsier Space Technology was preventing KAC from displaying any alarms. I\u0027ve re-installed each mod and then tested KAC in-game after each one and Tarsier is the only one that created the problem and as soon as I deleted the mod from my GameData folder all my alarms came back up when I restarted the game. Guess Tarsier isn\u0027t compatible with KAC for whatever reason, I\u0027ll let the Tarsier author know about this issue as well so that hopefully they make it play with KAC better.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI cant see anything conclusive in the logs re interactions, but I can see the below error re Tarsier and the ScenarioModule components which is how Modders store stuff in the save file - if the NRE is borking the stack of events then maybe its not calling the next one in line. I found note of the same error in a log in the KCT thread and people mentioning issues too.
