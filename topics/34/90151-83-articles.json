There are too many variables to be intuitive: If I have a 100 Ton interplanetary stage, how much ullage thrust do I need? What if the tanks is half full? A quarter full? How much difference does a service module make, if it makes any outside of pressure-fed hypergolic engines. What about smaller crafts, how does what engine (on what tank?) influence the equation? What goes for multiple tanks? Can I put a small service module at the bottom and a baloon tank above it, would that be an exploit?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure how the system works, but, outside of the engine ignition indicator, some percentage how \u0027ready\u0027 a tank/engine is to ignite would help alot, so I could follow how much difference my RCS makes, even if i have too little (or is there no too little and it\u0027s only a matter of time/acceleration?). The whole thing just doesn\u0027t feel that intuitive right now, there are so many question. Which is why some transparency, e.g. in the form of a settling indicator, would already help a lot!
