The development version of KCT has a check for that and will just disable access to that vessel instead of totally breaking, if you want to try that out, though I\u0027m actively working on it so things are bound to change a lot in the next day or so. If you want to just extract that ship out of the save file then open up the save and search for KCTVessel. Find the one that corresponds to the messed up ship and just delete the entire node. It\u0027s big, since the whole craft file is saved in there. Make sure not to accidentally delete anything else. You might also make a note of the total vessel cost (listed under the KCTVessel node simply as \u0022cost\u0022) and add that to your funds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk, tried dev build 168, no joy.

The game was kind enough to tell me what it was so I can probably swap it back over from an old install to salvage/scrap the ship, but I\u0027m more than willing to keep it borked for a little while if it\u0027ll help your development.

Build 169 should fix that, so you shouldn\u0027t see the \u0022your game is totally screwed\u0022 message anymore. Build 169 should pop up a message letting you know the stored ship is missing a part (or a few) and provide the option to ignore it or delete the vessel. If you delete it, you should get the funds returned. Currently it only pops up once even if multiple ships have parts missing\u00A0and it doesn\u0027t tell you which parts are messed up.

Sarbian uses it as well. CKAN uses Travis, which does basically the same thing but isn\u0027t hosted on your own computer. My Jenkins build server is the same one that runs my (currently totally broken thanks to mono) website and stores a bunch of my files and it sits on my desk behind my right\u00A0monitor. What it does is automatically builds the source code into a .dll whenever I push a commit to GitHub. Makes it super easy to have public betas, since I never have to touch anything to release them. If you look at the other projects available on there, there\u0027s also projects for KCT and StageRecovery that build the .dll from the source and create a .zip file automatically so that all I have to do when making a release is grab that zip and upload it to all the sites I host things at. I could probably integrate KerbalStuff and GitHub Releases into the build script so that whenever I push a release build it automatically updates those, but I like doing that manually for now. Those projects only get built when I push a commit to the \u0022master\u0022 branch on github. I do all my development work in a development branch which is what the \u0022KCT Development\u0022 and \u0022SR Development\u0022 projects watch for changes. It\u0027s super handy and cuts down on the amount of work I have to do for releases and the amount of things I can mess up (I messed up a few SR releases pretty badly before setting up Jenkins)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFailed builds are just builds that for whatever reason couldn\u0027t compile. I generally test compiling code before committing it, so they\u0027re infrequent. They most frequently happen when there\u0027s a KSP update and I update the .dlls I\u0027m referencing on my desktop but not on the server (so it builds code for 1.0.5\u00A0against 1.0.4\u0027s .dlls, for instance). Other times they fail because of connection issues with connecting to GitHub. Other times it\u0027s because I messed something up on my server.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CatastrophicFailure","CreatedById":57438,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-31T20:18:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBrilliant!
