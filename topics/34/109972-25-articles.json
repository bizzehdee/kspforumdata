I should have read this before releasing Ship Manifest.  Now that I\u0027m properly aware of the issue (thanks to [@Gotmachine](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/163039-gotmachine/)), I\u0027ll set about properly addressing the dll issue.  CLSInterface.dll was originally intended to be a hard dependency in other modders\u0027 code and was implemented before we better understood reflection.  This means that it is a breaking change to convert that to a soft dependency and a fair amount of work for those mods that support it.  However, since it is typically distributed with those mods, simply renaming it in SM will only correct the issue for SM, and not for other mods. \n\n CLSInterface is also a hard dependency for ConnectedLivingSpace, so I cannot simply remove the file from the CLS Distribution.  Therefore, the duplicate issue will remain for now, as both the supporting mods and CLS itself depend on that .dll.   \n\nSo, here is what I propose:\n\n1.  Recommend other modders rename their interface file with a prefix (or suffix) referencing their mod in the filename of the distributed copy of CLSInterfaces.dll. Ex:  SM\\_CLSInterface.dll.  This will allow each mod to function, and not require constant changes as CLS is updated, and eliminate the concern about dll version differences.  The interface typically does not change at all, but the version currently gets updated with the release.  Going forward, I will only change the interface version If I make a change to the Interface.\n\n2.  Long term:  Create a soft dependency class that can be embedded directly into a Mod\u0027s code, thereby eliminating the need for the interface.  Use of this will require changes to a Mod\u0027s code to support its use.  I will provide both the soft dependency class as part of the Devtools folder in the distribution. I will also include instructions for their use and distribution.\n\nComments?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-11-24T20:06:20Z\u0022 title=\u002211/24/2021 08:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 24, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Papa\\_Joe**\n  \nCorrection to proposals.

I don\u0027t know which side this problem is on, so I\u0027ve reported it at the SSPX thread and here too.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The problem is, CLS doesn\u0027t recognize SSPX parts as passable even though they seem to be configured this way and the part info tip says they are passable. Here is an [example screenshot](https://prnt.sc/26kbqab): the two parts should form one CLS space, but they don\u0027t for some reason. The same thing happens to other SSPX parts and for both top and bottom nodes.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027ve had a superficial look at the patch (provided by SSPX) and the part config and compared them to those that work correctly, and I don\u0027t see any obvious errors. Hope you\u0027ll have a moment to look at it.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m using KSP 1.12.2, CLS 2.0.1, SSPX 2.0.6.\n\u003E \n\nDid you check to make sure neither of them have a hatch? The Command Pod might. (it\u0027s not likely, but it would cause that behavior) On the parts I\u0027ve looked at, I\u0027m not seeing that behavior - but I didn\u0027t check the inflatable."},{"CreatedByName":"garwel","CreatedById":141813,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-28T04:50:03Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 3 hours ago, panarchist said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Did you check to make sure neither of them have a hatch?

And the problem is apparently not in the stock Mk1-3 Pod, because I\u0027ve tried attaching to different parts. If you attach a Hitchhiker instead, they are considered connected.\n\nMaybe the problem is due to the parts being inflatable? By default, they have CrewCapacity = 0 and use a custom part module (ModuleDeployableHabitat) to change that. However, as seen on the screenshot, the part is recognized as a habitable, it just isn\u0027t getting connected to its neighbours.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-01-28T05:08:08Z\u0022 title=\u002201/28/2022 05:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 28, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by garwel**"},{"CreatedByName":"eberkain","CreatedById":157548,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-28T11:42:08Z","Content":"the screenshot is in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003Evab\u003C/abbr\u003E, did you take it into the flight scene and inflate it to see what happens?"},{"CreatedByName":"panarchist","CreatedById":63336,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-28T13:40:23Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 8 hours ago, garwel said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E They don\u0027t as far as I can tell (from the part.cfg files at least).

I would try \u0022launching\u0022 on the ground with it deflated, and inflate on the pad, then try it again inflated in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and launch with it already inflated, and see if the behavior differs. I don\u0027t know when CLS makes the check for CrewCapacity, but I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if the second space is happening because the part has 0 CrewCap when instantiated in the flight scene."}]}
