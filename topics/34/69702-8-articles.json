Your new male textures make the other kerbals appear more obviously male. Keeping one texture \u0022smoother\u0022 and more like unmodded KSP would therefore make this more neutral texture automatically appear more feminine than the others, accomplishing the goal. There\u0027s also the fact that the name generator only really generates male-sounding names, and for the few cases where it doesn\u0027t, your mod doesn\u0027t actually match feminine names with the female texture, making another flaw with it.I already have removed this texture, I was just very shocked at seeing it included.

Try to do it more \u0022neutral\u0022 is quite absurd... because \u0022stock\u0022 Kerbals are COMPLETELY neutral.

That is why they are so \u0022simple\u0022. And I like that. The only reason to include this \u0022gender\u0022 textures is the player who want a feminine role in the game, because him/her feels the kerbal genderless in a too masculine way.
