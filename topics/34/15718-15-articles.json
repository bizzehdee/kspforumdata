Textures are done and they all load into KSP fine (pictures below). That\u0027s not to say all of the bugs are gone but at least I\u0027ve got basic functional models now. For example, I noted during static ground testing that the RCS was firing in all directions except up and down. Turns out I installed the monopropellant valve upside down (I forgot the RCS transforms). Easy fix but I\u0027m sure I\u0027ll run into plenty of those pesky bugs as I move on to functional testing in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI rolled back my install of Unity to 4.2.2 in an effort to fix the light animation problems and although they work just fine in Unity they are not working right in game.

It\u0027s clean and elegant, a great \u0027blank slate\u0027 for building all manner of sci-fi-ish heavy cargo ships. But, the \u0027blank slate\u0027 thing is a bit of an issue for me. It\u0027s VERY white. So white that it looks like the texture is missing when I first load a part into the editor. On further examination, yes, it\u0027s textured, and I double checked the PNG\u0027s in the files to make sure, but in the game it just looks pure WHITE, man. Which, okay, cool, I get that that\u0027s the look you were going for, but it\u0027s... well it\u0027s sort of boring to me. There\u0027s just nothing there for your eyes to examine, everything looks like blank slabs. Plus, I think that if one were to try to attach any other parts, stockalike look or not, the color difference would be really pronounced. I mean, if one cares about the appearance of the ship in that way. I kind of do, which is why I\u0027m mentioning it, that\u0027s all. Okay, so, anyhow, I think I\u0027ve made my point clear on this one. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only other main thing I have to mention is that there just don\u0027t seem to be enough parts (YET, yes, I know this is a WIP), to really DO much with the ship, other than figure out how to take off and land with it, and get it to and from space and otherwise fly around with it a bit. Which I will do, have no fear, lol. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E But with the way the parts are set up now, there seems to be really only one way to assemble them into a working ship. I\u0027m sure you\u0027re planning lots more stuff to go with this system, or I sure HOPE so anyway, so again I understand that nothing is \u0027finished\u0027 in the true sense of the word. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E But yeah, we need cargo bays (I mean, like with ramps that open so we can drive mining rovers on and off, or launch satellites, you know), science labs, just more goodies to bolt on and in, and hopefully a certain modularity in these parts so that we can make a larger or smaller cargo bay, for instance, depending on the mission requirements. Or to maybe assemble things in a few different ways other than simply each part going on line, one after the other. Or, maybe one can, I didn\u0027t really spend a huge amount of time investigating every option, so I may have missed something. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEh, just being clear, most of that last paragraph was me spitballing and/or thinking wishfully, please don\u0027t think I\u0027m making any kind of \u0027demands\u0027 here, okay?

But NOT with the \u0027Senior\u0027 or \u0027Junior\u0027 size ports, et al, so I don\u0027t know that this would be considered \u0022Universal\u0022, per se. Just sayin\u0027. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Also, the diameter of the port is bigger than a Size 1 clampotron, but smaller than a Size 2, so docking to either wouldn\u0027t really look very good, IMO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOops, I thought of one other thing: The attachment nodes for the HAB module and the... other one, can\u0027t remember what it does, sorry... the ones that go inside the frame section, I mean... their nodes are internal, which means that you can\u0027t see them in the editor, or at least I couldn\u0027t, so it may lead less experienced players to think that the parts won\u0027t attach to anything, is all I\u0027m saying. I ended up wiggling them around near the frame when they snapped into position, that\u0027s the only reason I figured it out. But then again, I\u0027m not saying I\u0027m the sharpest knife in the drawer, so I don\u0027t know, maybe that won\u0027t be such a problem. My suggestion would be to simply note in the description how the parts are to be placed, that way you wouldn\u0027t need to reengineer the attachment nodes. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Whew, okay, I think I\u0027m done now, sorry. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I do like the ship, Absolution, it\u0027s got a LOT of potential.

Here\u0027s an update:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently Working on:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m going through my massive back-log of work on the other parts I have in the pack. At this very second I am refreshing the Anvil IV with improved geometry and textures. I\u0027ve learned a lot since the last time I touched the Anvil IV and I\u0027m putting it all to good use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0027s after that:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t done anything with the Dune Raider since I released it a year ago and I am going to show it some love after the Anvil. I\u0027ve got some ideas for refreshed wheels and an instrument display to make the whole thing \u0022pop\u0022 better. Fundamentally I feel that the Dune Raider is a solid design so I am not compelled to do much else to it aesthetically. There\u0027s still a nagging issue that some people have reported of physics bugs causing the whole thing to rocket into the air. I suspect it has something to do with the wheel collider not behaving when something hits it on the side. I\u0027ll see what I can do on that front. I also have some plans to add some features such as a docking mechanic for refueling and RCS thrusters to aid in control on low G environments. It\u0027s been mentioned that the Dune Raider is too... \u0022extreme\u0022 for people and they want a more reasonable rover. So...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand after THAT:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe final stage of my near future plans is to completely redesign the Fire Hawk. It will be designed to pair well with the First Light\u0027s design approach. Simultaneously I will be working on the docking bay feature for the First Light. These two features need to be designed in parallel because, obviously, one fits into the other. Also, not so simultaneously but sort of simultaneously, will be the preliminary design effort for the \u0022Dune Crawler\u0022. The Crawler will be a practical rover designed with function in mind and not sexiness like the Raider. It too will follow the same design inspiration as the First Light and the new Fire Hawk so all together they will fit together in one cohesive package.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@Neutrinovore\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI released the First Light in its current state specifically so I can get feedback. Furthermore, I am doing all of this stuff for me first and sharing it with the community second. You wouldn\u0027t offend me even if you had mean things to say. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E I want feedback and inspiration from other perspectives. Not only will it make my own experience better but because I am offering my work to the public I feel responsible to do my best to make something worth downloading. I will never promise to do something or change something in response to community feedback but I value it and will always do my best.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConcerning textures: on a scale of 0-100 with 0 being pure black and 100 being pure white the base colors fall into the 90-95 range. Yes, very white. That level of white looked the best to me while I was doing the textures but I never reviewed the textures in game as a sanity check. I definitely see what you\u0027re saying. Furthermore, the textures have a shininess applied to them so the light reflects and makes light colored objected appear to be lighter. I\u0027ll try to knock off some of the shine and reducing the colors to somewhere in the 80s and see what I come up with. I plan on doing some more tweaking of the geometry and textures anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAttachment nodes: Yeah, I can see where that could be confusing. I located them where they are to limit the amount of wobbling those parts are prone to. A centrally located node makes for a very stable connection. I\u0027ll think about different ways of doing it or, as you suggest, add in some tips to the description.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConcerning Docking parts: When I titled them \u0022universal\u0022 I meant that to be universal with everything in the First Light. Originally, the First Light was designed as 4-6 separate parts that needed to be assembled in orbit over the course of several launches. This \u0022Universal\u0022 docking component was meant to be reused as a mating component for all of them. For mating with stock parts I always imagined using a stock docking component and attaching it to the surface of the First Light if necessary. I never intended my parts to mate directly to a stock part. I understand where the confusion comes in and I\u0027ll think about renaming it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConcerning more parts: They will come in time. I have a very specific mission in mind for the First Light, Fire Hawk, and aforementioned Dune Crawler. This means I am focusing all of my energy to develop specific parts to accomplish that mission. I am designing for a manned mission to Duna and back. I also intend on developing separate payload components that will store all sorts of items necessary for deep space missions; food, water, etc. However, since KSP doesn\u0027t incorporate any of that yet I decided to wait before proceeding too far. I\u0027ve got ideas in my head but that\u0027s were they will stay in the short term. Once I complete my mission to Duna missions to the other planets will be in store and inevitably other parts will be developed to tackle the unique challenges each planet poses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have a vision of where you want First Light to go then please share. As I said above I make no promises but there\u0027s always a chance I will be inspired. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck and have fun!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Absolution","CreatedById":4156,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-17T05:29:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter several years of developing parts that I thought were 1:1 scale with the KSP universe I have just come to realize that is not the case.

After realizing my scaling issue with my parts I investigated ways to bring everything back into line. There were a number of ways I could have done things but ultimately I decided to roll up my sleeves and just put the work in to make everything 1:1 and match the scale of the KSP universe. I\u0027m scaling all of my parts up by 125% and, in some cases, remodeling parts to zero them to the nearest nice round number.

As a result the Anvil IV was 5m and the Anvil V was 2.5m.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext, because of my terribly long development cycle and tendency to design one rocket at a time and come back to it many months later my textures and models show just how far my skills have developed in the intervening time. It\u0027s kind of nice to set two rockets side-by-side and see a dramatic difference in quality indicating just how much I\u0027ve learned. However, as far as a product I\u0027m distributing to the public is concerned that\u0027s not good. Everything needs to look like it belongs together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo here\u0027s the deal. Like a band-aid I\u0027m going to just rip the sucker off and fix these little quirks in one go. The Anvil IV, which I was working on all through December, is now the benchmark. It\u0027s size, it\u0027s scale, it\u0027s texture and normal conventions. It\u0027s been scaled up to be a solid 5m diameter and I am renaming the series \u0022V\u0022. The current Anvil V is going to be renamed \u0022III\u0022 and redesigned to be 3m in diameter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext comes the decision on what to do with the Maximus. Anyone who has followed me over the years knows that I have a thing with branding and the \u0022Anvil\u0022 brand is my thing. In that regard I\u0027ve decided to retire the Maximus after a short few months of service and in it\u0027s place will be the Anvil IX which, you guessed it, will be a 9m diameter rocket. Fundamentally the new Anvil IX won\u0027t be any different than the Maximus. It will follow the same design principles and assembly techniques. However, the Maximus was quite a boring looking rocket. It just didn\u0027t look \u0022real\u0022 to me. So once I finish up revamping the Anvil III I\u0027ll put some energy into the IX to make it more convincing to employ.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s my intent to make that the final major revision of the Anvil series of rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck and have fun!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wasmic","CreatedById":64885,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-10T16:43:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey Absolution, I have a little critique on the balance of the current Anvil V.

Originally the Anvils were supposed to be scaled properly to real rockets. I determined that the approximate mass fractions are 75% for the first stage, 20% for the second and 5% for the payload (75/20/5) is reasonable for a real world rocket. It\u0027s been too long for me to remember exactly how I came to balancing the Anvil the way I did (78/12/10) but it\u0027s probably due to the way KSP reacted to those numbers way back in the day. I remember the Anvil became very unstable at the end of the first stage and would snap into an un-correctable back-flip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI then tried to scale the Anvil just like a real rocket. Most rockets tend to have a scaling ratio near 15:1 so for every 1 unit of diameter they have 15 units of height. The old VAB must have been much smaller than the current one because I remember the prototype Anvils not fitting into the VAB. I don\u0027t recall what my current ratio is but I think its about 10:1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next thing I did was get all the properties (mass, fuel, thrust, etc) into line. Long story short: the numbers refused to all agree with reality at the same time. Ultimately I decided that the engines\u0027 T/W ratio and their Specific Impulse were the two values I would prioritize for realism. The Anvil first stages have a T/W of about 1.4 and an Isp of 250. The second stages 0.8 and 350 respectively. That may not be perfect but I think it\u0027s close enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI completely respect your input and truly value it. However, the Anvil is the way it is after many, many hours of testing and balancing over several years. Many of those results have been invalidated due to the evolution of KSP, sure, but I\u0027ve got this egg standing on end and I\u0027m hesitant to poke at it. Furthermore, I\u0027m so far along with this last, hopefully definitive, revision of the Anvil that I don\u0027t want to dedicate more time to do it all over again.
