Even at this tech level it shouldn\u0027t take such a huge number of these radiators for the 2nd smallest reactor to function without such a high waste heat generation rate. Especially when you consider the inline radiators aren\u0027t as good as the foldout radiators and the radial radiators are even worse. At this rate, what\u0027s it going to take to run the largest reactor with a completed tech tree, 1000 of the largest radiators?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point I\u0027m thinking it might be better to just disable the waste heat setting in the cfg file and hope a future version of the mod has a much more reasonable balance of number of radiators needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERadiators work by radiating off more energy than they are absorbing. In order to do that, they need to have a certain temperature. So they first need to build up some waste heat, in order to increase the amount radiated. At some point they will reach equilibrium, because they are warm enough to radiate the same amount of heat they are taking from the reactor. You will never get to 0 waste heat while you have some heat source on your vessel, even a small solar panel will give you some waste heat until the radiators reach equilibrium. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor that very reason you will never get the full efficiency out of your thermal generators, which is why people use the charged particle generator instead for later reactor types. It\u0027s just thermodynamics, that\u0027s how the physics work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: The thermal helper should have told you a \u0022radiator resting temperature\u0022 and a \u0022generator resting efficiency\u0022 or something like that, which gives you the numbers at equilibrium point.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-20T03:12:07Z\u0022 title=\u002208/20/2014 03:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 20, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Alvin853\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jason_25","CreatedById":55730,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-20T06:12:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for keeping this mod updated.

This mod has already gone through that painful phase months ago. Fractal has obviously already thought hard on the specifications for the various parts. I use this mod almost exclusively now, and I have many ships. I just rebuilt most of them for .24 and then for the changes in Infernal Robotics. I am even working on multiple vehicles for the next release based on KSPI. If you are intent on doing this, perhaps you can change the name of the mod, or maintain a KSPI \u0022classic\u0022. I can see the need for tweakscale, but TWR changes don\u0027t make sense.
