The stock missions as they are called are the Original Authors Mission Pack that came with Original Mission Controller back in .09. I have never done anything to these missions. The Random missions are made for .21 and above of KSP. The very first Random mission is meant for your very first launch in a Career game. It does not pay much, but it is desiegned to stop the Huge ship spam from KSP .22 that everyone would do to get 3000 Research points. After this mission and you can successfully orbit your vessel, in my opinion it becomes easy.\u003Cp\u003EI love reading the Thread on Interstellar Mod and watching people say that the first levels of that mod are useless. Then the responses from the people that know telling them no its not, you have to build your ships different. Well that same moto comes into play with Mission Controller Ext. You have to build your ships different in MCE to make budgets and make mission payouts. And I think this is the hardest hurdle people have to overcome. The difference between building what you want, without cost restrictions is a major Game Changer to Most that Try MCE.. Which is why I get a lot of the This mod sucks you can\u0027t make money. (not saying you, but check a few pages back)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut of course if you want you can pretty much change anything you want in Mission Controller by editing the MCsettings.Cfg file in the MCE folder. The file explains everything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso with the way I made MCE research tree, you really want to push for cheaper Fuels, Recycling, and Cheaper Building... Changes things a lot for your builds. And finally the higher mission payouts Later in MCE pretty much makes MCE sandbox mode 2. Which is kinda what I wanted, once everything is researched I figured people want to do own custom missions and just launch ships.. Maybe do a few MCE missions, and pay for that Trip To Eeloo. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut its a space program we have to work at getting to that point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks Both, I\u0027ve just started a new save in career mode doing the random missions, as if it wasn\u0027t addictive enough I now have goals!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nelien","CreatedById":65665,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-03T23:14:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know if this is planned, but I would like to suggest a couple of small features in the mission browser window.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, that it saves the settings (mission filters) between package changes. (Or is it something else that keeps resetting my filter settings..?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd second, add one more filter, one that filters out repeatable missions. So something like \u0022Show repeatable\u0022 - on by default. Preferably this one should only categorise a repeatable mission as repeatable if it was already done once. Alternatively include repeatable missions that have already been completed once into the \u0022Show finished\u0022 filter, hiding them if it\u0027s unchecked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason for the second request is that a few mission packages have linear \u0022story\u0022 missions but with a few repeatable ones mixed in in between.

I got permission to check out how Story Missions did his version and use it. Even though I had to modify it a huge amount to work with MCE Save Method. I got a pretty awesome system in the works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis will replace the Insurance cost charged when you launch. (no longer will happen). So what happens now is that If you start a new game the existing kerbals in list are free. (if you start late and have 8 kerbals they free, if only 3 then they are free) After this first list is created, anything added to the list will charge you money. So you hire a kerbal. And then you are charged Default 5000 Credits for that kerbal (this can be changed if you want). You are charged once mission controller notices that you have a new kerbal (based on scene changes).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m working on maybe keeping the insurance cost. If a kerbal dies..

Also thinking of adding a new system based on what the Developers are going to add to there Economy system. Bad rep. Whats your thoughts on this? Bad Rep will effect mission payouts.
