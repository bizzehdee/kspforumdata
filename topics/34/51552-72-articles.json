But there are limits - mainly range of omnidirectional antennas (the basic one has 2500km range). You should use them instead of dishes to have complete coverage of space near Kerbin without having to worry about where to point dishes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is how I did it :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI used 4 satellites, launched in one piece (screenshot 1 below). I wanted them to be on a circular orbit 700km above Kerbin. And here is where the science comes in - how to get them spaced equally apart ? With a little calculation, I came up with an orbit - apoapsis of course 700km (and above Space Center to provide connection) and periapsis 246.25km. The first satellite, after launching in apoapsis and circularizing its orbit to 700km, goes 3/4 of its orbit when the stack of other satellites reaches its apoapsis again to launch another satellite. So after a few passes, there are 4 satellites on circular orbit spaced equally apart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen there is another important part - all those satellites must have the same orbital period. I\u0027m using Kerbal Engineer, so it just means looking at the right number (screenshot 2).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, the result is on screenshot 3.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/3r6M6\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled. View full album\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother interesting thing I just calculated - the orbital period of all my 4 satellites is 1h 22m 37.6s. If one satellite was off by just 0.1s, it would drift away to cause short periods of no connection in only 277days. Fortunately, this drift can be easily spotted and corrected by very tiny burns before it gets out of hand.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
