Things of note in this update:\n\n- Fairings: Where appropriate, rocket engines now have fairings and bottom nodes\n- New engine type: 1.7 adds Air-Augmented Ramrockets. These work similar to the RAPIER/ ESTOC/ MATTOCK except they work in any atmosphere, and they have dynamic ISP that scales with mach in augmented mode; details in their part decriptions\n- Rontgen and other non-oxygenated air-breathing engines  now require standard air intakes, but will still function in non-oxygenated atmospheres\n- Chines now have proper radial\u0026mirror symmetry and attach nodes\n- IFS integration: A number of parts have been depreciated and folded into omni-parts that are configurable to the specific mission. this includes, but is not limited to the Service Bay and RCS thrusters.\n- General part rebalances and reworks\n- All parts are now searchable\n- the Mk2 Landing Leg is semi-functional, and is included as a placeholder until I either get it functioning or reworked\n\nDue to the number of changes to part lineup and naming convention, this update will likely break in-flight and saved craft. For optimum results, recover these vessels prior to M2X 1.7 installation. \n\nThis version of 1.7 does not include patches for mod integration (DRE, FAR, etc) at this time. As other mods get updated for KSP 1.1, MM patches for them will be added when appropriate."},{"CreatedByName":"Elkram","CreatedById":151154,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-04T19:58:20Z","Content":"Awesome mod!"},{"CreatedByName":"Carrot","CreatedById":154743,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-05T15:05:13Z","Content":"Hi is it possible to keep name of those parts next time or even using the old name with the new replacement please?
