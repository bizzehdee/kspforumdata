The first part of the video was doing a comparison of the old version (that didn\u0027t work properly) then the new version that works much better. I also don\u0027t think that the high altitude deceleration you are talking about in the video is KSP relative. The Apollo capsule hits the dense atmosphere then raises back up; that is not the same as setting a high PE and decelerating in the thin atmosphere. The video indicates they get to 2.5g before pulling up. In KSP if you hit 2.5g you have pretty much stopped already.\u003Cp\u003EI do think though that the atmospheric model is still not 100% even with FAR. But with deadly reentry 2, at least the reentry effects are modeled quite well based on the imperfect atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk, so, it\u0027s been stated that I should not post late at night and tired.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat being said, it\u0027s kind of an engineer\u0027s pipe dream in terms of reentry to do as much of your deceleration in the upper atmosphere where you hardly notice the reentry effects. An example of this is the proposed skylon craft, because of it\u0027s exceptionally low density in relation to it\u0027s surface area, it would only need minimal active cooling on certain key points along it\u0027s leading surfaces to survive reentry with what is otherwise a fairly standard skin. Another good example (though not from orbital speeds) is spaceships one and two from virgin galactic. They have nothing more special than paint and carbon composite as their pressure hull, main hull, and skin all combined into one, and it\u0027s hardly scorched on reentry. The way I understood it was that the skip in the apollo reentry profile was to spend as much time in the upper atmosphere as possible, only hitting higher temperatures and g-forces when they couldn\u0027t avoid it. When you watch the video, remember that altitude is rather exaggerated, the actual flight path is much shallower in reality. (look at when they give an overview of the whole flight, and notice that they\u0027ve drawn the atmosphere as a good 1/3 the thickness of the whole planet, if that isn\u0027t exaggerated I don\u0027t know what is)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"aquilux","CreatedById":23859,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-30T01:29:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOn a related note, a possible solution to the whole \u0022max g-force\u0022 issue would be to have the ablative coating be a subpart that wraps around the spacecraft. If too much force is exerted on it it\u0027d crack and break off much in the same way solar panels shatter during reentry. That combined with making the connection to the pod extra weak (if it\u0027s an attachable shield, though that\u0027d probably be best considering the different reentry scenarios one may encounter) would cause your craft to actually break apart if it over-Gs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"taniwha","CreatedById":57176,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-30T05:23:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOr better yet, how about a deadly acceleration mod? right tool for the job and all \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Killerblonde","CreatedById":36220,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-30T05:30:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022taniwha\u0022 data-cite=\u0022taniwha\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOr better yet, how about a deadly acceleration mod? right tool for the job and all \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat honestly doesn\u0027t sound like a bad idea.

The apollo used a lifting capsule to hit the thick atmosphere and then while still decelerating move up to lessen the g load.
