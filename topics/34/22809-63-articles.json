If I \u0022fix\u0022 this by clearing all input locks, it returns to normal, except when I try to open a building, e.g. the VAB, I end up stuck forever in the black loading screen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can avoid this bug by restarting KSP and by only loading the later game first, i.e. before I\u0027ve played the earlier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy hypothesis is that KAC is triggering alarms before checking whether they should exist in the currently loaded game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as mods go, I do have HyperEdit and Kerbal Engineer Redux, but this issue arose before I installed KER, and since it\u0027s a KAC alarm window that appears I\u0027m fairly sure it\u0027s this and not HyperEdit ^^;\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWill dig into this one\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022John FX\u0022 data-cite=\u0022John FX\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis is indeed what we find.

You know, stuff like \u0022Measure the temperature in spaceflight above 5,000 meters near Sector L-MR5V\u0022. Waypoint Manager does a great job of targeting these, but what I really want is the game to jump out of warp when I am within range of these markers so I can click the thermometer or whatever.

The challenge here will being the math to preict when you will be in the area and then set the alarm accordingly (as you need to preempt the event so warp can be slowed down in time to stop).
