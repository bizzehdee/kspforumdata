I am working on a new IVA immersion mod, MOARdV\u0027s Avionics Systems.  RPM uses the GPLv3 license, so if you wish to take over development of RPM, please feel free to fork RPM on GitHub.\n\nAre you tired of your Kerbals complaining about having nothing to do during long flights? Do you want to give them more buttons to push, and maybe some displays so they can keep track of what\u0027s going on? Then look no farther.\n\nRasterPropMonitor is a plugin and toolkit originally by [Mihara](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/members/61481) that provides functional props within your IVA. It was originally designed for the displays of the ALCOR capsule, but it evolved to add more features and widgets, dragging the Kerbal Space Program into the 21st Century. RPM includes some overrides for stock capsules (and a few mod capsules) to show off what can be done, but there\u0027s far more in the plugin than these examples can show.\n\n**DOWNLOAD**: From [GitHub](https://github.com/Mihara/RasterPropMonitor/releases/).  IVAs require [Module Manager](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/50533-131-module-manager-304-feb-11th-2018-early-christmas-gift/), which is not bundled with this mod.\n\n**\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E USERS:** I do not support installing by \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E.

If you want to create a really good looking IVA, you should consider grabbing Alexustas\u0027 [ASET Props](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/129305). It implements more of RPM\u0027s features than any other mod I\u0027ve seen. Even better, [ASET Avionics](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/129364) provides props for space planes (or any other IVA wanting some aviation-styled props).\n\n**Projects using RasterPropMonitor (may be outdated):**\n\n- [Aerokerbin Industries](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/96148) Modified IVAs by MasseFlieger.\n- The [ALCOR](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/54925) capsule and [ERS](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/94947) rover by alexustas.\n- [CST-100](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/132070) 7-seat crew vehicle by xxhansonmaxx\n- [Falcon Drone](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/29932) cockpit\n- [Home Grown Rockets](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/60974)\n- [KSA IVA Upgrade](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/137585)\n- [Mk3 Pod IVA](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/132856) Replacement by Apex\n\nDon\u0027t see a current IVA project on this list? Let me know. I may have missed it, or I may not have imported it from the original RPM thread. Speaking of which...\n\nMihara had more to say about RPM on the [original thread](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/57603) (and I\u0027ll edit this post some time down the road to include more of the links and info he had)."},{"CreatedByName":"drtedastro","CreatedById":70911,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T23:15:30Z","Content":"Great stuff.\n\nThanks for all of your work.\n\nCheers."},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceExplorer","CreatedById":138160,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T23:28:41Z","Content":"Thanks for the update MOARdV!\n\nAll the best with the maintenance and improvement of this essential mod!"},{"CreatedByName":"Drew Kerman","CreatedById":103177,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T23:31:28Z","Content":"damn, just ran out of rep to give this 24hr period ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) Thanks for the release"},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T23:35:49Z","Content":"Thanks so much ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"NoShotz","CreatedById":129281,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T23:47:03Z","Content":"sweet, definatly one of my favourite KSP mods"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T00:01:28Z","Content":"Good to see that this is still being maintained!\n\nNow, MOARdV, about those requests I made a while back... ![:sticktongue:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T00:05:02Z","Content":"Will you also be updating JSI PartUtilities ?"},{"CreatedByName":"luizopiloto","CreatedById":97503,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T00:07:35Z","Content":"we need configs for the new MK3 and inline cockpit IVAs... ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Voculus","CreatedById":85437,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T00:25:27Z","Content":"Thanks for this mod, once again! ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"MOARdV","CreatedById":60950,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T01:16:32Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Good to see that this is still being maintained!\n\u003E Now, MOARdV, about those requests I made a while back... ![:sticktongue:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif)\n\nThat was on the old thread, so it doesn\u0027t count. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) Seriously - I will take a look at it, now that RPM basic functionality is there.
