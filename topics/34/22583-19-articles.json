So after killing the stock code on a part, that part will fall through the ocean like it wasn\u0027t even there. It\u0027s all just air then. The stock one just pushes you more up the deeper you are, no matter what kind of part you are dealing with. Mine pushes up to a max, to allow for parts that have a max load capacity basically. It also allows you to set the ocean level. If you were to set it at 70 m, you would be floating like in water 70m off the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you turn debugMode = true on the float module cfg, you can increase or decrease the float force on the part. It goes between 0 at \u0022ocean\u0022 level, and the set force (12 in my case), at the defined max depth (0.5m I think on the floats). If you retool the code, you can just make the part think the ocean level is at your current target depth, and just clamp that so you can\u0027t have a target above sea level. It also limits the speed at which a part can rise to decrease bobbing up and down. It does this by only applying force if the vessel is rising less than 0.2m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and water impact resistance in stock is just based on ground impact resistance, so I made that a separate thing. Any part placed on the sub that\u0027s missing custom buoyancy code will drag you up, so it has to consist of only parts with that code, unless you do a Destroy on all vessel.parts[x].partBuoyancy. That has to happen after OnStart though, cause it\u0027s added at some odd time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-06T01:51:58Z\u0022 title=\u002208/06/2013 01:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 6, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Snjo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snjo","CreatedById":57198,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-06T01:49:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022fenderzilla\u0022 data-cite=\u0022fenderzilla\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAren\u0027t there any props that use only electricity and not liquidfuel?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are four I think.
