Finally, the thermal engines have never really gotten me interested, so I only use reactors for electrical energy; that being the case, making about half the reactors identical in this regard sort of put me off Wave\u0027s version a bit. Especially as it seems a bit easier to get large amounts of power from Fractal\u0027s powerplants when you get the appropriate upgrades.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBleurgh, stream of consciousness, but I hope I\u0027ve given a clear picture as to what I like from my Interstellar(s) and why.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"toomarc","CreatedById":123247,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-25T07:06:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPlease correct me if I\u0027m wrong.
