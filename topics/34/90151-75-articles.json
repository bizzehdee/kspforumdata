Even without a procedural heat shield, the command pod mk 1 explodes out of nowhere at around 43 k, and this time, I have no idea why. Log says nothing, I\u0027m at a loss. Launching a mk 1 straight up to 300 km and letting it fall straight down doesn\u0027t cause it to explode, it seems to be only coming in from orbit that does it, which suggests it might have something to do with the timeframe the heating occurs in.

Like, The Merlin engine on the Falcon 9. In the hover tests, it seems to be throtteable to an extent, and we\u0027re missing any good engines to use on Mars, or even a good medium engine, like the SuperDraco. Shouldn\u0027t the Merlin at least have some throttle control?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-22T18:58:13Z\u0022 title=\u002206/22/2015 06:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by JT2227\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Temeter","CreatedById":58056,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T19:06:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think most engines can fully throttle?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want something for a Mars Lander or so, then i\u0027d recommend the Aestus II.

The KWR support is good, but i still feel like there are some holes to fill, e.g around the 300kn to 1.2k cryo and generally from 1.5k to 7k.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, what is the best way to deal with engine farings?
