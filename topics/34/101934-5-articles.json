My free time has opened up finally, some of the IRL chaos has settled down. \n\nAn update for KSP 1.02 should be out this week. Expect a lot of changes, since a lot of these contracts were merged into the stock progression system. Also crafting this release as a \u0022modular\u0022 pack, with different types of contracts placed into different config files, so if you don\u0027t want (for example) the repeatable contracts you can delete them easily without trying to parse the configs. It will also allow me to add updates easier in the future.\n\nThe pending update will have a dramatically scaled-back number of contracts (again, due to many being merged into stock) but will offer a new set of \u0022routine spaceflight\u0022 missions to keep your skills sharp, and give you an excuse to keep using your designs. Space station contracts are removed in this version, and will be added (re-done from scratch) in the following update as a module. Also applying, as always, a good number of bug fixes. \n\nExpect 4.0 to be a save-breaker update, due to how the contracts are being re-arranged.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-19T16:00:30Z\u0022 title=\u002205/19/2015 04:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by tjsnh**"},{"CreatedByName":"Red2blue","CreatedById":143045,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T17:40:01Z","Content":"Sound really great.
