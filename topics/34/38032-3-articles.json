I have only used it on my iPad mini and it is quite functional. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I will now run through my pros, cons, and suggestions. Keeping in mind there are still bug fixes and touch how being released to beta testers in the next few days. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPROS:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Looks like and actual console\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Displays useful information via LCD like the Celestial Body Info, Orbit info, and Vessel Info\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) The ability to rearrange the panel to whatever configuration you want\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) The ability exists to send info to the program from other Mods and Plugins should the developers wish to do that(MecJeb2, ORDA, KAS and Kerbal Engineer instantly sprung to mind for me)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Nice touches of things like save buttons, map, view and other UI buttons\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECons:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Apparently no volume control for the button presses so that is a little annoying. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Having to reconnect to the control pad at every launch is a bit annoying as well, it would be nice if it remembered the port number for each session of KSP that you play so you aren\u0027t having to type it in each time(I launch crash, launch crash, so this is frequent for me)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Controls don\u0027t appears responsive enough for me to trust flying with it BUT I do love using it for information and button clicks which is where it would excel for other plugins to run off of, like MechJeb\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuggestions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Other Mod developers should definitely take a look at this, it makes the KSP experience more immersive and because you can customize it the options are endless\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Few more settings like volume control\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Make the port saved for the session if possible\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"L.J.
