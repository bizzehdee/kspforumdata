I built a service craft with a grabbing unit locally controlled by Jebediah to catch some (pre-RemoteTech) satellites. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter launch the actions are queued although they are issued locally. I tried bypassing them which works at first until I clamp to something in which case the bypass seems to be overridden (although the gui still displays the message). The queue shows all triggered actions followed by increasing negative numbers and they\u0027re never fired. After entering this state bypassing via the gui button does not seem to work any more; the stack is still filled. Triggering parts directly works, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn a locally controlled craft the queue should not be used, right? Am I missing something here?
