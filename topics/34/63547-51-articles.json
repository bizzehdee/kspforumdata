This is complicated by the fact that (AFAIK) some engines actuate the converging and diverging parts separately, whereas others don\u0027t. The nozzle flaps may be passive in some cases too, so that their position is set by balancing ambient pressure with exit pressure (if possible).\u003Cp\u003ESo do you have a proposal for how this should work? The two things that need to be determined are the exit velocity and exit pressure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not qualified to do the maths (Dammit blowfish, I\u0027m a biologist, not a fluid dynamics expert!)- I was basing my comments on some background info (such as this: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://exploration.grc.nasa.gov/education/rocket/nozzle.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://exploration.grc.nasa.gov/education/rocket/nozzle.html\u003C/a\u003E) mostly, so I\u0027ll defer to your knowledge in this area.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps a good compromise on nozzle operation would be to have an option to set how the nozzle behaves in the part file.
