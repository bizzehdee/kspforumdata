It has removed the majority of micromanaging resource transfers between my space stations and docked ships. I do however, wish it was a bit more granular to allow for more flexability. This wish comes from the fact that the pumping action is set at a tank level and not at a resouce level which prevents you from transfering resources both IN and OUT of the same tank. A good example of this are life support resources. I\u0027ll use TAC Life Support as an example.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I dock I want food, water and O2 to be transfered to the ship while waste, wastewater and CO2 to be transfered to the station. Since all of these resources are stored in one container on the station, what actually happens is food, water, O2, waste, wastewater and CO2 are filled on the ship. I\u0027m then forced to manually transfer the waste, wastewater and CO2 back to the station using TAC Fuel balancer. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis problem can also arise from the use of the Modular Fuel Tanks mod. If you have a tank configured to hold LF, Oxy and Kethane then you\u0027ll have to do the same thing when your Kethane miner docks. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, my feature request goes something like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou wish to keep the right click menu uncluttered and simple. Hell Yes. I completly agree. Change nothing there. Put everything under the pump options button/menu.

My first thought was to leve it exactly where it is and use that as a tank default level setting. Setting it to level 6 for example would set all of the resource sliders to 6. Afterward you can change the individual higher or lower. The only problem I see with that is if later you change the default level then it could reset all of the individual resources to that new level. I guess you could add a third button labeled \u0022Default\u0022 which would allow that resource to follow the tank default level rather than a custom level. That\u0027s starting to get complicated and I\u0027m not sure I like that idea. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk, this post is getting long I my boss would like for me to do some real work rather than spend all day on the KSP forum so I\u0027ll stop here.

Being able to set pump levels by resource would solve this issue. Well, not so much \u0022issue\u0022 but more of an \u0022inconvenience\u0022. Lately I\u0027ve become somewhat obsessed with reducing part counts so I don\u0027t use the TAC Life Support containers as they can get quite numerous and create a cluttered appearance. Instead I use 2 decent sized fuel tanks and the Modular Fuels mod to assign life support to one and waste to the other. By having two tanks I\u0027m able to set pump levels for both and accomplish the automatic transferes that have been discussed.
