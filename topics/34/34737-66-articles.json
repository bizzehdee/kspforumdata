Prebuilt or semi prebuilt parts can sometimes look nice, but it also limits their use. Most of us play KSP because of its freedom and I think that parts should allow for that, instead of restricting the users or uses. The best parts are parts that get used in ways the designers of those parts never envisioned.\u003Cp\u003EThis also means parts should be relatively simple. Although it is tempting to embellish, they are a means and not an end. They should not be show pieces, but functional and beautifully simple.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EThis is something i\u0027m mindful of, as it should be the resulting craft created by the community that act as the show piece of this mod, similar to B9 and others.\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E- The look and feel should blend nicely with stock KSP and stock parts. I think it has been noted that the current look sometimes does not really match up with KSP parts. They generally look good on their own, but seem a bit out of place when combined with other parts to make a vehicle.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EI am hoping to address this, but admit that the mod may end up with it\u0027s own style, as there are limited examples of actuated parts in stock KSP.\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAlso, some parts are hard to combine with stock parts while still looking good. A notable example it the powered hinge (\u0022taller motorized hinge\u0022) - which is incredibly useful - but through its width makes it hard to build anything that looks good. No truss or beam will fit it right. Either the hinge is way too small, or its surface is so big that truss will only cover its surface partly, looking odd.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EAgreed.

I guess they\u0027re not strictly better than the telescopic pistons, I just like parts that snap together nice and neatly. In the example above, the pistons would clip through the body in a really weird way.
