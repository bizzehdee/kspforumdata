If I may I have a few suggestions.\n\n1. You could make Roentgen not consume uranium and just consume intake air. This is how Porkjet\u0027s Atomic Age handled it, it is less baggage and less UI clutter. Simple, effective.\n\n2. An actual tri-coupler in a 2 down 1 up pattern with 3 x 1.25 would be a great addition. Possibly a late-game structural node unlock.\n\n3. A cryogenic Mk2 engine would be great! InterstellarFuelSwitch already allows LH2/LOX setups and Near Future Propulsion has dedicated hydrogen tanks.\n\n4. A shorter Mk2 - 2.5m adapter would help quite a bit; the stock one is rather oversized.\n\nEdit: I should also point out that one of the parts mentions an Icarus Airspace; I think that was meant to be Insanity. Something about outrage against C7 and Icarus taking the initiative.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-19T19:53:24Z\u0022 title=\u002209/19/2015 07:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by More Boosters**"},{"CreatedByName":"SuicidalInsanity","CreatedById":143878,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-19T20:20:06Z","Content":"@More Boosters: 1)The Rontgen Uranium consumption is controlled by a MM patch - /Mk2Expansion/Patches/NTJ\\_Decay.cfg - remove that, and the engine will revert to its stock behavior and only consume IntakeAtm. 2)I\u0027ll consider it. 3)I do plan to get around to making some sort of mk2 rocket engine at some point, would probably have the option to toggle between LH2/O \u0026 LF/O fuel modes. 4) would take like 5 minutes to make, why not?\n\nYeah, that should be Insanity, not Icarus.
