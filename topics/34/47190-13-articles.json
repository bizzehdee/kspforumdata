Usually 8 bits per channel, so we\u0027re either dealing with grayscale (8bit), RGB (red/green/blue, i.e. color, 24 bit), and RGBA (RGB \u002B a grayscale channel, called the alpha channel, 32bit). Alpha is an extra channel that is used to convey more information, like how transparent that area should be, or how shiny.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETextures exist for many different uses. Diffuse (color), specular (shininess), opacity/transparency, bump, normal, heightmap/deformation/displacement, emissive, etc. In KSP we generally only care about diffuse[\u002Bspecular] and normal. Engines also have emissive maps, and PQS terrains have heightmaps. I *highly* encourage you to do a google image search for each of these map types, and see both examples of them, and examples of them in action. That will explain better than words.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiffuse defines the visible color you see. It\u0027s often combined (into a 4-channel texture) with a specular map to also control shininess, or with an opacity map to control transparency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBump maps are grayscale maps that describe how \u0022high\u0022 a given pixel is, with white as highest and black as lowest. Then \u0022fake\u0022 3d detail is added in the shader by using the bump map to \u0022bump\u0022 the surface you see. This is done by changing how might light that area of the object reflects (because if there\u0027s a hill on a flat plane, the sides of the hill, being angled differently, will reflect light differently). The line perpendicular to the surface, btw, is called a normal (so if you were looking from above at a flat plane, the normals would all be pointing at you; the normals of a sphere look like hair sticking straight out all over it, etc.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENormal maps are basically a better version of bump maps. Instead of the lower-quality, automatic changing of normals, the normal map actually encodes the normal at each pixel, and the shader reads that. In essence you generate (fake) geometric detail from the texture map. Often used when you make a very high-detail model, \u0022bake\u0022 its normals into a texture, and apply it to a lower-detail model.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeightmaps are like bump maps except rather than doing shader tricks, the geometry itself is deformed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEmissive maps control whether that pixel of an object \u0022self-illuminates\u0022, i.e. glows.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, how this figures into KSP. Unity/KSP will load *all* image files in GameData (except in PluginData folders) automatically. It will then, with two exceptions, compress everything into DXT1 or 5. If the file has 3 channels, it is compressed to DXT1 at a ratio of 1:6; if it has 4 channels, it is compressed to DXT5, at a ratio of 1:4. In essence this means that 4-channel textures take up twice the memory of 3-channel textures of the same resolution.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe exceptions are: TGAs are left uncompressed (ATM fixes this problem) and mbm textures flagged \u0022uncompressed\u0022 are left uncompressed. This matters because you *don\u0027t* want KSP to compress normal maps, that makes things look weird. mbms have a flag in the file to notify KSP, but other file types don\u0027t; this is why ATM requires all normal maps to either have NRM in their filename, or be specified in a config (the NORMAL_LIST{} node in ATM config files).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGenerally, stripping alpha from a texture will have the memory it takes up ingame, but will also remove the specular effects (bad, but ok) or remove the opacity map (VERY BAD, for example making parachutes into solid cones).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"commandeur_brin","CreatedById":107387,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-24T08:08:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022commandeur_brin\u0022 data-cite=\u0022commandeur_brin\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHi !
