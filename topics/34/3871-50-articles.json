Real world engines are tailored by using exhaust bell design by either reshaping the bell during flight or using ablative materials to reshape the bell as the burn proceeds.

However, if your computer is slowing down a lot when launching your ship, it can cause the strut code to be skipped over by the game, and then they won\u0027t have any effect at all. Wobble is certainly normal though, and if your ship flies stable enough, you can reduce some of the wobble effect by not using any SAS while launching (the SAS compensating back and forth when it gets off track will just make it worse lol).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to see a rocket that really wobbles, check out the one in my signature, it almost looks like it\u0027ll snap like a twig when you watch it launch lol.

Tall rockets plus the ASAS flopping the gimbals and winglets back and forth adds a lot of side to side torque. You also have to make sure when using shroud decouplers to join the stages at two nodes as close to the \u0022bottom\u0022 of the decoupler as possible, as that is where the parts \u0022collision box\u0022 is - if you leave a gap between the collider and the bottom of your engine, it has that much room to wiggle.
