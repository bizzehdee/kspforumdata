The SABRE combustion chambers get colder air in, which will thus expand more and faster when combusted. Most jet engines run out of juice at high velocities because compression heating at the intakes mean that combustion does not give as much thermal expansion, which is what provides the thrust - so you\u0027re basically burning fuel just to break even.
