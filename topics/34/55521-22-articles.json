When I was balancing the engines I used KER to test and try to find happy mediums between the capabilities of the 1.25 and 2.5 equivalents. These engines should be more efficient for the average craft built with this size of tanks and Under/over built for the bigger and smaller tanks, ideally. I think waiting for 1.0.3 and doing a big balance pass is the best call, a lot will likely change at that point anyway. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll that being said, as you showed above, the 120s need to be tweaked down a bit if you\u0027re building an R-7 replica. It would be similar to building a 2.5m craft and using five mainsails in your first stage and then another in the upper stage with a relatively light payload. I think that generally speaking in the stock environment this type of craft is overbuilt for the payload it\u0027s lifting. I\u0027m ok with that however because fuel and thrust can be tweaked down for replicas without turning this into a kit craft. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe old Soy-Juice is a good example of something in this pack that looks good, but really needs a remake to get rid of that kit craft feel.

I have an issue with mod soup and this mod. The Green Soy-Juice decent module causes the screen to go black when i go from VAB to launch pad. When I go back to the Space Center i am in space and the world is gone but still have all the HUD and can still click on things. This does not happen when the only mod i have is HGR. I slowly narrowed it down to the Green Capsule and when I delete that part the game has no further problems that I have found. Not sure why this happens and love the Green module so would love to see some kind of fix for it.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s an issue with RPM, or that\u0027s what I was told.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Orionkermin","CreatedById":91013,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T18:22:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes I\u0027m pretty sure it\u0027s loading the wrong internal space for that pod with RPM installed.

Basically for whatever reason the RPM internal space got saved as a .txt instead of .cfg. Changing that will fix the issue.
