Making RPM listen to joystick buttons would be no problem, the problem would be making sure you can configure them, because the game\u0027s native GUI will certainly not support this in any way. I suck at GUIs, or I wouldn\u0027t make what is internally essentially an 80s-era terminal on acid. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EDue to the way KSP\u0027s internals work, IVAs get destroyed and recreated multiple times per flight -- basically every time you switch vessels, which includes going EVA, the entire process of RPM loading pages into memory and sorting out it\u0027s complicated internals has to start anew. \u003Cem\u003E(which is why on 32 bit, out of memory crashes are most likely at that moment with RPM -- the old copy has yet to be picked up by garbage collector, the new copy tries to bite out a chunk to live in)\u003C/em\u003E Key assignments would need to be kept somewhere, they would need to be configured per pod, \u003Cem\u003E(Most pods include more than one copy of the exact same RPM prop!)\u003C/em\u003E or possibly, per flight. These settings would need to be stored somewhere. This is nontrivial, as in KSP, modules that run internal props do not have equal rights with modules that live in parts. -- for example, they don\u0027t get to save their data into persistence files. I had to jump a lot of hoops to circumvent that, and I don\u0027t at all like the way I ended up doing it.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe only reasonable way to do that while keeping all the advanced button tricks, like multiple screens sharing buttons, is to stick the listen-for-the-key function into the button handler class. Which is not too hard either, but would require jumping a lot more hoops to a) record the data about your key assignments somewhere that doesn\u0027t stand a chance of getting wiped out in the next second, \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E making sure we can get at that somewhere when the whole thing is created again and find out what key did you assign.

Sorry guys, I didn\u0027t realize my thread had become active again! Thanks to everyone who has been working to keep these configurations alive. I\u0027ve been on a hiatus, Pokemon X \u0026amp; Y, Bayonetta, Hyrule Warriors, Sui Generis, Wasteland 2, Divinity: Original Sin, etc, etc, etc ... but the big reason why I haven\u0027t updated my configs is that honestly I just don\u0027t really like the new monitors. I\u0027m around, and I still play KSP at least weekly but I skipped the 0.24 release, contracts just didn\u0027t shake up the core game enough, so I\u0027m working back to IVA. I should clear up that I\u0027m not providing support for the old configurations because I don\u0027t know what it would take to get them working, and they need more than just a band-aid so they are provided as-is. I pretty much have to write new ones from scratch to get things working with the new monitors, and I\u0027m not sure when I\u0027ll be able to do that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt does feel a bit like a kick in the ass though, I didn\u0027t mean to let the IVA crowd down! I\u0027ll see what I can get done for you guys though, IVA deserves a proper interface.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
