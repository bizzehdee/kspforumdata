The antimatters had stopped workign for some odd reason, and I didn\u0027t know until I fired my engines. The qunatum plasma jet I had as the main drive drained the power reserves, and the thermal jets just shut off because there was no thermal energy AT ALL.

After about half of one earth year (time accelerated, of course), I would predict that that is where they shut down.

I can imagine that a microgravity research environment would be more interesting than doing research on the surface of Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScience labs sitting on the launch pad wasn\u0027t really something that I had in mind but that said, if people want to build universities on Kerbin with research labs and power plants then I don\u0027t want to totally discourage that. Afterall, those universities will make the technological breakthroughs eventually but you may be able to accelerate that process by doing research on other planets. So, I don\u0027t want to take out science generation for Kerbin completely but likewise the last update means that Kerbin\u0027s science rates probably need tweaking.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NeoAcario","CreatedById":24645,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-14T04:18:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Fractal_UK\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Fractal_UK\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EShould you still fail to find some power to keep the antimatter contained, when the storage tank finally runs out of charge, the antimatter tank will \u003Cstrong\u003Eviolently\u003C/strong\u003E explode.
