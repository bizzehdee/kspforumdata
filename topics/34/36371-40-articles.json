Then you can use the code I wrote for StretchySRB to support adding new textures arbitrarily (support via confignode) and switching between them. It also means they could share the same set of textures as the sides of stretchy tanks, meaning textures wouldn\u0027t have to be duplicated (that\u0027s why I ask re: exporting with two textures).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI assume I\u0027m not the only one who uses procedural fairings / interstages to make curved rocket/plane fuselages?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing you might think about: IMO it would take very little work to turn the procedural interstage into a very shapeable fuel tank.
