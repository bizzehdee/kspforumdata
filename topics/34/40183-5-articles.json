If they are too easy/hard/boring, I\u0027d like to know before spending more time expanding them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFour questions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(1) Is it wrong to incorporate easter eggs into missions?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(2) Is it fair to necessitate mods? If so, which mods are common enough?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(3) Should I merge these into one large pack?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(4) Are \u0022weapons\u0022 acceptable in KSP? Will people scream if I start the military pack with a \u0022V-2\u0022 mission to land a warhead on a specific part of kerbin?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWill these work with 0.13? I have yet to get very far with Stock\u002BNT\u002BMalkuth\u0027s two packs (keep getting distracted by learning to use other mods), but eventually hope to make my way through _all_ of the available mission packs. I can if you want DL and prioritize playing yours to give you more specific feedback. Re questions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Don\u0027t see why, depending on what they are.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Totally reasonable, although if it is possible to make the specific missions in the pack optional to proceed to further missions that might be advisable so that even those using stock my be able to play it through.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Why not do both? Offer them as separate packs and offer them as one merged pack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. I think the main thing here is \u0022Is it okay with Squad, and is it okay in terms of the EULA.\u0022 I see that \u0022military stuff\u0022 is in their list of \u0022things not to suggest.\u0022 But I gather based on some threads I see about weaponized mods that that merely means \u0022Don\u0027t ask us to make KSP militarized\u0022 and not that they prohibit mods that are militarized.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou do after all describe it as a \u0022military mission pack\u0022 so anyone who might use it should realize up front what it is. As long as you don\u0027t \u0027force\u0027 people to play it (e.g., by only offering your non-military pack bundled with the milit pack) and as long as it doesn\u0027t breach the EULA, don\u0027t see what anyone could have to scream about. If they don\u0027t want to play a militarized KSP, then just don\u0027t DL and play the mission pack!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ph34rb0t","CreatedById":4291,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-05T21:37:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sandworm\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sandworm\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E(4) Are \u0022weapons\u0022 acceptable in KSP?

Im using Mission Controller extended with Remote Tech and I wanted to modify the missions that came with MC to include the antenna and dishes that came with Remote Tech in the missions that ask for antenna and dish parts. But I want it to be an Or situation where I can complete the missions with the default KSP dish or antenna Or one or more of the new dishes added by Remote Tech.
