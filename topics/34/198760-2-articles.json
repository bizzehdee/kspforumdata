Select your landing point either by clicking on it, typing\u00A0the latitude\u002Blongitude\u002Baltitude or selecting a target (e.g. drone ship).\u00A0Its aimed to be reliable and fairly easy to use. I\u0027ve also made it work in Realism Overhaul where limited throttle able engines and limited ignitions mean you can\u0027t play fast and lose with your engines.

You can set the steering gains during the flight to give the grid fins more/less to do, and configure the reentry burn via altitude and target velocity. Some more advanced settings allow you to set safety margins, speed of final descent, at what height\u00A0to give up\u00A0steering and more.

The mod does try to give the latest suicide burn taking aero-braking into account. It does this by finding a maximum velocity for each altitude assuming no air resistance. It also calculates a\u00A0falling trajectory with no engine thrust which includes air resistance. When these lines cross at the lowest possible altitude determines when\u00A0the landing burn is started. This has mostly worked well in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E too, but I\u0027ve tested very few vessels, and there is a safety margin added (perhaps this is too much). The landing burn altitude is extremely sensitive to the weight. If you use HyperEdit and tweak the fuel quantity you will see the landing burn altitude change radically.

The mod does try to give the latest suicide burn taking aero-braking into account. It does this by finding a maximum velocity for each altitude assuming no air resistance. It also calculates a\u00A0falling trajectory with no engine thrust which includes air resistance.

This calculation means any vertical and horizontal velocity is cancelled until the velocity becomes low and then just staying vertical begins to dominate.
