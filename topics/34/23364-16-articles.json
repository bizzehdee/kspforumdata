It is great for collabs. Also you can put your released binaries there.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Eedit: please add in again the option to use own sounds / soundfolders.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Eedit: while to have individual settings are cool, it should be derived from a global one which should be editable from the menu (its a bit awkward to 1st set up the sound of a space craft which might take some time)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Eedit: I really loved the effects from 0.5.6 please add them in again (if they hide behind advanced settings then never mind.. can\u0027t test that since advanced settings doesn\u0027t show up on my system) I also loved the option to have as many beeps as you like... please give it back.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd thanks for coming back, I think I might not be able to learn C# in a reasonable time...

Copyright infringements? I thought many of them where really cool. Too cool to leave them out of new versions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit2: Mute is buggy. It does not mute wind. and if its selected the volume (of wind. e.g.) will not been adjusted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso a bug I started and there was the alien ship ambient sound, after I used the mute button it it didn\u0027t came back.

At the moment at \u0022precise\u0022 the slider works from left as the shortest interval (loop) to right as the longest, while \u0022loose\u0022 works the other way round. means at left is the longest and right the shortest.
