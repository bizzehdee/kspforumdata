I think I found a new bug (in v0.25, that is). Working on a new career game, I get my first magnetic field survey contract (requiring magnetometer and RPWS data from low \u0026amp; high orbits). Upon building my probe and going to launch it, I discover a two-fold bug: one part has to do with interacting with another mod (Kerbal Alarm Clock), and I will be mentioning this on their forum thread as well; the other part, however, has to do with maneuver nodes and the navball. Any ship that has the magnetometer boom on it (tested on two different probes and added to a previous manned ship design) will cause the KAC window to disappear as long as the scene is on that ship (i.e. the KAC window reappears when going to another ship without the boom, or back to the KSC). Also, whenever a maneuver node is created for a ship with the boom, the display of \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Arial;\u0022\u003E\u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Times New Roman\u0027;\u0022\u003E \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cem\u003Enumbers only \u003C/em\u003Enever appears (the little \u0027x\u0027 for deleting the node shows up by itself).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVery strange bug, and with my admittedly modest knowledge of programming, I can\u0027t imagine why only the one part is causing it.

So it seems pretty clear that the boom is the sole culprit.
