Adds a new element of design and challenge.\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve found an odd issue and when searching this thread I couldn\u0027t find a mention of it. I was attempting to deliver a life support module to a base, just the large recycler and a large oxygen tank as a single unit. I was planning to just plonk it on the ground next to the base and connect it up using the KAS mod. However when I winched the module out of the delivery craft and lowered it onto the ground it just sunk into the terrain! I thought that maybe it was a KAS related problem so I did some tests. I made a small craft with stock parts that just held the life support module under it, when I decoupled the life support module it sunk into the ground. I did this test at KSC and on the Mun with the same result. I then replaced the life support module with two standard fuel tanks and did the same drop action and those rested on the ground just fine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo there seems to be an issue with these parts not being able to be placed on the terrain. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other odd thing I noticed, not sure if this is intended function was that when I hit critical CO2 levels and a kerbal \u0027died\u0027 he just reappeared back in the available crew at KSC. Didn\u0027t actually seem to die, just got teleported home. I was expecting a more permanent death (not that I\u0027m bloodthirsty or anything). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, just thought I\u0027d mention those two.

To that end, I:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003ECreated two additional pair of of custom resources: Food,Waste,Water, and WasteWater, in the \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Courier New\u0027;\u0022\u003E\\Resources\\IonCrewSupport.cfg\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAdded these resource in the \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Courier New\u0027;\u0022\u003E\\Plugins\\PluginData\\IoncrossCrewSupport\\IoncrossCrewSupport.cfg\u003C/span\u003E file, as ION_SUPPORT_KERBAL_RESOURCE, with consumption rates (1 Kerbal consumes 1 unit of Food and Water, and produced 1 Unit of WasteWater and Waste, per day or 1/85600 per second).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ECopied a small inline RCS tank model under a new name, and added new resources storage capabilities to it.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ECopied a large inline tank model, and gave it a new name\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ECreated a file for ModuleManager in the Mod\u0027s root folder (with all the others), for the new large inline tank name (Hydroponics Bay) adding an IonModuleGenerator MODULE to the part, specifying INPUT_RESOURCE and OUTPUT_RESOURCE entries in the MODULE block. Waste, WasteWater, CarbonDioxide, and a \u003Cstrong\u003Elot\u003C/strong\u003E of power go in - Food,Oxygen, and Water come out. Rates are ~10% higher than 1 Kerbal will produce. All resources are required for conversion. This means that the hydroponics bay\u0027s output may fluctuate up and down a bit as it runs out of waste to convert, but overall the hydroponics bay works to keep one Kerbal alive. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis worked quite well for Food/Waste and Water/WasteWater. Under 100K time acceleration, rounding errors would cause resources to \u0022leak\u0022 out of the system, but that seemed to add a bit more realism; a small closed life support system wouldn\u0027t be perfect, and it took hundreds of days to draw down resources significantly, so deep space missions were still practical.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHowever\u003C/strong\u003E, carbon dioxide acted weird. Whenever I would come out of time warp, carbon dioxide would suddenly and very quickly deplete. Oxygen was maxed out, so it looks like there was very rapid O2 conversion going on, and I hadn\u0027t added a recycle converter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI went into \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Courier New\u0027;\u0022\u003E\\Plugins\\PluginData\\IoncrossCrewSupport\\IoncrossCrewSupport.cfg\u003C/span\u003E and removed the built-in Carbon Dioxide scrubber in ION_SUPPORT_POD_GENERATOR. No change. Carbon dioxide would still disappear rapidly, coming out of warp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThinking that there was some sort of \u0022hard coded\u0022 treatment of CarbonDioxide/Oxygen going on, I created a new pair of resources O2/CO2 and defined them like I had Food/Waste - using the consumption rates built in for Oxygen/CarbonDioxide.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI then \u003Cstrong\u003Eremoved\u003C/strong\u003E the entries for Oxygen and CarbonDioxide from \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Courier New\u0027;\u0022\u003E\\Resources\\IonCrewSupport.cfg\u003C/span\u003E and \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Courier New\u0027;\u0022\u003E\\Plugins\\PluginData\\IoncrossCrewSupport\\IoncrossCrewSupport.cfg\u003C/span\u003E. AFAIK, this should have removed it as a resource, and removed any \u0022resource check\u0022 from the life support system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also then altered both my edited \u0022resource tank\u0022 and \u0022hydroponics bay\u0022 to use O2/CO2 in place of Oxygen/Carbon dioxide.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis worked OK - CO2 did not spontaneously convert like CarbonDioxide had, and O2 behave inversely to CO2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHowever\u003C/strong\u003E, the game still dropped out of warp every hour, and eventually the Kerbal pilot died, \u003Cem\u003Ejust as if the Mod was still checking for oxygen and carbonDioxide\u003C/em\u003E, which I removed from \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Courier New\u0027;\u0022\u003E\\Plugins\\PluginData\\IoncrossCrewSupport\\IoncrossCrewSupport.cfg\u003C/span\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo - does anyone have any ideas what is happening? It almost looks like there\u0027s some hardcoding going on with Oxygen/CarbonDioxide. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr, am I missing a crucial configuration file somewhere?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere should only be one place where resources are hardcoded; the calculations for inactive resource usage are hardcoded to ignore ElectricCharge as a required resource. So don\u0027t know yet what might have cause the crew to die in your situation. There have been errors with the generator code though and these results with the generator at least aren\u0027t very surprising.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022katateochi\u0022 data-cite=\u0022katateochi\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI really enjoy using this mod. I was playing KSP and also watching the FireFly episode \u0022Out of Gas\u0022 and it just happened that the alert from Serenity \u0022Life support failure, check oxygen levels at once\u0022 sounded at the same time as I was dropped out of timewarp with a life support issue. That made me think it would be really cool if there was a sound warning but even better would be if it could be a user customisable one, by replacing the default .wav file. Then I could actually have that sound byte from Firefly sound when I had life support issues.\u003Cp\u003EHow possible is that to do?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is a good question.

To see what was causing it I did a few tests.\u003Cp\u003ESetup:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6GxU6La.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00226GxU6La.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETest procedure was to time warp till the clamps completely stocked the craft on O2 and then stage. From there I\u0027d run the tests.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETest 1: Straight up timewarp at maximum speed with the capsule scrubber enabled. Result: 25 days and 12 hours before dropping out of time warp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETest 2: Recycler enabled from the start at maximum capacity. Result: 25 days and 16 hours before dropping time warp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can quite clearly see that the recycler isn\u0027t doing much...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy first hypothesis was that because the CO2 tank stayed empty during time warp this was messing with the calculation (because it didn\u0027t have the juice on a iteration to iteration basis or whatever).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETest 3: Time warp at maximum until the CO2 tank was half full. At that point I switched on the recycler and fiddled with the capacity until it was consuming 1.6 CO2 per hour (so it wouldn\u0027t drain the CO2 tank). Result: 25 days and 14 hours before I was both out of O2 and CO2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yea, that wasn\u0027t it. So I decided to check if timewarp itself was the issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETest 4: Time warp at maximum until the CO2 tank was half filled. At this point I switched on the recycler at maximum capacity and timewarped at x1000. Once my CO2 tank was empty I switched off the recycler and time warped at maximum until I had a decent supply of CO2 to recycle at x1000. Rinse and repeat until I was out. Result: 35 days and 22 hours before I was out. So not the 2 times duration you would expect, but a significant step up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo it seems that time warp messes up the calculations for recyclers. Probably floating point errors (space kraken but with time). I suspect that you\u0027d actually get the full duration increase when you stick to slow time warp (or physical time warp). But I don\u0027t feel like running the game for a month to test this \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeems we just have to drag big O2 tanks around and avoid the recyclers for now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI found two issues that led to errors with high timewarp:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGenerators would continue to consume inputs at full rate until encounter one that was low. If later inputs or outputs were low the earlier inputs would be lost.
