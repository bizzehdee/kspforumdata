Meaning. Leave a crane with cargo at the end of the winch line hanging in mid air - save - return and find nothing is as  you left it.\n\n So my suggestion would be docking ports. They will pull your target toward you and once docked it will survive a save. But this creates a whole new set of issues. All IR parts have a \u0022\u0022root\u0022 node and a \u0022top\u0022 node. Imagine the command pod as the source of electricity. This power must flow through the \u0022root\u0022 node first. And if you install a part backwards weird things happen like misalignments or improper movement. (kraken bait in other words) So If you dock ship A to ship B using an IR extendatron in between them. You now have a command pod attached on the other side of the flow of power which could potentially mess things up if when loaded it defaults to the new command pod.\n\nCan you in more detail explain exactly what it is you are trying to do?
