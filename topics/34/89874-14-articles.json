When I place the rear gear with symmetry, as one must obviously do, the NON placed unit, that is to say the gear on the opposite side of the one that I\u0027m actually \u0027holding onto\u0027 with the cursor, the motor on that unit is always reversed when I launch to the runway. To put it another way: If I place the left landing gear, that means the right one is the \u0027mirrored\u0027 unit, correct? Yes, well, no matter how I try to set things in the editor, when I launch the plane the motor on the right-hand gear is ALWAYS set in reverse. And by \u0027reverse\u0027, I mean \u0027backwards in relation to the airplane\u0027s natural direction of flight\u0027, not simply reversed compared to the unit on the other side. If I set THAT one\u0027s motor to \u0027reverse\u0027 in the editor and the right one to \u0027forward\u0027, BOTH are in \u0027reverse\u0027 when I launch the plane. Believe me, I\u0027ve tried every single permutation of editor settings to figure out how to get around it, but nothing has worked so far. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I just got into the habit of right clicking the right-hand landing gear unit AFTER launching to the runway and manually changing that landing gear\u0027s motor setting to \u0027reverse\u0027. The way to check if everything is set right is to motor around on the runway a little bit before taking off. If when you press the \u0027forward\u0027 or \u0027accelerate\u0027 key (this is for the landing gear controls, mind you, I\u0027m not talking about the engine throttle controls), if the plane pulls to the right and seems to move forward only very sluggishly, that means that the right gear motor needs to be switched from whatever state it\u0027s in now, no matter what the right-click GUI says it\u0027s set to. Now when you motor forward the plane should track (mostly) straight. Once you have it set it should be fine for the rest of the flight, I\u0027ve done multiple landings and takeoffs in a single session without a problem. I THINK that it will also be okay if you switch away from the vessel and then go back to it later, but I\u0027m not entirely sure about that, you\u0027ll have to check that one yourself. Although, I have left a spaceplane in orbit (after going through the whole routine described above before takeoff), saved and quit the game, and then come back to that ship days later and landed it and landed it just fine without it pulling to one side, so I guess that the settings remain persistent once you\u0027ve quicksaved or autosaved that flight. It\u0027s only on launch that the motor functions don\u0027t correctly detect which side of the craft the gear are on, it seems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I hope that this info helps, Mykill. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Oh, and I\u0027m aware that this issue was supposed to be \u0027fixed\u0027 in the latest version, and yes, I have the latest version installed. All I can say is that for whatever reason the \u0027fix\u0027 didn\u0027t seem to work in my particular case. I do have a LOT of mods installed, so I\u0027d not be surprised that there\u0027s some minor conflict going on somewhere, but this is a very minor issue as far as I\u0027m concerned, so it doesn\u0027t really bother me. It\u0027s actually kind of fun to biff a landing every once in a while, just to see the new explosion effects, lol.

It\u0027s not really \u0022cheat-mode\u0022 if you know you\u0027re going to land it successfully every time... I\u0027ve done 13 approaches with this shuttle design (all on video) and every single one has ended in me touching down perfectly and softly, THEN something goes wrong with the mods/parts. So I know it\u0027s not me. I\u0027ve done it successfully so many times (with other designs/planes) at this point that it\u0027s second nature.

If the joint between the gear and the fuselage is sagging, then either get Kerbal Joint Reenforcement (a very good mod to have in general) or put a lot of struts between the gear and the hull. If the gear itself is sagging you can increase the spring constant in the tweakables.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mykill Metal","CreatedById":89183,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-05T11:03:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhere would I find the \u0022spring constant\u0022?
