With both stages, if I don\u0027t have any parachutes on them I get a red message that tells me they splashed down hard, however if I do have parachutes on either stage, stock or realchute, that stage gets deleted as it would without the mod, and I don\u0027t get any messages at all. This seems to be the case no matter if the parachute is deployed when dropping the stage or not (I haven\u0027t been able to tell from the mod description nor really test it for myself yet).
