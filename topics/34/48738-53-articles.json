But, KAS was a key part of my favorite utility module; take a KAS winch, put a flat connector on the movable end, and then put a small probe core, RCS jets, and a Claw on that end. Voila, a steerable, flexible claw. Not only does it make refueling in space easy (no need to EVA to set up the lines), it\u0027s a key component in my asteroid towing vessel as the cable eliminates issues with off-center towing (the rock will just oscillate a bit around the imaginary line connecting the center of mass to the ship, without need for a lot of SAS modules to keep it from torqueing too much).

To do it, KAS uses the same method that\u0027s used everywhere in game (like, in decouplers) - part.decouple(). It\u0027s part of code (function) wrote by Squad, and out of range of moders (You actualy can\u0027t modify it without KSP source code) that\u0027s likely to rely on some either function or variabe value that acts different in Unity 64 win player. And the suspect is (most probably) either convex mesh colliding into something or force vector being applied as negative, etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo we pretty much know what\u0027s the problem, there is just so much you can do about it without looking directly into KSP code. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd to add insult to injury, it seems that the issue sometimes, randomly doesn\u0027t appear (as, decouplers work in x64 around 5% time). It\u0027s something that really doesn\u0027t help while debugging without knowing exact source code of function.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETl;dr, we\u0027re looking at workaround involving not using decouple() function, or hotfix from Squad. This, or Majiir (or other moder) is coding god, and can fix it \u0022somehow\u0022.

But it\u0027s easy enough to make your own version with stock parts (and KAS, obviously). Here\u0027s a screenshot to illustrate the concept, taken just after I\u0027d refueled on the way to an asteroid:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ItNalCJ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ItNalCJ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe key is the back (right) end. The hook/winch module is attached via a 2.5m docking port in this case, so that I could dump it if necessary, but I\u0027d recommend making it integral to your ship. (Just make sure it\u0027s on the primary axis, not off-center.) The battery is for when it\u0027s separated, as are the small solar panels on the 2.5m-1.25m adapter (hard to see in this shot), so you can skip those. Then it\u0027s a vertical stack winch, flat connector on the end of the winch\u0027s line, 0.625m RCS tank (50 monoprop) with four RCS quads on its sides (very much overkill, I\u0027d recommend two at most), probe core, and finally the Claw. If you make this setup integral to your ship, I\u0027d recommend an action group that toggles the RCS jets on the hook on and off (preferably also toggling the ship\u0027s other RCS in the opposite manner) so that maneuvering the claw doesn\u0027t rotate the rest of the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe one problem I have with doing this is SAS. If the cable is extended and RCS is on, you can\u0027t really use stabilization properly as the two linked pieces will try to do all sorts of strange rotations around the center of mass. This results in the claw whipping around uncontrollably, with the potential to break things like solar panels. So, you can\u0027t really use SAS with RCS while the winch cable is extended (at least until it\u0027s attached to something heavy), and that makes it a bit harder to manage. While it\u0027d be nice if KAS could fix this, I\u0027d assume it\u0027s buried far too deeply in the engine to adjust.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Boomerang","CreatedById":92198,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-20T01:31:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan anyone confirm that the .23.5 version works fine in 32 bit .24?
