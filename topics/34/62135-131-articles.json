I\u0027m having a blast with the ships, and am going to start a mission log based off of Jeb and companies exploits in their orbiters. I do use mechjeb for takeoff and plotting maneuvers, but am hands on with everything else. I follow a slightly different takeoff checklist though. My ascent profile has the turn starting at 1k, leveled off by 70k, shooting for an 80k orbit. By doing this, I can usually empty the EFT after apoapsis, and have well over 500 Dv to use for orbital operations. I\u0027ve found that I\u0027m in good enough shape to just use the OMS thrusters alone to circularize. On re-entry, let\u0027s just say the island runway is seeing a lot of use, I keep overshooting KSC. I\u0027m getting better, although it might be because I\u0027m deorbiting at 200k instead of 75-80k. Regardless, I\u0027m getting the hang of it, I\u0027m getting closer each landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few things I was curious about though:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. I\u0027m having problems with my SST, I saw some of the twitchyness some people were complaining about, but it wasn\u0027t anything I couldn\u0027t handle. Although I\u0027m still not sure how it suddenly ended up sailing 2k away from my station, but I got it under control. No, my problem was that I couldn\u0027t get the pilot out after I was done maneuvering. My plan was to drop off the tug, EVA someone out of the orbiter, pilot the tug a bit, then get out and head back to the orbiter. But for some reason I can\u0027t get him to EVA, there\u0027s no picture to click an EVA button on. I am using Ship Manifest andConnected Living Spaces, so I\u0027m not sure if one of them is causing problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. On the Super25\u0027s, would the be big enough to fit say, a module from the Fustek Station Parts pack? I only ask because I really like this pieces, and am planning out a couple of stations the will be mixing the 1.25 and 2.5 sized parts together. Although, if your planning a series of larger modules yourself, I could always be swayed to tweak my designs. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Are your docking ports proprietary, or will the work with other parts? I\u0027m a fan of the Fustek IACBM\u0027s, but if your ports don\u0027t play well with them (or stock parts for that matter), that\u0027s no big deal, I\u0027ll just have to work up some adapters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf any of these were answered previously, I apologize. I\u0027m trying to backtrack through the posts, and I\u0027m up to mid April right now.
