I\u0027ve already made the PEC and Transport Carrier KIS compatible. However, the Carrier requires KASModulePartBay, for which there is no KIS equivalent yet (I\u0027ve asked the KIS modder about this). Using KIS, when I place the experiment on the carrier, the KEES mod does not recognize that the experiment is placed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBe advised, I have removed the KAS references from the carrier, PEC, and experiment part.cfg files.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Manimal","CreatedById":125982,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T08:00:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi, I came upon a weird bug yesterday. When moving craft with loaded OEC-1 carriers to the launch pad from the VAB it would put the craft in a weird orbit around Kerbin. However the game would not progress so it would have been eternal weird posisitoning. The game did not crash however and I could go back to the space center and the VAB and unload the OEC-1. When empty the craft would go to the launch pad normally. Also saving loaded OEC-1 would work, but when I loaded the craft it would put the VAB menues in disarray, putting all parts in one folder and no possibility to load subassemblies. I have not checked with other OEC except the mark 1.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"parrots","CreatedById":2796,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T09:45:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Nehemia Engineering Research Program is one of my favorite mods. I really like having a set of parts, experiments, and contracts that I can use to build up a lot of science fairly early on. Stock KSP\u0027s tech tree bears more similarity to where humanity is now than any truly interplanetary future we (or the Kerbals) have, and the NERP parts really fit in well with that setting.

I checked with different carriers, the 1.25 and the 2.5 m variants and when loaded with experiments destined for the MPL-600 they show the behaviour mentioned above.
