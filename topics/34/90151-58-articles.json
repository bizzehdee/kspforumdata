Pretty much no matter what you do I find that there is quite a lot of steering loss because the S-2 and S-IVB stages have low starting TWRs. In addition to that, the fuel tank mixtures are not correct, so I usually end up with extra fuel. Normally I would think this is to make up for LH2 boil-off, but there seems to be too big of a discrepancy between the fuel boil-off and extra fuel. The main thing to remember when launching the C-5 is to time your launch so that you line up with the plane of the moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENathanKell is right about the Hypergolics purpose as being storable.

Check the rocket-ship icon. Ah, nm, later you said that was it. Make sure you air-light the LR-87s, as samroberts mentioned the Titans with SRMs did not ground-light their engines, they lit them on SRM near-burnout (like, 5 seconds left). The issue with TF is that engines have rated burn times, and if you exceed them they\u0027re likely to fail...might also ping Agathorn, maybe the LR-87s don\u0027t have enough rated burntime for the IIIL application (although if memory serves the widebody core didn\u0027t burn longer, it had more fuel \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E more engines).\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem occured several times while simulating the rocket with Kerbal Construction Time. Shortly before shutting down, the failure rate number displayed by testflight increased (to still a very low percentage value). Then the engine turned off. This was also the exact message in the F3-Log. After removing Test Flight temporarily I was able to launch the rocket several times without problem. So I guess, it has to be Test flight. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was the first time, that I had an engine failure, also it was very strange that it happended several times at the exact same time/location and in a simulation. So it took some time for me to get it. The strange thing is, that Test flight didnt report a failure in its window. Just an A-button appearded, I guess, it stands for \u0022Activate\u0022, which doesn\u0027t work a second time with this engine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe burn time could indeed be an issue.

First, has the high temperature melted anything you\u0027ll need again? Second, is the combustion chamber (or nozzle) now so ablated it\u0027s not safe to reuse? Third, how do you start up the turbopump, if there is one? Not needing an ignitor is important, but not the be-all/end-all when it comes to restartability. For example, the Apollo SPS was rated for essentially infinite restarts (although a set total burn time) because it was a pressure-fed hypergolic engine with ablative cooling: so long as there was still propellant to be fed to it, and the combustion chamber and nozzle hadn\u0027t ablated away too much, you could just open the vales and light it up (ullage willing). The Agena engine, however, was pump-fed, and thus needed to spin up its turbopumps before it could light its gas generator (which was there to power the turbopumps). A bit of a chicken-and-egg situation, but it could be gotten around by judicious use of stored electricity (IIRC) to spin up the turbopumps in the absense of the generator. That said, even with enough juice, after about 18 starts (well past the rated 15? Or was it 15 and 12?) stuff was getting too melty/corroded/whatever to work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe advantage of hypergolics isn\u0027t so much that they have infinite restarts, it\u0027s that they are \u003Cem\u003Estorable\u003C/em\u003E. LOX boils off. Means you can\u0027t store the missile, you have to fuel it up before launch--and that means you need a few hours\u0027 warning, not a few minutes. It\u0027s also an issue in space--that\u0027s why pretty much everyone uses hypergolics for on-orbit maneuvers and\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInteresting stuff!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs it accurate to say that the only way that early rockets would have multiple restarts would be be using monopropellant?
