When I come back to ships, the base of the hinge has often been translated to some substantial distance outside of the ship.

The base (static) mesh moves some meters away from the top (moveable) mesh which on the other hand, stays in place correctly. The problem is only graphical, there are no physical issues though. This happens after loading the ship (quick loading or just continuing the mission, but not from start).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cameroon","CreatedById":51687,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-13T02:53:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sirkut\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sirkut\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWow that\u0027s awesome.

I got a chance to install and play with the new parts last night, great stuff, especially the rail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do have two requests (whenever you get around to requests) or maybe one request and one (known) problem. The request: a longer/taller powered hinge. I\u0027ve used the DR equivalent (with necessary cfg file editing) to fold things up flat against the craft. With this shorter hinge most things collide with the main body before it gets to 90 degrees. I could put some structural part under it, but fewer parts is always better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem I\u0027m having is one I\u0027ve mentioned before about the old DR parts -- in this case, that landing gear placed on the hinges aren\u0027t very stable. I was trying a really heavy craft last night so I want to go back and try with something closer to a normal lander, it seems better than what I was experiencing with the DR hinge. (Maybe making it longer will make this worse...) But if I use a structural part, and mount legs to that, it\u0027s stable. If I replace the structural part with a hinge, I can\u0027t get the thing to stand up any more. I think that started happening to the DR parts in 0.19 or 0.20, and it seems worse for everything (as in all the stock parts) in 0.21 -- nothing wants to hold together as solidly as it used to.
