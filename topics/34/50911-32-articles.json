Obviously, these are all things to be avoided if possible. So at a certain point, when the object is spinning too fast you stop adding angular velocity to it. But the problem with this is that it violates conservation of momentum and conservation of energy, which can cause very... strange things to happen in-game; things that can be picked up on by players.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo instead, why not try something like clamping \u003Cem\u003Etorques\u003C/em\u003E down to whatever would be necessary to keep the angular velocities below the limit? That would easily solve the conservation issues, but now all of your torques are limited by the inertia of your objects. An alternative is to take advantage of the iterative nature of the physics solver: it\u0027s not like it goes through the approximations to the equations once per frame, it does multiple iterations to increase accuracy, eventually converging to an answer; why not clamp angular velocities at the end of each iteration, to try and solve away the conservation issues? It really depends on what happens under the hood in PhysX (which I have no idea what\u0027s going on there specifically), but what was happening was that the physics engine was clamping the angular velocities to very, very low numbers, that in turn was causing torques applied to parts to be much lower than they should be (or) parts not responding properly to the torques applied to them, so wobble.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs an aside, I think the \u00227\u0022 is 7 rad/s, since I spun up a ship as fast as possible in game and it seemed to manage a little over 1 revolution a second, which is a little over 2pi rad/s, so about 7 rad/s seems right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKJR will probably continue on in some form after the official release; it has some workarounds for bugs in the launch clamps, some physics easing abilities that make sending large rockets to the pad easier (even if it\u0027s harder to launch them) and the original functions may still be necessary for Real Solar System, where things are a lot more complicated.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Endersmens","CreatedById":80723,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-25T15:32:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe only problem i have with KJR is when im warping to a maneuver and i come out of warp and have no control for about 5 or so seconds while KJR is stabilizing physics.
