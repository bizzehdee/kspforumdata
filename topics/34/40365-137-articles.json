Fairly certain that if you filled one of the smallest antimatter tanks, you could easily go on a tour of all the planets and moons without needing to refuel at all. One thing to consider is that tossing on a 62.5cm nuke reactor/generator or two will take care of your ships power needs for science transmitting and whatever else you need power for as well as keeping your antimatter containment fields fully powered. That\u0027s a MUCH lower mass solution that loading up on antimatter collectors. Additionally, those little nuke reactors will last quite some time. If I\u0027ve done my math correctly, they will last at most 26.3 years or as little as 7.9 years if you are running them hotter than base of 30%. Cut those times to 1/3 if you upgraded them (8.8 and 2.6 years respectively). Granted, you can drastically increase run times both by using a science lab on the ship to reprocess fuel or in the next patch you can use a kerbal to refuel using the upcoming nuke fuel tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThrow on one or two antimatter collectors to grab a trickle charge of antimatter whilst you are waiting for phase angles and just use one or two of the smallest nuke reactor/generator combos to power your ship.

The reactors scale non-linearly in power output with size, all of the basic ones draw quite heavily on real nuclear reactor designs that were tested for space travel. The smallest is drawn from SAFE-400, a 400KW thermal, 100KW electric nuclear reactor that NASA is currently experimenting with. This one I have scaled up somewhat to try and make the smallest size a bit more useful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the top end, we go up to Phoebus-2, which I believe was the largest nuclear reactor ever built at just over 4GW\u003Csub\u003Eth\u003C/sub\u003E and would have been used as an alternative Saturn V upper stage. This would\u0027ve been a little larger in volume terms but only marginally heavier than the Aegletes-2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, all of the nuclear reactors have better Isp than the stock versions at 915s compared to 800s for the stock nuclear engine but the thrusts start off very poor and become increasingly good as you go to the larger sizes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re therefore best off using the smallest reactor solely for power generation, the 1.25m for power generation and/or aircraft thermal jets and the two larger ones can do all that plus some spacecraft propulsion. Aegletes-2 is the one that is designed to be a really competitive spacecraft engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn 0.8, you can accentuate some of these advantages using Thorium reactors. Thorium is better suited large exploration type ships because it requires more reprocessing to remove neutron absorbing elements from the core but I have also discovered the working fluid can be higher temperature than Uranium, and that translates directly to better specific impulse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThorium will push your I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E up to 993s and thrust up by ~27%. Aegletes 2 would therefore do, with LiquidFuel propellant, 849kN @ 993s I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E, which pushes its TWR just ahead of the stock LV-N, in addition to the superior specific impulse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sarbian\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sarbian\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWould you consider an half size version of the radial radiator ?

In converted terms, each large solar panel, in Kerbin orbit, provides about 12 kW. I think. Probably around there somewhere. So in orbit around Kerbin, you\u0027d need about 417 solar panels -- bear in mind we\u0027re talking the big ones here -- to power the science lab.
