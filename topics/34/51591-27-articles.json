To try and clarify, Say I build a base on Duna, along with this base I have a few unmanned rovers, for moving stuff around, resource drilling, base assembly. the way the mod works now, to control those rovers, a signal must be passed to Kerbin, directly, or through satilite relay. Say this base only has one sat in orbit to relay, and the rovers only have the small antenna\u0027s on them. sat goes beyond horizon, signal is lost. rovers dead. What I\u0027d like to see, is an ability in the code, or a part that turns the base into a small control station that can control all the little rovers around it. say small antenna range only? so the base controls all its own little rovers, and doesn\u0027t have to wait for a link to Kerbin. It seems realistic to me, if we ever go to Mars, our astronuats on mars aren\u0027t going to be sitting around twiddling their thumbs waiting for a signal to get to the rover to move some piece of equipment around their base. They\u0027ll get out their little control and move the rover themselves. This is the idea I was talking about. And if Toadicus doesn\u0027t want to do this, that\u0027s fine.

Chief among these reasons is that I\u0027d have to use such laughably unbelievable numbers to achieve a similar effect (since the whole point of the mod is that it\u0027s important to pick the right antenna for the job), I\u0027m not sure I could sleep at night. For example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVoyager is around 19.5 terameters from Earth, sending 12 W through a 48 dBi antenna. It goes all that way, down through the atmosphere, and is received by a 74 dBi antenna. We get on the order of 10^-20 W out the tail end of that antenna, \u003Cem\u003Eand we can still hear it\u003C/em\u003E. These numbers generally even account for a bunch of the noise. Numbers from here: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://descanso.jpl.nasa.gov/DPSummary/Descanso4--Voyager_new.pdf#page40\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://descanso.jpl.nasa.gov/DPSummary/Descanso4--Voyager_new.pdf#page40\u003C/a\u003E, PDF page 40 if the bookmark doesn\u0027t work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe most distant conceivable probes in KSP are about 700 gigameters from Kerbin. Common consensus amongst the modding crowd suggests that 1 EC/sec = 1 kW. The stock 88-88 uses 20 EC every 0.1 seconds, making it a \u003Cem\u003E200 kW\u003C/em\u003E transmitter. That\u0027s four times higher than broadcast AM radio stations are allowed to run in the United States, and more than 16,000 times more powerful than Voyager\u0027s radio. These two facts together mean, all else being equal, the received power back at Kerbin would be on the order of 12 million times higher than Voyager\u0027s signal getting back to Earth. Even if we break with consensus and treat 1 EC/sec = 1 W, it\u0027s still 12000 times more power received.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis means that, in order to make things work as expected, I\u0027d need to handwave the baseline noise levels up by at least 30 dB (and perhaps 60 dB!), or completely trivialize the power usage (which would be more realistic, but clearly out of line with Squad\u0027s vision for the system). Also, this wouldn\u0027t have any direct impact on the way the mod plays: in the end, it\u0027d still basically be about comparing antennas and their ranges.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I\u0027ve decided to leave the baseline ambiguous, and make it more about comparative gains and powers instead. It puts a little more burden on the antenna designer -- you have to bake gain and power into \u0022range\u0022 yourself -- but since that\u0027s mostly me anyway, I feel like that\u0027s OK.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I \u003Cem\u003Edo\u003C/em\u003E still want to do is add circumstantial noise, which would have a direct multiplicative impact on \u0022power\u0022 (and therefore a sqrt impact on range). I\u0027m thinking I might add optional \u0022atmospheric noise\u0022 that could make it harder to transmit off and around bodies with atmospheres, and optional \u0022radiation field noise\u0022 based on localities around big planets and such.
