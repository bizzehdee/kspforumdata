Oh well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT2: Some debugging later, I\u0027m reasonably sure this is some kind of weakness in the Mono runtime rather than a problem with Chatterer. It seems entirely dependent on the \u003Cem\u003Enumbe\u003C/em\u003E of mods installed, rather than any specific mods - and there\u0027s an intermediate stage where textures go wonky and the game becomes highly crash-prone. I don\u0027t see how this can be an issue with Chatterer.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-03T19:01:46Z\u0022 title=\u002205/03/2014 07:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 3, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Baughn\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pejmany","CreatedById":105223,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-06T18:48:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDropbox is giving me download errors, anyone else?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbrud","CreatedById":92900,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-09T12:30:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh! There\u0027s a new updated version for 0.23.5? So THAT\u0027s where the airlock-sound went! I have the 0.23-version. Cool! Also, in the new version, are there docking sounds? If not, I would think that it would be possible to add sound-triggers for docking in the same manner as the sounds-triggers for entering/exiting EVA. I\u0027ll download the new version tonight and try to fiddle about with it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
