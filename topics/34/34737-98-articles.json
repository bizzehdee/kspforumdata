First pic shows the setup in the SPH, 2nd pic is after fully extending the pistons, note how one cylinder (the non-inverted one) has moved inside itself while the other (the inverted one) hasn\u0027t moved. The 3rd pic is after retracting the pistons fully. the inverted cylider is now inside itself. So that\u0027s the correct behaviour for the invert option, just the cylinders are moving the wrong way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/kdeTFr2\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/kdeTFr2m.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022kdeTFr2m.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/bZBSQE4\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bZBSQE4m.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022bZBSQE4m.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/Eh8BTxv\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Eh8BTxvm.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Eh8BTxvm.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(click pics for full size)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- putting a docking port on the end of a set of robotic parts works perfectly (thank-you that means a lot to me!). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- regular timewarping works perfectly, even when the robotic parts are under a load.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- physics timewarping causes robotics parts to behave like rubber.
