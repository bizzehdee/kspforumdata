Apparently, there are also at least two versions of the 1st stage. Aerodynamic fins were sometimes used, too, so that would be nice to see. Also, it seems that there are only two baseline rocket cores in Long March family. Long March 1 and Long March 2, the rest are derivatives of the two. A pack encompassing China\u0027s entire launcher fleet certainly seems within reach. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Long March 1 was a fairly simple rocket, it seems, with the only changes between variants being in the solid fueled 3rd stage.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-29T18:12:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOther then the orbital module a Shenzhou would just be a retextured Soyuz, no?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"chinchilla","CreatedById":101563,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-29T18:18:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Motokid600\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Motokid600\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOther then the orbital module a Shenzhou would just be a retextured Soyuz, no?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough Shenzhou is based on the Soyuz; they\u0027re different.
