In short, is it possible to build a winch/connector/port/(part) assembly while in the VAB? Basically I\u0027ve been trying to use a winch as an attachment for a minirover to my rocket. I\u0027ve got the winch/connector on the main rocket, and a radial port on the minirover, but I can\u0027t get them to attach together until after I launch. I assumed I could just start building from the winch out in the VAB, but after adding the winch, then the connector, I cannot, under any conditions, get a port to attach to the connector. Is this a mod limitation, or is there something important I\u0027m missing? After hours of struggling, my workaround is to just mount the rover onto the rocket via a decoupler, right next to the winch, then have Jeb come out and connect the cable manually after launch, but this is inelegant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, do you think you could add a radial winch at some point in the near future? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E It seems all my winches end up radial, and I\u0027d love to reduce my part count.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"0x7be","CreatedById":71709,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-18T12:13:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m trying to attach detachable connection port to my ship in EVA.

You need to activate the magnet, catch the object (rover), and then reel it back in. The rover, then, has to be small enough to not cause a collision between itself and the spacecraft, so that the magnet can be winched all the way back in, flush to the the winch base, where it will lock. I think you probably still need to power the magnet at this point, even when it is locked, but I\u0027m not sure. The best way to transport rovers in this fashion is to have the rover have an actual port for connection, but that requires a kerbal to connect it. The hook works but not very safely, the magnet works but requires electricity (it should be properly called an electromagnet).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TinyPirate","CreatedById":77813,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-18T20:34:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks, but that is kind of annoying as one can no longer build a fully attached system in the VAB.
