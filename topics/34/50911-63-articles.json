While in orbit around Kerbin (with no apparent cause and happening all at once) every single part on the station will simultaneously reach max temperature and will explode. I have only been able to replicate it four times and it doesn\u0027t happen with the mod uninstalled. It can take anywhere from 10-20 min or it can happen as soon as it has reached orbit. With out knowing the exact cause I cant replicate it in a timely manner, the only way is to either let the game sit running or put into time warp (luckily It is on my science farming station so it has to do that anyway). Like I said it can sit in warp for 10-20 min before exploding. The crash log after the ship explodes doesn\u0027t help either. It just list every single part (all 64) with the explanation \u0022part overheated\u0022.
