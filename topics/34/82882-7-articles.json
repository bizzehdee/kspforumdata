That way when you go with electrical engines or cheap economy rockets you\u0027ll prefer fission over fusion, while grand tour craft with loads of liquid fuel will lean towards fusion; warp capable ships will use antimatter since using it for anything else is overkill both in power usage and how friggin expensive it would be to maintain an antimatter fleet compared to a fleet of fission vessels.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dangerous_Beans","CreatedById":78059,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-28T05:50:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Uzcil999\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Uzcil999\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI installed the mod on a fresh 32 bit install and the only issue I observed was parts flying off the screen in the VAB.

This is exacerbated by tweakscale\u0027s configurations. Take Fusion for example: (@ 40-50% carnot vs 85% w/ direct conversion of the original; one of its main draws) 0.625 m = 63 MW vs 66 MW minus the efficiency losses; which I won\u0027t add to reduce the clutter this post already will contain. 1.25 meter = 250 MW vs 625 MW. 2.5 meter = 2 GW vs 6.8 GW. 3.75 meter = 13.5 GW vs 54 GW (rounding). That\u0027s within the same family of reactors. Scaling shouldn\u0027t be linear. These new numbers feel arbitrary. (I really don\u0027t mean for this to sound as harsh as it sounds Wave; as seriously I appreciate this mod and the work you put into it to get it working well \u0026lt;3). I won\u0027t get into fission reactors as the smaller form-factor reactors have stepped firmly outside the bounds of plausibility with their power/weight ratios. This helps out newer players wondering why they got less than 0.5 TWR and worse efficiency than the stock LV-N with the same form-factor. I also won\u0027t get into the particle-bed fission reactors (very happy with the change overall here; even though its identity is gone and it\u0027s now just a stepping-stone). Their whole niche was based on high-efficiency of power-output. In practice it was about worthless as they were heavier than the base fission reactors and never put out meaningful amounts of electricity.
