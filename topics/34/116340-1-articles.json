I was *just* thinking about an idea like this a few days ago. These were some other bullet points I had if you want any ideas for future versions.\n\n- Make pods that don\u0027t have airlocks like the 2.5m 3 seat command pod decompress-able; while decompressed all crew still in the pod have to use their EVA lifesupport suits.\n\n- Make a compressor pump module that would take say, 30-40 seconds and 10-12 ec/s? That could store airlock air as a resource in an airlock attached tank.\n\n- Using Connected living spaces and the \u0022Close Hatch\u0022/\u0022Open Hatch\u0022 actions on the docking ports to allow a CLS area to be depressurized without depressurizing areas beyond closed hatches.\n\n- Make nicer airlocks able to save ALL the air by depressurizing with pumps to a near-vacuum, and have cheaper airlocks lose some air every time they\u0027re opened.\n\n- Make an airlock action that would allow crew to \u0022blow open\u0022 an airlock and create a quick thrust vector in the direction of the airlock door, the magnitude of the vector dependent on the amount of air available to leave the airlock when the door is breached.\n\nAlso please include a link to your source code on github so we can check it out and help debug!"},{"CreatedByName":"anxcon","CreatedById":148336,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-19T20:20:02Z","Content":"technically no part has an \u0027airlock\u0027 modeled in, evidence being their IVA\n\nso can only pretend by type, and the 2.5M 3 crew pod to me feels like it has one, while the 1.25M 1 crew pod seems like it doesnt\n\neither way thats an MM script change for the loss per part\n\nwhile i could have a button to \u0027decompress\u0027 and pump out air to save it, then eva has full loss if not decompressed first\n\nthere would be no reason to not just decompress and leave it as that, since life support systems treat kerbals in pods as \u0027back safe in air\u0027\n\nCLS open/close hatch stuff would be a life support issue for LS / CLS i think, but same as decompress above, pointless\n\nnicer vs cheaper airlocks would again be an MM script per part\n\nblowing open a hatch to give a small thrust has been considered, but thats currently a weee bit past my modding skills yet ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nsource is in the zip"},{"CreatedByName":"CaelumEtAstra","CreatedById":109360,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-19T23:13:16Z","Content":"This seems like a great mod idea, but that\u0027s about it.
