I see where your trying to go with the distribution of ores and it makes sense. You can really only remove so much ore from an area before it is depleted. But given the lowish current values for Kethane, ho will that be compensated for? Will you be upping the individual hex values for Kethane to make it worth while to mine?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy line of reasoning is that 400k (Current total deposit I am mining right now in the current version) for a deposit is sizable and will probably allow you a good amount of time to stockpile and expand to other areas. At the same time the viability of deposits as the procedural craters are added to other planets becomes decreased. So there will be deposits that just can not be accessed because they are in a bad place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe benefit to this is that Kethane and mods that use the Kethane system will have greater chance of overlap as long as the deposits are more spread out.

Some of us are operating rockets that would consume that entire deposit in one launch (I\u0027ve drained two deposits on Minmus using one ship back in .18), and since the game will pick up some sort of even rudimentary economic model, kethane is going to fail that model without some adjustment. It\u0027s simply not going to be worth building the infrastructure needed to extract it unless there are deposits of considerable quantity - 10s of millions of units or more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, these can be relatively rare, in difficult places, and so on. That\u0027s as things work now IRL. Getting to it is always part of the challenge. How do you get to that deposit at the pole? How do you reach the one under the ocean? How do you cover the cost of landing on Eve and getting it off of there (and maybe you don\u0027t)?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe old system had discrete deposits that were easy to hit - pick any spot and you can drain the pond. The new system sounds much better - we\u0027ll have to be more nimble and more clever. But I think a great deal of diversity in kethane density is key - there should be some honey holes and a lot of places with some, but not enough to set up a whole operation. That will let us build both permanent mining colonies and an incentive to do rovers to pick off the easier to access but smaller deposits. Adding to the incentive, the rate at which the drills extract should be a function of the density of the deposit - so those small deposits are also slow to extract, making the rare honey holes even more temping. And if they\u0027re large and fast to work, those that just want to get on with things can do so for the cost of adapting to the conditions of the honey hole location. And if you want to take that long rover excursion, mount a drill and a portable converter and there will be plenty of fuel on your journey for that kind of effort, just not in high quantity.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Majiir","CreatedById":7550,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-20T20:48:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m approaching these changes with the philosophy that it should be easy to get a little and hard to get a lot.

Currently, you can drill about 300K units (600 tons) from a single deposit, but then the nearest deposit might be so far away that not even planes make sense for transport. I\u0027d like to encourage short- to medium-distance transport logistics. Note that this doesn\u0027t necessarily discourage the all-in-one designs that are common today, but such a design would have to \u0022hop\u0022 between areas to fill up. Refilling currently means turning everything on, timewarping, and turning everything off; you never \u003Cem\u003Edo\u003C/em\u003E anything to extract Kethane. Now, I haven\u0027t got a solution yet that makes the actual extraction more interesting, but at least the whole process of gathering and processing fuel will involve some more thought and interaction. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI want to emphasize you\u0027ll still be able to find a \u003Cem\u003Elot\u003C/em\u003E of Kethane; a deposit on the small side could easily contain 3,000-10,000 \u003Cstrong\u003Etons\u003C/strong\u003E of fuel, and denser deposits could hold even more ridiculous quantities. Part of the problem with the current deposits is once you mine one dry, you have to go a very long way to get more; the new system will let you get more with a short drive.
