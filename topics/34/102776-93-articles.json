One can\u0027t revive a mod unless the license permits it, regardless of what the author may say in personal communications.  And if the license *\u003Cu\u003Edoes\u003C/u\u003E* permit it, then that\u0027s all that one needs; no author permission required, because that *\u003Cu\u003Eis\u003C/u\u003E* the permission.  Fortunately for us all, New Horizons is licensed CC-BY-NC-SA, which is what allows reviving it like this.)"},{"CreatedByName":"linuxgurugamer","CreatedById":129964,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-06-28T12:45:54Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 2/6/2022 at 3:12 PM, coyotesfrontier said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I have an updated version with most of the bugs fixed available on my github here, made with KillAshley\u0027s permission.

I have a problem with New Horizons (both from the original [dev](https://github.com/KillAshley/New_Horizons) and from the [fork](https://github.com/GregroxMun/New_Horizons)) and Kerbalism mods. The issue is that solar panels generate 0 electricity, solar storms last an eternity (~20y) and food supplies also last an eternity(9y for 1 kerbal with the smallest can)\n\nIt looks like all times are multiplied by some huge constant,  thus making all Kerbalism-related timings incredibly long. Stock time works fine however, e.g. planets orbit normally, maneuvers take a sane amount of time\n\nP.s. I tried OPM mod and it works fine with Kerbalism. I\u0027ve briefly inspected configs for OPM planets and New Horizons, but I didn\u0027t spot anything suspicious.
