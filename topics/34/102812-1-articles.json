Thus for a 1000 day mission with enough greenhouse capacity, you have to bring 100 days of water and 200 days of food as shown by the TAC Life Support helper window. And of course some reserves/buffer for every resource (including waste products) in addition to enough energy to run the greenhouse continuously.\n\nThe Nutrient transformation is necessary to allow a planned incorporation of mined resources in the future.\n\nShutters are just cosmetic at the moment, because those would lead to frustration with BackgroundProcessing, since your vessel does not rotate to track the sun.\n\n![XenlTUW.png](http://i.imgur.com/XenlTUW.png)\n\nThe SETI-Greenhouse provides configs for the following **mod combinations** as well as the CommunityTechTree:\n\n[TABLE=width: 800]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]**Mods**\n\n[/TD]\n\n[TD]**Configuration**\n\n[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]**none**[/TD]\n\n[TD]No converters/function, but a nice looking part for space stations[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]USI Life Support\n\n[/TD]\n\n[TD]108 supplies last for 200 days, 3.2EC/s required per kerbal[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]TAC Life Support\n\n\u002B BackgroundProcessing\n\n[/TD]\n\n[TD]Same as above, but uses only 1.2EC/s[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]TAC Life Support\n\n[/TD]\n\n[TD]Same as above, but uses only 0.12EC/s[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[/TABLE]\n\nPS: And no, SETI stands for Space Exploration \u0026 Technology Initiative in case of the Greenhouse, or Scope, Economy \u0026 Tech Integration in case of the BalanceMod ;-)!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-20T22:10:56Z\u0022 title=\u002202/20/2016 10:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 20, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Yemo**"},{"CreatedByName":"FreeThinker","CreatedById":117389,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T22:41:51Z","Content":"Nice!"},{"CreatedByName":"DirtyFace83","CreatedById":131509,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T23:17:17Z","Content":"Nice!

It receives the converters via ModuleManagerConfigs if TAC Life Support is detected.\n\nAnd those conveters can be deactivated again.\n\nThough if it does not have enough input resources (because eg only 2 kerbals are on the station instead of 3), it should only run at 2/3 capacity.\n\nThat might be a problem for testing on the lauch pad aswell, since kerbals do not consume oxygen and produce carbon dioxide below 5km on kerbin.\n\nThe consumption/production does not automatically adjust to different TAC settings levels.\n\nAbout the back, imho a greenhouse for space would look very different in reality, much less wasted space, no or extremely few windows (everything lit by LED).\n\nBut that is the model zzz released to the public domain, and I do not do models and textures myself.\n\nPersonally I use Ven\u0027s StockPartRevamp, putting a docking port on at least one side and long fixed ladder segments on that back strip.\n\n![7VSAxkt.png](http://i.imgur.com/7VSAxkt.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"Mapoko","CreatedById":139980,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-29T20:51:10Z","Content":"I did edit my message about the TAC, because I renamed it\u0027s folder and apparently it was not working, now everything is fine.\n\nThe ladder seems nice.\n\nSo just to clarify, it replaces the TAC recycle parts, concerning waste products turning into consumables for the kerbals, except the ones that work around with fuel, right ?\n\n**Idea :**  (for the large one only)\n\nAre you considering an option to put a scientist/engineer/both inside to increase efficiency ? \n\nProbably just 1, because having 2 inside do not justify the extra resources consumed.\n\nExample : Having level 3 or higher scientist or engineer increases efficiency by 50%, so having one inside justifies the resource he uses and adds enough for half more kerbal.\n\nNot sure how visualization works, but when shutters are open maybe we can see the kerbal inside ?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-29T20:54:07Z\u0022 title=\u002203/29/2015 08:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mapoko**"},{"CreatedByName":"Yemo","CreatedById":114412,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-29T21:20:12Z","Content":"Yep, if you have sufficient greenhouse capacity,\n\nyou only need about 10% of the usual water and 20% of the usual food.\n\nThe greenhouse consumes all the waste products and with the extra water and food, it fulfils all oxygen, water and carbondioxide needs.\n\nI m not aware of fuel components in TAC life support.\n\nCrew requirement and efficiency: I was considering that, especially with regards to MKS/OKS compatibility.

Solo mission.\n\nYes, 10 times as much water consumption and 5 times as much food consumption. And of course all the oxygen.\n\nThe recyclers are meant for those more mass sensitive missions. Unfortunately you would have to use the SETI-BalanceMod to have mass balanced recyclers.\n\nBut you could use the Universal Storage recyclers, though they seem to be op when not balanced by SETI. At least they are lightweight and not thus useful for 1-3 kerbal missions, unlike those massive TAC life support things.\n\nAlso, the Greenhouse actually supports 1.02 kerbals or 3.06 for the larger one. So for example if you have greenhouses for 12 kerbals, they could support 12.24. When you make a one day trip (6hours) with one kerbal and return the waste products, they would get processed as well within the following 6/0.24= 25 hours."},{"CreatedByName":"WoollyMittens","CreatedById":138628,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-01T02:35:30Z","Content":"Just in time for the Easter long weekend.
