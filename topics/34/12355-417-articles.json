Ascent guidance created the node for final orbital burn but when it came time to start the engines, nothing happened. If I disabled the engines the throttle jumped to 100% but re-enabling them the throttle jumped back to zero. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was related to the decoupler. I had decoupled the nose cone during ascent, the decoupler with arrows up had fired off the cone but whatever was left of it, the inert ring, remained attached and its image remained in the staging list as part of the current stage. Once I created a new dummy stage 0 and move the ghost of the decoupler into it the MechJeb burn executed without a hitch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a further test I recreated the flight but this time the cone decoupler was placed with the arrow pointing down so it would fly off attached to the nose cone.

You can \u0022target center of mass\u0022 on the asteroid, but then MJ thinks no target is selected. This makes it super hard to align the thrust vector with the center of mass.
