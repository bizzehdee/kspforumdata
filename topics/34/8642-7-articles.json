On the flip side of that I have launched many Bigtraks with just a Mk1 Command Pod had to scrap whole rockets because the thing would not leave the atmosphere.

Mine was attached directly to the nose of the bigtrak. All I know for sure is this: I tried to remake the same craft you did, chickenplucker, based on your pics and I\\\u0027m sure it was nearly identical. I made literally 7 entirely different rocket designs, flew some of them entirely out of the atmosphere at a speed below 165m/s, had the bigtraks stacked on top of multiple decouplers, I followed every single piece of advice everyone mentioned in the entire thread, and nothing helped until I removed the floodlight. This includes spacecraft designs where the bigtrak didn\\\u0027t even have anything beneath it at ALL for the wheels to touch (spacecraft built around the bigtrack in a dropship design). Without exception, every single time my camera would end up so far behind the spacecraft that I could barely see it. Once I removed the floodlight and used my stock super powerful and fast launch vehicle there was no problem whatsoever. What this may point at is not that there is a problem with the floodlight itself, but that while everyone is so focused on what is *below* the wheels, some of us might not have paid any attention to what is *around* or *above* the wheels and as a consequence while we were assuming that the camera error was caused by the wheels bumping into the fuel tank maybe they are bumping into the floodlight/bigtrak itself? Pure conjecture on my part, but I\\\u0027m trying to make sense of it. Two anecdotes does not make a scientific case study, but you do have two people who are reporting the exact same problem with the floodlights attached, and once removed, no problem at all.
