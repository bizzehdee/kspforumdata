All I ask is that if you intend to re-distribute DeepFreeze Continued... code, configs, models, etc you must do so within the rules of the License agreement (see the OP). Or, if you intend to just distribute your own module manager change config files, that you clearly state that it is their own configs/changes and that I will not support said re-distribution/configs/files. But you are free to post them here or anywhere else. I fully support those who want to do things like this and am happy for you to do so. but it is too much of an overhead for me to manage and distribute and support all these modified configs, etc.\n\n![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-11T01:27:43Z\u0022 title=\u002209/11/2015 01:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by JPLRepo**"},{"CreatedByName":"JPLRepo","CreatedById":114736,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-11T07:34:36Z","Content":"V0.18.2.0 is out.
