There\u0027d be almost no new features and I\u0027d likely have to remove a few features to get everything to work with the stock GUIs.

So you could have one save with really quick build times and another with slow ones.

But I also tend to interact with the community fairly often and don\u0027t have a habit of going dark, and I tend to take your suggestions and try to act on them. I think so far I\u0027ve been a benevolent dictator \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E This is by far the simplest method for me to continue with development, but it obviously has some disadvantages.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Pass off KCT to another developer. I don\u0027t really want to do this because I enjoy working on KCT. I\u0027ve brought it to the point it\u0027s at now and it\u0027s one of my greatest accomplishments. But I also know that I don\u0027t have the time to develop it into the amazing piece of software it could be. So I could put it up for adoption and let someone with more time, or more skill, or more vision continue development on it. But if that person falls short as well, it could totally kill the mod and I might not be able to come back to catch it before it falls. It\u0027s a risk, but it might have the greatest reward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Form a development team. This is kind of the compromise between the other two options, but brings with it it\u0027s own challenges. Organizing people is hard. Organizing people without ever meeting them face to face is even harder. And when they\u0027re at wildly different skill levels and have wildly different methods it can be a serious challenge. The mixed styles can result in a discontinuous feeling in the final product: for instance, the other developer(s) might want a stockalike feel for something they\u0027re working on and integrate it into the stock GUIs but I prefer making a new GUI where I know I can do what I want. Suddenly there\u0027s this big disconnect between these two elements, and that can honestly make it more jarring to interact with than my crappy GUIs. There have been games released in the past where different developers have worked on different parts of the game and none of it feels cohesive. Those games don\u0027t sell well for a reason. But, if we can all work together well, some really amazing things can happen from this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The question that follows from this is how big of a team should it be? Just two people, or should we go bigger? Two is manageable, but 5 or more could do a whole hell of a lot of work (Squad\u0027s game dev team is less than 10-15 people and they made this whole game)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: The extra info included in the poll options are very clearly affected by my opinion, and for that I apologize. The poll likely won\u0027t be a totally fair poll as a result, so if people want me to rewrite it to be less biased then I can do so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit 2: If it wasn\u0027t obvious, you can select multiple options. I will pick the top one or two to focus on (depending on how long they take to complete). If you pick UI overhaul, that\u0027ll be by itself, but I can probably mix the Simulation Overhaul and Other Mod Integration (as an example, there are other valid combinations as well).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELink to poll: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://strawpoll.me/4235203\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://strawpoll.me/4235203\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-29T16:03:37Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2015 04:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by magico13\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"enneract","CreatedById":56759,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T16:05:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022magico13\u0022 data-cite=\u0022magico13\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Improved/Reworked Simulations.

A definite improvement over KCT\u0027s current system).

I might do presets at the same time since it might not be too hard to add it in. The next thing that\u0027s winning is integration with other mods, which will likely wait until after the API comes out since other mods might instead integrate with KCT, but I might do some of that at the same time as the API.

This was my original plan for the next update.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The UI overhaul. This would be a lot of work to do and I\u0027d need enneract\u0027s help for it, but the end result would be awesome. I\u0027d have to rewrite about half of KCT or more (again) since I have too much going on in the GUI code that would need moved. There\u0027d be almost no new features and I\u0027d likely have to remove a few features to get everything to work with the stock GUIs. It might also break mod compatibility in some instances (imagine if two mods decided to take over a stock GUI. I\u0027ve already run into trouble with other mods that take over the launch button). I\u0027d expect this no earlier than the end of the summer (so, August).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- An API for other modders to integrate their mods into KCT. Pretty much no matter what I\u0027m going to be starting on this, but if you all want me to focus on it as the primary component, I can try to kick out a fully functioning API. This will actually require changes that will allow for the UI overhaul in the future, and might allow for a different mod to do the UI overhaul while KCT remains with it\u0027s weird GUIs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Preset configurations. I was also planning on doing this soon and forgot to add it to the poll. Basically, since KCT is so amazingly configurable I want to provide several preset configurations that you can choose from at the start. This would move 99% of the configuration options into the save file (or save folder), aka the Game settings, instead of having the separate Time and Global settings. So you could have one save with really quick build times and another with slow ones. And you could have one save where all the rates are defined by Stock upgrades and another where they use the Upgrade Point system. Other mods could provide presets (like Realism Overhaul) and don\u0027t have to worry about overwriting your configs. Basically, this needs to happen eventually and \u003Cstrong\u003Eif you want me to do this please choose the \u0022This is not an option, it\u0027s another question\u0022 option\u003C/strong\u003E (which is really another question \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI voted for these four. However, it looks like an API would take care of pretty much everything, especially if enneract would be doing the simulation piece for you (via API), and a GUI overhaul (also via API?). The other mod interactions will use the API (or, if not, you can eventually do your own integration, again via the API). The API seems to be a clear winner that will allow you to do what you want, when you want. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf ultimately you decide to go a different direction than Holodeck, you\u0027ll be able to do that too, when the time comes.
