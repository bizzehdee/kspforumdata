Type in 90 and it\u0027ll roll 90 degrees. Set control to a docking port then set a docking port on another ship as target and SASS doesn\u0027t align the roll axis to the targeted port. SASS force roll to target alignment would be a useful option, especially when manually docking a ship with an overabundance of RCS thrust such as the small RTG power pods I added to my Duna ship at the last minute.
