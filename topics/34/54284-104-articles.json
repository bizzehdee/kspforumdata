I do not have issues like this. The only thing that really draws my eye is the poor graphics rendering, I\u0027d almost hazard a guess that maybe active texture management isn\u0027t playing nice. I\u0027d suggest clearing that out, and testing it. If I remember correctly, in a previous version of ATM there was a bug that broke Minmus, you couldn\u0027t land there or build anything there.

Yes after I installed ATM some textures got really bad. But the problem is the game runs good without EL, but when I install it I get this. And I cant just uninstall EL because I have a big space station with its parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI uninstalled all mods, reinstalled them one by one and when I install EL I get this problem. It might be a problem with MKS.
