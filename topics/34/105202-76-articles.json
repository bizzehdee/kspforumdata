Thanks for all your work.\n\nIn other news, I\u0027m a bit confused how Homesickness and Habitation work together. I\u0027m pretty sure I see how Habitation is calculated. Sounds like Habitation is attached to a particular ship and decreases by the amount of time Kerbals spend on it. When it hits zero the ship is permanently uninhabitable. Meanwhile, Homesickness is attached to each Kerbal. Is this what \u0022MaxOffKerbinTime\u0022 is in the safe file? How is it calculated? Sounds like it can go up or down depending on what ship they\u0027re in?\n\nEdit: Oh, and why does Settings.cfg say HabMultiplier is 1 by default?
