It revolves around the idea that a resource is used only to advance your own path in the game and does not really offer anything in its own right other then opportunities to get more resources.\u003Cp\u003EWith all of this discussion about resources, I got to thinking about another model for their use, the Development Model. Unlike Exploitation, the development model looks at resources as a way to develop game play, in this case the natural progression of space travel to colonization. Resources would be Water, Food, Waste, Kerbals (non-playable), and materials (Kethane, Ore, Etc).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe point of the development model is to give the player a larger sense of accomplishment when their development reaches points of sustainability. This is more like what you would see in SimCity or Anno2070. This would not invalidate what has been done, but would alter the path of resources to something other then just mining for the sake of mining. A process that is, in game terms, something of a dead end.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf interested I would not mind discussing this in more detail with you, but right now with ideas flowing in my mind I could go on for pages. Eah probably will as I detail out the ideas. But I was just wondering if this path was under consideration as it would offer a different perspective to resource development and would be in line with what a space programs ultimate goals would be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour question speaks in broad terms, but I think I understand what you\u0027re getting at. I hadn\u0027t been thinking along those lines, but there\u0027s no reason other resources couldn\u0027t fit that model. For example, a Laythe base with sufficient equipment and power might constantly generate life support resources in a way that\u0027s tracked while offline and through timewarp, so you could set up infrastructure and not worry about it as long as your crew is inside. Exploitation will probably remain the primary mode of operation for Kethane, but I\u0027ll ponder alternatives. (And, of course, feel free to elaborate.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
