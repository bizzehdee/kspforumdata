I used 0.625m reactor\u002Bgenerator instead, which was intended to use he-3 to generate enough power for big reactor to run. But... it turned out that generator is using charged particles from big reactor, it will show things like \u0022maximum power 11.78MW, current power 46.4MW\u0022 and run just fine in D/T fuel mode. And it also work fine with small reactor disabled or fuel deprived.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-15T09:10:43Z\u0022 title=\u002202/15/2014 09:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 15, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Lightwarrior\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tochas","CreatedById":92786,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-15T10:16:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi, I built a 24 science laboratory space station at LKO, it is powered by a 2.5 reactor and an upgraded generator plus 4 massive radiators it hosts 49 of the less stupid kerbals I could manage to gather before launch, each lab supposedly generates between 0.8 to 1.3 science per day (about 2 science per day total).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/72963294/2014-02-15_00005.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222014-02-15_00005.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebut after a 7 day time warp with another vessel, when returning to the station I only got 1 science\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/72963294/2014-02-15_00004.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222014-02-15_00004.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat am I missing?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lightwarrior","CreatedById":93585,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-15T10:41:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf it says 0.133/day it will generate 0.133/day...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd those messages are per lab i think, so if you will check your R\u0026amp;D you probably got ~24 science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso it is very inefficient, you can get comparable amount of science if you land 2 labs on something like Ike.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"forsaken1111","CreatedById":2703,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-15T12:05:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt says 0.13 science per day per lab. 0.13 times 24 labs = 3.12 science per day.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo after 7 days he should have received ~21.84 science.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sevio","CreatedById":97873,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-15T12:14:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SV-ESK\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SV-ESK\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOpenResourceSystem\\PlanetResourceData\\oceanicresourcedefinitions.cfg\u003Cp\u003EOCEANIC_RESOURCE_DEFINITION\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E{\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E name = LaytheLithium\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E guiName = Lithium\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E celestialBodyName = Laythe\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E abundance = 0.000000237\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E}\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks, I hadn\u0027t thought of looking in the OpenResourceSystem dir yet.
