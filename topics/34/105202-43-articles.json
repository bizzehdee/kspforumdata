I noticed that if I have two Habitats running with 2 kerbals in each (hab\u002Brecycler active) that I am self sustaining without the addition of anything else (nothing it used up, like fertilizer etc). Supplies do not run out, only mulch keeps accumulating.\n\nIf I run 3 greenhouses (for 4 kerbals) I eat away more mulch than they produce, Dirt is used but I use a regolith to replenish. But basically I can run without the greenhouses, just two habitats, and the counter will stop counting down indefintely.\n\nIs this a bug?\n\n[edit] It behaves differently than I would expect seeing the flowchart. I have 4 kerbals, 2 habitats (2 kerbals each), one greenhouse and a regolith sifter and I am 100% self-sustained without using any fertilizer. Also two Nom-o-matic 2500s will become self-sustaining for 4 kerbals, but this does use up fertilizer.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-08T02:40:57Z\u0022 title=\u002212/08/2015 02:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jimbodiah**"},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-08T12:50:33Z","Content":"Will need to take a look.
