You can just split your gamedata in two different ones, load the game one time with each, and merge them back together. Atm cache will merge as well and you should then be able to boot without crash. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only advantage of this is that you don\u0027T have to worry about restarting the process everytime it crashes.

It gets stuck on detaileve1.png which is a 14.1kb file and then the game crashes. It\u0027s loaded up most of my heavy-load mods (KW, B9 etc) but always gets stuck on this. I have read through this thread that people have had issues similar and kept restarting and it gets there eventually, but I\u0027ve tried many, many times and KSP just crashes every time. Thanks for the RAM savings though, and from what it loads before it crashes it is a lot faster than 3-8!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Saint-Stanislas","CreatedById":72776,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-10T01:25:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMaybe you can try making an exceptions in atm configs for that particular file ? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EACTIVE_TEXTURE_MANAGER_CONFIG\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E{\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E folder = Astrosomething\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E enabled = true\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E OVERRIDES\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E {\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Astrosomething/pathtothefile/filename\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E {\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E compress = false\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E mipmaps = false\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E scale = 1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E max_size = 0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E }\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E }\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rodion","CreatedById":75111,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-10T01:27:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eupdate:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eunfortunately i\u0027m also getting the no clouds in EVE/AVP bug too right now. however, to ease the burden of recaching the ludicrous textures, i resized the astronomer\u0027s 8K textures to 4K (which is enough for me anyway, personally) and crushed them more aggressively than the originals (at no small cost; my CPU hit 65 C for about an hour, bits of programs\u0027 GUIs started breaking and i could faintly smell singed dust wafting from my case, no joke), the result is that my \\Clouds\\Textures folder is down to 66MB from 208MB (almost two whole B9 installations\u0027 worth of difference) which should greatly ease loading.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eif anyone else is running astronomer\u0027s visual pack and could do with the smaller textures you can \u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/31907122/kspscreens/AVP.clouds.crushed.7z\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eget them here (7zip)\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Enow to see if i can normalize the clouds issue. i might try setting up an exclusion for all of \\BoulderCo from ATM if i have to but i\u0027ll just recache, mess around and see.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LitaAlto","CreatedById":110917,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-10T02:07:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022rodion\u0022 data-cite=\u0022rodion\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eif anyone else is running astronomer\u0027s visual pack and could do with the smaller textures you can \u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/31907122/kspscreens/AVP.clouds.crushed.7z\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eget them here (7zip)\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFYI Astronomer is attempting to re-release the latest AVP with reduced textures.
