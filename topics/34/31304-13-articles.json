You can gather them in science missions (= space telescope or something like that), on space stations or on mining missions (there won\u0027t be many missions that will give you the chance to gather research points. A simple communication satellite is not a science mission). Those mysterious research points will limit your abilities to build rockets. Say you just started the game and you want to fly to Jool. You probably want some NERVAs on your rocket to get there. Those NERVAs have high ISP values and you don\u0027t have enough research points to build them efficiently. That means you will pay much more for those engines. Once you have enough research points, you can build everything efficiently and the costs will be the same as before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is one huge problem with this approach: I don\u0027t know how to balance this... my idea was to provide enough research points in the Kerbin system.

At the moment when I send a satellite into orbit the main cost of the mission is the LV, I don\u0027t want LV\u0027s to be really cheap, I just think that payloads aren\u0027t valuable enough at the moment. One way I see of tackling this is to make all probe cores, batteries, solar cells etc much more expensive. This would tie in well with the difficulty setting you mentioned (i.e. \u003Cstrong\u003Eeasy = low probe costs\u003C/strong\u003E | \u003Cstrong\u003Ehard = high probe costs\u003C/strong\u003E).
