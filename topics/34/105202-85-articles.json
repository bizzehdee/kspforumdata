First noticed this when I kept crashing with a heavy modded save.. whether it was the cause or not, I am not sure but I created a brand new fresh install (deleting the entire KSP directory) and used CKAN to download only USI and Roverdude mods like Community Resources with their dependencies.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E ERROR Object reference not set to an instance of an object IN ModuleLifeSupport\n\u003E \n\nCan you please confirm USI-LS version and KSP version?"},{"CreatedByName":"CraveMode","CreatedById":99116,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-19T15:41:48Z","Content":"KSP version (Tested on fresh copies) is 1.1.0.1228, 1224, and 1215   \n\nUSILS 0.4.1.0\n\nI tested in my previous installations (backup each update since 1215) and it has happened. I can\u0027t seem to find any more specific information other than that error, which isn\u0027t very detailed. Since I had seen in an earlier post a few pages back that this was fixed in one of your 1.1 releases, that it may be related or something is causing it. Maybe the resource pack?\n\nIf there is anything else you might need, let me know.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-19T15:42:13Z\u0022 title=\u002204/19/2016 03:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 19, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by CraveMode**"},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-19T16:14:42Z","Content":"hm, try on a new save maybe?

Here\u0027s some documentation from NASA on the subject:\n\n[http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20040012725.pdf\u0026ved=0ahUKEwjDsIn3rp3MAhUP0WMKHXLXAHgQFggeMAE\u0026usg=AFQjCNGFic4si6KP6fDS_jmqcwxM0Y879Q\u0026sig2=y3p8nXj332xyXK5E3Ga7bQ](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t\u0026source=web\u0026rct=j\u0026url=http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20040012725.pdf\u0026ved=0ahUKEwjDsIn3rp3MAhUP0WMKHXLXAHgQFggeMAE\u0026usg=AFQjCNGFic4si6KP6fDS_jmqcwxM0Y879Q\u0026sig2=y3p8nXj332xyXK5E3Ga7bQ)\n\nAlthough that document only shows roughly 32kg a day (5kg metabolic and 27kg hygiene), RoverDude once explained how he got to 64kg - I just don\u0027t remember how.\n\nYou then need to use parts with recyclers to reduce consumption.  I know there is at least a 75% recycler and I think there might be a 90% one (not positive on that though, I\u0027ve been waiting on 1.1 full release to get back into playing regularly.)\n\nYou can also reduce consumption rates in the config files, if you believe they\u0027re too high."},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-20T14:21:35Z","Content":"Yep, as noted, we\u0027re including everything - eating, drinking, hygiene - To the tune of about 16.2L of stuff.  Time is also based on the 6 hour Kerbal day, not a 24 hour earth day, to reflect the time compression in KSP (i.e. all of this is Kerbal scaled).\n\nFor a very short mission, not a big deal.  For a larger one, you will be investing in recyclers pretty quickly."},{"CreatedByName":"danfarnsy","CreatedById":67183,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-20T22:24:55Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 8 hours ago, RoverDude said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Time is also based on the 6 hour Kerbal day, not a 24 hour earth day, to reflect the time compression in KSP (i.e. all of this is Kerbal scaled).\n\u003E \n\nThat makes sense. I used 24-hour timeframes for easier comparison to real life usage, but also because the USI-LS build aid in the VAB appears to report numbers based on 24 hour days. When I threw on the 1.25 m life support canister with a Mk1 pod, it told me the 500 kg of supplies included would last 7 days, 17 hours, which are obviously earth days, or about 31 kerbal days. It\u0027s unnecessary for quick Mun trip, but about right for a Minmus landing mission.  \n\nAt any rate, thanks for the helpful responses, everybody! Especially that reference document, [@mcortez](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/153791-mcortez/). After Army time, training, exercises, and deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan, my intuition is skewed by not-quite-comparable experiences. I know you can get by for shorter periods of time with a lot less than this, but you get very stinky, throw away a lot of disposables, and it\u0027s easy to underestimate water consumption because you\u0027re frequently re-supplied on that count. Even for carrying a few liters on backpacking in the mountains (gets heavy fast), you end up having to do your own \u0022ISRU\u0022 from streams and lakes (though your caloric and straight water needs are a lot higher carrying weight on your back over rough terrain versus riding in space capsules).  \n\nI think I\u0027ll leave it as it is, for now. At the very least, it makes for interesting gameplay challenges.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-20T22:28:04Z\u0022 title=\u002204/20/2016 10:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 20, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by danfarnsy**"},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-20T23:01:34Z","Content":"[@danfarnsy](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/67183-danfarnsy/) - thanks for your service.
