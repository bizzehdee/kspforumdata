At least game loads my ships faster on launchpad. There use to be like 20s hold. But since this is mearly a memory issue and nothing to do this great mod, there is nothing fractal can do for us. Strange that i have plenty of memory left (of the 32bit \u0027pool\u0027), oh well....game is getting bit old anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf there is one thing that could use quick updating, its the microwave receiver, the umbrella variant that causes all kinds of troubles.

I had a lot of fun playing with it. The acuracy of the physsics laws involved like angular light incidence, radiation inverse square law and thermal radiation properties (i dint check them very much).

Very elegant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I have some doubts or questions, to test this, I delete almost all other parts less the ones that has relevance with thermal or electrical properties.

This is the base weight or not?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy estimation taking 1300 w/m2 at (1AU kerbin orbit) with 1N of force, is that the real solar sail dimentions are close to 400mts x 400mts, in KSP scale 1/10 this will be 40x40 like the model that we see (I understand this is mostly to avoid some unity engine problems and practical implementation of the solar sail)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy you choose 1T? Is for technical problems with the strenght of the sail due to KSP way to calculate things or the weight of the sail in 400mtsx400mts using kapton (sunjammer material)? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell like I said, is a great mod and job, Congrats Fractal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs weird that not much people is testing this.
