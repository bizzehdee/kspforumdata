When the Ares V was then redesigned around the use of five (later six[1]) RS-68B rocket engines currently used on the Delta IV EELV family, the EDS was then redesigned using only a single J-2X engine and a common bulkhead, thus in its final design, the EDS resembled an oversized S-IVB, but with the capability of on-site storage (using new propellant storage techniques along with a \u0022loiter skirt\u0022 containing solar panels for electricity) for up to 4 days, something impossible with the old S-IVB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Ares V in the new release has five engines while the EDS has one engine.

I have 8GB in my games PC and KSP crashed on me several times when I first played it with mods because I INSTALLED ALL THE MODZ and had too many mods loaded at once. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBobCat\u0027s mods do take up a fair bit of RAM (it\u0027s worth it \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E ) because there are a lot of parts to them all with their own textures. Because of the nature of the mods it\u0027s unavoidable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing you can try, if you have the spare hard drive space, is copy the WHOLE KSP folder out to a new location and run the KSP.exe file in that folder (this even works with Steam, I have 4 installs on my PC). You can then strip out everything except the Soviet pack and see if you still have the crash.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYep, that\u0027s what I do as well. I have a separate install with Soviet pack and functionality mods (MJ, DR, FAR) only, with even some stock parts removed. Same with Constellation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the limit of RAM for 32-bit apps is not 3.8GB. Actually 3.25 GB is an upper limit of whole RAM used on a 32-bit OS. The actual limit for 32-bit application is 2GB. This can be increased if an application has IMAGE_FILE_LARGE_ADDRESS_AWARE flag in image header. I don\u0027t know if KSP.exe has this but it probably doesn\u0027t. There was once an application that force set this flag on binary level, I used it with Unreal Engine 3 based games (e.g. Mass Effect 2) and in Battlefield 2, but it should work on any 32-bit .exe AFAIK. Unfortunately I don\u0027t remember its name. MS Visual Studio also has an universal tool for this AFAIK.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MDBenson","CreatedById":65560,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-21T12:52:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve seen KSP use top-side of 2.8GB if RAM on my system so I guess it is using an expanded memory space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the moment I have the following installs of KSP:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Rockets (for KW and AIES-based rocket dev)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - RealSpace (basically has all BobCat\u0027s stuff, ISS and Lionhead Ariane/ATV 5 installed)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Spaceplanes (B9, Tav Pizza, FAR) - don\u0027t use this much because I suck at it \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Test (surrently testing the ModularfuelTanks mod)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Main (my Steam install, which has all sorts of stuff installed and is relaly slow and crashy).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBreaking it down like that means faster loading times and I never run out of RAM \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BobCat","CreatedById":22422,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-21T14:25:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst.
