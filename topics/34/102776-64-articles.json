This assure the home body has a magnetosphere and a belt. Also gas giants all get very strong radiation belts (deadly!). I checked the results against stock and RSS bodies (using the planner) and they are okay-ish: Venus has a smaller magnetopause but stronger magnetic field than Earth, Mars has a weaker one with no belt and most of the moons have no magnetic field at all, for example. There is no configuration unfortunately, but this has the advantage that it support all planet packs and rescale mods automatically.\n\u003E \n\nLooks like you may not be able to tweak the actual radiation part of the mod to better fit NH, but with gas giants having a very strong radiation belt, it sounds like exiting Sonnah could be a very interesting experience ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022;)\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"KillAshley","CreatedById":128696,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-18T14:38:47Z","Content":"\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:22px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOK so for everyone interested in the further development of NH\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\n\nThe development of NH 2.0 is underway. While this process could be extremely quick, or extremely slow I cant really say. However while reading what feedback i got about the choices i saw originally, I have decided the best course of action is a complete refit of the planetary bodies. For a long time I have been slowly working on other packs to better my own skills and improve the finished products of what i release. You can see a clear difference in quality if you look at my latest packs; Uncharted Lands, and KASE (links in my sig for those who are unaware), and it\u0027s this quality I hope to bring to NH which, since it\u0027s beginnings, was a cobbled together pack that has worn my motivation thin for the longest time. My future goal is to update this pack to a sufficient quality that i can actually be proud of.\n\nSo after reading my ramblings above you may be concerned about the finished product, and how it will affect your own views on the pack. My main focus is to make the bodies unique, and to stick to the *original* idea that they embodied. These ideas aren\u0027t specifically used currently in NH, but they were the essence of the planets when i made them before adapting them to the pack. I think returning the focus to creating an actual plan to what the body is for will help the process of creating something to change the game for the better Returning to these ideas will also help me create a roadmap for the overhaul and allow me to tailor the worlds to something that not only fits the system better, but provides the beauty and unique aspects i want to bring in.\n\n**Original Ideas:**\n\nSpoiler\n\n- **Ernus** - semi-molten rocky body\n- **Moh** - deadly, super-heated gas giant\n- **Arin** - hot desert world\n- **Astid** - clump of rock in arin\u0027s rings\n- **Atell** - rocky moon\n- **Derso** - partially destroyed moon\n- **Sonnah** - main gas giant with an oxygenated atmosphere.\n- **Aptur** - captured asteroid\n- **Serran** - dead terrestrial world\n- **Lave** - frozen planet\n- **Eli** - rocky moon\n- **Leouch** - planet split by internal forces\n- **Nolas** - canyoned ice ball\n- **Titanus** - frozen super-terra\n- **Ete** - smooth ball with mountainous ridges\n- **Oree** - asteroid\n- **Vanor** - Cold gas giant, the largest in the system\n- **Tidus** - ice world with central channel\n- **Etal** - world imploded by own gravity\n\n**Goals of update:**\n\n**Visual overhaul**\n\nMy main goal for the visual aspect of the update is to bring in the quality of visuals as i mentioned above. The main focus for comparison to help this part is my other pack KASE, which overhauls the stock worlds. The future of NH will match KASE visuals perfectly, so that they may be played together, and provide equal visuals for the world. No longer wil NH have the weird over-the-top super-realism it has (i don\u0027t know why i did that tbh).\n\n**Terrain overhaul**\n\nThis aspect will be changing the worlds to actually have not only decent terrain, but terrain that accurately reflects the worlds they are made for. Existing heightmaps are either modified and used, or removed entirely depending on the body. This will change how the planets actually look, especially seeing as how bodies are becoming more unique, but will result in a much better pack at the end of the process.\n\n**Balancing the system/De-cluttering**\n\nThis is a big one. I know most people have the mentality of more planets = better, but I will be focusing on removing the \u0022junk\u0022 planets that don\u0027t really have any incentive to visit, this might also help with people\u0027s wish for additional Sonnah system worlds, as moons could get a little juggle around ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022) However creating a stable system that allows for the same gameplay will be a major driving force.\n\nRegardless of how the pack releases as 2.0, the older versions will still be available for people, so those who don\u0027t want change can still play the (current) 1.x versions.\n\nAnyway thanks for reading, have some sneak-peek dev pics with KASE\n\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/Xa6gh/embed?background=ffffff\u0026text=1a1a1a\u0026link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"troyfawkes","CreatedById":109437,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-18T15:13:00Z","Content":"Awesome work KA!"},{"CreatedByName":"The White Guardian","CreatedById":148627,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-18T16:28:16Z","Content":"[@KillAshley](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/128696-killashley/) Looks amazing so far!
