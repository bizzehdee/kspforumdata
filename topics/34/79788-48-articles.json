You got lucky and found the right point on your first try. This is intended behavior. Initially the rover contract only gave you credit for waypoints you explored up until you found the correct point. This resulted in people feeling kind of cheated if they got lucky and found the first point quickly but the mission was on another planet like Eve. They\u0027d fly all the way out there, and only get credit for one point. As a result, people requested credit for all of the points once they found the right one, and I implemented it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, this is also not ideal, as it results in player confusion.

I found getting science to be extremely easy even before contracts. So for the new campaign I have it set to 50% income on Funds/Science/Reputation and 500% Penalty for Failure to ensure I actually only take contracts I\u0027m going to complete. I also have it set so I need to buy each part from R\u0026amp;D before I can use it. The science income one also effects your science parts and not just contracts so R\u0026amp;D is a lot slower. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI play with about 30 mods so I have a lot of extra parts to purchase in the tech tree and have not had enough money to buy all of the ones I\u0027ve unlocked for a while now. Also still not unlocked the full tree yet, normally by this time I\u0027d have the thing completely unlocked. I\u0027m sure I could use the strategy center to convert funds to science and unlock the tree but I quickly dismissed that idea since I need the Funds to actually unlock the items once the node is unlocked. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut overall there are a lot of easy contracts with high payouts. I think part of the reason is it\u0027s also suppose to be balanced for people who don\u0027t revert flights so they could loss tens of thousands in funds if not more from a few mishaps. But if you do allow reverts than odds are every mission is going to be successful and thus earn you a decent profit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-26T15:28:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Spyre2000\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Spyre2000\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI recommend playing at a higher difficultly.
