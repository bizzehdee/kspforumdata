Waterfall already does exactly what this mod does so technically this mod is useless if you use Waterfall. But I had to disable the lighting effects produced by Waterfall because with the mod list I have, it causes an insane stutter for a few seconds after launch. So I was hoping to use this mod to replace those lighting effects, but for some reason I can\u0027t get them to work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I\u0027m not sure why you want to use this mod along with Waterfall, but if you\u0027re having the same problem I\u0027m having, I will update you if I find a solution.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe lighting in here just seems a bit more noticeable than the waterfall lighting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Errol","CreatedById":118622,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-07-18T13:44:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just noticed a possible bug with scatterer/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E/deffered lighting.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nClouds do not receive lighting from engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
