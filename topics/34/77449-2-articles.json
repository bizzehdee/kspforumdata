I\u0027ve gone over it and have found nothing changed out of the default.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow about that thrust gauge issue. I think the issue is that undocking might produce a short lived, yet extremely drastic, spike in g forces, but that will have to be tested. So does this happen with both vessels being undocked, or just the one you control immediately after the undock? Does it happen rarely, commonly, or every time? Lastly, how many command parts do you have on the docked vessel combined, and how many on the undocked vessel afterwards?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELast thing. You say the bash saved your ship.

Comparing that with other engines, I\u0060ve still never seen a 909 failure (other than the odd one after I had already dropped the engine) and using multiple 24-77s on one ship, and over dozens of restarts have seen only one or two failures of single engines. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will test some 45s into the ground and get some answers \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thrust gauge, each occasion was similar in ciscumstance, and 75% of undocks have seen the failure. On all occasions there was one command pod on each vessel, thus two combined separating into one each. The failure occurs in the pod of the ship I have undocked from. That is to say, I\u0060ve undocked, and receive the failure popup regarding the pod on the other vessel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach time I have been undocking with a mk1-2 3 man pod, however the failing pods have been both mk1-2 and mk1 lander cans. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking at the ship in the VAB, I can also see that there is an advanced inline stabilizer between the pod and docking port. Perhaps that has been playing a part. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEDIT, after extensive testing at the launchpad, under hacked gravity conditions I must revise the estimate of failure rate to 40%, noting that in a sample of about 100 tests there was one occasion of 22 consecutive successful undocks. Testing also essentially confirmed the role of the advanced inline stabilizer in the failure, the ship design altered to remove that part could not replicate the failure in testing. The failure rate therefore doesn\u0060t seem to be too much of an issue, however the condition persist that the failure is not repairable\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to the bashing decoupler episode, on this occasion the decoupler had not been activated, but was part of a vessel that had no command parts at the time, and rather than exploding, the bash triggered a standard separation. However, I have since tested a bit on the launchpad, and following both successful decouplings, and part failures, the bash decoupler option is still available, and spamming it causes an explosion.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-05T09:43:38Z\u0022 title=\u002208/05/2014 09:43  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 5, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by soranno\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eupdated information\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"IRnifty","CreatedById":85825,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-05T14:37:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow, soranno.

Originally, both I and Ippo (the developer of DanIt! Random Failures) had this issue, but we decided it would be more realistic to let it leak from all, and would provide more than enough incentive to just go out and fix it, instead of blocking it off and not sparing the parts (or duct tape).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"soranno","CreatedById":58351,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-08T00:46:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI assume that\u0060s an issue limited to monoprop, and not other rocket fuel? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny ideas what caused the tank failure while in time warp?

(\u0027-\u0027)/\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe\u0027s right. MonoProp leaks will attempt to drain until completely gone, because the flow mode allows it to flow anywhere on the ship without connection. Liquid fuel and oxidizer will only flow between connected tanks, so leaks usually stay localized. There is no way to fix this, but it\u0027s not quite that big a problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: It seems Ippo has found a clever solution that I think is worth implementing, so I\u0027ll reveal what it is on the next patch notes, which won\u0027t be long.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell why would you want to cheat the system by disallowing failures during time warp? It\u0027s bad enough you can skip them by time warping while the craft isn\u0027t loaded. Yes, parts can fail during time warp, just as if the checks were happening real time. Every in-game 10 seconds, the system checks, which can be affected by time warp. I\u0027ve recently noticed, though, that some failures will happen early in the lifetime of a part, given the average is a year, and the failures usually happen after a few days...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-08T03:36:47Z\u0022 title=\u002208/08/2014 03:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 8, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by IRnifty\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"soranno","CreatedById":58351,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-08T14:41:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI wasn\u0060t aware it could even happen in time warp when on rails, but I certainly don\u0060t support disallowing the failures under any conditions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy space agency engineers have indeed come to the conclusion that automated vessels should not be interacted with unless absolutely necessary for fear of failures... also my engineers suffer nightmares of the day you figure out how to kill a part on an unfocussed ship. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt had not escaped me that the majority of failures occur very early in part life, most of the failures I have experienced within the first 10 minutes of flight.
