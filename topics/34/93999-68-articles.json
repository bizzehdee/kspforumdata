By contrast, a highly-inclined, and retrograde-orbiting (if such a thing is even possible) Triton analog would be a real challenge to get to, particularly given how far Neidon is to begin with. A tenuous atmosphere would also be fun (providing an extra lure for science, but not being much use for aerobraking or parachutes).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would also be neat if the Triton analog had perturbed other moons into unusual orbits (a la Nereid and its high eccentricity).

Hopefully they\u0027re all showing up on the spreadsheet succesfully?\u003Cp\u003EOn another note entirely, I\u0027m sure you guys have big plans for Neidon, but having spent some time reading about Triton lately, let me express my hope for a Triton analog. I\u0027ve also been writing up my Jool-5 submission lately, and one thing I found made Joolian missions pretty easy was the ability to aerobrake into orbit around Laythe and operate from there. By contrast, a highly-inclined, and retrograde-orbiting (if such a thing is even possible) Triton analog would be a real challenge to get to, particularly given how far Neidon is to begin with. A tenuous atmosphere would also be fun (providing an extra lure for science, but not being much use for aerobraking or parachutes).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would also be neat if the Triton analog had perturbed other moons into unusual orbits (a la Nereid and its high eccentricity). Another thought is some small, extremely distant moons at the edge of Neidon\u0027s Hill sphere, a la Neso and Psamathe, which would be their own challenge to reach thanks to their small size and distance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks. Also don\u0027t worry about a Triton analog, that\u0027s one of the moons we have planned.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptRobau","CreatedById":41695,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-20T16:46:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA shout out to a new OPM video by JoshandCrissGames:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/qsxzzBr5Sko?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn an unrelated note, thanks everyone for all the amazing work on the science blurbs.
