With that I can place parts overlapping the recycler and they get sucked up into it. I don\u0027t think I plan to use the recycler for complex part production but if I did I\u0027d just stick it right on the launch pad so as soon as the part gets released it gets sucked up. So far it\u0027s been more of a trash where I can shed extra part count on my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E station.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSpeaking of which, I have some unsolicited suggestions, which you should feel very free to ignore if they don\u0027t align with your vision or priority list.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve been very slowly making progression on my career save, and I now have 20 Kerbals and two hydroponic modules on my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E station. The EL workshop is hard at work assembling a third hydroponic unit at which point I\u0027ll move pretty much the rest of my space program up there as well. I think this will reduce the remaining time for progression to tier 1 to less than 300 days. I don\u0027t think I will be able to expand much more then that given both game performance/crashing/kraken and also the fact that rescue contracts seam to have dried up due to me doing them incessantly. Any kind of bonus for getting to level 1 that involves quality over quantity would probably be good for the meta.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI managed to get a probe on it\u0027s way to Gilly on year 1 day 18 so that will be the first interplanetary spot where my greenhouses can function (assuming you can actually land there). It\u0027s going to be a really long time before I can really do much outside of Kerbin \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E. I wish there was a config to turn off the requirement to return a probe after landing. A compromise might be the option to transmit data back instead of actually physically returning. Take Duna as an example. Using the Launch window planner, first launch window is around Year 1 day 238. The next return windows is around Year 3 day 241. After that you could actually launch greenhouses around year 5 day 368 and have then arrive year 6 day 246. In short if you are waiting for a probe to return from Duna, you\u0027re going to be waiting until the third launch window. If you could transmit data back then you would wait a single launch window and you could launch around year 3 day 311. Sooner is probably possible with absurd burns. Sooner is likely more practical by investing in orbital greenhouses (i mean hydroponics) and lots of snacks. As in you _could_ launch Year 1 day 238 and bring enough snacks. I think once you reach tier 1 you can live entirely on a combination diet of 40% tier 1 hydroponic snacks and 60% tier 1 snacks. I know that you want players to understand how many snacks they need well before launching so my argument probably just further proves your point for why this requirement exists in the first place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-04-25T06:19:07Z\u0022 title=\u002204/25/2020 06:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EApril 25, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by pand1024\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rmaine","CreatedById":143945,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-25T03:14:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust a few comments to pand1024.

My biggest prob;em on Gilly has always been staying landed. :-) Physics phase-in tends to make many vehicles bounce wildly off the surface - sometimes fatally - on scene load. A trick I\u0027ve used is to avoid putting landing gear on anything landing on Gilly. The springiness of the gear tends to make the problem of bouncing on scene load really bad. If you need something to help stabilize things, I just stick some structural beams out horizontally from the bottom of my landing craft; works much better than gear on Gilly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-04-25T03:19:28Z\u0022 title=\u002204/25/2020 03:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EApril 25, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by rmaine\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Etypo\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NermNermNerm","CreatedById":174264,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-28T05:53:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223775695\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022181852\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221587784472\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022143945\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022rmaine\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 4/24/2020 at 8:14 PM, rmaine said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust a few comments to pand1024.

This is needed to address some conflicts between this mod and others. The root of the problem is that the KSP API\u0027s for controlling toolbar buttons and some related resources are written with the assumption that all mods know about all other mods... Not a good thing. The way the community has dealt with this is to have a library that basically manages the cooperation.

Thought it time for me to give a little feedback on various things I\u0027ve noticed mostly from prior careers. I really haven\u0027t found any other mods that I feel I can reasonably make self-sufficient bases with; that\u0027s the biggest attraction of PKS to me. I\u0027ve fiddled with a few others, most recently MKS, but I wasn\u0027t finding it very engaging to me (plus it\u0027s clearly in the middle of major changes).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. The one thing that drove me to give up on my prior career with PKS wasn\u0027t directly the fault of PKS, but regardless of fault, it ruined the game for me. That was the problem of bases not staying stable on scene load. Sometimes they would slide around and bump into nearby things (even on perfectly flat lakebeds on Minmus). Worse, they would sometimes fly up into the air and then crash down; Gilly was particularly bad about that. I\u0027d have a self-sufficient base set up, but come back in a few years just to check on it and see it annoyingly self-destruct (or if not the whole base, the automated stuff rover would go). I *THINK* the ground tether of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E tools (plus a tweak I read about elsewhere to apply that tether to all command modules) might have fixed that for me. The ground \u0022stiction\u0022 of KSP 1.11 might also be helping, though it clearly was not enough by itself. Haven\u0027t yet gotten to Gilly on this career to test it there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. It\u0027s discussed in other posts above, but I think the tutorial walkthrough leads people down a miserable path in suggesting launching a fully-built base from Kerbin instead of pointing people to EL (or Simple Construction, which I use) to expand from a minimal starting hub.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. I long ago gave up on the transfer stuff in PKS. Simple Logistics substitutes fine. I admit I haven\u0027t tried the transfer since your latest tweak to it, as I was already used to Simple Logistics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. Probably just a personal preference of mine, but I find driving rovers around incredibly painful and most definitely not fun. As rovers are all but mandatory for PKS, that pretty much killed it for me until I tried the rover autopilot of McJeb. That\u0027s still a pain, but the pain level is at least low enough for me to tolerate. I recently discovered the Bon Voyage mod; haven\u0027t actually tried it yet, but I intend to do so with this career. Relating to rover pain, I\u0027d sure like to have a way to search for another source of stuff if the first one found is in a bad enough location. As is, you can search for another source, but only after depleting the first one, which doesn\u0027t address the problem of the first one being too difficult to access. I\u0027ve taken to save scumming to avoid horrible stuff locations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. The requirement to do a round trip to a body before I can even start a base is awfully stringent. I could see requiring a one-way trip first, but to return? Considering that I\u0027m mostly not planning on having the Kerbals that \u0022man\u0022 (um Kerbal) the base ever return, that requirement doesn\u0027t seem to match. In my past careers, I never managed to get a base on Eve because of that requirement. Hmm. Maybe I could swing that with sufficient support craft rendezvousing in low Eve orbit. Might try that this career.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6. Oh. One thing that turns out to be a lot simpler than you probably intended. I happened onto it pretty much by accident. Since starving Kerbals has no long-term consequences, it is trivial to send them on long interplanetary journeys with even minimal snacks. Just turn off the usage of the snacks from every component where you have them stored on the vehicle. Ignore the resulting whining until you get to the destination. Then turn snack availability back on and everyone is soon happy, perhaps after a brief time or scene switch. Don\u0027t know whether you want to go so far as to kill Kerbals off when they starve, but reviving them probably ought to be harder than just giving them a snack.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NermNermNerm","CreatedById":174264,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-24T02:25:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223912817\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022181852\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221611269975\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022143945\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022rmaine\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 1/21/2021 at 2:59 PM, rmaine said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.

And Bon Voyage takes the rover stuff down to the level of just painful (which is a big improvement). My current reason for posting is an issue of transferring resources. The new stuff in PKS is mostly ok on that, but I\u0027m having one big pain, which I think is going to drive me back to reinstalling SImpleLogistics, which I\u0027ve been doing without so far this playthrough. Sometimes fuel and lox just fail to transfer. This makes setting up a base for refueling.... awkward.

It is landed next to my \u0022gilly base 2\u0022, which is set up to mine and make fuel and has oodles of it stored. I bring up the PKS GUI transfer window and tell tanker to \u0022take\u0022 fuel and lox from the base. Clicking \u0022start\u0022 results in the progress meter immediately jumping to finished, without any transfer having happened. Doing a reset and trying again has the same result. I was able to transfer a token amount of residual fuel from the \u0022gilly supply\u0022 craft, but not nearly enough for the mission. Just can\u0027t get any of it out of the base.
