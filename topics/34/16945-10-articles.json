I had to change the Cfg structure edit the modual system from 17 to18 and add the part scale. All of this was done in txt edit on cfg files in pack and was very time consuming as I had to trouble shoot the node placement. Also don\u0027t worry if you can\u0027t get the SU style wings system to work as it was bug from the start. I no long have the files so don\u0027t ask for them as its not my mod any way just saying its not imposable to update with out any codeing or modeling just some good ol trial and error. In my personal opinion this mod would not be well served as an update it would need a complete over haul to utilize kerbals updated features better also the combination of certain parts as one solid piece would offer a more contestant build and perform better in kerbal (I.E. Su wing setup) this just my opinions and you know what they say about opinions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso thank you vvaris for all the hard work and innovation you put into your pack.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-03T06:08:42Z\u0022 title=\u002206/03/2013 06:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 3, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by cappedu\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-30T18:26:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am working on a F-104 and somehow discovered this mod.
