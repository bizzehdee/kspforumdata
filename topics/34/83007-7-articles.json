If you want any significant amount of Oxigen to bring along on space travel, it needs to be liquified oxygen, in it gas form, it\u0027s the economical most effective method of storage!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOxidizer is a chemical which must be manufactured and can be stored without cooling and therefore much easier to store. This is very important for Balance reasons, otherwise it would become highly unbalanced. This is basically my only demand, everything else is of lesser significance.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-25T18:55:22Z\u0022 title=\u002202/25/2015 06:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FreeThinker\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nertea","CreatedById":83952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T18:44:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E*frowns* I\u0027m not exactly sure what you mean. LOX by definition is liquid oxygen, not a generic oxidizer. It does need cryogenic storage, though not as badly as LH2 does.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModeling boiloff is beyond the CRP scope though.
