I have an Apollo-like project I\u0027m working on. There\u0027s an\u00A0upper section with a nuke engine. Attached to the bottom of the engine is the upper node of the interstage. On top of the fairing\u00A0base, I have a small structural piece and a separator, and then the bottom engine of my lander.\u00A0I have the extra height cranked up pretty high, due to the geometry of the upper-stage fuel tank.\u00A0I\u0027ve done very similar designs in the past with no issues. On my 1.0.5 game, when I jettison the four fairing pieces, the upper and lower sections separate physically, but not logically. The throttle controls engines in both parts. I can\u0027t select the lower section in the map or by hitting ]. The upper and lower sections can\u0027t collide. They pass right through each other. When I attempt to turn the craft, both upper and lower parts turn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt gets odder. I sent an intrepid Kerbonaut on an EVA to try to get into the lander, and the lower part kept a constant distance from him. No matter how fast he accelerated toward the lower section, it moved with him as if it were attached. Things got jumpy when doing time warping or switching back to the upper stage, as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/yupuo/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI rebuilt part of it and the problem went away. I threw away the fairing base, the structural piece, the center lander engine, and the separator, and reassembled it, as far as I can tell, identically to the way it had been, but I don\u0027t get that odd behavior anymore. Now nothing stands between me and all the science of Ike and Gilly but a few hours of tweaking. I\u0027m thinking smaller radiators, larger liquid fuel tank, and maybe reduce the fuel in the lander a bit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExcept that on a trial run, when I jettisoned the interstage in Munar orbit, everything below it disappeared. The interstage ring, the lander above it, and the tank and booster below. Not on the map anywhere that I can see. Haystack doesn\u0027t show it, either. I did see a row of... marks on the hull. Round marks of some kind.\u00A0I mean, it couldn\u0027t be. But Bob swears they look like the scars giant squid leave on sperm whales. Some kind of materials defect, maybe? It makes no sense, but I can\u0027t shake this feeling that something is out there. Something malevolent, something\u00A0powerful.\u00A0Something lurking beneath, or perhaps built into the fabric of space itself. It knows we\u0027ve entered its domain. There\u0027s nothing more we can do here without the lander. I\u0027m taking us back home. If for any reason we don\u0027t make it, let our last words be this. Launch, and launch again.\u00A0Kerbalkind must--and will!--take its rightful place as a spacefaring race.
