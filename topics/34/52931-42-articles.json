I\u0027m not sure what you mean by this. Different planets have different gravities and different atmospheres. There\u0027s is no way I can set an \u0022omni feature\u0022 that will give you the same falling speed on every planet, that\u0027s just not how it works. You have to set the planet you want to use that chute on and it will set the fields in prevision for that. My testing is showing me it works. If you set Duna as a target but don\u0027t hit apply, the settings won\u0027t change, so you\u0027ll keep the same falling speed, it\u0027s expected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for settings defaults, I\u0027ve talked about this above. I can include a button to reset the fields to what they were the last time apply was hit, but that\u0027s about it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll link this post in the OP too as I think it\u0027s important people read this as I\u0027ve explained this numerous times.
