KeRD runs as a browser app, and is designed to run on a second monitor\n\n(and soon available for tablets).\n\nKeRD features a **live 3D orbital map with markers**, **biome maps**, **a high contrast navball**\n\nand lots of data about your current flight.\n\nIt runs fine in any recent release of Chrome or Firefox, and has tablet support\n\n(you may have to edit the default layout to make it fit your tablet or monitor).\n\n**Screenshots**\n\nYou can check it out right now at [http://kerd.space/](http://kerd.space/) even if you don\u0027t have\n\nTelemachus installed. Here\u0027s an album with some recent screenshots:\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/X0SnK)\n\n**Installation**\n\n1. [Install Telemachus](https://github.com/richardbunt/Telemachus/wiki/Installation)\n2. Launch a craft (optionally attach a Telemachus antenna).\n3. Visit [http://kerd.space/](http://kerd.space/) in a WebGL enabled browser.\n\n**Tablet usage instructions**\n\n1. Visit kerd.space (with Safari on the iPad, Chrome on android).\n2. Optionally add a shortcut to the dashboard, on the iPad this will remove the browser borders when you open it.\n3. Tap the bottom of the screen, you should see a narrow bar appear.\n4. Tap again, this will open the menu.\n5. Click the cog/settings icon to open the settings menu, in the settings menu change the IP to the machine that you\u0027re playing KSP on, then save your settings.\n6. Optionally repeat step 3-4 and click the edit icon to enable the layout editing mode - this will allow you to remove parts of the UI so the interface will fit the screen.\n\n**Source code**\n\nThe source code is available at [https://github.com/Lokaltog/KeRD](https://github.com/Lokaltog/KeRD) under the MIT license.\n\n**Contributing**\n\nI\u0027d love to hear what you guys think, if you have any cool ideas please feel free to post them in this thread!\n\nIf you encounter any issues, please report them on GitHub or in this topic and I\u0027ll take a look at it right away. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-08T06:49:27Z\u0022 title=\u002207/08/2015 06:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Lokaltog**"},{"CreatedByName":"HoloYolo","CreatedById":138353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-03T19:16:31Z","Content":"Very interesting.

While you show the basics, there are quite literally hundreds of modded resources.\n\nThanks for the comments!\n\n1. I\u0027ve done some tweaks to improve the design flexibility (automatically shrinking some modules to fit smaller screens, using the viewport width and height to scale the elements), the thing is that I haven\u0027t really decided how I want the modular design to work yet. I\u0027m kind of leaning towards modularizing the design completely, splitting it into data providers and visualizers like gauges and displays, and allowing the user to customize it to their preferences - maybe with the ability to share layouts as e.g. JSON documents. I haven\u0027t done this yet as it requires a bit of work, I\u0027ve kind of just whipped this thing up over a couple of days, but it\u0027s definitely on the long term todo list to improve this.\n\n2. I\u0027d like to include the ability to display any resource, but the API docs for Telemachus only referenced the vanilla resources so that\u0027s what I started with. If it\u0027s possible to display any resource like Rich mentioned above this will be implemented for sure!"},{"CreatedByName":"Raptor831","CreatedById":68286,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-04T17:38:07Z","Content":"First off, well done. Looks great!\n\nSecond, I\u0027d really vote for a modular setup the user can customize. JSON would probably be perfect.\n\nAlso, what setup are you using to build this? I\u0027m a front-end web developer by day, and I\u0027m really curious to know. I checked the repo but I\u0027m not familiar with Jade so I\u0027m a bit lost."},{"CreatedByName":"Lokaltog","CreatedById":147414,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-04T17:55:54Z","Content":"Thanks! I\u0027ve looked at some options and other plugins for telemachus, and I\u0027m going to start implementing a flexbox based modular layout soon. I\u0027m thinking that it will work by allowing users to split sections of the interface horizontally or vertically (kind of how the current layout is defined), and resizing them (translating the proportions to the CSS flex-grow or flex-basis property). This should be simple to store in a JSON structure, and it\u0027s a modern and flexible way of defining a grid based layout. I think I\u0027ll also end up splitting the components into displays, gauges, etc. and allow the user to link them to specific data providers, while also allowing \u0022static\u0022 plugins like the map display, which wouldn\u0027t work well with a dynamic data source. This is just initial thoughts, let me know if you guys have any suggestions!\n\nThe setup is something I\u0027ve used for a lot of projects lately, it\u0027s basically a single-page app built on Vue.js (a simpler, faster alternative to frameworks like Angular), it works well with an API backend, as well as for a static page like this where the websocket connection is the data provider. It\u0027s compiling Jade templates and SASS stylesheets into a component based system using Webpack. It\u0027s a lot to explain, but look up webpack, it\u0027s handling the assembly of the components into a single-page app.\n\nThe app itself basically works by telling Vue that variables from the websocket have changed, and Vue automatically updates the corresponding DOM elements with the updated data. Some plugins have watchers on specific variables and update their presentation whenever these variables are changed. I\u0027ll write docs on the project wiki later once the base app is done, it\u0027s kind of pointless documenting it when it\u0027s changing so rapidly. If you have any questions on the project layout let me know and I\u0027d be happy to help you out!"},{"CreatedByName":"Raptor831","CreatedById":68286,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-04T18:58:06Z","Content":"Cool, thanks.
