For example, it is AFAIK impossible to have different drag values between open and closed balloons. Increasing the drag would mean that whenever you tried to launch an airship on a rocket (to another planet, ofc) the rocket would start tumbling almost immediately, as if you deploy a parachute during launch.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EYour point about launching standard envelopes makes sense to me, but it should be entirely possible to have varying drag on a part depending on whether it\u0027s open.
