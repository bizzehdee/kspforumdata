Then I put my target on the navball between my facing and my prograde marker by moving my prograde marker to the spot where I want it by using IJKL while having ASAS on to keep me lined up. This makes me drift so the target is right in front of me and we\u0027re both lined up from before. Then I use RCS again to stop when my facing and the target are lined up so my facing, my prograde marker and my target marker are all lined up and use H to fly to the target, wait till I get close (20m) make finer adjustments, repeat what I did before and dock at about 0.2-0.4m/s using N to slow down with ASAS off to let the ship wiggle to connect easier\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to not do the 20m adjustment, then either have the thing you\u0027re docking to be small enough that you can point one of the ports in a north/south direction so it rotates on it\u0027s axis while orbiting instead of rotating randomly, or if it\u0027s a big station that takes forever to turn and looks like it\u0027s going to rip itself apart when you do turn it, then have it at about 300km or higher to make it rotate slowly\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry, I don\u0027t have an in-game tutorial, but hopefully it still helps\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, using chase camera for this is a huge help because it makes it easier to know which way is up even if it\u0027s stiffness is a bit nauseating.
