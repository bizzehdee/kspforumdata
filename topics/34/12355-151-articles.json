I found that the rate of change of the orbit was relatively little with accelerations less than about 0.2 percent of the orbital velocity. Unfortunately that makes rotating the orbital inclination by 90 degree take approximately 800 seconds.

At the burn time, the orbit has two orientations. If one assumes that the average of the two normals is the appropriate normal, then the angle that the delta-V makes with the two velocities is equal. By definition, this situation is the definition of an isosceles triangle, which makes the two velocities equal. For the example that I gave earlier (magnitude of the velocity is 10 m/sec and the delta-V is 2 m/sec), the law of cosines gives the rotation as 11.48 degrees. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eskips\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"softweir","CreatedById":2795,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-10T20:09:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Galane\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Galane\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBuild 102, force roll in Smart A.S.S. and Docking Autopilot are 90 degrees off from each other.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EForce Roll has two modes: when a docking port is set as target, and otherwise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen a docking port is targeted (such as when Mechjeb is in Docking mode, but also when manually docking and using \u0022Parallel -\u0022 or \u0022Parallel \u002B\u0022) then the roll is relative to the target docking port.
