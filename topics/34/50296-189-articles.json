The version I used is different from yours. AFAIK I have the latest official so I\u0027m guessing you have a dev version. (0.15.5 vs 0.15.3)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I\u0027m just not seeing that as a factor. I don\u0027t think FAR is really doing anything with that affects heat except that how it calculates area is/has been different.

I removed it and reinstalled the older FAR 0.15.4.1 I had been using, then reloaded that save. This time skin temp rose steadily to about 1690 which didn\u0027t happen until I was closer to 52km. Then skin temp started to drop and didn\u0027t spike again. Not sure what is going on there but I\u0027ll post over on the FAR thread.

If RO customers would prefer more challenging shields then in the future I\u0027ll figure something out. Probably an in-game slider that scales ablation on the fly. That way, the various configs that control behavior wouldn\u0027t have to be changed anywhere.

But with some assistance from Starwaster, it looks like the problem is actually with FAR. Here\u0027s what I\u0027m experiencing. I\u0027m playing with RO/RSS/RP0, all their respective required mods and most of their suggested mod (plus FASA). I recently upgraded from FAR 0.15.4.1 to 0.15.5. Prior to the upgrade, I had successfully launch and recovered 6 Mercury Atlas rockets. After upgrading to 0.15.5, however, I launched a 7th and have been experiencing issues during recovery. Reentry seems to be going initially fine. Skin temp will slowly increase from space to around 1600 at 62km (speed: 7km/s, vert speed: -238m/s, 2.1375g). At this point, skin temp starts to slowly drop until its down to under 1350 at just over 50.5km (speed: 5.6km/s, vert speed: -305m/s, 5.1374g). But as soon as I hit 50.5km, skin temp immediately jumps back up to over 1950 and begins climbing. Without the \u0022Ignore Max Temperature\u0022 cheat turned on, the Mercury capsule explodes moments after falling below 50.5km do to overheating. With the cheat turned on, skin temp continues to climb until it peaks at about 2550 at 45.6km. Obviously, the issue is this phantom \u002B600 in skin temp that seems to be added as soon as I hit 50.5km. \u003Cp\u003EIf I remove FAR and reinstall the older 0.15.4.1 version (and Starwaster was using 0.15.3 which worked for him), then reload the exact same save that resulted in the failed reentry above, the reentry works just fine. The Mercury pods skin temp slowly increases to just shy of 1700 but that doesn\u0027t happen until I\u0027m already below 15.5km. And when skin temp starts to fall, it never has any sudden increase and makes it all the way down to the ground. I don\u0027t know enough about modding to have the first clue as to what changed between 0.15.4.1 and 0.15.5 that might be causing this strange heating issue, but I wanted to report it so it can be investigated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022chrisl\u0022 data-cite=\u0022chrisl\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EJust wanted to report that 0.15.5.1 seems to resolve the issue I reported.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote I\u0027m not using RO or any of those things, and I am on the latest version of FAR (0.15.5.1).

DRE edits a few things like max temps, skin-internal conductivity, some minor changes to the stock heat shield (by way of extending the ModuleAblator class) but aside from that, all thermodynamic functionality is the stock code. So if there is some issue between FAR and thermodynamics, it\u0027s still stock. There\u0027s not a lot (that I can see) that I could do to resolve a FAR-DRE compatibility issue, because it\u0027s mostly stock\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. NathanKell has mentioned (and this isn\u0027t really news, but it seems to be frequently forgotten) is that capsules are too massive for their size. Or rather, are 64% smaller than they would be IRL while retaining the same mass, which means drag has less impact on them. Is maybe reducing stock capsule masses something that I should look into?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-19T03:47:49Z\u0022 title=\u002209/19/2015 03:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Starwaster\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Herrkurt","CreatedById":116605,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-19T05:00:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom your first point about the stock code I\u0027m suspecting it may be a problem with the parts from RO.
