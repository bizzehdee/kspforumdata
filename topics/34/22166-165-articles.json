It has major problems with RemoteTech because the Kethane drills continue to work when the battery is completely drained and even when all your tanks are full. If you are consuming more power than you are generating (easy to do with Kethane drills) you will lose your probe if you ever reach 0 power. Most power draining items stop working when they lose power so you have these tiny intermittent moments of control where you can shut things down. There\u0027s also the expectation that when your tanks fill up the drill will stop so eventually you will start charging the batteries again.

This is more efficient than processing it in orbit, since 1 ton of Kethan produces slightly less than 1 ton of fuel. The small converter is less efficient than a large one, but that doesn\u0027t matter since you\u0027re sitting on the deposit; you just extract more until you are full. Since the main power comes from the Kethoelectric Generator, you don\u0027t even have to worry about nightfall. Once its full up, it launches to orbit and rendezvous with the tanker.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe tanker fills up from the lander. The extra quarter-tank on the lander is more than enough for the launch and landing, so there\u0027s enough to fill the tanker completely even if its dry. Similarly, there\u0027s usually enough monopropellant, since the tanker isn\u0027t usually totally dry; if it\u0027s short, the last bit can be converted from the small amount of Kethane the lander carries. (By necessity; it\u0027s not possible to feed Kethane directly from a drill to a converter - you cannot extract Kethane if you don\u0027t have somewhere to store it.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe tanker transfers to LKO and unloads onto the station, then returns for another load. You get ~95% of a full BOT. (You only need ~100m/s of delta-v to get from Minmus to LKO, since you can use aerobraking to do most of the work. And since the tanker\u0027s mass is quite low when it\u0027s empty, the 1000 m/s of delta-v to get back doesn\u0027t require all that much \u003Cem\u003Efuel\u003C/em\u003E.) Ships can then stop there to pick up fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis system is efficient and simple: only two rendezvous-and-docking maneuvers, and no need for precision landings. Flexability is limited; if I ever found myself needing huge amounts of monopropellant, xenon, or kethane in LKO I\u0027d be in trouble. But that\u0027s never happened: 4 cylinders of monoprop to 1 BOT of fuel is a good ratio, and I almost never \u003Cem\u003Eneed\u003C/em\u003E to refuel Xenon tanks.
