In this tree, you will need to explore Kerbins biomes via rovers and experimental planes before beeing able to unlock the first rockets. You will face meaningful decisions about your next advances, since you cannot simple unlock it all at once. Do you really need those ladders or lights? Or maybe save those valuable science points for more pressing limitations? Go for better rockets first? Or maybe invest in lighter probe cores and transmission technology? Or more science experiments? Or save it all up for energy sources? Your choice! One thing is for certain: You will need to build vessels you have never built before in KSP, this tree will challenge your creativity, engineering expertise and strategic planning. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETech Tree overview\u003C/strong\u003E with node costs and node content highlights (click for full resolution)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lWMFGv7.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8husU2j.png\u0022 alt=\u00228husU2j.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFeatures:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- mismatching parts whereever you look.

I used jet engines to get science from Kerbins biomes, with a flight to the north pole to unlock SRBs. With that, the door is open for drone missions to space/LKO first, and with a little optimization unmanned Mun/Minmus (at 400-500 science each) \u002B manned missions into LKO, wich eventually leads to manned missions to Mun\u002BMinmus in chairs. Gave me choices between better rockets vs transmission vs construction things vs new science experiment. Went with transmission, and did a Duna impactor mission with loads of batteries. With better rockets, i might have done a return mission instead. Or i could have continued to do Mun missions to unlock solar panels.

I\u0027ve got a plane built now and the SRBs unlocked but getting to that really felt very grindy due to having to drive 30km or so back and forth in jet cars to recover all the science possible. The thought of having to do the same for thousands more science just isn\u0027t particularly pleasant or uplifting.

Sorry for that then, and thanks a lot for this feedback. But in my initial playthrough, i didnt need a 30km rover drive, since once you get jets you can flying things to reach the deserts and the mountain biomes fast (kinda tough to land without chutes, but great\u0026amp;fast explorers). At my current stage in the tree, i did three Mun missions (unmanned, unmanned with hop, 4 kerbals with hop) and two Minmus missions, all with minor node unlocks \u002B improvements to launch vehicle and lander craft inbetween, and it feels really rewarding to me. Obviously, finding the perfect spot between \u0022too easy\u0022 and \u0022too grindy\u0022 is very hard in a sandbox game where some people can pull of tier 0 interplanetary stock career missions on the one hand, and others are having difficulties reaching orbit with such things. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was hoping that others might enjoy these challenges aswell, thats why i published this tree.

I need to start saving my game state, buy things to note what\u0027s behind it and restore. Otherwise I can\u0027t really make informed decisions about what to get next. Planes are the best example, it took me a while to find them whereas you know where they are and went straight to them right? So I probably had to grind out another 50 to 100 science on top just to find plane tech which is why it feels such a chore. At one point I was 2 point short and the science logger showed there was 1.4 left available, I installed the achievement mod as it gives you 5 science for each achievement. That got me to the next node, it was that or delete and walk away because I was not repeating the 6 or 7 hours to that point \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah I know about feedback.

If you have some science available, think about which tech node will allow you to reach further and/or generate more science. Maybe you can also use a combination of jet engines \u002B Sepratrons/Ant engines to put a probe into the upper atmosphere, space or even orbit for more science. I got the SRB fairly late (after a visit to tundra\u002Bnorth pole), but getting it earlier by skipping some of the 50-science nodes might be a good alternative. Once you get them, the door to space is wide open (even without decouplers - you can use several sepratrons pointing at a single piece as a makeshift stage decoupler).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is an album of some creations from my test-run (first one is obviously not very useful, its just included as a spoiler-blocker).
