Your mod is really great... But this drifting of parts, rotating after testing the system, make for me the design quite complicated. So for me it\u0027s a breaking mod issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll just wait you find a way to solve this issue, and I\u0027m sure you will, and then I\u0027ll continue to use it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, as I said, it still a great and unique mod.

After a search in this thread for problems with the Closed Powered Hinge, I seem to be the only one who messed up this way! I\u0027ve included screenshots to show what happened in flight and a stripped-down .craft file (I think I got all the non-stock parts out).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s my situation: I have a space station with an experiment module that is finished and needs to come back home. I use docking ports on the experiment to send it up and bring it back (launched with a basic rocket, retrieved with a spaceplane). My retrieval design uses a cargo bay on a spaceplane, with your Closed Powered Hinge to bring out the docking port for attaching the experiment. The hinge is then supposed to close again, safely tucking the experiment into the cargo bay (because I like to use DeadlyReentry for the realism).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem: After designing my spaceplane (see .craft file below), I tested the hinge movement, set movement limits, and assigned action groups for easy operation. All systems were go, so I launched. When I got to the space station, grabbed the experiment, decoupled, and tried to retract the hinge...nothing moved! I hear the motor sound when I activate my action groups, but the hinge never retracted. Then I took a close look at my cargo bay and noticed the state of the hinge. Here are screenshots (a couple of views, and each view with and without the part menu in case there\u0027s any useful info there):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/eg6z5tafbxswfs9/screenshot5.png?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/eg6z5tafbxswfs9/screenshot5.png?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/4iflqooyi7otz0n/screenshot6.png?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/4iflqooyi7otz0n/screenshot6.png?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/d499cxijo6hyfjk/screenshot7.png?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/d499cxijo6hyfjk/screenshot7.png?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/euq15cl7loq1ml6/screenshot8.png?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/euq15cl7loq1ml6/screenshot8.png?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor anyone reading through posts like I did, what happened was the base of the hinge--the part that doesn\u0027t move in the VAB and is supposed to be fixed to a surface--decided to become the moving side! It\u0027s now closed again with the payload sticking out and doesn\u0027t move at all anymore. I thought maybe this was simply a graphical bug, because the \u0022Rotation\u0022 value in the part menu \u003Cem\u003Edoes\u003C/em\u003E respond to the motion controls, and tried closing my cargo bay doors:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/yii4lcsaxopidad/screenshot9.png?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/yii4lcsaxopidad/screenshot9.png?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the menu for the doors showed that only the same 3 parts were shielded as in the VAB (the hinge, docking port, and an RCS tank), as you can see from the .craft file:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/jrtxrchvj6ozhv5/SERP%20Debug.craft?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/jrtxrchvj6ozhv5/SERP%20Debug.craft?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat did I do wrong, so I can avoid it next time?
