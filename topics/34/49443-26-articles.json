It is working great except I have found one major bug. When I push ESC the game pauses but the menu does not appear (cannot revert flight or return to SC). The problem only occurs when I have the parachute blimp thing deployed (tried it with both the \u0022Ray\u0022 and \u0022Una\u0022) and once I decouple it the problem usually resolves itself. I figure this is more likely a bug with toolbar as the buttons on it do not seem to work well, but the fact that this only happens when I have an inflated blimp is odd. As well the big balloons seem to have lost their collision values and just fall right through the earth.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Major999","CreatedById":131827,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-20T00:34:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EMust have been a pain to launch though~\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you launch it along with a rover and a second, ground based mobile base, AND use a transfer stage that doesn\u0027t use nuclear rockets, you begin to go a little insane.
