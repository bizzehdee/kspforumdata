I\u0027ve made several changes that simplify things in some ways and allow for more customization.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is now only one window mode, instead of one narrow and one wide; the re-size icon can be used to expand in either dimension. The contract rewards will only be shown if you expand the window horizontally, and you can choose to only expand the window enough to show Funds rewards, rather than having to show all types.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/hUa7aYv.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022hUa7aYv.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve also added the ability to create a save mission lists. There is a master list that contains all active contracts, from there you can add contracts to different mission lists or create a new list. Each contract has an icon in its title bar that opens up the mission list. An icon along the top allows you to switch between lists. Contracts can be added to more than one list (they are never removed from the master list), and their settings (whether their parameters are shown or if they are pinned to the top of the list) are stored separately for each mission. You can remove contracts from any other mission, or you can delete the mission entirely. The sorting order and type for each mission is also saved separately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mDtp7KP.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022mDtp7KP.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are still a few kinks to work out, but everything is mostly working correctly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StarkRG","CreatedById":95420,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-11T09:09:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhere does this mod store its configuration?
