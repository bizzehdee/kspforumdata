I then filled the background with black and removed the original layer that I extracted everything out of. I then filled the regions of the other layers that were to be paintable with Red, Green, or Blue for the primary, secondary, and tertiary colors, respectively. I then set the layer modes to \u0022additive\u0022 and merged them all on top of each other, and then merged the result onto the black. This created an image that had the three colors, plus the additive colors for overlapping areas of the original texture. For example, a region of the image which would take a value from all three color layers would appear white in the final image. In the end, save as a PNG in the folder where the rest of the masks are kept, rename it to remove the file extension so KSP doesn\u0027t load it up itself (KerbPaint does this itself) and then enter it into the config like you\u0027ve already done. If this is done properly then, in theory, it should work fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing to look for, however, is that KerbPaint might already have an MM patch that is putting a mask on the part. You may need to seek that out and either replace the mask it references with your own and scrap your own patch, or comment the KerbPaint patch for that part out so it only uses your patch. A third option is to format your patch as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E@PART[mk1InlineCockpit]:AFTER[KerbPaint]\u003Cbr\u003E{\u003Cbr\u003E    %MODULE[ModulePaintable]\u003Cbr\u003E    {\u003Cbr\u003E\t%name = ModulePaintable\u003Cbr\u003E\t%Texture = mk1InlineCockpit_paint\u003Cbr\u003E\t%Shader = BumpSpec\u003Cbr\u003E\t%DeepReplace = true\u003Cbr\u003E    }\u003Cbr\u003E}\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis tells the MM patch to replace the module of that name, and all the parameters as well. If any parameters are not found, they will be added. Likewise if the module by that name is not found, it will be added.
