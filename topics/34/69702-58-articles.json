You have OpenGL on all platforms, OpenAL for sound, SDL for window creation \u0026amp; input. I/O and networking API are almost the same across these platforms (POSIX), timer and multithreading can be made through SDL (but not especially effective/accurate) and even if you implement them natively, it\u0027s not a big deal, especially since Linux and OS X both share POSIX API.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther engines also mostly work on all platforms and probably provide even better performance per CPU/GPU power. The advantage of Unity is that is has very low learning curve, it\u0027s simple to start with it, you already have a lot of building blocks you need to create a new game. It a great engine for beginners, but if you want to create a huge beast and squeeze all juice from your machine, it\u0027s a bad choice. Just look at KSP, how many limits it puts on the game. With a custom engine Squad could integrate a better physics engine, like Bullet, use all CPU cores for physics calculations, possibly use double precision to resolve all sorts of physics glitches, fix 64bit Windows port, make graphics run much faster etc. However, they\u0027d need much more manpower, cost of development would be significantly higher and initial development, before they publicly released KSP would probably take a few years longer which means ...
