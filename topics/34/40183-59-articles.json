Redid the way Non Repeatable missions are saved and deleted. Now when you launch a new vessel a check will be made (The check is only made if a Mission is loaded and its NOT REPEATABLE), if a previous vessel tried to do a Non Repeatable mission the goals will be reset and deleted. This should almost completely get rid of the whole, I can\u0027t finish this mission problem because the vessel ID does not match the new vessel and previously saved goals. The only thing I can see that might happen now is if maybe the player launches a Non Repeatable mission.. Stops it for some reason mid way through.. And launches a new vessel just because they are bored or whatever with the same mission still loaded! This will delete the goals of the mission because MCE thinks your starting the mission over. So beware of this.. I guess we will see how this turns out.. LOL. If you want to avoid this don\u0027t keep the mission loaded if you are pausing a mission for whatever reason to launch a new vessel. Again to repeat this only applies to A Non Repeatable mission. Repeatable missions can have many different vessels and goals and not have any issues with this!

If you check your .sp file this line should read like this. timeStarted = -1 (thats a Minus 1 its important) if not then set it to -1 to restart the timer. Its not important if you don\u0027t do this. Just that if the timer is set to an older time (other mission not finished) the timer will continue from that time, and either give you an instant finish, or possible longer countdown then what current mission is.

Given the current cost structure and payouts for stages autorecycled with parachutes (roughly 60%) versus 85% for stuff manually landed on solid ground and manually recovered, it can be more profitable to build a bigger more expensive rocket that can get to orbit with just the 1st stage.

Then I designed several possible rockets to lift it to orbit, attached to an orange tank with a Poodle or Aerospike engine to serve as transfer stage to Minmus/Mun plus orbital fuel depot for the lander. At first I aimed for the cheapest design, then added parachutes to recover all the dropped stages. It cost $331,560 (Minmus mission pays 400k, so that\u0027s cool). It turns out the cost to orbit (cost of the dropped stages subtracted by the autorecycled value) was $83836.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I tried with a big first stage that can get to orbit (with over 400m/s deltaV left in it), and then manually reenter, land and be recovered at 85%.
