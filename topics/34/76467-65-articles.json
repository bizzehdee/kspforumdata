I\u0027d like to to launch right into the plane of the moon, but it\u0027s impossible to just guess from the map view when you\u0027re under the target orbit. I\u0027d appreciate any suggestions. It\u0027s not a big deal when Kerbin is the planet and everything is roughly in the same plane, but launching from Earth obviously changes things quite a bit.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve done all my launches manually (haven\u0027t had the balls to trust MechJeb yet), so I\u0027ve got a pretty good feel for it. This is the method I use (I think I learned/adapted this from one of metaphor\u0027s comments):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003Ego to the tracking station, and zoom out so that your viewpoint is just outside lunar orbit\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Epan around until you\u0027re at the Northernmost point of lunar orbit - try to be as exact as possible\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Eonce you\u0027ve determined that point, timewarp until KSC is directly at the centre of your view (it should be right under lunar orbit, even slightly below it)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Elaunch directly East, and keep heading East - when high up (\u0026gt;100km), start following the orbit prograde marker (keeping an eye on MechJeb\u0027s relative inclination indicator is handy too)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Eif you get a significant relative inclination, adjust the timing of your launch\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt might take a little trial-and-error initially (took me 4-5 launches at first to get it right), but now I can launch reliably into orbits that have relative inclination \u0026lt;0.5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA within 2 attempts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course this mainly applies to Cape Canaveral (which has a latitude closely matching lunar inclination) - if launching from a higher latitude site (e.g. Baikonur), you cannot avoid having to do a dog-leg and/or in-orbit plane change. If launching from the Southern hemisphere, you\u0027ll need to switch to using the Southernmost point of lunar orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kurja","CreatedById":66303,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-15T22:01:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDoesn\u0027t MJ have time to AN/DN indicators?

I\u0027ve found that a high turn-end altitude coupled with a gentle turn and an early turn start tends to work well for low-TWR launches; my Apollo-esque LV has an ascent path in MJ with a 1km start, 180km finish, and ~55 turn shape to hit a 200km target orbit. MJ flies it to a 160kmx200km orbit before requiring a circularization burn. Different ships require different settings, of course, and I think I\u0027ve still got optimization room, but it works. I wish MJ wouldn\u0027t cut out when you drive your apoapsis past the target orbit altitude, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAs for landing, you need to add multiple low-thrust engines and selectively disable them as your TWR climbs. Or you can do what Surveyor did: a large fast-burning solid retro to kill most descent velocity at a km up or so, then some small, limited-fuel verniers to soft-land.
