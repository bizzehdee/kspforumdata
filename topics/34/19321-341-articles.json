The main problem is that there is always the chance that the threads try to work on the same section of the voxel, and so some performance needs to be given up to prevent them from clashing. In addition, the actual solidification pass can only manage ~2x speedup, ever. The method simply doesn\u0027t lend itself to multithreading given the amount of data that would need to be transferred between threads and the cost of keeping them synced to keep problems from showing up there.

The scaled down planets have a faster atmosphere density scaling, meaning that it becomes less dense quicker than on Earth.

I\u0027m going for the most realistic aerodynamics I can manage, not personal opinion of what \u0022feels\u0022 right. As I believe I\u0027ve mentioned before, if you can point to papers or data that include models and correlations that get the performance that you\u0027d like to see that prove that it\u0027s realistic, I\u0027ll gladly implement it. Now, show me the data on how it compares to reality vs. oldFAR.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wonder if there is some super-accurate but slow aerodynamics simulator out there that can simulate arbitrary 3D models that\u0027s not some ultra-pricey piece of software. I could export KSP ships as a model (maybe .stl?), have it simulate them, and compare the results to what FAR gives. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea being that the separate piece of software doesn\u0027t have to work in real time, so it could afford to use far more computationally expensive but more accurate (and maybe simpler) methods. It might be useful for finding edge cases that FAR doesn\u0027t handle well, and if FAR does a really good job, then it would definitely be a source of bragging rights.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Hey, I made a mod for KSP that simulates aerodynamics as accurately as this research tool. Oh, and mine does it in real time, too.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr you may already do this, who knows. I have access to a university license of Solidworks Flow, so I may fiddle with that. Flow is geared more towards lower speed stuff like fluid in pipes, though. I know it does some aerodynamic stuff, but I\u0027m not sure if it will do stuff like supersonic wave drag or compression lift, though. Depends on how general it\u0027s fluid dynamics solver is, I guess.
