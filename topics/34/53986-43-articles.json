But SABREs don\u0027t really need MEC, since thrust correction isunnecessary and they don\u0027t support multiple fuel configs per mode. You can use RF resources for them without MEC or MHE.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently it\u0027s 4 meters to fit the Mk1-2.
