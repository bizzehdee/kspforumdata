Extrude the two other blocks from their own quadrant. Put in the cylinders, then do the NURBS extrusion for the wires like I talked about in on of the posts above. It\u0027s sitting around ~700 polys right now. I could probably cut it down to something like 500 if I cleaned up the geometry from the edge loops and merged together some of the straighter parts of the wires.

Yeah, I generally find the older stuff a lot more interesting. Especially the periods when we were still figuring out how everything works. Now, for example, most probes look very same-y with all the gold foil and such. And there are more than enough mods that aim to recreate things like the SLS. I made an Atlas V because the only one I know of, OMSK, is somewhat dead and I didn\u0027t care for the textures. But that\u0027s probably the only modern part I\u0027ll make unless another catches my eye. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think my current plan is still just to implement the cameras as normal experiments and worry about making them compatible with hullcam or something later.
