someone help me? I\u0027ve tried searching for an answer but cannot find it for the life of me: I want to make an equippable/carryable parachute (specifically the small Umbra sounding rocket)  that my Kerbal can carry inventory, equip it, and then deploy it if they need to bail out of a craft in atmosphere. I can carry the umbra parachute inside the seat inventory, but for some reason, there doesn\u0027t seem to be any way to either attach it to the Kerbal in EVA or have them visibly carry it (it\u0027s just hidden in their invisible pocket). \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Is there some way to make this possible?

Although, now that I think about it, the KIS storage crate does continue to retain the right click menu to access it\u0027s inventory.  You could try making your own part using the container as a template, but the chute functionality may just not work as expected:\n\n[https://github.com/KospY/KIS/blob/master/Parts/container1/part.cfg](https://github.com/KospY/KIS/blob/master/Parts/container1/part.cfg)\n\nedit:  Looks like a cross post, you found what you needed.

Like, why does limit depends on the experience? Though, the whole approach of mass limitation is planned to be changed in some future version. I was describing basic idea somewhere in this thread. I;m going to finalize it at design level and then implement. It will be kind of \u0022mass re-scaling\u0022 approach but based on physics principles.\n\u003E \n\nNeat - I looked at the notes earlier in the thread and it\u0027s pretty clever to use the MMU as a physics-based method to mitigate weight limitations on the surface and inertia limitations in orbit.
