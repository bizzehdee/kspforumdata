Maybe better to leave them enabled, then :)  \n\nHmm, although... to think of it, looking at ScienceDefs.cfg in Sounding Rockets, SRExperiment01 and SRExperiment02 are meteorological and aeronomical experiments, respectively, so perhaps they should NeedsAtmosphere. On the other hand, they don\u0027t requireAtmosphere in the .cfg - maybe that should be reported as a bug to RoverDude.

Do you have a suggestion for a mod to add to Blizzy\u0027s toolbar? Just so we can see if it works.\n\u003E \n\n[Transfer Planner Window](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/84005-10x-transfer-window-planner-v1400-dec-3/#comment-1386852) and [Kerbal Alarm Clock](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/22809-10x-kerbal-alarm-clock-v3500-dec-3/#comment-299092) are two I know work, and both of which you might want to consider for your game.  Both install their icons to the stock toolbar and you have to transfer them to Blizzy\u0027s through their own settings dialogs.\n\nI wasn\u0027t clear enough so I\u0027m going to assume that you can\u0027t see the Science icon on either the stock toolbar (located in the upper right) or Blizzy\u0027s toolbar (whose default location I can\u0027t recall).  If this is the case, try reinstalling the mod iaw the developer\u0027s instructions or via CKAN.  It should, by default, be on the stock tool bar.\n\nCan you open Blizzy\u0027s toolbar\u0027s settings menu by clicking on the small down arrow on the right side?  If you can, select \u0022Configure Visible Buttons\u0022 and see if Science is listed and enabled."},{"CreatedByName":"Steviedm777","CreatedById":156098,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-30T17:15:25Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 31 minutes ago, Brigadier said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I can\u0027t say as I have never run 64-bit KSP and haven\u0027t paid any attention to what may or may not work.

Thanks so much for the suggestion.\n\nIt is showing up and working as expected now. Also no problems with the 64bit as far as I can see.\n\nJust keep in mind I have removed every mod I had and only went with the CKAN suggestion, and then installed [x] science.\n\nSeems I just sucked at doing it manually. ![^_^](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_happy.png \u0022^_^\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"Brigadier","CreatedById":147109,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-30T18:33:29Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Quote\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Seems I just sucked at doing it manually. ![^_^](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_happy.png \u0022^_^\u0022)\n\u003E \n\nThe manual installation process is pretty simple in most cases.  Be aware that some mod developers would prefer not to deal with CKAN installations because it\u0027s been know to screw up the install.  This can result in more headaches for the mod developer when it isn\u0027t their problem.  People have complained in the mod thread instead of the CKAN thread.\n\nI\u0027ve had a CKAN-installed USI mod do this but I solved it by removing and reinstalling all of the USI mods via CKAN.\n\nGlad it all worked out.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-30T18:36:29Z\u0022 title=\u002212/30/2015 06:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Brigadier**"},{"CreatedByName":"Z-Key Aerospace","CreatedById":138926,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-21T20:35:24Z","Content":"I\u0027m testing a new version.
