I\u0027ve edited the stock radial attachment point to do this, but so far some of my bases explode when I go to land a ship at the base to unload more parts to build up a base? Having something that feels more like a foundation to build off of would be great. \n\nAlso, would it be possible to add a pod (or man able device) that would allow for greater reach and lift capabilities while inside with out having to edit the config file for the Kerbals themselves? This would go a long way in making in-situation base building more accommodating. \n\nThanks, and I love this mod.
