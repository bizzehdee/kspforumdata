That is, while the mechanics behind antennae transmission/reception can be measured by the quality and design, placing a limitation on the range does not mean the signal stops at this point. The radio waves (or whatever medium is being used) continue to travel after they have reached the limits of the operating range. They will suffer from signal degradation as they travel away from the origin, but the signal doesn\u0027t simply vanish. This presents a more realistic scenario when dealing with transmission distances rather than basing it on an imposed distance range.\u003Cp\u003ETL;DR A stronger antenna can do more with less.

Well I\u0027d be ok if FC wouldn\u0027t work with burns that require staging. Once staging is out, it\u0027s actually pretty simple. You can try using Tsiolkovsky rocket equation for estimating burn time. Advantage of this method is it\u0027s exact (and pretty fast too), and not simulation-based like the one MJ uses.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-29T04:56:37Z\u0022 title=\u002212/29/2013 04:56  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 29, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by asmi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NoMrBond","CreatedById":69263,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-29T06:31:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps have a reception multiplier as another stat/attribute, so a weaker antenna can transmit further than it can receive, as long as there is a better receiver at the other end to catch the attenuated signal\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[Edit] You could even have specialized high-gain \u0022listening\u0022 antenna which have no transmission capability (and vice-versa with powerful transmitters)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-29T06:36:58Z\u0022 title=\u002212/29/2013 06:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 29, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by NoMrBond\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kimberly","CreatedById":71980,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-29T08:39:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NoMrBond\u0022 data-cite=\u0022NoMrBond\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou could even have specialized high-gain \u0022listening\u0022 antenna which have no transmission capability (and vice-versa with powerful transmitters)\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been checking many real satellites for inspiration for Kerbal designs, and it seems most modern communication satellites actually do have dedicated receiving antennae for signals from earth, often only one or two small ones, while the main array of antennae is for broadcasting.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Garek","CreatedById":73214,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-29T08:45:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Cilph\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Cilph\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EMaybe finally do proper kOS integration if the kOS main dev comes back from absence.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is basically what I\u0027m waiting for.
