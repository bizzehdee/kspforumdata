You have got to experiment with different ascent profiles to obtain the right one for your vehicle. I suggest doing a bit of maths and figuring out your vehicle\u0027s abilities and specifications e.g. initial and final TWR of each stage, specific impulse of each stage and so on. Then you will be able to decide on the ascent profile you will want to take. It\u0027s essential that you get the FAR config for MechJeb. Just one bad thing about MechJeb is its stiffness on the yaw and roll of the vehicle during ascent. Because you don\u0027t have an ascent profile that includes roll and yaw, on launches that are inclined, MechJeb often manages to nicely screw up your vehicle with the help of aerodynamic forces! Other than that it is a very nice tool, not to mention a realistic one as well, that manages to simulate computer controlled launch for those who don\u0027t know how to do fancy programming.

I then disengage the autopilot take manual control, launching on a heading of 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 which should put you on or very near the plane of the Moon. I will warn you that the dev build from about a week ago didn\u0027t do a good job of this, so to be sure you\u0027re launching into the right plane, zoom out to map view before launch and double check that your ship is centered on the orbit line of the Moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Shukinen\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Shukinen\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ewow thanks, really helps a bunch but ther eis the other thing (lol sry imma look again tomorow, getting a bit tired here hehe), but let\u0027s say i want to put a satellite to a specific inclinations, it wont be launch azymuth right? if i did understand launch azymuth calculate the best moment to launche to get alignement with another plance such ISS, how do i know to launch it?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENope, azimuth is exactly what you want. You want the arcsin (that sin-1 on most scientific calculators) of the cos of your target inclination divided by the cos of your latitude. So, for the ISS\u0027s 51.6 inclination from the cape, you would do cos(51.6) / cos(28.5), which is 0.621148 / 0.878814 = 0.706800. Arcsin(0.706800) = 44.98\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 or 135.02\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 if you\u0027re going south, meaning that to launch into the ascending arc of the orbit, you\u0027d launch on a heading of 44.98\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 and for the descending arc (not sure if those are the right terms) you\u0027d fly heading 135.02\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0. Now, the rest of the page helps you figure out things like when to launch, including how much lead time to give yourself so you end up at the correct inclination and also the correct orbital plane. Again, the launch into plane mode of MechJeb helps a lot here, though it won\u0027t calculate the lead time for you, so you\u0027ve either got to do that yourself or you\u0027ve got to carry some extra dV to correct your inclination after reaching orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tmikesecrist3","CreatedById":99603,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-24T09:12:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI thinking about trying this a again but I am not real sure how to get the earth map?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpacedInvader","CreatedById":106018,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-24T09:47:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022tmikesecrist3\u0022 data-cite=\u0022tmikesecrist3\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI thinking about trying this a again but I am not real sure how to get the earth map?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Earth and the Moon should both be part of the basic RSS download from the OP.
