First, the \u0022Lock\u0022 command doesn\u0027t seem to do much, either that or I don\u0027t understand it\u0027s functionality; is supposed to prevent the locked part from being actuated [from the IR controls] or is it supposed to lock the part as in make it rigid so external forces (gravity, bumping, collision) can\u0027t move it? I attempt to lock parts, but when I press the corresponding actuator after locking, they move normally. Also, the GUI option doesn\u0027t change to \u0022Unlock\u0022 or anything of the sort to indicate it has been locked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, the toolbar. When in flight, the toolbar refuses to hide the IR controls when clicking. However in the VAB/SPH, it works as intended. No other toolbar-enabled mods I use have this issue. Is there any known incompatibility with other mods? I\u0027m running a lot; currently the ones that interface with Toolbar (off the top of my head) are: FAR, Targetron, RCSBuildAid, Kethane, CrewManifest and ActionGroupManager plus a bunch that don\u0027t interface with the Toolbar. They\u0027re all updated to the latest version; that\u0027s the first thing I check when something like this happens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnywho, love the mod aside from those hiccups, and can\u0027t wait for the redesign!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZodiusInfuser","CreatedById":76163,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-11T15:40:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022bulletrhli\u0022 data-cite=\u0022bulletrhli\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAre there tutorials anywhere or craft files where we can learn Infernal Robotics?
