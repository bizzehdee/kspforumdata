I have to admit that I absolutely deplore using the sliding tweakable menus to manipulate control surface deflections. I humbly implore you to at least provide the option for the use of the old style control surface assignment GUI page. That allowed me to do many things that I am no longer able to do, and it makes me a very sad tradesman of soil. Also, please, split aileron drag rudders that i can operate with my joystick instead of the action groups i used for the craft below. \u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/vuAQy\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

I had a thought, though that perhaps there might be a way to tie in spoiler deflection with a control axis, ie, if you tie it to yaw, it will deflect the same percentage (up to the deflection limits specified, either positive or negative) as would the rudder, regardless of its orientation relative to the rudder. With a setup like that applied to my example craft in my previous post, as I call for rudder imput, the spoilers would deploy as if they were rudders, even though they\u0027re not in the typical vertical stabilizing orientation. So ultimately what I\u0027m asking for is a \u0022dumb\u0022 ctl surface that would not deploy based on how it would affect the rotation of the ship, but would deploy based on what the control input for whatever axis(ies?) it was assigned. Does this make sense? I would imagine that would be easier than attempting to devise a way to build a split control surface system, or even a \u0022smart\u0022 drag based control system and it would allow one to accomplish the same sort of functionality providing I employed the surfaces in a clever manner.

It takes a pretty good educated guess as to the axis, and then it determines the distances across the object perpendicular to that at either end. It averages them to come up with an approximate circular cross section to refer to and stores a ratio between the two axes for use handling body lift and drag. The tapering of the frustum is stored so that drag properties can be calculated from that and the surface area is calculated as the rounded area of the shape, ignoring the bases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt works quite well for most parts, actually.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHmm.
