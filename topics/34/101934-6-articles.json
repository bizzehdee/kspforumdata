It needs to work this way (most of the contracts work like that) for the \u0022return to the ground\u0022 step to work correctly. The first ship to complete the steps of a contract must be the one that returns home, with some minor caveats (some of them are complete-able if you land a ship that has docked with the main ship, etc). If you fail the contract (crash, land without completing all the objectives, or cancel it from the space center then re-accept) you should be able to complete it with a fresh launch.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-24T11:20:19Z\u0022 title=\u002205/24/2015 11:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by tjsnh**"},{"CreatedByName":"jordanjay29","CreatedById":62787,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T14:37:50Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E That shouldnt matter.
