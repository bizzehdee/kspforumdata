Since that is the only new part it\u0027s effective cost is MUCH higher in magnitude than the other parts, but is actually negative (easy to test. Put just that booster in the vab and remove some fuel. If the cost goes negative, then that\u0027s the problem).

There are two settings that influence reconditioning time: the Overall Multiplier (which also affects total build times) and the BP per ton ratio (which can be adjusted in the settings. Default is 86400BP per 25 tons. Doubling the tonnage cuts the time in half.) Or, if you want to stick with default settings, the actual way of increasing the rate at which it progresses is to increase your VAB rates. All of the VAB rates get added together to make up the total reconditioning rate.

Personally I wouldn\u0027t like pressing the Launch button and then having to wait, especially after having to wait (days, sometimes weeks or months) for it to build (and reconditioning from the last launch, which luckily is less than the time it takes me to build a new rocket).
