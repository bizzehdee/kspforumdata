I have no idea why this was done. The code I have currently stops tritium breeding from working if you have no Lithium, which due to this change is 100% of the time when the button is available. If you take this code out, so that you can have the mode active all the time then it consumes no Lithium/produces no Tritium until you hit about 100x time warp, then suddenly starts working properly as the amount crosses this 1e-5 limit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThankfully this problem won\u0027t affect either Fission/Fusion reactors, radiaoactive decay and various other things because these all use custom code.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGeneration of Tritium will still work on unfocused vessels that have the tritium breeding mode enabled but when you focus that vessel, it will immediately drop out of that mod, thinking it has no more Lithium.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are a couple of ways I can fix this: 1) I can change most of the ALL_VESSEL_FLOW resources to STACK_PRIORITY_SEARCH - this has the downside that existing ships may need significant redesign because those resources will no longer be easy to transfer or 2) I can remove all the checking code that disables mode when you have no fuel for it, which means these options will fail at low time acceleration but will begin working when you accelerate faster and when the vessel is unfocused. Technically, there is also 3) write a new method that handles resource draws for ALL_VESSEL flows properly but I\u0027d quite like to know why this change was introduced before doing that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Donziboy2\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Donziboy2\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhen he first implemented this it threw us for a loop and it also blew up a few ships;)\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, I\u0027m glad I had you testing this part on that dev-build I released before I started blowing up the general Interstellar playing populace \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Donziboy2","CreatedById":74984,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-20T17:38:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Fractal_UK\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Fractal_UK\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, I\u0027m glad I had you testing this part on that dev-build I released before I started blowing up the general Interstellar playing populace \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBah, now I feel like one of those poor Kerbals that gets used for the suicide tests lol.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022So you just want me to sit on this full tank of Antimatter?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Sure.....\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-20T17:46:30Z\u0022 title=\u002212/20/2013 05:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 20, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Donziboy2\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lightwarrior","CreatedById":93585,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-20T18:18:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Fractal_UK\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Fractal_UK\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...\u003Cp\u003EThere should be upgrade button in the right click menu for unupgraded parts in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStrange.

I have built a craft that includes a fission generator, electric generator, antimatter collector and antimatter containment device. On the wiki, it claims that Kerbin has some antimatter that can be collected, so that\u0027s where I\u0027m testing at the moment. So I have a few questions to try to figure out what I\u0027m doing wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Do any of the parts need to be directly connected to one another? Sometimes engines need to be directly connected to a reactor, is this the case for the collector to the containment unit? Or anything else? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Is there a reference for the ideal orbit height for Kerbin flux? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.
