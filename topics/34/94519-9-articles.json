After converting it to use LH2, however, I found that EVERY engine out-performed it. A simple Skipper burning stock RP-1/LOX was far superior in every way, and if I compared it to other engine mods, like the Cryogenic Engines, it was insane to even consider it. It\u0027s the type of engine I wanted to use, however, so I did some testing (using Interstellar Fuel Switcher) to find out why it sucked so bad...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI built a craft with one pod, one tank, and a Nuclear Lightbulb running the original RP-1 (liquid fuel). It weighed 29.12t, and engine performance was: TWR=1.58, Dv(vac)=2469.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe exact same ship with the tank switched to LH2 and the Lightbulb modded to use it was just pathetic, but that\u0027s to be expected since the best real-world information I can find says you can fit over 11 times the mass of RP-1 in the same space as LH2, so I added more LH2 tanks until the ships were the same total\u003Cem\u003E weight\u003C/em\u003E. This hydrogen-using ship weighed 29.22t, using six of the tanks used on the RP-1 ship to get there, and engine performance was: TWR=1.57, Dv(vac)=1099.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, simply converting the engine to use hydrogen instead of liquid fuel lost me 0.01TWR, removed a whopping 55.5% of my Dv, and as an added bonus made my rocket SIX TIMES larger! That\u0027s the exact opposite of good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECompared to a stock conventional engine, it gets even worse. The exact same ship using a Skipper engine instead of the Lightbulb weighs only 12.2t, with engine performance of: TWR=5.47, Dv(vac)=1456.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAccording to a NASA proposal document on NTP (Nuclear Thermal Propulsion), an engine like this could be expected to have 100%\u002B Isp over a conventional engine, and even with the Lightbulb\u0027s awesome starting Isp of 1500, that means we\u0027d have to multiply it by 2.65 (if using LH2) to get that sort of performance advantage over a Skipper.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I don\u0027t even want total realism, but, in NASA\u0027s words, nuclear propulsion opens up the possibility of practical manned missions to the outer solar system, so I at least want that to be true in my game. Clearly, this just won\u0027t do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know this mod natively uses liquid fuel, so any discussion of hydrogen is off in left field, but even using the stock fuel it\u0027s performance isn\u0027t nearly better \u003Cem\u003Eenough\u003C/em\u003E to warrant using it over another engine that weighs much less and provides far higher TWR. And if we do discuss modding it to use H2, why does the same weight of hydrogen give less than half the Dv of liquid fuel, anyway? That\u0027s one I can\u0027t figure out no matter how I look at it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, fuel types is not something I know much about, really, so... thoughts anyone?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwaster","CreatedById":71262,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T10:12:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Rhedd\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Rhedd\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe exact same ship with the tank switched to LH2 and the Lightbulb modded to use it was just pathetic, but that\u0027s to be expected since the best real-world information I can find says you can fit over 11 times the mass of RP-1 in the same space as LH2, so I added more LH2 tanks until the ships were the same total\u003Cem\u003E weight\u003C/em\u003E.

I hadn\u0027t considered that, as I was only considering the total wet mass of the ship. Clearly as the fuel gets used the effects of dry tank weight would become more pronounced. Still, each tank weighs 0.5t, so the difference in ship dry weight between the RP-1 and LH2 ships is only 2.5t. I\u0027m not doing math, here, but I can\u0027t imagine that a dry weight difference of 2.5t out of a wet total of 29.2 would account for an over FIFTY PERCENT drop in Dv. Am I wrong?
