The throttle setting produces a fraction of motorPower in EC/s. That\u0027s converted into watts using whatever EC:J conversion rate you decide on (ISTR 1EC=1kJ). That\u0027s multiplied by partEfficiency to produce the output power in watts. That can then be divided by the current part RPM and the conversion factor listed above to produce the current torque.
