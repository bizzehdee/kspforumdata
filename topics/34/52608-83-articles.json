The part in question has a working IVA (I believe it is a \u0022transparent\u0022 IVA). I have very very limited modding ability, and would not trust myself to even generate a .cfg file (nor do I even know where to go to do that). So, my question is, are there folks here taking requests for part .cfgs for RPM, or is there a tutorial somewhere that can teach me how to do this?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nli2work","CreatedById":106805,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-28T05:54:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m getting materials together to record a video for doing that, possibly tomorrow. keep an eye out in the model/texture section.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FeepingCreature","CreatedById":71591,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-28T09:19:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Errol\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Errol\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAlong with kerbtrack and a touchscreen I feel like I get better immersion then I could with an oculus rift.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you think this is immersive, try it with kerbtrack \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E an Oculus Rift... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AntiMatter001","CreatedById":100129,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-28T11:20:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022FeepingCreature\u0022 data-cite=\u0022FeepingCreature\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf you think this is immersive, try it with kerbtrack \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E an Oculus Rift... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eor you know... google cardboard.... they work too.... and they use your high end phone for something other than calling people...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT(i remembered what i was gonna say \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E): hi sorry for bothering anyone on this but i keep getting JSIactiongroupswitch and JSIswitchablelabel initialization error when i select the cyclops pods from the \u0022retro future\u0022 mod pack. i\u0027ve tried re-installing them with no luck... the RPMs work and so do the actiongroups/switches. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eoh i get these errors in the SPH/VAB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eso any help on the matter?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-28T13:53:02Z\u0022 title=\u002209/28/2014 01:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 28, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by AntiMatter001\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Errol","CreatedById":118622,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-28T16:05:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022FeepingCreature\u0022 data-cite=\u0022FeepingCreature\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf you think this is immersive, try it with kerbtrack \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E an Oculus Rift... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E While google cardboard looks super cool, and I might be interested if I was still an android user, I have a laptop with a touchscreen and RPM works with that.
