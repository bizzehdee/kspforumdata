For example, display suicideburnstartsecs only if vertspeedrounded is negative?\n\u003E \n\nYes.  There are a couple ways to do that, depending on the layout of the line of text it goes on.  If it\u0027s the last bit of text, you can do something like\n\n    Burn Start: {0:;\u0022       \u0022;}{1,7:METMM:ss.f} $\u0026$ VERTSPEEDROUNDED SUICIDEBURNSTARTSECS\n\nor you can use a select variable\n\n    RPM_SELECT_VARIABLE\n    {\n      name = MY_BURNSTART\n      defaultValue = SUICIDEBURNTIMESECS\n      VARIABLE_DEFINITION\n      {\n        name = VERTSPEEDROUNDED\n        range = 1,100000\n    \n        value = 0\n      }\n    }\n\nand use the variable SELECT\\_MY\\_BURNSTART, which will return 0 if VERTSPEEDROUNDED is between 1 and 100000m/s, and return SUICIDEBURNTIMESECS otherwise.  Then, for the data display, you can use some text like \u0022--:--.-\u0022 for the text displayed when the select variable is zero."},{"CreatedByName":"dlrk","CreatedById":60033,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-29T03:08:43Z","Content":"Thanks!  \n\nAlso, I\u0027ve read through the string.format docs, and I\u0027ve been able to make some useful changes to the landing page, but I\u0027m still not quite understanding how this works.
