It only displays values up to mach 10, and flying a reentry over Kerbin in any scaled up RSS system means your vehicle can easily get up to mach 20 or more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAFAIR: There is no real difference in the VSI and the the vertical velocity gauge.
