Increased power for thrusting away from a docking port, perhaps required for emergencies. 2. Increased power for deorbiting, providing a higher degree of accuracy for placement of atmospheric reentry. 3. Increases potential thrust in each vector between 30 and 100 percent due to the involvement of two or more thrusters with each translation.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-01T02:59:37Z\u0022 title=\u002206/01/2014 02:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 1, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by LazarusLuan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-01T01:22:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/77398-0-23-5-ModuleRCSFX-0-3-RCS-with-PROPELLANT-based-fuels-and-EFFECTS-based-FX!?highlight=ModuleRCSFX\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/77398-0-23-5-ModuleRCSFX-0-3-RCS-with-PROPELLANT-based-fuels-and-EFFECTS-based-FX!?highlight=ModuleRCSFX\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry this out, it fixes roll for capsule-mounted RCS.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RedAV8R","CreatedById":94171,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-01T02:02:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LazarusLuan\u0022 data-cite=\u0022LazarusLuan\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThere appears to be a total of 18 RCS thrusters. Ten involve the -Z vector: two on port and starboard near the nose which are 100% dedicated to the -Z vector, four on port and starboard between the engine nacelles that split thrust between the -Z, -X, -Y, \u002BZ and \u002BY vectors and four on port and starboard on the outside of the two nacelles also splitting thrust between the -Z, -X, -Y, \u002BZ and \u002BY vectors. The remaining eight thrusters each involve the \u002BZ vector, with varying degrees of involvement with the -X, -Y, \u002BX and \u002BY vectors depending on placement. Four of these thrusters are involved in providing rotation, but this can\u0027t be seen in KSP due to the current requirement of a surface mounted RCS for roll. \u003Cp\u003EThis new configuration seems to provide three things: 1. Increased power for thrusting away from a docking port, perhaps required for emergencies. 2. Increased power for deorbiting, providing a higher degree of accuracy for placement of atmospheric reentry. 3. Increases potential thrust in each vector between 30 and 100 percent due to the involvement of two or more thrusters with each translation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know you don\u0027t care to add 3rd party module dependencies but I do ask you include all the real transforms for the possibly of those who use RSS and RO to have good accurate control. I know you did so on V1 pod, just asking you do the same on V2. Otherwise it appears what you\u0027ve seen and modeled match what I see. Thank you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
