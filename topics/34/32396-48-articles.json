Oh, and. My advice would be to set aside an empty save and design your base components there, testing them on a debug version of the launchpad. (Just copy the part config file, change the part name in it and set \u0022debug = true\u0022). This will help you know exactly how much parts do you need to bring with you, whether your design even works, whether you can actually move it off the launchpad (always an important consideration) before you spend the effort of transporting it all to your destination.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInitially, I made a crane to haul modules off the pad.
