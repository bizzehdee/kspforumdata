Perhaps only RCS thrusters should be able to feed from the bladder and surface tension tanks. In any case, there should be some ullage simulation in RCS thrusters in case they feed from surface tension tanks (which they often do).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-28T15:35:37Z\u0022 title=\u002201/28/2014 03:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 28, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by eggrobin\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Agathorn","CreatedById":99662,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-28T17:51:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo what is a typical ascent profile for a heavy launch vehicle designed to put a payload directly into GTO?

If you\u0027re going to need to burn a complete third stage to get to orbit, make sure that your second stage has an initial 1.2 at this velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can get away with an initial TWR for a second stage (that gets into orbit) of 0.4 if your first stage burns out at ~4.5 km/s - 5 km/s. Generally, in this case you\u0027re sending something to another planet, the moon, or to GEO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou want an orbit of ~190 km for lunar and interplanetary missions, and ~300 - 400 km if you\u0027re sending something to LEO.

It can help buy you time to get extremely heavy payloads into space. Also, don\u0027t be afraid to circularize after apoapsis; most rockets do this actually, since the lower thrust engine allows the stage to weigh less and get more dV.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you need practice getting into orbit, build a Titan II or a Falcon 9; both have abnormally high-thrust upper stages that will make getting into orbit easier, and then you can go for the lower-thrust upper-stage rockets where piloting is more difficult.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is nice information, but i\u0027m still curious about my initial query.

HoneyFox, my apologies for leading you astray!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgathorn: Given that the most efficient path to GEO is usually \u0022launch to LEO but keep burning that upper stage past circularization\u0022 the trajectory won\u0027t be *much* different. It depends on your upper stage(s)\u0027s TWR. If you\u0027re putting a GEO payload on a LEO launcher, and getting it off the ground with thrust augmentation, odds are your upper stage will be underpowered and you\u0027ll have to fly it up much higher to have time to get to orbital velocity before hitting the atmosphere again.
