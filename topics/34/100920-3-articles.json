No more hanging off the sides of cockpits to get that \u0022flying at kerbin\u0027s mountains\u0022 data or EVAing every two minutes in low munar orbit. This just makes more sense this way.\n\u003E - Reduced Transmission Penalty On Numerical Experiments: Science data that is just a number (temp, grav, barometer, accelerometer, atmo data) is much more effectively transmitted. Recovering the instruments is still mildly helpful.\n\u003E - Increased Transmission Penalty On Physical Experiments: Seriously nerfs the already low transmission rates for materials studies and mystery goo.\n\u003E - Surface Sample Transmition Penalty: (in alpha, currently disabled by default) Seriously nerfs the transmission value of Surface Samples to be in line with materials studies given the \u0022Materials\\_Nerfs\u0022 patch.\n\u003E - Science Lab Rebalance: Increases the Science Lab\u0027s weight to 5 tons (aprox. 2 hitchhikers). Increases lab\u0027s data and science storage. Also adds small labs to some mod-added habitats.\n\u003E - Probe Science: Adds a very low value experiment to all command modules. This data is representative of the telemetry data needed to pilot the vessel. Mostly helpful for contracts that require science transmission.\n\u003E - Hitchhiker Experiments: Replaces the hitchhiker\u0027s stock crew report with a new, slightly more valuable \u0022Micro-Gravity\u0022 Experiment. Really just flavor.\n\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptRobau","CreatedById":41695,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-11T23:15:03Z","Content":"Hi there zekew11, just checking to see how my old mod is doing. I like what you\u0027ve done with it. The near-zero loss rate for numerical experiments especially is a good addition you made. Originally I had 100% transmission, but your setup works better. It\u0027s not worth it to bring a probe back for the difference, but for manned missions you\u0027ve given the choice of getting instant science at an earlier time or waiting for the return of  your crew with full science benefits (with the risk of accidents along the way).

I\u0027m a min-maxer so the near-zero rates play into my style well :P. I also agree with the realism argument. Things are going well; I consider this mod essential for my playthroughs. I\u0027ve been away from Kerbal Space Program for some time now, but the game has a special place in my collection. For various reasons I\u0027m looking at studying engineering; I think Kerbal helping me rediscover my childhood passion for problem solving was on the critical path to that decision. Long story short; I\u0027m making sure this mod stays alive until the magical future point when I have a gaming pc and some time on my hands ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif \u0022:P\u0022)  \n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 8 hours ago, Jansn67 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The \u0022Micro-Gravity\u0022-Experiment from \u0022Science Revisited Revisited\u0022 have strange behavior within the \u0022Spectrometron\u0022 of \u0022Station Science 2.0\u0022, which wasnt present in Station Science 1.6.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Once the Hitch is manned with an Scientist and Micro-Gravity is done once, it begins to doubles/duplicated/spam the analyzable Results in the Spectrometron after analyzed first time.

I suspect there is a game engine conflict when a single part contains both an experiment and a lab though. I won\u0027t have time for a while to do a thorough investigation. The interim fix will be to release a patch that makes the Microgravity experiment contingent upon the part not also having an lab. In your save, you could accomplish this effect by deleting the config lines that add this experiment to the hitchhiker (though already launched hitchhikers would still be affected.) I\u0027ll try to get this out sooner rather than later.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 5/20/2016 at 10:13 AM, CarnageINC said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Got another name for your mod, instead of \u0027science revisited revisited\u0027, why not call it \u0027Science Revisited^2\u0027^ ?
