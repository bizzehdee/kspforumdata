With mechjeb, try using throttle control to reduce it, or use less thrust, then set your turn accordingly. And verikosto, the \u0022best\u0022 rocket is really hard to determine, everyone plays the game a little differently. What are you trying to send into space? The mainsail can still fly well with FAR, but it is very powerful, maybe use a skipper; and again, watch the TWR or your rocket will be unstable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WedgeJAntilles","CreatedById":67191,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-24T15:53:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re flipping around because your center of drag is in front of your center of mass, so air resistance at high speeds often causes you to flip around. Ferram posted some good tips for dealing with this few pages back; I won\u0027t repeat them here. I will suggest in short that you limit your acceleration to 20 m/s (use mechjeb\u0027s throttle assistance for this, it\u0027s a lifesaver) and turn slowly so you get out of the lower atmosphere as quickly as possible. Once you\u0027re at 35km, you\u0027ll be perfectly fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will add that if you have a large, light payload, your CoD will be SO far ahead of your CoM that even that won\u0027t help. It took me awhile to figure it out, but here\u0027s what I figured out:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Contrary to normal, it helps to make your rockets SHORT and WIDE -- asparagus staging is good here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Climb straight up until the atmosphere is thin enough that you can turn without losing control. This is usually at LEAST 15km. Even with such a non-optimal gravity turn, it still takes less delta-v to reach orbit than it does without FAR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will say that I feel your pain. It took me a good couple of weeks of failed launches and rockets flipping upside-down before I worked out how to get consistent launches with FAR, but it IS possible.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-24T15:58:33Z\u0022 title=\u002206/24/2013 03:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 24, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by WedgeJAntilles\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"asmi","CreatedById":59068,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-24T17:23:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI always control my rocket \u0022semi-automatically\u0022 (Using Smart ASS\u0027s \u0022Surface\u0022 mode) and always set pitch 88 and needed launch heading (btw I use 350 for polar orbits) before liftoff, then slowly turn it so by the time I get to 3k I\u0027m at 80 pitch.
