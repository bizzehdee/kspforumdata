I guess it has something to do with the order in which certain parameters are parsed, but don\u0027t quote me on that. Inside the Finalize node, finalizeOrbits can be set to true or false, and while I am not sure what that does exactly, one thing was that it used to keep SOIs from dropping below a certain minimum before we could set them manually.
