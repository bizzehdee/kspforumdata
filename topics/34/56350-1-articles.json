The lander\u0027s pilot was nowhere to be seen, likely alterady being rescued, and the rescue team ditching the destroyed debris like it was nothing, not to mention that Moving Parts Experts Group\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u017E\u00C2\u00A2 had alterady abandoned this landing strut layout and switched to a newer. Figuring these no longer had a legit owner, we reverse-engineered those parts, at the same time taking opportunity to build more of these landing struts. And, here we are, selling them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese landing legs have none of this suspension nonsense. They are barebones, shock-absorbing efficiency not exactly at it\u0027s finest, but rather at the finest price. When you land, you don\u0027t have to worry about the silly landing struts with suspension \u003Ca href=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/685968273269594645/FB792B526FAEA25FC06B670B2156B3DC4DADCF70/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Etilting your craft to the side\u003C/a\u003E, nor about they thinking they are actually trampolines when you intend to land your craft. Our legs will just do their job safely landing your craft on the floor, and if the rocket is going too fast for them, they will absorb the damage 25% of the time, providing a safer landing experience! (Warranty void if they don\u0027t absorb the damage)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot enough for you? Well, keep in mind that, while we were making more of these legs, we ended up making them slightly tougher, allowing them to take on impacts of up to 13 m/s. Not much higher than the newer legs\u0027 12, but they are good enough for that moment where your engine is struggling to slow down, and your craft ends up impacting the ground at 13m/s, breaking your landing struts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat are you waiting for?
