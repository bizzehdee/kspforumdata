First general discussion on why Im trying SMURFF\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Im not using Real Fuels largely due to the engine restarts and ullage. For engine restarts I like reusable explorers which they often trouble. An EVA Kerbal engineer could replace the \u0027matches\u0027 or other starters but Im not aware of that being coded yet. The ullage is a relatively minor issue solved by having solid rockets fire for a few seconds before starting the engine. The game code though requires an extra stage or manual vs Mech Jeb auto staging. With larger and certainly complex explorers having to give up potentially several stages is actually a problem. SMURFF seems to provide the more real \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E, engines and tanks without those issues.

However, this does not mean that a stock rocket that can reach orbit around Kerbin can reach orbit around Earth with SMURFF.  Because of the logarithm in the rocket equation, even a 4x reduction in rocket dry mass (which is more-or-less what SMURFF does) has pretty strongly diminished returns (a 60% increase in delta-V capacity at maximum, but more like 40% in practice because there\u0027s more to a rocket than engines and fuel tanks), while the delta-V requirements to get around the solar system roughly triple.\n\nFor a concrete example, it is possible (barely) to get into orbit with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E and SMURFF by taking a Kerbal X, removing the ladder and legs, and doubling the upper stage fuel tank.  It has just over 9500 m/s of delta-V.  In stock, the same rocket has \u0022only\u0022 6800 m/s of delta-V, which is enough to land on Duna and return (with very careful piloting and exploiting aerobraking opportunities to their fullest).\n\nSo, while SMURFF makes it easier to get into orbit (or anywhere else) in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E, it is still much more challenging than in stock."},{"CreatedByName":"Norcalplanner","CreatedById":112223,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-22T15:47:46Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 10 hours ago, The-Doctor said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [@Kerbas_ad_astra](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/126593-kerbas_ad_astra/) Hey, I\u0027m getting a few issues with the mod, in that, it doesn\u0027t get me to orbit in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E, I thought that\u0027s what it would do, scale up the power of the engines so that you can play \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E with stock engines right?

If you try out some of the rockets, they have nowhere near the mass fractions they should have. Ex: The Explorer probe only has 4,000 m/s of Delta V, when it should have 9,500\n\u003E \n\nWhere are you getting FASA?
