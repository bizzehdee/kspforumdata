I wonder whether there is some approximation being made by the thrust-calculating code that has diverging error as speed increases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, it\u0027s not just \u0022my vehicle\u0022, but a large number of vehicles I\u0027ve built. Even vehicles that do work to real-life spec (for example, a MiG-21 clone I built) experience this problem if I give it a push with a rocket over Mach 2.0: the SNECMA turbojet would suddenly start going faster and faster, and you just can\u0027t get it to stop: cutting throttle doesn\u0027t work since the engine spools down slower than the thrust increases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy \u0022gigantic turbofan\u0022 I mean the CFM whatever. It does dramatically reduce thrust as you get up to around 500 km/h, but starts picking up thrust afterwards. If you disable overheating, you can get it to produce as much thrust as you like by simply boosting it to supersonic speeds: it will then self-sustain, producing more and more thrust until the plane falls apart due to aerodynamic forces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEssentially, my subsonic airliners would fall apart due to Mach effects if I don\u0027t reduce throttle as I speed up.

What evidence do you have to defend that? IRL, planes don\u0027t get hypersonic because of a number of reasons, not necessarily lack of thrust.
