Heat loss due to boiloff is implemented but it doesn\u0027t seem to have much impact. Probably because actual loss rate is independent of heating rate. At some point that needs addressing and I think Nathan has some ideas about it but I\u0027m not sure what they are. (my own idea about it is that it should be based on incoming heat flux; with loss being calculated each frame based on how much heat gets through so that both loss and cooling (due to vaporization) are concurrent rather than disconnected as they currently are.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nalfz","CreatedById":145025,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T04:08:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m having some pretty vicious issues getting RF and tweakscale to play nicely.

Didn\u0027t realize that RealFuels now had the old engine ignitor/ullage stuff built into it. I\u0027m playing a new RO/RP-0 game and I\u0027ve been running into a problem with igniting most of the early AJ-10 and Agena upper stage engines. The problem is, the right-click information window will tell me \u0022Propellant: Very Stable\u0022, whether I\u0027m firing ullage or not, but when I activate the engine, 9 times out of 10 it will flame out with a notice similar to \u0022Vapor in fuel line\u0022.\u003Cp\u003EThe only ways I\u0027ve managed to reliably work around the issue are to either ignite the upper engine before the lower stage engine has completely burned out, or to fit my upper stage with a couple \u0022Separation Motor (small)\u0022 SRBs and fire those for a second before trying to ignite the upper stage engine. These work arounds are fine during the early stages when my upper stage engines can only be ignited once, but I\u0027m getting to the point where I\u0027ve got multiple restart upper stage engines and I can\u0027t (and should need to) fit tons of small SRBs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing RCS seems to fail pretty much every time. Doesn\u0027t matter how long I burn RCS or how powerful the RCS thrusters are. Before activating the RCS, the information panel says \u0022Propellant: Very Stable\u0022. It\u0027ll continue to say that no matter how long I have my RCS thrusters going. But as soon as I activate the engine, it\u0027ll switch to \u0022Propellant: Very Unstable\u0022 just long enough for the ignition to fail, then go right back to reporting \u0022Propellant: Very Stable\u0022 again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hate to turn off ullage and/or limited ignitions because I think they really add to the realism, but if I can\u0027t reliably get the engines to ignite, I don\u0027t have much choice.

I know there probably isn\u0027t anything I can do about it mis-reporting \u0022Propellant: Very Stable\u0022 when the propellant isn\u0027t stable at all, but I am hoping there is a way I can fix it so that RCS thrusters count as ullage. I\u0027ve read that a vessel in orbit only needs to produce about 0.001g of thrust (less then 0.01m/s2, right?) for a few seconds in order to settle the fuel so even early game RCS thrusters should be able to produce plenty of thrust. I have to figure since the small separation motors are able to keep the fuel stable, the problem is related to the g forces being produced but I\u0027m not sure if there is a setting in the RealSettings.cfg that controls that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"westamastaflash","CreatedById":110546,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-14T20:07:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have similar trouble sometimes I can\u0027t even ignite engines when I have SRB ullage motors running for several seconds, and it says \u0022Very Stable\u0022...
