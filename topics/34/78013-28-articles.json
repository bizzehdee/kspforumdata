It would also make the atmospheric cutoff a lot more jarring as well. Finally, drag is just about right for reentering capsules with the current settings, and increasing drag too much would simply make returning to Kerbin damn boring. If you wanna find out, go into the NEAR directory in GameData, open up NEARAeroData.config, find the areaFactor value and set it to something above 1 and see what you think. Reentry becomes boring as hell (for which the only solution is to remove drag dependence on shape, and now we\u0027re back where we started) and rockets become less stable. Not fun at all.\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve always found the dV requirement argument to be lacking, especially in the face of the new stability requirements on rockets. That\u0027s always struck me as the argument of people who already build ideal aerodynamic vehicles who don\u0027t realize how difficult it can be for new players. It\u0027s funny, it\u0027s led to people arguing that FAR is both \u0022cheaty\u0022 and \u0022absurdly hard\u0022 at the same time, which leads me to the conclusion that FAR (and probably NEAR as well) are balanced, but different from the stock game. Then the judgments on difficulty make sense in the context of players with differing skills in one area or another.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe stock engines aren\u0027t really overpowered for a real atmosphere, they\u0027re about correct. The jet engines are broken though, but that\u0027s because they\u0027re really magical air-breathing rocket engines and changing those around too much really falls outside the scope of an aerodynamics mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHi there. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know it is a really old part of the tread. maybe You did managed to make a deal since.
