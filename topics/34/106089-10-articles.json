If people want maximum realism, they can use mods like RealFuels and RO. For \u0022stockalike\u0022 gameplay, I don\u0027t think we should concern ourselves too much with realistic numbers for boil-off temperature and rate.\n\nNertea\u0027s new HeatManagement mod (and the new version of NFE) will include radiators and heat pipes with active cooling capabilities. However, this active cooling has a floor of 273K. Therefore, the boil-off threshold would need to be above 273K. Something like 400K would probably be reasonable. Thematically, we could assume that cryogenic tanks have built-in internal refrigeration that prevents boil-off, as long as the temperature of the tank itself remains \u003C 400K. It would also be important to include a means of alerting the player when boil-off is occurring; e.g., RCS effects coming off of the tank would be ideal.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-04T20:07:54Z\u0022 title=\u002206/04/2015 08:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fraz86**"},{"CreatedByName":"woot","CreatedById":102873,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T17:51:51Z","Content":"I tend to agree that while boil-off would be a nice addition, the rate of boil-off would need to be pretty slow.

Of course boil-off should have a stockalike gameplay feeling and should be optional for those who like to have an additional callenge. Maybe I\u0027m wrong but is CryoEngines the only stockmod except NFP which uses cryogenic fuels? Eventually we can use a MM-Patch to buff the engines in case of boil-off.\n\nReferring to the Nasa source from my first post active cooling is needed when the trip is longer than 30 days. For gameplay reasons in KSP the lossrate could be balanced in a way that active cooling is needed for trips outside Kerbins SOI only, perhaps already for Minmus trips?!?

I\u0027m trying to establish what are realistic boil off for IFS\n\nBecause I\u0027m using MFT this is from its description:\n\n\u0022loss\\_rate = controls how fast the resource is lost. The boiloff = loss\\_rate \\* maxAmount \\* (current\\_temp - desired\\_temp) \\* time elapsed.\u0022\n\nTime in seconds. Temp in Kelvin. The loss\\_rates I\u0027ve mentioned are taken from RF multiplied with four.\n\nThis means the numbers are per unit/liter tank volume, per degree deviation and per second.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-04T20:29:01Z\u0022 title=\u002206/04/2015 08:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by funk**"},{"CreatedByName":"Fraz86","CreatedById":90101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T20:43:57Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I haven\u0027t played with heat control, yet, but if the zero point temperature is 273K there might be some problems with stock heating - perhaps it is turned off? Will test it now...\n\nIt\u0027s not the stock heat system, it\u0027s the intentional design of Nertea\u0027s new active cooling functionality. Basically, radiators and heat pipes will now transfer X watts of heat from their parent part - into themselves for radiators, or into their target part for heat pipes. During early testing, this behavior resulted in the parent part getting cooled to ridiculously low temperatures (~4K) while the radiators would get very hot, with various undesirable gameplay consequences. Therefore, Nertea introduced a cooling floor, in which the heat transfer rate tapers down to zero as the parent part\u0027s temperature declines toward 273K. I assume 273K was chosen largely because this is the initial temperature on the launchpad, and so having zero heat transfer at this temperature allows a spacecraft to start out in equilibrium, avoiding unpredictable/volatile behavior.\n\nI think the current active cooling behavior, with a lower limit of 273K, is desirable and well conceived. If boil-off is implemented, I believe the boil-off temperature should be set at a point that integrates well with the active cooling as it is currently implemented (regardless of realism), rather than trying to change active cooling to allow lower temperatures."},{"CreatedByName":"Nertea","CreatedById":83952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T22:17:04Z","Content":"Quick update, 0.1.7, fixes these issues:\n\n- Fixed LF/O/MP tank patch functionality\n- New MFT patch from funk\n- Fixed dry mass in tank patch not adjusting"},{"CreatedByName":"rasta013","CreatedById":140002,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T21:28:12Z","Content":"Bringing this discussion of NTRs vs Cryo engine efficiency over from the NFT thread...\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I tested with all sizes of fuel tanks, including the largest ones from NFP, and even added weight to cryo engine setups to mitigate as much as possible the effect of dry mass, and cryo engines are still much more efficient.\n\u003E I thought it was that at first and repeated the tests very carefully. I\u0027m always testing cryo engines with LH2/OX, and NTRs with hydrogen only. I usually use 5 tanks of hydrogen in nuclear-powered setups to get about the same fuel mass.\n\u003E \n\u003E No matter what I just can\u0027t find any setup where nuclear rockets are more efficient than cryogenic engines. Test it for yourself if you don\u0027t believe me.\n\nLH2 Only : Rockomax Jumbo 64 w/ \u002B LV-N Nerv \u002B 10t NRAP = 19891 kg....this comes to a total dV of 1704\n\nLH2/Ox : Rockomax X200-16 \u002B Rockomax X200-8 \u002B VL1-Volcano \u002B 10t NRAP = 20000 kg...this comes to a total dV of 1686\n\nThis is vacuum numbers of course but I\u0027m not seeing much difference. If I could add just a bit more fuel to the NTR I\u0027d get even better dV. I\u0027ve checked a number of different configurations including using some of the Atomic Age engines, some of Ven\u0027s Cryo tanks, some stock tanks, some of the Klockheed Martin cryo tanks and I keep coming up with the same thing. I\u0027m finding all kinds of configurations where the NTRs are more efficient. Now that said, there are a number of situations where they are very close and I listed the above example as one since that\u0027s about as close to equal efficiency that I can get but it also would depend on situations as to what I was trying to accomplish.\n\nSome basic testing I\u0027m doing with the NFP tanks, here\u0027s one result where the Cryo engines perform better with similar weights:\n\nHI-M-10 \u002B 2x HI-M-5 \u002B LV-N \u002B 10t NRAP (adjusted fuel to give equal weight) = 16473 kg gives dV of 1017 m/s\n\nHI-M-5 \u002B VL-1 Volcano \u002B 10t NRAP = 16471 kg gives dV of 1210 m/s\n\nWith this setup the Cryo engine is more efficient but the NERV would not really be my choice in this situation anyway. Turning to the Atomic Age LANTERN engine, I actually end up with full tanks, a weight of 16357 kg and dV of 1379 m/s - far more efficient. Regardless, I\u0027m finding that there are so many variations of configuration between tanks and engines that I can find all kinds of performance ranges provided I maintain equal weight. LH2 is so much lighter that it requires more tanks but once I get the weights the same, the performance difference becomes very obvious. Obviously depending on the situation I\u0027d be using differing setups but I\u0027m definitely not finding that the cryo engines are ALWAYS more efficient, nor am I finding that the tanks from NFP are heavily unbalanced in any way. Actually, quite the opposite. The NFP tanks for me tend to be on the lighter side, yes, but I pay for that in dV and rocket size, specifically, length or width one of the two.\n\nI\u0027m just not seeing any problem here. I\u0027ll keep checking numbers and testing of course but in my opinion my first few passes have not really shown any unbalance to me."},{"CreatedByName":"toric5","CreatedById":58046,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T23:01:29Z","Content":"would ti be possible to add some smaller transfer engines? possibly convert the ones from NFSP?"},{"CreatedByName":"Vitasalato","CreatedById":114170,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T08:56:07Z","Content":"Hi, i love this mod and the idea of high ISP engines, but i think that it might be a problem.\n\nI\u0027ve measured with mechjeb the DeltaV of some stock engine and one Cryo, and the result is not what i was looking for.

If you use a Jumbo-64 w/ LFO and then just switch it to LH2/Ox and a cryo engine, you will always have worse dV. However, if you match the fuel mass between the two (which means more LH2/Ox tanks) you will see the improvement in performance and efficient. You\u0027ll also find that you will still end up conserving weight despite using more tanks because of the mass of LH2/Ox.
