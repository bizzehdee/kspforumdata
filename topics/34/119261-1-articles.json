In a previous KSP version Fusty created a mod which overcame this problem. His mod consisted of four differently sized docking ports which all could dock with the other three ports.

With this small mod i\u0027m trying to fill the gap somewhat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis mod consists of two configuration files one of which combines the three stock docking ports into one port.
