You wouldn\u0027t really have to care WHAT the button does; just whether it was clicked once (\u0022on\u0022) or twice (\u0022off\u0022); and then when a scene changes; simulate a click for each button that was last stored as \u0022on.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically; the button could open a webpage showing Hamster Dance; but toolbar shouldn\u0027t care; it just has to tell the button that the user clicked it as if they really had.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn pseudo-code....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003Eon_scene_change($scene) {\u003Cbr\u003E  load button_status ($scene.\u0022_status.cfg\u0022);\u003Cbr\u003E  while $button_status != EOF; do { if $button_status[$i] == 1 { simulate_click_on_button; $i\u002B\u002B} }\u003Cbr\u003E}\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003Eon_button_click {\u003Cbr\u003E if $button_status == 1 { $button_status = 0 } //button was on but was just clicked; store value as off\u003Cbr\u003E else { $button_status = 1 } //button was off and was just clicked, store it as such\u003Cbr\u003E}\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike I said; my knowledge of things is quite dated; and I don\u0027t know if KSP / Unity would allow for this easily or not; though. Then again maybe I\u0027m mis-understanding you and you mean that KSP / Unity doesn\u0027t have a method of \u0022click simulation\u0022 and you\u0027d have to basically have your own API where toolbar would have to tell the individual (other) plugins what their status was the last time; and rely on the (other) plugin makers to put the API to use. If that\u0027s the case; well aren\u0027t we already half-way there now? I mean it\u0027s up to the plugin makers now to determine what their buttons do already; a little more work to give the option of storing it\u0027s last state couldn\u0027t be TOO hard right :-D \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LMA","CreatedById":75775,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-27T21:00:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDownload links to malware\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blizzy78","CreatedById":68543,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-27T21:04:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LMA\u0022 data-cite=\u0022LMA\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDownload links to malware\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease don\u0027t spread false information, thank you very much.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"diomedea","CreatedById":93700,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-27T22:00:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LMA\u0022 data-cite=\u0022LMA\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDownload links to malware\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnless you can show evidence supporting such accusations, these are to be considered an attempt to discredit someone, as such\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#ff8c00;\u0022\u003E against rule 2.2.d of the \u003C/span\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/30064\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#ff8c00;\u0022\u003Eforum rules\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#ff8c00;\u0022\u003E.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven in case you had a report from an anti-malware software, it could easily be a false positive.
