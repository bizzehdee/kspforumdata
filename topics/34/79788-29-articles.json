I\u0027ve found that by landing directly on a waypoint, FP checks to see if it\u0027s the winner. If not, then just tells me, clears that waypoint and off I go to check the others with the rover. But, if I land on it, quicksave and then exit out and back into the game again, FP does the check all over again when I spawn on that waypoint. Sometimes it\u0027s the same as before, but sometimes it must RandomNumber the waypoints and it completes the contract for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for your exact issue, I think that is FP working as intended. All waypoints clear when you hit the magic one it\u0027s looking for.
