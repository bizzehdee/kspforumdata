The Wings of Mercury\u003C/em\u003E a fair bit recently, I have got a feel for the Mercury capsule\u0027s interior, and this is the finest one can possibly get with stock props.

One thing that\u0027s been bugging me though is the placement of the hatch. The texture shows the hatch in the correct position (left of the window), yet the actual hatch hit-box is on the window.
