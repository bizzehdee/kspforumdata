Unfortunately, that\u0027s what happens when I\u0027m coding late at night. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nOriginally, the plan was to give layouts custom names. I decided against that, and now the system just uses the file names. I just forgot to take out the Name field out. In the latest version, the ignored \u0022Name\u0022 field has been removed.\n\nNow regarding your custom layouts showing with blank names, that seems like a difference issue. If you\u0027re making a custom layout, the root node **MUST** be called **KSEA\\_HISTORIAN\\_LAYOUT**. Otherwise the layout would not (should not!?) load. So I\u0027m not sure how you got it working with an empty text file renamed to a \\*.layout extension.\n\nIf you are still having the issue, can you upload your layout file and your KSP log?\n\nFor me, custom layouts show up fine in the layout selector.

Right now, am playing a sandbox game with two objectives - to design craft that can perform certain roles AND to explore the Kerbol System. I decided with 1.0.X to start a fresh game and go back to the basics. Right now, while a lot of my craft are aircraft, the KSP is advancing in probe and orbital technology. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nOriginally I was only uploading unweaponized aircraft on KerbalX but had some requests to add an armed version of the aircraft I\u0027ve thus far shared. Personally, while shooting missiles is a fun way to get rid of orbiting junk, it really has a minor/nonexistent role in my Kerbal universe. \n\nIn my storyline, all Kerbanauts must become \u0022flight qualified\u0022 - meaning they must successfully demonstrate an ability to pilot fixed wing aircraft. They must do a day flight and a night flight, fly to the island airfield, land, exit the aircraft, then do a return flight. This includes one daytime and nighttime take-off and landing. I know for some of you that it may seem redundant, but it has sharpened my skills tremendously since .24 came out. Eventually I plan to blog the storyline and see where it takes me...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-27T03:38:08Z\u0022 title=\u002205/27/2015 03:38  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by adsii1970**"},{"CreatedByName":"nightingale","CreatedById":119307,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T05:21:52Z","Content":"Small feature request - Historian needs to subscribe to the GameEvents.onHideUI and GameEvents.onShowUI events to hide/show the UI window when the F2 key is pressed.

But you might have to tweak the Anchor, Size, and Position values of SITUATION\\_TEXT because SITUATION\\_TEXT is usually bigger. To play around with these values:\n\n1. Run the game\n\n2. Open Historian configuration window, select your layout, and hit \u0022Save\u0022 (to make sure your layout is selected as default)\n\n3. Make sure \u0022Always Active\u0022 is turned on\n\n2.

I know how it\u0027s done via save editing, but I never came across an easier option.\n\u003E Historian is becoming mainstream ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) I see more and more Historian screenshots around the forum.

Especially because I always tend to forget to switch it. It ***may*** be possible to do this in a very brute force way. But actually showing the flag selection UI in flight is a whole different story. Regardless, this seems like a solid enough idea to warrant its own mod. When I was looking for a solution to this issue, I was really surprised that no one\u0027s already made a mod for this.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Thanks to the good explanation in GitHub it\u0027s not too hard to get a nice layout. I do have one question though: how can i add special characters in the text? For instance the degree sign for longtitude and lattitude.\n\nSpecial characters is a touchy subject. I managed to get it to work by copy-pasting the degree symbol character from a random website (just Google \u0022degree sign\u0022). The problem is, since the character is most likely encoded in UTF-8, depending on which text editor you use and its configuration, the editor may or may not convert that character into ASCII. I wish I had a better solution for this, but it has a lot to do with how KSP reads configuration files, and how Unity treats rich text and different string formats that load from those files. That\u0027s why I had to use \u0022\u003Cn\u003E\u0022 for the new line character.\u003C/n\u003E\n\nMaybe I\u0027ll just add a \u0022\u003Cdegreesymbol\u003E\u0022. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/degreesymbol\u003E\n\nAlso, I think there is a typo in your layout: \u0022TextAnchor = EndRight\u0022 should be \u0022TextAnchor = LowerRight\u0022. It probably doesn\u0027t affect the layout all that much, but you\u0027ll prevent an exception from being thrown. I\u0027ll post a link to your layout on the front page! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-07T18:07:47Z\u0022 title=\u002206/07/2015 06:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Zeenobit**"}]}
