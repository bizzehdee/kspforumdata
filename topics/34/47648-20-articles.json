Anyway I will do a test to check this again.\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I cannot reproduce on my side... perhaps because the 1st stage\u0027s final TWR is not extremely high...\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETypically my designs are in the 1.4 to 1.8 TWR range. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think this is an issue at this point. After extensive play and testing, the mod appears to simulate the effect of G forces on the fuel. In the staging issue I talked about above, what was happening was that the 2nd stage TWR was much lower than the 1st stage, and hence when sepping there was a large G force differential (going from, say 1.9 TWR to 1.1) which amounts to negative g\u0027s on the fuel for a moment or two. When I reduce these terminal TWRs to match the initial TWR of the next stage, there are few if any ignite failures. Thanks for looking into it. Sorry for my ignorance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is an excellent mod btw, I really enjoy the challenge it provides, and am experiencing KSP in a whole new way.
