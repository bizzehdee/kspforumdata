I\u0027ve seen voices about not only adjusting all parameters so each planet has exactly the same radius etc. as their RL Sol counterparts but also moving planets arround. But it is NOT Solar system, it\u0027s the Kerbolar system, the home of Kerbals. Unless someone develops \u0022human mod\u0022 for KSP, I think scaling everthing up times ten, randomizing a tiny bit (bc perfect 6000km diameter is not believable but e.g 6129 is), tilting rotational axes randomly and adjusting orbital speeds/periods, rotational speeds and gravitational accelerations of planets so that they make sense for realistic densities is enough. When I saw the realitic kerbol system in add on development forum what I thought of was making Kerbol system reasonable not turning it into Sol. The problem with this game never was with Kerbals being in it but with ridicoulus body parameters, with e.g Kerbin having 600km diameter and at the same time having atmosphere and 1g on surface suggesting that it is made of dark mater or something.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
