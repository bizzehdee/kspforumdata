The stock survey contracts fulfill basically the same purpose, and it would be nice for everything to share the same behavior. It\u0027s easy to setup new types of surveys, and to limit them to certain experiments. The only issue is that they need those tiny little icons to indicate which experiment to perform at each waypoint. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am hoping that someone with more experience in creating tiny textures can help me out here. I don\u0027t necessarily need all of my experiments to be represented.
