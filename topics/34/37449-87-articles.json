It hits the right spot in terms of complexity/Kerbal fragility: it makes keeping Kerbals warm, fed, and breathing an important part of your mission plan, without turning the focus of the game from \u0022space exploration\u0022 to \u0022O2 meter management\u0022. If there were a Donate button (hint, hint) I would press it. Eagerly awaiting the 0.25-compatible update so I can run the same mod \u0022constellation\u0022 I used in 0.24.2, consisting of Karbonite, RT, MKS/OKS, ScanSat, and (of course) TACLS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do have one question/potential feature request.
