Metaphor\u0027s config isn\u0027t quite what I\u0027m after (no offence to anyone here) so I\u0027m doing my own. I thought the atmosphere settings were different in RSS to stock and if they are I want to use those or similar. Astrophysics, thermodynamics and any kind of real science related to this aren\u0027t my strong point but if I don\u0027t try I\u0027ll never learn now to do cool stuff like this \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-09T19:19:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe atmosphere of Earth is somewhat deeper, yes; this makes reentry easier rather than harder--more atmosphere to brake in.
