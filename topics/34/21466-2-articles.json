I can\u0027t find anything in the config files that would explain it, but I used to get \u0026gt;10km/s of vacuum delta V on my surveyor probes, and now I am lucky if i get 4km/s. all evidence in the config files would suggest that my fuel tanks should weigh even less now with the switch to xenon (.0005 density for arrrghon versus .0001 for xenon), so I would sorta expect to be getting slightly \u003Cem\u003Emore\u003C/em\u003E delta V now.
