The description given in the OP, is, I hesitantly assume, given in terms of how the reactors behave when hooked up to a thermal engine. I don\u0027t tend to use the thermal drives, so I\u0027m a bit confused. And because I tend to only use reactors for energy generation, what effect do the changes have on the energy density of the reactors, and their lifetimes?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll do a video soon.
