The amount of solid surface area is taken and mushed down into an equilateral square. All negative space due to hollow bits is considered and reduces the total area. Drag cube area is not simply a function of how tall and wide the face at that axis is. This number (the drag cube area) is most important for the Y\u002B and Y- because this axis is where stack nodes and the airflow direction apply nearly all of the time. Once the drag cube area is near identical for the Y faces across all parts in a given bulkhead profile (or a given stack, regardless of profile), this particular problem is squashed.\n\nThe matter of negative space is the reason why (for example) the Mk3 Expansion drone core should bring players an exceptional lot of trouble. I remember it having a lot of hollow area. Any cargo bays added by mods are the absolute worst as they only have their really thin side walls and practically don\u0027t exist in the Y axis view."},{"CreatedByName":"ztoundas","CreatedById":201417,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-19T23:49:11Z","Content":"[@JadeOfMaar](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/167617-jadeofmaar/) Thanks for the insight!  \n\nI noticed one of his .mu models (the MK2 battery) has multiple hollow components that together ultimately make a solid face from the Y ortho perspective, but also seems to have a bulkhead profile inconsistency in the drag cube (I think).

It will definitely complicate things. You will likely find the word \u0022procedural\u0022 in the drag cube entry for parts like this, and procedural drag cubes are something I have no experience with. Assuming its overall size never changes, you can get away with stopping this and giving it the same single settings as the next closest part by size."},{"CreatedByName":"ztoundas","CreatedById":201417,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-20T02:56:32Z","Content":"BAM\n\nSo I went through my plane in flight\u0027s drag values and found the stock crew cabin, MK2 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E segment and a few others had no YP and YN  values (I\u0027m guessing that\u0027s Y Positive and Y Negative) over 0.00. I am here assuming that meant they had no exposed areas where the Y faces of their drag boxes exposed. They looked like this (using the short \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E values, but highlighted values where the same across them):\n\n**cube = Default, 2.802,0.3552,1.292, 2.802,0.3552,1.292, 2.494,0.972,0.1627, 2.494,0.972,0.1627, 4.688,0.2036,0.7, 4.688,0.2036,0.7, 0,0,0, 2.5,1.875,1.5**  \n\nNow notice the original MK2 drone core\u0027s drag cube:\n\n**cube = Default, 0.3691,0.3524,1.324, 0.3691,0.3524,1.324, 2.004,0.9604,0.2241, 2.004,0.9604,0.2241, 0.6348,0.2035,0.7, 0.6348,0.2035,0.7, 0,-6.258E-07,7.461E-14, 2.5,0.25,1.5** \n\nand the original value for the MK2 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E Stability Module:  \n  \n**cube = Defaults, 0.1824,0.3659,1.313, 0.1824,0.3659,1.313, 2.122,0.9694,0.1825, 2.122,0.9694,0.1838, 0.293,0.2174,0.8097, 0.293,0.2165,0.8097, 2.682E-05,-0.0001838,4.172E-06, 2.5,0.1255,1.73**  \n\nSo I swapped the Y Area values of the irritating parts (in red) with the value (in green) from the appropriate part. I also did the next value, the Y coefficient, and while I am hazy on how it relates, I figured it wouldn\u0027t hurt. In the end I added a default corrected drag cube to the stock drone core and the mod\u0027s MK2 battery and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E Module.     \n\nThen I started the game and flew, matching speed and pitch. The action menus are going counter clockwise, starting with the top of the stack (other than the mk2 cockpit) being the drone core and ending with the MK2 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E fuselage:\n\n![cN3ZVKD.png](https://i.imgur.com/cN3ZVKD.png)"}]}
