That\u0027s a compatibility issue, since they both add the same nodes with the same IDs.\n\nIf you originally had two saved games using different tech trees thanks to Yonge\u0027s Plugin, or something like that, unfortunately now you\u0027ll have to make separate installs, each with one of your saved games (copy-paste).\n\nAnd don\u0027t worry, even though I\u0027m forcing the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E Tech Tree, any TechRequirement changes made by the ETT will overwrite any \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E patches made by other modders.

Ultimately it\u0027s a compatibility issue that should be resolved in the @TechTree edit patches. I don\u0027t think many mods add their own tech nodes anyway. KSP-IE changed to the CTT, you patched KW Rocketry, now SpaceY and maybe a handful of other mods just need to do the same.
