I\u0027m releasing my mod, PEST, for now. I will update it as I progress with some things. This mod basically gives two different probe cores for satellites or probes and a few new science parts, because you can never have too much science.\n\nParts in this mod:\n\nPods:\n\n**SP-X1-** Spherical probe core with attachments on both ends, making it useful inside stacks. A little more versatile.\n\n**GENSYS -** Probe core based off of the Dawn spacecraft. Hollow inside, allows you to store fuel or engines. Is equipped with full SAS, 20 units of monopropellant, and a 200 unit battery.\n\nUtility:\n\n**Probe Shock Absorber -** Based on the Venera probes, it\u0027s a heavy part that can help ensure your probe lands right side up. It also kind of helps with aerobraking.\n\nScience:\n\n**Coiled Antenna -** Long range, low energy antenna for spacecraft. Pretty simple, has attachment nodes on top and bottom.\n\n**Gas Chromatographer -** A small device that analyzes the chemical makeup of an atmosphere.\n\n**Planned/In-the-Works Parts/Features:**\n\nGRaND - Gamma Ray and Neutron Detector. Everything is finished but for some reason it doesn\u0027t perform the experiment in-game.\n\nOuter Planets Mod compatibility - Soon...\n\n![pestprelim.png](http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v68/MoviesColin/pestprelim.png)\n\n![Dawn%20Core.png](http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v68/MoviesColin/Dawn%20Core.png)\n\n**License:**\n\n*The folder PEST and all contents contained within are licensed under a* \n\n*Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.*\n\n*You may copy and redistribute, modify or change any of the contained files as long*\n\n*as credit is given to \u0022-ctn-\u0022 and \u0022Squad,\u0022 any changes to the original files*\n\n*are indicated, the material is not used for commercial purposes, and you use the*\n\n*same license.*\n\n*Thank you!*\n\n*-If you use these parts in another mod, please link me to it!*\n\nHopefully you guys enjoy this mod!
