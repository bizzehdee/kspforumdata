I originally thought that after researching a specific node, an upgrade would become available and you would have to right click the part in its original node and choose an upgrade option, or something.\n\nSince the node isn\u0027t empty, I\u0027ll keep those visible. I\u0027ll search for PARTUPGRADE modules, and add their techRequired fields to the list.\n\nEdit: By the way, I noticed that you have a part called Thermal Tubrojet in the advancedNuclearPropulsion node, but you also have an upgrade for that part in the same node. Is that intentional?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-21T09:47:14Z\u0022 title=\u002210/21/2016 09:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 21, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by ev0**"},{"CreatedByName":"FreeThinker","CreatedById":117389,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-21T13:00:27Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 3 hours ago, ev0 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Edit: By the way, I noticed that you have a part called Thermal Tubrojet in the advancedNuclearPropulsion node, but you also have an upgrade for that part in the same node.

\n\nThe errors are KSPX problems, more or less. It looks like KSPX adds tech nodes with IDs that are the same as some other mod (probably Community Tech Tree?). My mod doesn\u0027t account for duplicate IDs, so throws an error.\n\nHere\u0027s a fix using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E on the KSPX thread: [link](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/96464-11x-kspx-kerbal-stock-part-expansion-mod-reposted-v02101-20416/\u0026do=findComment\u0026comment=2844074).\n\nAs for the missing icon texture, if you download KSPX from SpaceDock it has a KSPX folder *and* a Squad folder. The missing textures are in the Squad folder, so make sure you install both folders. It doesn\u0027t overwrite anything, just adds the textures."},{"CreatedByName":"dtoxic","CreatedById":103573,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-16T06:13:12Z","Content":"hmmm, strange i do have that installed, will check more to see what\u0027s going on"},{"CreatedByName":"ev0","CreatedById":116691,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-19T17:59:36Z","Content":"**v0.7 Pre-release (testing appreciated)**\n\n**[Download from Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/a29yez4fh645etx/AAAh-M8eCwA6R5IWPEuSeLP3a?dl=1)**\n\nAfter finding out that the tech tree is used for a few more things than just visiting the R\u0026D center, I\u0027ve decided to change the workings of the mod from \u0022just visual\u0022 display changes to something that is more permanent to the behind the scenes of the game.
