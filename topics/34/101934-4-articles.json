Also, squad has tweeted/facebooked this mod at least twice, so there\u0027s a chance we might see some advanced-progression-ish contracts included in the 1.0 release. Also, it\u0027s likely that some of KSP\u0027s developer \u0027hooks\u0027 might change, so I anticipate an update to the Contract Configurator library is likely and squad has also said they are doing a rebalance pass on all the contract reward scales and part costs, so I\u0027ll need to adjust mine accordingly to \u0022match up\u0022 with stock.

RSS uses the Kerbalized names, so you don\u0027t have to worry about that. What you do need is:\n\n1. Don\u0027t assume a celestial body is in a specific place. In RSS, Minmus represents Uranus. So if you want to do a contract that says \u0022visit Kerbin\u0027s moons\u0022, then you can\u0027t hardcode them and need to do something like @targetBody.Children().\n2. Don\u0027t assume sizes of celestial bodies. For \u0022reach space\u0022 wouldn\u0027t be altitude = 70000, but altitude = @targetBody.AtmosphereAltitude().\n3. If you are using waypoints at all (as far as I know you\u0027re not), and they are meant to be relative to something (ie. a location in KSC), then use the PQS offset tool in the alt-f10 window instead of hardcoded lat/lon.\n\nThat\u0027s the main ones, although I\u0027m sure there\u0027s the potential for other little things.
