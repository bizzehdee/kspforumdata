Long time user first time poster. I was curious if you could give me a bit of advice. I don\u2019t have any logs because I\u2019m at work right now. My problem lays with the image for the agent in the contracts at KCP. Particularly the field research one. It\u2019s just a white box, but I can still take on contacts so functionality is still there. This is just purely an aesthetic thing.  I tried going in it and re-uploading the photo from the main page with the black background by cropping it, resizing, and then changing the file name as I saw on the CFG file that it had a logo URL and I put it in that folder but the box where the agent logo is at is still all white. Did I do this wrong or is there some other method of fixing this?  If I can do it myself I will. The only thing I can think I did wrong was the file I resized was the original so I didn\u2019t have a large image and then a resized, smaller one. I\u2019ll have to attempt that tonight but if that\u2019s not the case, then what would you suggest? Thank you for your time and help. Also, love your contracts!
