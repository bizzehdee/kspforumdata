I will soon be producing a flow diagram for the contract pack so that everything with its requirements will be clearly set out for anyone wondering when a certain program is accessible, with this latest update: \n\n- The shuttle ALT missions now need to be complete as well as the Skylab program before the STS missions will become available, the Vega program requires completion of SoyuzT-12, and the JWST, HSO and Kepler contracts require the completion of atleast STS-100.\n\nWith some more consideration I have decided to dedicate some time over the next few weeks to splitting the pack into decade eras as well as the complete release, this will allow anyone to play the missions from a given time period without having to have completed 380 contracts formerly - The JWST would require this currently. Just so that people do not get bored of this pack ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif).

The OMSK pack has a very good series of Redstone and Atlas rocket parts which should carry you into the early Gemini missions, beyond that FASA has a great set of parts for the later Gemini and Apollo missions (albeit at the expense of a slightly increased RAM usage).

The next update will focus on another overhaul of the Russian side of the pack, including some more Russian/USSR programs such as Zond, Foton and the enormous Luna series. I hope to also experiment with some tweaks to the MIR and Salyut expedition missions (a prelude to the ISS expeditions) just so that the station is not left unoccupied for gaps between missions. \n\nI will also begin focusing on separating the pack into modular packs for more freedom of choice for the user! \n\nEnjoy! \n\n![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"nightingale","CreatedById":119307,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T03:36:59Z","Content":"Congrats on your selection for [Modding Monday](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/125535)!"},{"CreatedByName":"Uml\u00FCx","CreatedById":69703,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T07:13:32Z","Content":"how is this working? do you have to have a STS mod installed for the missions to show up?"},{"CreatedByName":"xiombargdei","CreatedById":125757,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T13:25:38Z","Content":"110% what i was looking for. thanks"},{"CreatedByName":"dan2600","CreatedById":138534,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T15:32:39Z","Content":"this is an amazing mod. any tech tree to go with it?"},{"CreatedByName":"RickKermen","CreatedById":140020,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T15:43:28Z","Content":"Impressive!
