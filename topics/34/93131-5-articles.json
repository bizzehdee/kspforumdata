Using CKAN mod manager or even installing mods manually, this mod breaks the game on certain mods. As of now, when I install Mech Jeb, KW rocketry to name a few, the game breaks. I installed this mod first, then loaded up one or two mods, started the game, and once everything loads, its CTD. Im not complaining, just letting you know that this mod is not playing nice with a lot of other mods on my computer.

Close out of that and then go into the VAB or whatever else. And any other time you start to repeat-launch into Blacky Karman, go back to the Space Center and open the Tracking Station from the Center (ie don\u0027t use a quick button or just open the Map, actually go back to the full Space Center and then go to the Tracking Station). That has worked for me so far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@Duracelle: With this in mind, is it possible that info could help point out why the bug exists in the first place? Maybe sometimes the game sees Blacky Karman as the center of the universe and focuses on that instead of on Kerbin as a default location and spawns the ships inside of it, but opening the Tracking Station reminds the game that Mission Control on Kerbin should be the focus, which fixes it?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"coolmodi","CreatedById":25218,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-21T20:58:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have a strange problem now, at first this mod worked, but i made a mistake with EVE and i had to reinstall the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow i can\u0027t get this mod to work, i have the absolute same other mods as before!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen i now go into map view and scroll out, the screen will just start to shake more and more but there are no other planets.
