I\u0027ve found that the best approach is around 45-55 degrees (I usually choose 55), which stalls out all your wings and slows you down in a hurry. Things to be aware of, though:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. If your CoL is not bang on (or better, \u003Cem\u003Ein front of\u003C/em\u003E) your CoM in the VAB, hypersonic flight is going to pull it back far enough that your nose will drop without active countermeasures (RCS works pretty well).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. As atmospheric effects kick in but your aerilons are stalled out, you\u0027re very, very vulnerable to a spiral dive. Counteract with RCS or twist your aerilons to angle downwards so that they unstall faster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Canards work better than tails. Why? Because when they\u0027re stalled out they pull your CoL \u003Cem\u003Eway\u003C/em\u003E forward, hence allowing you to keep your nose up. Unstalling them can be tricky; I tend to give them a high enough deflection range that I can actually deflect them clear out of the stall regime whilst my main wings remain stalled. Gotta be really careful coming in for landing, though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spanier","CreatedById":57247,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-21T20:21:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewhat happend to the LV-1 engine, it doesn\u0027t work in space as it should (as predicted from MechJeb)?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ferram4","CreatedById":21328,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-21T20:59:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESpanier, FAR doesn\u0027t change anything with the LV-1; that\u0027s either a problem with another mod or MechJeb is wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spanier","CreatedById":57247,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-21T21:10:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eok, now that\u0027s weird, but I think I just wait up until 0.21 and restart everything\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"p1t1o","CreatedById":74091,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-21T21:53:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi all,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esorry if this is too much of a no0b question, I searched the thread and could only find a sideways reference to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI installed FAR and ended up with a lot of duplicate parts - not everything, but definitely the stock engines \u0026amp; SRBs, it also affected mod-added parts too with some B9 parts being duplicated too, and Im sure much more besides - this was the only reference to the problem I could find:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022taniwha\u0022 data-cite=\u0022taniwha\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt works (at least for rockets), but if you just naively install it, you\u0027ll wind up with a bunch of duplicate parts.

I\u0027ve followed the included instructions, unzipping the GameData and Ships folder into my KSP root folder and merging them with the folders already there. The new vehicles show up in the SPH and VAB no problem, but the FAR CAS button doesn\u0027t seem to exist, and neither does the in-flight UI.

I\u0027m guessing the more realistic portrayal of FAR combined with Kerbal\u0027s unrealistic scale means as long as you make correct, efficient and aerodynamic rockets or planes, they fly better, faster, and more stable than vanilla KSP.
