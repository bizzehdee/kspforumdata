Thanks for all your hard work!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECase-in-point: Tonight I was finishing up placing a class-C asteroid into 1600 km circular orbit with a new \u0022Asteroid Grabber\u0022, and to keep the debris count low, I always try to de-orbit the probe. So I get away from the asteroid, and do a burn that goes from 1600 km to -200 km. Guaranteed splat. As the probe enters the atmosphere (pro-grade) I notice the entry angle is very steep, so I fully expect my solar panels to shred, which they do. But I\u0027m screaming in at well over 2600 m/s, and seconds later, the whole ship breaks apart at the major seams! This is, like, four large chunks each (briefly) with their own plasma trails, plus about a dozen batteries which politely separate from one section, but maintain their radial orientation to each other. One piece explodes (which is where the batteries came off of). If you remember the video of Mir coming in over the Pacific Ocean, that\u0027s what this sequence looked like.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe remarkable thing about this is, I don\u0027t use Deadly Reentry. This broke up from FAR dynamics and simply exceeding the joint stress limits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was pretty, in a macabre sort of way. NOTE: No Kerbals were sacrificed in this death plunge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI managed to get three shots of the re-entry, including one with the explosion of the central tank section. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.fileswap.com/folder/2GzUq40k/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E FOLDER LINKY \u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"technogeeky","CreatedById":107155,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-06T05:25:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Aldmehr\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Aldmehr\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIs there any way to turn off individual functions of the maneuver planner?\u003Cp\u003EFor example, I never tend to use these:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-change both Pe and Ap\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-change semi-major axis\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-resonant orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-change longitude of ascending node\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand I get tired of clicking through them with the left and right arrows.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Enote:I do use the blacklist to turn off individual modules that I don\u0027t use such as the Rendezvous modules.

Use MJ where you can - for instance, you CAN use MJ to launch into the object\u0027s plane. You CAN use MJ to fine-tune that plane once you\u0027ve reached orbit. You CAN use MJ\u0027s maneuver node editor to play around with that first big intercept burn until you at least get an intercept within a couple hundred km\u0027s. You CAN use MJ\u0027s maneuver planner to execute that manually-plotted burn, and you CAN use it again to plot and execute a fine-tuning burn to get within a few hundred meters once you\u0027re en route. Once you\u0027re close to the target, you CAN still use SASS or any other module you want to help with the approach. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally I set the Navball to display the Target data, then just point retrograde at the target and slowly \u0022brake-steer\u0022 my retrograde marker onto the target marker until I\u0027m about 100m away and approaching at about 5 - 10 m/s. Then I\u0027ll rotate prograde and use RCS to make the final approach and capture. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, it might take practice but Quicksave is your friend. Once you learn to do it, it\u0027s no harder than anything else in KSP. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tassyr","CreatedById":42397,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-07T14:24:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LameLefty\u0022 data-cite=\u0022LameLefty\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ERead my reply to your question in the Questions forum.
