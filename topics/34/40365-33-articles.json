It is on Minmus, has 2 kerbals, and is powered. Yet when I activate \u0022do research\u0022 it animates but doesn\u0027t produce anything.

The science generation rate on Minmus is very slow (around 0.25/day) so don\u0027t expect to see the resource bar filling up while you watch. It will however continue to generate science if you switch to a different ship, so feel free to leave it running while you do other missions and when you come back to it, you might have some science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other thing to check is what are in the boxes when you right click on the science lab? The two boxes you need to check are the \u0022Power\u0022 box, does that one say \u00225.00 MW / 5.00 MW\u0022?, and the \u0022Science Rate\u0022 box, this should have a value/day in it.
