They are superior for eliminating heat from equipment cores, so when cooling ISRUs, reactors and the like, you will need fewer radiators. However, they have less overall surface area - this makes them poorer choices for radiating overall vessel heat.\n\n| \u003Cbr\u003E**Frequently Asked Questions**\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E**Q:** **Will you ever finish this?**  \u003Cbr\u003E**A:** I have plans for more parts eventually but very low priority\u003Cbr\u003E | \u003Cbr\u003E**Dependencies (Required and bundled)**\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EModuleManager\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EB9 Part Switch\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E**Tech Tree**\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThis pack is compatible with the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100385-Community-Tech-Tree-1-0\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003ECommunity Tech Tree\u003C/a\u003E, version 2.0\u002B.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIt places radiators in the Heat Management nodes.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E**Licensing**\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAll code and cfgs are distributed under the\u003Cspan\u003E MIT\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E License\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAll art assets (textures, models, animations) are distributed under an\u003Cspan\u003E \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAll Rights Reserved License.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAll bundled mods are distributed under their own licenses.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E |\n| --- | --- |\n\n| \u003Cbr\u003E**DownloadMirrors**\u003Cbr\u003E | \u003Cbr\u003E **[Primary (SpaceDock)](http://spacedock.info/mod/537/Heat%20Control?ga=%3CGame\u002B3102\u002B%27Kerbal\u002BSpace\u002BProgram%27%3E)  [Secondary (CurseForge)](http://kerbal.curseforge.com/projects/heat-control)**  \u003Cbr\u003E **[Tertiary (GitHub)](https://github.com/post-kerbin-mining-corporation/HeatControl/releases)**\u003Cbr\u003E |\n| --- | --- |\n\n[Issue Tracking and Source](https://github.com/post-kerbin-mining-corporation/HeatControl)\n\nIf you appreciate this project, please consider contributing to my caffeine addiction!

One example: the radiators are not passive radiators like they seem to be in Heat Management, they\u0027re active. This makes them generally more effective as they\u0027re attempting to pull heat away from the craft rather than just passively heating up \u0026 dispersing. There\u0027s also the heat pipe which lets you pull heat away from whatever the source is (reactor, NTR, MPD thruster) and send it off somewhere else to wherever you may have placed your radiators. Functionally you can do a bit more with Heat Management, but outside of having extendable radiators the two are probably very compatible with one another."},{"CreatedByName":"Nertea","CreatedById":83952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T16:57:24Z","Content":"Basically what Sierra said.

The models are absolutely first rate and the system is quite clever.\n\nUsing a 3.75m multinode heat sink and four XR-4500 Radiators, I successfully completed a 30 minute burn at full throttle (4 LV-N\u0027s) with no overheats. The cooldown time after the burn was ~40 minutes, but I actually missed the exact time. I was shooting for an hour to see what the temps were and noticed the entire ship was completely cool at the 40 minute mark. The radiators themselves were still quite hot.\n\nA 3.75m multinode heat sink and four large radiators from HM also successfully completed a 30 minute burn at full throttle. After 1 hour, temperatures had dropped to ~800. Overall temps were higher throughout.\n\nThere is a trade off in mass, but certainly worth it if you need to dissipate heat rapidly.\n\nI didn\u0027t bother to test them in conjuction with an AHMS unit because I\u0027m relatively sure that you could fly into the sun with some clever placement with this particular combo. \n\nTwo thumbs up!\n\nEdit: Just for giggles I tried the XR-4500\u0027s with a 3.75 AHMS unit. Heat equilibrium was achieved in the LV-N\u0027s at 2107.5 at around 13 minutes. You could literally burn forever.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-06T04:36:44Z\u0022 title=\u002206/06/2015 04:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Randazzo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Tankman101","CreatedById":144359,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T04:57:02Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E There\u0027s a mod for that too ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\u003E [KerboKatz](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/116034-1-0-2-KerboKatz-SmallUtilities-V1-1-12-04-06-2015-Now-with-PhysicalTimeRatioViewer!)\n\n[If you only want the temp-gauge fix](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/120731-1-0-2-Temperature-Gauge-Killer)\n\nAnyway nice work Nertea, looks like another mod on my list once I\u0027m no longer burned out on KSP!"}]}
