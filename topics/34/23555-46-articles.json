I made one pipe connection and started transferring fuel, and it started causing the two docked vessels to shake relative to each other. SAS and Smart A.S.S. were both off, but it seemed to amplify anyway. Kept coming back after timewarping to try to kill it too. Once during timewarp the refueling tanker\u0027s parts near the pipe connector all shifted out of position slightly during the warp, and snapped back afterwards. Hit a point where I COULDN\u0027T timewarp because it thought the ship was \u0027under acceleration\u0027. Stabilized it somewhat (ironically with the SAS), and had Bob emergency unlink(Unlink really needs to not be EVA-Only, I think.) The two parts went flying off away from each other and I burned quite a lot of monoprop getting close enough to try again. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI decided to try reinforcing the connection with struts. Ended up with the \u0027no attach pointer\u0027 problem, so I saved and reloaded to try to clear it. After reloading, Bob\u0027s jetpack didn\u0027t work. The thrusters would fire but imparted no movement. Right clicking on the strut connector brought up no menu. I couldn\u0027t recall what the \u0027drop part\u0027 button was since the controls are apparently undocumented, and just started pushing buttons. One of them worked, and the instant it detached it went flying away from Bob VERY fast, achieving several KM distance in a matter of seconds. It despawned at some point before I checked to see if it was orbiting the Mun, no idea why. After another save and reload, Bob\u0027s jetpack worked again and he was able to get back inside the pod with less than 30% fuel. The struts turned out not to be long enough anyway. The subsequent fuel transfer was successful, though I kept it short.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe tanker turned out to have somehow had its periapsis dropped by 5km in all this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter landing, partially refueling a craft on the ground, and heading back up to the refueling tanker, the craft once more tried to pipe-dock with the refueling tanker. I decided to bring it in closer and better aligned on the fuel pipe connector, almost like docking normally, and see if that helped the shaking. I hit \u0027link\u0027 on the first pipe connector while Bob was still on the ladder. There was instantly a very violent kick. I don\u0027t know precisely what happened, but bob was sent spinning off one way, the main body of the plane another, and the cockpit of the plane a third. The front end of the refueling tanker was also broken off the main body of it, but floating stably a short distance in front of the main body. The Mechjeb unit on it was set to KillRot at the time, so it may have auto-stabilized it (it had a large probe core and a large ASAS and could\u0027ve stabilized very quickly with the fuel tanks broken off.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: New attempt of that last resulted in a similar effect, only this time only when I activated the second half of the link, to the refueling tanker. the tanker was instantly torn in half approximately at the connection point, parts sent flying all over. Bob went flying.
