The fuel gets bombarded by charged particles and some of that is gonna stick. Also, remember that NERVA, as a spacecraft engine, had to be rather light, meaning that it could also potentially activate air around it (due to much lighter shielding), which is more vulnerable to this than hydrogen. Hydrogen exhaust, after dispersing in the air, could also decay and activate more vulnerable molecules. The results would certainly be detectable, though the actual dose from a single test would be rather low. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, that only applies to hydrogen-powered nuke engines (NERVA was one, as was RD-0440), if you feed it ammonia, helium, atmospheric air or some other fuel, your results could be much less environment-friendly. In fact, there was an idea to use a nuclear ramjet as a weapon that would irradiate the enemy territory by flying over it. The amount of neutrons hitting the coolant is very high inside the reactor, that\u0027s why the exhaust velocity is so incredible.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"frizzank","CreatedById":57210,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-13T23:10:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo I got a chance to actually play KSP and I came up with this gem the other night.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts Rescue Big G in a shuttle configuration with a makeshift docking bay (MOL equipment part).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt took a bit to figure out the engine configuration but once I did it flew rather well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/l3JWRuZ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022l3JWRuZ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xS7Cg23.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022xS7Cg23.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cdodders","CreatedById":85280,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-14T07:51:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022frizzank\u0022 data-cite=\u0022frizzank\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo I got a chance to actually play KSP and I came up with this gem the other night.\u003Cp\u003EIts Rescue Big G in a shuttle configuration with a makeshift docking bay (MOL equipment part).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt took a bit to figure out the engine configuration but once I did it flew rather well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/l3JWRuZ.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/l3JWRuZ.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xS7Cg23.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/xS7Cg23.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAwesome, just awesome\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"aeTIos","CreatedById":17032,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-14T08:04:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd that\u0027s why I love FASA: It\u0027s still stock-sized so you can go nuts with combining stuff!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tmikesecrist3","CreatedById":99603,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-14T08:19:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThats true in fact I am finding the Agina to be really versatle\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MaverickSawyer","CreatedById":11952,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-14T08:28:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAgena has turned out to be a surprisingly flexible package...

I could make a perfect replica of a historic launch tower but it would be completely static and only good for a specific rocket. The launch clamps have some weird restrictions on how they are built, and I would like people to use for more than one specific pre-made vehicle. The mesh and texture for the tower have to be square. The mesh stretches and the texture is tiled as it goes up, and this launch complex would work well for that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do however plan to make swing arms for fuel and electricity so you could if you wanted to load a completely empty rocket on the pad and fill it up with fuel, Kerbals and whatnot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/Apollo_5_on_pad.jpg/447px-Apollo_5_on_pad.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/Apollo_5_on_pad.jpg/447px-Apollo_5_on_pad.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose fuel arms would be truly epic \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MaverickSawyer","CreatedById":11952,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-14T18:45:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022tmikesecrist3\u0022 data-cite=\u0022tmikesecrist3\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eform my experince the main engin burns out befor the Mono perpellent engin.... right now what I am testing is if I can use Agina to help build my space station....\u003Cp\u003EI just ran into a porble.... with the Gemini\u0027s docking nose cone only dock with the docking port on agina?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt can also dock with another Gemini nose cone, or with the Clamp-o-tron Jr. Doesn\u0027t work with the Clamp-o-tron or the APAS-69 from Kosmos.
