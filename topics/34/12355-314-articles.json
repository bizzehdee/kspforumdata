Instead of doing a Hohmann transfer, it shows a plot of all possible transfers (within a reasonable period) and their deltaV, the cheapest transfer is selected by default but you can pick another one if you\u0027re in a hurry: the X axis is the departure date and the Y axis is the transfer duration, the exact values for the dates and the deltaV are shown under the plot. Also because it actually uses the Lambert solver, the transfer actually reaches the target instead of requiring a course correction.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis improves the calculation of the transfer orbit injection maneuver node, but you will still likely need a course correction. I imagine MechJeb2 still isn\u0027t doing a power-track calculation, that is calculating the accelerated track under thrust on your spacecraft flying the node. It\u0027s still likely assuming the maneuver is a point impulse to change the orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, as usual, check to see if you need a course correction after every long burn and SoI change.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
