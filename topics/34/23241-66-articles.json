I discovered and really loved the previous B9 aerospace mod, but I\u0027ve run into a spot of trouble trying to download this new release. I\u0027m running windows 8, and I tried to install the mod as bac9 instructed. No matter what I tried, I could not get all the parts to appear. I\u0027m missing structural elements, fuselages, and fuel tanks, all of which are pretty much necessary to build the planes that come with this mod. Could someone here maybe help walk me through installing the mod successfully? If you could, that would be really appreciated. Thanks for any help in advance guys.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Blizzardofoz123","CreatedById":69865,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-08T18:41:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey guys...
