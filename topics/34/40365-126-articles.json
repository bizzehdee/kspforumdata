Just to keep it challenging I only use it for magical refueling on Kerbin. Still need to get it into orbit. And I don\u0027t have a problem with collecting resources beyond Kerbin. That would just be a reality of any sustainable early space program, IRL, if traveling to other planets with live people and wanting to return without building a super-sized interplanetary vehicle. I\u0027m also using the Orbital Construction mod as an intermediate step between full blown extra-Kerbin resource gathering, and construction. Still need to get resources up to the warehouse, but once I have my local tug (too big to move from Kerbin\u0027s surface with its 4 3.5m reactors and 4 3.5m thermal rockets) I\u0027ll move all resource gathering over to Mun or Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BananaDealer","CreatedById":60684,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-11T18:24:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022BrickedKeyboard\u0022 data-cite=\u0022BrickedKeyboard\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ECould you use antimatter \u002B outside air or antimatter \u002B water to get enough thrust for liftoff?

For example, instead of being able to use thermal rocket systems to travel to and mine fissionable materials and then return them to KSC, we\u0027d have to use primarily stock ships to mine the materials and return them. Say if the best place to mine uranium is on Tylo (completely randomly chosen example). If I\u0027m using a thermal rocket to travel there, mine, and return to Kerbin, I would want it to be reasonably easy to carry enough materials back to replace the nuke fuel spent on the trip as well as having a decent profit of materials left over to be used to refuel other nuke reactors. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d want to be able to use my max tech level parts to efficiently supply my economy for those parts. I\u0027m also not a fan of doing a whole lot of resource collecting on Kerbin. I want that to be an option if needed, to be sure, just not a required gameplay element of KSPI. Anything I can easily procure myself right at KSC, I generally just mod those resources to be full from the get go. 1% for Antimatter tanks and full for the D/T tanks. I like that the ability for IS resource gathering has soooo many options (one of the reasons I love this mod so much is massive freedom of choice), I just don\u0027t want to have to clutter up the space center with a bunch of infrastructure that could reasonably be managed by the fictional other Kerbal companies referenced by NotCoach. With the upcoming tweakables in .23, KSPI might be able to accommodate both playstyles. I think both playstyles of having your space program manage all resources used by the space program (most non-stock tanks start empty) and having some (think D and T and Lithium) managed by other Kerbin companies and thus start full in the VAB/SPH are both completely valid. Some people enjoy one or the other far more and that is perfect. If I had a faster computer, I\u0027d probably want the extra challenge of managing space center based resource infrastructure.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fractal_UK","CreatedById":61595,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-11T19:22:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI actually need to make a change to the DT tank to fill up the Deuterium resource from the start.
