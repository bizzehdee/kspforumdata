Also i need to finalize and comment the code since that will be released along side every version, and i will also correlate all the assets sources, since i remade most in game icons at much larger sizes to accommodate larger resolutions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote: It \u003Cem\u003Edoesn\u0027t\u003C/em\u003E make any changes to part files, it merely parses them and places them at your fingertips.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, since i dumped so much time in to this, and i can finally see the finish line on the project, i thought i may as well share this little preview with you all, in the hope for some feedback and questions. Please be aware though, i haven\u0027t been programming long, having only started to learn around 6 months ago, also, this is my first post here on KSP forum, please be gentle!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"001","CreatedById":211991,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-06-13T22:56:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomething i realized early on, extracting a parts title from a .cfg is an utter nightmare, since more often than not, they will return something like:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode prettyprint lang-html prettyprinted\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022pln\u0022\u003Etitle = #autoLOC_500385\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is for the sake of localization off course, after some trying though i worked out it was just a matter of making an index of all the localization\u0027s into a more accessible .INI type file, this way i was easily able the correctly retrieve the full titles and present them in the tree view.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince i wanted to show an easily browseable tree view on launch, the first launch builds an index of any found localisaion\u0027s, which is used from then on-wards, or until the part count changes.

Just a small question regarding the mod, does it only act as a parts list to check on information regarding specific parts or can you modify parts lists by moving or deleting parts. I know a couple of old mods I play with have parts that are no longer compatible and while I can just go into the mod\u0027s folders and delete the parts manually a tool to help do this would be extremely helpful. If this isn\u0027t the case I\u0027m still looking forward to your first release.
