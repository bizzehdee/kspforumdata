After installing the latest KJR from the SpacePort (\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/kerbal-joint-reinforcement/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/kerbal-joint-reinforcement/\u003C/a\u003E) I can\u0027t launch any craft anymore.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat happens is that when I launch a simple craft (Pod -\u0026gt; Fuel -\u0026gt; Engine) the engine fires but the craft doesn\u0027t move an inch. When I launch another craft (Pod || -\u0026gt; SBS || Fuel || SBS -\u0026gt; Engine) the same happens. When I decouple the SBS (while still firing) they lift off, flying away. When I then decouple the Pod while the main Engine is still firing, they (Tank \u002B Engine) go through the Pod and the Pod sticks in the air, not dropping down, nothing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I open the Debug-Console (Alt\u002BF2) I see alot of red \u0022NullPointerReference\u0022 errors and in between some other exceptions saying \u0022Could not load PartJoint\u0022, which is a reference to the KJR plugin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I remove KJR everything works fine again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThats my mod (directory) listing:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E09.02.2014  10:00    \u0026lt;DIR\u0026gt;          000_Toolbar\u003Cbr\u003E13.02.2014  00:15    \u0026lt;DIR\u0026gt;          ActionGroupManager\u003Cbr\u003E01.04.2014  23:52    \u0026lt;DIR\u0026gt;          B9_Aerospace\u003Cbr\u003E31.01.2014  21:45    \u0026lt;DIR\u0026gt;          BoJaN\u003Cbr\u003E02.04.2014  00:03    \u0026lt;DIR\u0026gt;          BoulderCo\u003Cbr\u003E31.01.2014  21:45    \u0026lt;DIR\u0026gt;          CrewManifest\u003Cbr\u003E01.02.2014  18:34    \u0026lt;DIR\u0026gt;          DeadlyReentry\u003Cbr\u003E02.04.2014  22:04    \u0026lt;DIR\u0026gt;          Engineer\u003Cbr\u003E06.02.2014  06:32    \u0026lt;DIR\u0026gt;          EnhancedNavBall\u003Cbr\u003E01.02.2014  17:01    \u0026lt;DIR\u0026gt;          EVALoading\u003Cbr\u003E01.04.2014  23:51    \u0026lt;DIR\u0026gt;          ExsurgentEngineering\u003Cbr\u003E01.02.2014  16:23    \u0026lt;DIR\u0026gt;          FerramAerospaceResearch\u003Cbr\u003E02.04.2014  00:03    \u0026lt;DIR\u0026gt;          Firespitter\u003Cbr\u003E02.04.2014  00:00    \u0026lt;DIR\u0026gt;          GenesisRage\u003Cbr\u003E01.02.2014  15:19    \u0026lt;DIR\u0026gt;          HexCans\u003Cbr\u003E31.01.2014  21:46    \u0026lt;DIR\u0026gt;          HrmHaystack\u003Cbr\u003E31.01.2014  21:51    \u0026lt;DIR\u0026gt;          KAS\u003Cbr\u003E31.01.2014  21:46    \u0026lt;DIR\u0026gt;          Keramzit\u003Cbr\u003E31.01.2014  21:40    \u0026lt;DIR\u0026gt;          Kethane\u003Cbr\u003E01.04.2014  23:51    \u0026lt;DIR\u0026gt;          KineTechAnimation\u003Cbr\u003E04.02.2014  01:09    \u0026lt;DIR\u0026gt;          KSPCalendar\u003Cbr\u003E07.02.2014  01:53    \u0026lt;DIR\u0026gt;          KWRocketry\u003Cbr\u003E08.02.2014  10:31    \u0026lt;DIR\u0026gt;          MagicSmokeIndustries\u003Cbr\u003E23.02.2014  16:39    \u0026lt;DIR\u0026gt;          Nereid\u003Cbr\u003E31.01.2014  21:46    \u0026lt;DIR\u0026gt;          NewHorizons\u003Cbr\u003E31.01.2014  21:46    \u0026lt;DIR\u0026gt;          RBR\u003Cbr\u003E07.02.2014  01:49    \u0026lt;DIR\u0026gt;          RemoteTech2\u003Cbr\u003E01.04.2014  23:51    \u0026lt;DIR\u0026gt;          ResGen\u003Cbr\u003E31.01.2014  21:46    \u0026lt;DIR\u0026gt;          SelectRoot\u003Cbr\u003E31.01.2014  21:24    \u0026lt;DIR\u0026gt;          Squad\u003Cbr\u003E31.01.2014  21:47    \u0026lt;DIR\u0026gt;          StationScience\u003Cbr\u003E04.02.2014  23:08    \u0026lt;DIR\u0026gt;          ThunderAerospace\u003Cbr\u003E01.02.2014  15:19    \u0026lt;DIR\u0026gt;          TreeLoader\u003Cbr\u003E11.02.2014  19:20    \u0026lt;DIR\u0026gt;          TriggerTech\u003Cbr\u003E31.01.2014  21:47    \u0026lt;DIR\u0026gt;          UbioWeldingLtd\u003Cbr\u003E01.02.2014  16:46    \u0026lt;DIR\u0026gt;          VNG\u003Cbr\u003E01.02.2014  15:19    \u0026lt;DIR\u0026gt;          WarpPlugin\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone any idea?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ferram4","CreatedById":21328,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-02T20:28:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKJR v2.2 is not backwards compatible.
