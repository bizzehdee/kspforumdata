For me, the problem was I was using a part who\u0027s IVA I had deleted, but the part was still calling that IVA as I hadn\u0027t changed the part\u0027s cfg. It seems that KSP doesn\u0027t like a part calling out to an IVA that doesn\u0027t exist and that causes issues like the ones you described. Not sure if this is your exact issue but it\u0027s probably worth taking a look at. Try reinstalling the kso pack and see if that helps.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Winterbottom","CreatedById":120558,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-07T15:29:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy game crashes on loading after installing all-in-one pack.
