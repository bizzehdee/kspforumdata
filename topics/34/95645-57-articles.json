SETIctt adds a 160km omni antenna to all command modules. However, due to what (as far as I can tell) is a bug in Remotetech, that new antenna takes over any animations the capsule may have. If you\u0027ve installed the SETI modpack, you\u0027ll notice this immediately with the window lighting added by Ven\u0027s Stock Revamp. When an antenna is not provided the index of an animation module, it\u0027s supposed to not use any of them. Instead, it\u0027s attaching to ALL of them. This can be seen with Ven\u0027s replacement cupola which has two animations; one to toggle the window shutters, and one to toggle the window lights. As-is, the 160km omni antenna will attach to both of these things and you loose control over them. Turning the antenna on/off opens and closes the shutters and toggles the lights.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemote tech allows two broad categories of antenna: Active and passive. Actual antenna and dish parts are active, and passive antennas are what makes that \u0022tech perk\u0022 where your probe cores can be given built-in 3km antennas (in stock Remotetech)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPassive antennas are always on and cannot be turned off, but they only consume power when transmitting science. However, SETI\u0027s active 160km antenna isn\u0027t being set to consume any power either, so I made them be passive antennas instead to get around the animation issue (since passive antennas can\u0027t have animations). There\u0027d be no reason to turn them off since they weren\u0027t consuming power anyway and I never do, personally.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELong term, what would need to happen is the built in antennas SHOULD consume power (so there\u0027s a reason to turn them off), and Remotetech has a bug to fix.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rokanov","CreatedById":149722,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-18T00:58:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGreat explanation, thanks!

I suppose you can add crash tolerance on that. I rarely will consider it since I try not to crash. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInteresting info on the Apollo and Mercury. Definitely does look like they modeled after those pods. Sadly many of the extra features the Apollo CM has aren\u0027t on the Mk1-2, like integrated parachutes, advanced navigation, integrated heatshield, significant life support and various other things. Though that really just goes back to there isn\u0027t a lot to differentiate between pods. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe last point I would make is that as you said, KSP isn\u0027t real life and when it comes down to it, squad needs to (and in many cases has) balance for gameplay. If you can take 3 MK1 pods to get the same number of crew and save 1.6t then there is a balance issue. I could get behind the MK1-2 being heavier overall, but an additional 1.6t is a little much IMHO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah love that show! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Garibaldi is one of my all time favorite characters.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"goldenpsp","CreatedById":113874,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-23T18:51:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Svm420\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Svm420\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESee that is a poor way to gauge balance when parts are all massively heavier in KSP cause we play at toy scale.
