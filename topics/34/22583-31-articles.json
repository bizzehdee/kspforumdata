Three prime examples would be fighter jets, which use it to pull tighter corners, large cargo planes and bombers, who if they suffer failure of one of their engines need to be able to adjust the throttles of the others to keep the plane flying straight, and VTOL\u0027s and quadcopters, who use it to keep them from spinning out of control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEDIT:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E OH! and B2 bombers, as they have no stabilizing fins, using varying throttles to stabilize instead.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-08T17:19:21Z\u0022 title=\u002211/08/2013 05:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 8, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Tanya Sapien\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snjo","CreatedById":57198,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-08T17:12:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Aranthos\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Aranthos\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFeature request tiem!\u003Cp\u003EThe engines work amazingly well for the vertical part of a VTOL\u0027s flight, but I\u0027ve got some ideas on how to improve VTOL steering\u0027s usefulness in forward flight.

At the moment it\u0027s not perfect but does allow for some degree of flight where in normal KSP you\u0027d be unrealistically spinning towards the ground. KSP is goofy in this respect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB2\u0027s also use computer controlled drag flaps (AKA split-rudders) at the ends of the wings which help keep it flying in the intended direction.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-08T18:03:12Z\u0022 title=\u002211/08/2013 06:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 8, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by InfiniteDice\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tanya Sapien","CreatedById":58405,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-08T18:36:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022InfiniteDice\u0022 data-cite=\u0022InfiniteDice\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EB2\u0027s also use computer controlled drag flaps (AKA split-rudders) at the ends of the wings which help keep it flying in the intended direction.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did not know that.
