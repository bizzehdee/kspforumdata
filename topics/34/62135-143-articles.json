The only thing that goes wrong as it seems I always land in the night, but that\u0027s not too big of a deal. There is a visual glitch though. I tend to land quite hard in the Super 25 since it is quite bad at gliding, and it seems the force dislodges one of the main gear and makes the top of the gear part poke out of the top of the wing a bit.
