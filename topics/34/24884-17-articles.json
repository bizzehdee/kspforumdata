From there I\u0027d run the tests.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETest 1: Straight up timewarp at maximum speed with the capsule scrubber enabled. Result: 25 days and 12 hours before dropping out of time warp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETest 2: Recycler enabled from the start at maximum capacity. Result: 25 days and 16 hours before dropping time warp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can quite clearly see that the recycler isn\u0027t doing much...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy first hypothesis was that because the CO2 tank stayed empty during time warp this was messing with the calculation (because it didn\u0027t have the juice on a iteration to iteration basis or whatever).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETest 3: Time warp at maximum until the CO2 tank was half full. At that point I switched on the recycler and fiddled with the capacity until it was consuming 1.6 CO2 per hour (so it wouldn\u0027t drain the CO2 tank). Result: 25 days and 14 hours before I was both out of O2 and CO2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yea, that wasn\u0027t it. So I decided to check if timewarp itself was the issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETest 4: Time warp at maximum until the CO2 tank was half filled. At this point I switched on the recycler at maximum capacity and timewarped at x1000. Once my CO2 tank was empty I switched off the recycler and time warped at maximum until I had a decent supply of CO2 to recycle at x1000. Rinse and repeat until I was out. Result: 35 days and 22 hours before I was out. So not the 2 times duration you would expect, but a significant step up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo it seems that time warp messes up the calculations for recyclers. Probably floating point errors (space kraken but with time). I suspect that you\u0027d actually get the full duration increase when you stick to slow time warp (or physical time warp).
