Hence you pay for recovery instead of getting funds.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \\* so far havent seen this in pure stock, but definitely with part switcher such as CC, IFS and WildBlue mods\n\u003E \n\nI\u0027m having the same exact problem. MKS Kontainers and IFS tanks, when recovered, are worth substantially negative money, but only if you switch from the default resource to another resource. Somehow, tank switchers like B9, Firespitter, and IFS appear to mess up the game\u0027s price calculations of the tank/cargo container\u0027s value. This isn\u0027t very obvious with cheaper fuels, but for something like liquid helium-3, it can instantly drain your coffers of a million credits or more. My current workaround, if you can call it that, is to just use the money cheat equal to the amount that vanished into the ether."},{"CreatedByName":"FreeThinker","CreatedById":117389,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-02-13T11:39:49Z","Content":"new feature: Powered Resource Transfer\n\n![F2MVVnt.png](https://i.imgur.com/F2MVVnt.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"Tacombel","CreatedById":191092,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-02-13T12:14:48Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 33 minutes ago, FreeThinker said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E new feature: Powered Resource Transfer\n\u003E \n\nWould this work as an automatic ship refueler as soon as I dock if a select a higher priority for the ship containers? ![:o](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/ZNGIcon2.png \u0022:o\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"FreeThinker","CreatedById":117389,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-02-13T12:16:10Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Just now, Tacombel said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Would this work as an automatic ship refueler as soon as I dock if a select a higher priority for the ship containers? ![:o](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/ZNGIcon2.png \u0022:o\u0022)\n\u003E \n\nYes it flow from low to high priority.
