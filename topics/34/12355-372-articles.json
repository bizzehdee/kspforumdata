That\u0027s why you have to do a normal non-rendezvous ascent with it first from Kerbin for it to work there initially. I believe you can force it to learn by saving, \u0022Mark\u0022ing the launch and complete the ascent then reload that save and launching to rendezvous.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, in my particular case it seems more troublesome than useful, so I don\u0027t want and most probably won\u0027t do it.

The launch must occur when the target orbit is almost directly overhead, which only happens twice a day (and days are looong on Laythe). The odds are very much against the target being in the right position for a direct rendezvous at one of those exact times. Best to just launch into the plane of the target and rendezvous after orbit is established.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T13:48:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sarbian\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sarbian\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI had to revert one of the codez change after I noticed an error.
