I made the larger capacitors hold greater amounts of Megajoules and have faster rates of conversion. Since the kethane converter module auto-stops if the target resource is full, I simply add two kethane converters that convert at the same rate in opposite directions - as long as there is sufficient inflow of electriccharge, the excess goes straight into megajoules.
