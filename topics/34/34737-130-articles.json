Basically, it was completely unrelated to the actual mod and was a conflict of some sort stemming from module manager. I know this may sound silly but just do a search on your GameData folder for ModuleManager. The last time I had this happen it was because another mod had a module manager file inside of its folder, not in the actual GameData folder (not Porkjets, I was on a mod installing spree at the time) so wasn\u0027t immediately easy to spot. It could be as simple as that, it certainly sounds extremely similar to the behaviour I experienced.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"johnwayne1930","CreatedById":79033,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-16T20:28:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E0.15b works fine for me now, no laggs anymore.
