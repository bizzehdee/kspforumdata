With the helper, the mechjeb buttons would be always visible in the toolbar once you\u0027ve configured them, but now that the helper\u0027s been folded into the main mechjeb dll, you need to manually open mechjeb from it\u0027s tab on the right of the screen before the buttons will appear in the toolbar. I haven\u0027t made up my mind yet if this is a bug or not (I can see the new behavior making sense from a certain point of view), but it is definitely different to the way it used to be. It\u0027s especially apparent in the VAB, where you won\u0027t see any buttons on the toolbar until you\u0027ve placed the AR202 or the mechjeb capsule, which causes the MJ tab to appear at the edge of the screen, and when you open the tab then the buttons appear. Yes, I\u0027ve made sure that I\u0027m running up to date builds of the toolbar and MJ (checked 10 minutes ago) and that I deleted the configs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and thanks Sarbian for a great autopilot.
