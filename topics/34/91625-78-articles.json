A Contract Configurator contract can range from extremely simple (see WhiteCat\u0026#39;s [URL=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/123453\u0022]Historic Missions[/URL]) to very complex/dynamically generated (see my [URL=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/123892\u0022]Field Research[/URL]) - what would the target complexity be? Would you have specific agencies with specific \u0022types\u0022 of contracts? In that case, one could argue that it\u0026#39;s better to have those as separate contract packs, but maybe it makes sense to combine if they\u0026#39;re not strong enough to stand on their own.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe other issue I forsee is that unlike something like Crowd Sourced Science, there\u0026#39;s a bigger barrier to entry. If I wanted to contribute to CSS, I just need to pick a Body/Experiment combination and write a blurb. Although I\u0026#39;ve tried to make Contract Configurator simple to pick up, some people may not want to invest the time.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnyway, not saying that it\u0026#39;s a bad idea, just that I foresee difficulties. Kudos to you if you can make it work.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nightingale","CreatedById":119307,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-24T04:59:19Z","Content":"\nNew release, [URL=\u0022https://github.com/jrossignol/ContractConfigurator/releases/tag/1.8.2\u0022]download now[/URL]!\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[I]This release marks the 1 year anniversary of Contract Configurator (close enough, considering the forums will most likely still be down on the actual anniversary).
