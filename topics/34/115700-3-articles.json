But must have a variable somewhere that tells it that has already done the adjustment, so that it wont keep doing it...  \n\nIs there any way to add such a check to NodeHelper?  \n\nEDIT: Actually, I think NodeHelper should also divide the node defs by the rescale factor, to put them back to what they would be at a rescale factor of 1.0, BEFORE it writes them to the \\_NH.cfg... ??  \n\nI have different sized versions of the same exact part, and the node defs are all set for ONE version at the 1.05 rescale, and the others use the SAME node defs, but then get rescaled automatically by KSP...  \n\nLMK if I\u0027m not making sense, and I need to re-explain...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-21T14:34:55Z\u0022 title=\u002205/21/2016 02:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 21, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Stone Blue**"},{"CreatedByName":"Felbourn","CreatedById":97344,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-21T15:24:00Z","Content":"Are you saying you want this mod to interact with TweakScale?

Sometimes I have needed to change the node\\_stack values by hand before I begin working, but that\u0027s easy with an Excel spreadsheet.
