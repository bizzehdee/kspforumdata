If research cost were tied to \u0022difficulty,\u0022 I hope it would scale. Kopernicus allows not only for modded planet packs, but also the repositioning of Kerbin itself. In my career, Kerbin starts as a moon of a gas giant that is two planets further out than Jool -- this planet is roughly an analog to Uranus, I think. I\u0027d hope that any cost-scaling would be able to reflect new readings, since Minmus is now way down near Moho, I think.\n\nMaybe scale the cost with distance from the telescope. Doing it that way would allow you to deploy it in other orbits for reduced science cost for those really far out planets."},{"CreatedByName":"RA3236","CreatedById":150734,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-16T21:10:20Z","Content":"Quick question, what happens if you manage to enter, for example, Minmus\u0027 SOI before you discover it?"},{"CreatedByName":"simon56modder","CreatedById":119640,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-17T06:51:16Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Quick question, what happens if you manage to enter, for example, Minmus\u0027 SOI before you discover it?\n\nFor now nothing happens but it would be great to auto-discover it."},{"CreatedByName":"Walker","CreatedById":103329,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-17T07:48:51Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E For now nothing happens but it would be great to auto-discover it.\n\nYes this would be amazing with addition of some new scientific instruments.
