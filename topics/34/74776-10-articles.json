The general consensus from other modders was that when too many individual game objects exist, a large number of position checks take place (as the KSP system is moved round the vessel) that result in physics lag. To rectify this it would be necessary to merge the separate game objects in Unity into a single game object, therefore reducing the number of position checks to 1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter finishing up the latest update to KerbinSide, I tested KSP\u0027s \u0027physics handling\u0027 pretty intensively and have come to the conclusion that merging the individual objects into a single game object has made \u003Cstrong\u003Eno bloody difference what-so-ever\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I\u0027ll add this to the OP and leave it to players to decide whether they can live with hideous physics lag when warping vessels at speeds of 750\u002B ms.

I.e., if the merged objects still contain the same amount of collision boxes, then nothing is gained - and if it doesn\u0027t even use collision-boxes as a pre-filter, then matters are even worse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, to do collision checks efficiently in such a case, there would need to be multiple levels of collision boxes: First you check large areas, then gradually smaller ones - powers of two, you know the drill. Question is: Is Unity/KSP even capable of this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT2: If unity only allows one level of collision boxes, the both extremes attempted thus far would be inefficient: If you put a collision box around every individual thing, there will be too many boxes.
