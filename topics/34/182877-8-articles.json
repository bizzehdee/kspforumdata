From then, the player can decide to sell the recovered parts right away (earning yet more money during the transaction)\u00A0or,\u00A0 before selling them, he ca re-use them a number of times for the building of other vessels. As noted by you, the player will still pay the full money amount for the used parts included in his new projects, but he will spare building time. I am not sure whether there is a limit to the number of times used parts can be recycled, but if OhScrap! is installed together with SY, it is likely that after several reuses the recycled parts will\u00A0become so prone to failure that the player will discard/sell them\u00A0way before their\u00A0theoretical max recycle limit is reached.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nConversely, when the \u0027override funds\u0027 option is checked, recovered vessels\u00A0will still add parts to the inventory, but the player won\u0027t receive any cash on their recovering; on the contrary, he will get\u00A0to pay an amount\u00A0proportional to the distance of their recovering location relative to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. Again, it will be on the player deciding when to sell the recently acquired inventory parts (thus earning money) and how many times he wants to recycle them. Unlike the previous point, recycling used parts will make the player to spare money as well as building time, but that doesn\u0027t mean that their re-use will be cost-free. As a matter of fact,\u00A0the player will still have to pay some money for their reconditioning, but it will be only a fraction of the money he would have payed\u00A0 had he used\u00A0completely new parts.

From then, the player can decide to sell the recovered parts right away (earning yet more money during the transaction)\u00A0or,\u00A0 before selling them, he ca re-use them a number of times for the building of other vessels. As noted by you, the player will still pay the full money amount for the used parts included in his new projects, but he will spare building time. I am not sure whether there is a limit to the number of times used parts can be recycled, but if OhScrap! is installed together with SY, it is likely that after several reuses the recycled parts will\u00A0become so prone to failure that the player will discard/sell them\u00A0way before their\u00A0theoretical max recycle limit is reached.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nConversely, when the \u0027override funds\u0027 option is checked, recovered vessels\u00A0will still add parts to the inventory, but the player won\u0027t receive any cash on their recovering; on the contrary, he will get\u00A0to pay an amount\u00A0proportional to the distance of their recovering location relative to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. Again, it will be on the player deciding when to sell the recently acquired inventory parts (thus earning money) and how many times he wants to recycle them. Unlike the previous point, recycling used parts will make the player to spare money as well as building time, but that doesn\u0027t mean that their re-use will be cost-free. As a matter of fact,\u00A0the player will still have to pay some money for their reconditioning, but it will be only a fraction of the money he would have payed\u00A0 had he used\u00A0completely new parts. During my tests I didn\u0027t pay too much attention to the following aspects, but it is \u003Cem\u003Elikely\u003C/em\u003E that reconditioning costs for each part will grow every time it is\u00A0re-used (reflecting the difficulty of maintaining a part\u00A0subject to\u00A0\u00A0an increasing wear), while the cash we will earn from selling it\u00A0will \u003Cem\u003Eprobably\u003C/em\u003E decrease proportionally to the decrease of its reliability.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nSumming up: despite the fact that the \u0027override funds\u0027 option is classed as a \u0027WIP\u0027 feature, during my tests with it\u00A0enabled I couldn\u0027t identify\u00A0any significant adverse effect.\u00A0All in all, I think it provides a more realistic and more balanced gaming experience than the regular SY mode, and in my opinion this balance do reach its maximum\u00A0if OhScrap!

That said, I realize that there are different tastes, limits to what can be modded and what not\u00A0and, above all, priorities relative to what aspects of the game\u00A0need to be addressed first. By no means I think that the issue we are discussing now is a priority, and I wouldn\u0027t have raised it, if aat had not brought\u00A0our attention to it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am a new KCT user who is trying to build his own mod list around this mod, and so far I am very happy of how it works.
