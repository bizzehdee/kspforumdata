Expect heartbreak and disappointment if you bust your arse for anyone\u0027s satisfaction besides the half dozen fellow Whovians who would use it. However, whilst a Whovian, I would opt not to use it as it is a game and immersion breaking concept which, as far as I can tell, is diametrically opposed in intent to everything which the developers and their modder community have worked towards.\u003Cp\u003EModding is a double edged blade in that regards. You\u0027ll find the first person to include a set of antennae, dishes and simple tiny little reality tweaks that make our ships look more realistic will have a thousand downloads in a matter of a few days, but folks who work on ambitious projects that break the unspoken allegedly mutual intent of development will get shunned like leppers.

I mostly make things for my own enjoyment first but anyone who downloads is just a plus to me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Destroyer","CreatedById":36109,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-30T04:18:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVaccer, that is nice. i would like it!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
