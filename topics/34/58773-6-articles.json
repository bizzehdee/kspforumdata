Any chance you could add the \u0022Control from Here\u0022 control group function to command modules and the new ARM Claw? It\u0027s so super useful for docking ports.

I got some... ideas.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u00225thHorseman\u0022 data-cite=\u00225thHorseman\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOh God Yes. I don\u0027t need Free Hinge but if you could open the claw and the attach something to it... The possibilities!\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can definitely do the action group item, and can almost certainly allow you to tweak the claw opened and closed in the editor. I\u0027m not sure about adding an attachment node as I have with the shielded docking ports: for docking ports, Squad\u0027s code already assumes that docking ports should be able to \u0022start docked\u0022, and has a special provision built into the state machine to handle such an eventuality. If that\u0027s not the case for T\u00C3\u0160\u00C5\u201C\u00C3\u00A1\u00C2\u00B4\u00E2\u20AC\u00A1 C\u00C3\u0160\u00C5\u00B8\u00C3\u00A1\u00C2\u00B4\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C3\u00A1\u00C2\u00B4\u00C2\u00A1, then anything I could do would be contrived and hacky, so I probably wouldn\u0027t release it. I\u0027ll look into it, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Azimech\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Azimech\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWas the RGB slider for the stock lamps your idea or Squad\u0027s, toadicus?

So, while I don\u0027t think your craft would fail to load on a stock install, the fairings would likely still exist. To my understanding of the way KSPFields work, there\u0027s no way around it in this case.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Green Skull\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Green Skull\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI got a weird bug with the latest version that may possibly be a conflict with another mod... When I dock or re-dock two or more vessels all of my docking ports are shown up on the staging system on the left with the de-coupler symbol. Then I\u0027m unable to dock with them.

If you can get me your debug log (Windows: \\path\\to\\KSP_win\\KSP_Data\\output_log.txt; Linux (\u0026amp; Mac?): ~/.unity3d/Squad/Kerbal\\ Space\\ Program/Player.log) after a run of the game that exhibits the problem, that would help me target my testing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
