This prevents SCAN SAT missions packs from loading as they are dependent on the agent \u0027Research \u0026amp; Development Department\u0027 which is a Squad agent. I added the agent information from the Squad Agent.CFG to the SETI-Contracts-General file and my SCAN-Sat contracts are now loading properly by Contract Configurator.\u003Cp\u003EI think I am getting to the point with this game where I spend more time focused on finding new mods/finding bugs then actually playing the game.
