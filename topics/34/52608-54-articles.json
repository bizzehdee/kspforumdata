(read my post above) I\u0027ve now tried with regular RPM, hyomoto, and superhyomoto as in your screen shot. None of them seem to be correctly displaying the delta angles. This can be verified by running lazor docking cam alongside the RPM docking screen. The delta angles in the lazor cam monitor are correct and can be used to easily align your ship with the target. The delta angles in RPM are just.... off. You should be able to roll your ship until delta z is zero, than rotate the x and y axis until they are lined up perfectly. After experimenting around with it, it seems the main problem may be related to delta z. With rpm, it does not change when you roll as it should. When I zero\u0027d my delta z on the lazor docking screen, the delta x and delta y magically matched with rpm. But then also, as I pointed out above, sometimes the delta y gets stuck on zero. Not sure why. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(I like your new dashed lines btw)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
