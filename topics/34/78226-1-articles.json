As an example, if you set the DR_Velocity to 1500, then a 2000 m/s surface speed will have a 67% chance of burning up, rather than 0% at the default setting of 2000 m/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdding a heat shield can reduce this chance by up to 100% (note that the chance of burning up \u003Cem\u003Ecan exceed\u003C/em\u003E 100%) based on how much material remains. If 50% of the heat shield material remains, then the chance of burning up reduces by 50%. 100% remaining -\u0026gt; 100% reduction, 10% remaining -\u0026gt; 10% reduction, and so on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs an example, consider a stage going 3200 m/s at the point of \u0022deletion\u0022 when SR kicks in. This stage has a 120% chance of burning up, meaning it will always be destroyed if it doesn\u0027t have a heatshield. Luckily, it has a heatshield attached that has 80% of the ablator left. This reduces the chance of burning up by 80%, down to 40% (120-80=40), greatly increasing the odds of the stage surviving reentry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs of 1.6.6 for KSP 1.2.2, stages eligible for powered recovery will attempt to reduce their speed to below the minimum speed for burning up by using fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:22px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPSA: Set your chutes to open at Min Pressure of 0.5 and \u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eactivate/stage\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E them with your stages!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP 1.0 added reentry heating (and parachute breaking) and an increased physics range (now 22.5km).

This mod is essentially stripped right out of KCT and changed to be made functional on its own, while DebRefund appears to have been written specifically for the 0.24 update. My code was originally written for total part recovery for putting parts in a part inventory, so DebRefund\u0027s form of partial recovery is more advanced than the flat rate form I use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do plan on adding config options for science and kerbals. Also, beware of the new Real Chute update.

This should work now with the new version of real chutes and I also added the ability to recover Kerbals from stages. I\u0027m working on getting science to work but I keep running into an issue where the subject value is NaN and so no science is returned. If you were having issues before, try this version out and see if they\u0027re fixed an let me know if they aren\u0027t.

It also means I can focus more directly on KCT, which has yet to have a 0.24 release.
