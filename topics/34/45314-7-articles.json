Peristent Trails just make craft moving on line. Line also records direction of craft. So you won\u0027t get smoke, because it\u0027s only moves on line.

KerbPaint is not working. Ghost craft have bugged landing gear. Always lowered. (even if I start raised from SPH) I was recording crafts without landing gear. Lights are bugged too.
