Currently the shaders \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003Ehave to be\u003C/span\u003E are added in as embedded resources. I\u0027m not sure if that can be changed or not. Which means they\u0027re actually added when the dll is compiled as part of the dll.\u003Cp\u003EWhat would be ideal is if I could take any shader source, compile it and turn it into an asset package and have it loaded up when KSP starts up. Unity does support that but I\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s possible for US to do with the tools provided....? (i.e. it\u0027s a Pro feature, meaning that the game has to be using the Pro license which KSP is but is the toolset available to us the same as what Pro users get?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW, the next update to this will fix a bug that is in the current download which is that realTimeReflections aren\u0027t properly turned off. But when I fix that bug another creeps in which is that the shader is not properly reflective on the launchpad or when first switched to.... It takes about a minute worth of updating before it kicks in. That\u0027s actually something that was plaguing me before and I thought I fixed it but apparently only replaced it with a different bug. Not really sure what\u0027s happening, as near as I can tell the update function is being properly called but just doesn\u0027t produce or apply the cubemap immediately. Either it\u0027s sitting there updating for the entire minute or just doesn\u0027t work the first time or something. And I can\u0027t programmatically determine whether it\u0027s worked or not, I only know by watching it in-game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe shaders CAN be brought in from a text file if you want. Look at KSP.IO I think. I embedded my shaders simply because it was more convenient. If you want, I can take a look at the shaders to see if I can add translucency to them. KSP is *Probably* using the _Color or _Tint field to determine the highlighting and transparency (though I\u0027d have to look at existing shaders to be sure).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
