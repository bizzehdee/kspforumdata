If I interpret it correctly (sorry for being vague here) it\u0027s the time you are going to intercept, not how long until. Regardless, you can watch your target distance as well. I know that isn\u0027t perfect but its how I did it with Kerpollo. There are a few other issues such as the intercept distance it gives you IS accurate, but it fluctuates making it a bit muddling to use. Unfortunately that\u0027s an RPM issue, but I believe there is already a fix for it if you use one of the dev builds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the reference part to work with the docking cam, yes it must be selected from the target menu. The change you see on your navball is to be expected. If its particularly large it is either your docking port is quite far from the command pod, or your speed display changed, that could explain it. Unless its a really weird change, but for that I\u0027d need to see it to diagnose. EDIT: Thanks Mihara! You are the quickness!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt sounds like you selected your target docking port correctly, but it may have been some weirdness. KSP can be a bit wonky with targeting sometimes, so when it happens I recommend you first try clearing your target from the menu, and then do it again. I\u0027m not 100% sure on this, but you may also need to have a docking port selected on your craft as well. And for both, it needs to be done through the target menu, selecting parts by right-clicking with the mouse doesn\u0027t work and may have caused some of your issues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe totals menu is mainly for mod users, I don\u0027t know if RPM supports RealFuels and I\u0027ll have to check. The simplified view and the staging assistant are both designed for stock resources which is where your problem is coming from. If there is a demand for folks such as yourself, Mihara has been hugely accommodating to user requests, and it would be rather simple for me to make that adjustment. So there may be a fix for it. And finally, as far as the battery charge display goes, I\u0027ll double-check it, it\u0027s entirely possible I made an error there.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-23T17:46:57Z\u0022 title=\u002201/23/2014 05:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 23, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Hyomoto\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DasBananenbrot","CreatedById":70900,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-24T14:40:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWohoo 0.14 is out \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hyomoto","CreatedById":64780,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-24T16:46:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003EExcellent, I\u0027ll get to using this immediately.
