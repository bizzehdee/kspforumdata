This and DangIt! basically do the same thing in totally different ways. How could they possibly work together? TestFlight is designed to simulate failures in a more realistic rather than random way, and to allow parts to improve in reliability through flight testing.

(In fact, I visited this thread to ask this very question.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDangIt allows for part failures on a rather random basis, but does so for pretty much any part on a craft. Your mod allows for a specific pattern to be applied to the logic of when a part fails, but that pattern can only be applied / exploited (with test flights) by physically \u003Cem\u003Erunning\u003C/em\u003E the part, i.e., with engines and boosters running, mostly (according to your YouTube test footage -- I just discovered this mod on CKAN and haven\u0027t run it yet.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy running both mods simultaneously, we can now have a realistic DangIt across all parts, but without it being totally arbitrary and random. Indeed, it might even allow for KIS specialization of the single-gender DangIt inventory resource, \u0022spare parts.\u0022 For example, different part failures (or different types of failure for the same part) can necessitate a different type of repair, perhaps even requiring a different type of SparePart resource / inventory item. It would then force designers and mission planners to anticipate what repairs might be more likely, or even if unlikely, would be so mission-critical that carrying a specific spare part would be justified despite a low likelihood of needing it. At the same time, while it\u0027s easy to \u0022test fire\u0022 an engine with three orange tanks of fuel, or a booster, all on a set of un-released launch clamps on the launch pad, or even organically in flight with risk of failure (having to plan for abort contingencies) etc., it\u0027s rather difficult to \u0022run\u0022 a floodlight, or to \u0022run\u0022 a solar panel, or to \u0022run\u0022 a parachute. So while TestFlight data can be \u0022gamed\u0022 by simply investing in a few tanks of fuel to fire an engine on the launchpad, lights and life support parts and KAS winches and solar panels and parachutes really DO have to be strapped to missions and flown in realworld scenarios before being certified for use as primary systems on dangerous interplanetary missions. (To be sure, the TestFlight module curve for those occasional use items such as parachutes can have a different accrual constant as a balancing issue.) With DangIt alone, I just need to split my engineering; instead of sending an automated Eve probe with a single large capacity battery beyond the 10ec built into the probe core (See\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/xSf_x3IY-f8?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E from 8:47-10:25) I\u0027ll send a probe with two or three smaller batteries for the same overall ec capacity. Combine your mod here, and that workaround becomes slightly less viable, since not only could the batteries be tested beforehand so as to reduce this possibility to begin with (perhaps at 80% reliability, failures on non-engine-type-parts could be just as frequent as at 50%, but likely to be less severe) or, at the very least, sending multiple batteries along afford me greater opportunity to amass du for analysis, thereby providing an incentive to return the craft to Kerbin and recover it on the surface (not only do I get greater Science and Funds that way, but physically recovering the used parts is how I make the parts more reliable in the future.)\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll even go beyond that -- we have TACLS, which I mentioned; what about things like BDArmory, or Kerbal Construction Time? With KCT, what if I\u0027m planning an emergency rescue mission because I accidentally hit the spacebar while in munar orbit and detached my primary capsule from my service module that housed all of my TACLS resources? (See \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92377-1-0-4-Kerbal-Construction-Time-1-2-2-%288-26-15%29-Unrapid-Planned-Assembly/page8?p=1405649#post1405649\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92377-1-0-4-Kerbal-Construction-Time-1-2-2-%288-26-15%29-Unrapid-Planned-Assembly/page8?p=1405649#post1405649\u003C/a\u003E) I need to design a rescue craft that I can not only afford with funds in career mode (RO or stock-scale); that can rush to the launchpad and achieve orbit before the in-capsule resources are exhausted; but I also have to worry about using untested equipment on said rescue craft design? This is closer to RO-type safety margins, where if I\u0027m sending a mission to the Mun, I need to pre-launch my potential automated rescue craft almost before the staging incident occurs in order to achieve my safety margin. Allowing for emergency reconnect procedures, such as with a KAS winch cable, so as to suckle off the staged resource levels, prolly wouldn\u0027t hurt either. KCT already allows me to enjoy faster build times for often-built parts, and faster than that for parts recovered and in inventory from previous missions; your mod allows for those parts to also be more reliable if they\u0027re not even ORDERED until after my test flight is recovered at KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI see a LOT of potential with this \u003Cstrong\u003Etruly awesome mod\u003C/strong\u003E, man, and I\u0027m very excited to see how it turns out.

This allows failure rates as low as .00000000000001. However, KSP itself will not persist doubles, only floats. Further more, by their very nature FloatCurves, which are used to define the failure rate curves, have to be floats. This means that while internally the failure rate can be much lower than before, KSP will still only allow you to specify failure rate values down to .0000001 (This is one significant digit lower than previous). In order to get even smaller values than that, use the new property on TestFlightCore failureRateModifier to force it even lower. Setting both the failureRate and the failureRateModifier to the smallest float value of .0000001 will result in a calculated failureRate internally of the min rate, .00000000000001\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2[B]CONFIGS - RO[/B]: Update RO configs for RO 10.0\u003Cbr\u003E\n[INDENT]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2Aerobee configs were renamed\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2RL, AJ, and LR no longer have a dash (Only the last was relevant here)\u003Cbr\u003E\n[/INDENT]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2[B]NEW[/B]: Recompiled for KSP v1.0.5\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2[B]CHANGED[/B]: Updated ContractConfigurator to 1.8.1\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2[B]NEW[/B]: Added support for lots of different parts thanks to the awesome work of @anxcon.
