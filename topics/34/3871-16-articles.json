Also be sure to note the difference between SAS and ASAS modules, the normal SAS modules only apply force to stop rotation, while an ASAS is a flight computer that uses OTHER control parts (flaps, RCS thrusters, and gimballed engines) to control the rocket and hold the heading you were on when you hit the SAS key.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd by the way, all of those structure parts have fuel flow turned on, unless the description text specifically says otherwise.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
