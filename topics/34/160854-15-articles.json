Then if a failure is determined, it will happen between now and a part of the original expected lifetim (1/3 for example)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n7. At the end of the 2nd expected lifetime, dices are rolled again. The time is again 1/3 of the previous lifetime (which was already 1/3 of the original lifetime).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n8. This goes on every time the lifetime ends. Obviously there should be a cap to prevent the dices from rolling to often and making a failure unavoidable. Maybe a minimum time of 30 ingame minutes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis way the possiblity of a failure would increase tue to roling dices more frequently, after the expected lifetime is reached. The lifetime concept would also give a more variable time when a failure will happen, opposing to your fixed 2 minutes for engines or 6 hours for other parts, after which no more failure will happen, as long as you don\u0027t switch back and forth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso the expected lifetime should increase with the failure rate decreasing. So the more often a part is build, the longer it\u0027s expected lifetime will be.\u003Cbr\u003E\nMaybe the lifetime could also be increased by paying additional money for that part.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLifetime for engines should be pretty short then, but the lifetime should only be counted while they are running (Failure described at point 4).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDue to a failure roll when activating a part (Failure described at point 2), it would also mirrow the risk of moving parts and engines (solar panels getting stuck the more often they are retracted and extended,\u003Cbr\u003E\nantennas getting stuck on extracting, engines failing with more frequent shut-down and activation)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith this you would have a little risk at the start, where you activate engines and antennas and solar panels, then you would be pretty safe for the expected lifetime (though there is still a small chance for a failure) but after the expected lifetime, your vessel/satellite will slowly start to degrade, as it would in real life. But you could calculate with that. A part with an expected lifetime of 2 months will most likely not make it to Duna, but a part with an expected lifetime of about 3 years most likely will make it and also be able to operate in orbit for a long time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also agree with \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/163177-gordon-dry/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022163177\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/163177-gordon-dry/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Gordon Dry\u003C/a\u003E that it would make sence that a part being build more often should have an impact on all other \u003Cstrong\u003Eolder\u003C/strong\u003E parts of that category, i.e. a highly reliable Poodle should have made a LV-909 a little bit more reliable, too.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E But i don\u0027t know if that is just too dificult or complex to implement.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI hope something of the above can help you in your decision in which direction you will go in balancing the failures.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThank you very much for your mod :-) It makes the game way more fun to play for me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-05-28T22:25:26Z\u0022 title=\u002205/28/2018 10:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EMay 28, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by BlueTiger12\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"linenoise42","CreatedById":189276,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-29T04:05:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n@severedsolo I\u0027ve been thinking about this too\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI really like the idea of new tech being less reliable than the tried-and-true older tech, but the way its implemented I find myself just cheesing it.\u00A0\u00A0A reliability level 1 item is going to fail, so it\u0027s not worth trying to use it.\u00A0\u00A0That\u0027s easy to solve though - just make a \u0022ship\u0022 with a bunch of random items, head out to the launch pad, and then recover the vessel.\u00A0\u00A0This, of course, completely defeats the purpose, but it\u0027s almost necessary when dealing with uncommonly used, but long-lifetime items, such as space station components.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat\u0027s interesting about tracking the reliability of each part is that you open up a new sink for different resources that the base game is somewhat lacking.\u00A0\u00A0Some ideas that might or might not be interesting:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRepairing:\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Parts should be repairable, but based on the skill level of the engineer.\u00A0\u00A0If you divided the tech tree up into tiers based on the science cost to research, a 5 star engineer should be able to repair any part, but a 0 star engineer could only repair the lowest-tech items.\u00A0\u00A0As others previously mentioned, this gives a reason to bring engineers along.\u00A0\u00A0Since any part can fail, it also makes the higher-tech items permanently have a higher cost - if you\u0027re taking a 1 year trek out into space with the top level nuclear reactors, you better bring along the best-of-the-best in technicians.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- The above could be tweaked so lower-level engineers have a chance to fix higher level tech, but at risk of making things worse / permanently breaking them\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- There should always be a way to fix a part.\u00A0\u00A0I launched a reliability 1 station core, and it immediately short-circuited once it was set up. \u00A0I could undock everything, replace this one core with a new one, and effectively rebuild the station. \u00A0It\u0027d be neat, though, if instead I could send a repair mission. \u00A0Send an appropriately-leveled engineer with some spare parts, and replace its internals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Retrofitting older hardware. \u00A0You launch a ship with a reliability level 2 item in it. \u00A0Later, you progress that engine to level 3 - it\u0027d be neat to send an engineer to retrofit the existing engine to level 3 reliability.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFailures:\u003Cbr\u003E\n- What about critical failures, fore when things go -really- wrong?
