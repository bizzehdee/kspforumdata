MSM/MBU has a 240/167u storage container. Although there\u0027s room for 3-4 times units.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Pondarosa has a 40u container... why? I would assume that it\u0027s tightly packed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.

So here are my suggestions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Change MSM to 800-900u (12containers*80u-some deduction)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Change MBU to 540-600u (8*80u-perhaps more deduction because it\u0027s the base unit ;-))\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Pondarosa storage container size = 0 ; storage size =120\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.

For starters MKS/OKS and this mod utilize shared assets, thereby drastically reducing the memory footprint of the mod. What this means is multiple parts are going to use the same model and texture, and then have a different decal applied to them depending on what the part actually is and what it does.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason MKS/OKS and this mod aren\u0027t set up in a way in which you can easily pick and choose parts is because that would break the intended functionality of the mod. These mods are supposed to allow you to create a functioning self sufficient base/space station, every part accomplishes a necessary step on the path of converting waste products into life support products in a semi realistic way, in addition to being able to mine and refine resources into useful fuels and materials.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E If you are intending to use them simply for their aesthetic value that is outside of the intended use of this mod, in which case you are entirely on your own and the mod author has absolutely zero obligation to provide support for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the Templates, they are\u0027t part configs, this mod only adds what five or six individual parts. There is then a custom coded plugin that allows you to then take that single part and change it between different templates, allowing it to fulfill the roll of multiple different parts. All of this not only decreases memory usage but also reduces clutter in the part menu.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo your memory issues are most likely entirely due to you not knowing what the hell you are doing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou should also know that loading parts does not increase memory load, it\u0027s loading textures, if you have 500 parts all using the same texture, guess what memory usage will be very very low.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps you should gain some basic understanding of what you are talking about before cluttering the forum with useless rude garbage.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Angelo Kerman","CreatedById":106975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-04T17:01:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@Cdr_Zeta:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt sounds like you have issues with MKS/OKS to begin with, and that mod isn\u0027t for you. It\u0027s clearly stated up front on the first post of the first page of this thread that MCM is built on top of MKS/OKS, it requires MKS/OKS to be downloaded, and contains parts that retain the functionality of MKS/OKS but does so in a way that reduces the parts catalog clutter and provides a stock-like appearance. The very nature of the mod means that a number of the parts are replacements for their MKS/OKS equivalents.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGiven your stance on MKS/OKS, this mod wouldn\u0027t be your cup of tea either. Anybody else evaluating the mod is encouraged to read the first page to properly set expectations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the curious, the assets are organized the way they are precisely because they share the textures. The parts themselves are clearly labeled, so anyone who doesn\u0027t want a particular part can easily find the config file and .mu and remove them. Don\u0027t want the MCM? No problem, simply delete the MCM.mu and MCMPart.cfg. Deleting the textures as well will result in parts you don\u0027t delete having texture issues, since they\u0027re shared as much as possible to conserve texture memory. The decals and templates are left separate to make it easy to add new configurations, and they\u0027re shared as well- the MCM, Homestead, and Ponderosa, for instance, all make use of the same templates, so you\u0027re not duplicating MKS/OKS configurations depending upon the part you use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: There\u0027s also a limitation of KSP to consider regarding texture management. I\u0027ve learned through experience that KSP requires a part\u0027s textures to be in the same directory as the part itself. That\u0027s true even if you replace the textures through the MODEL node. What I\u0027ve found is that you can create placeholder textures and then replace them through the MODEL node in the part\u0027s config file, but now you\u0027ve got a bunch of placeholders for each part that you use the technique with. Even at 64x64px (the minimum size), those textures add up. So better to place models and textures in the same directory for those models that share the same textures, and save some memory by not requiring those placeholders.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf memory is an issue, try using Active Texture Management and/or the -opengl switch. If you\u0027re really memory starved, the second post on the first page shows you how to remove textures and assets from MKS/OKS that aren\u0027t used- keeping in mind that the mod already has a small memory footprint.
