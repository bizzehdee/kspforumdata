So I will be tuning the guns relatively close to the real world counterpart... even though it\u0027s KSP and there is no humanity for god\u0027s sake! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost guns fall between 750 - 900 m/s, I think the fastest firing gun I have right now would be the phalanx which fires somewhere around 1100 m/s - with nearly 100% of rounds colliding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a timer on all rounds, realistically I have to keep the overhead down with the rate of fire being high but not as high as in real life. I think the timer on the phalanx as well as all smaller rounds is about 4 seconds. Which after velocity falloff due to drag will give the round an outer range of 3 - 3.5 km. Penetration power is reduced as it slows down of course, so effective range (depending on the target) is likely under 2km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe larger rounds/shells have more duration on the timer. due to their extended range. As I mentioned in another post I was able to lay some smack-down on another battleship about 7.2km away. Really with those shells even when at reduced velocity they put down the hurt.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve added some fire/smoke fx to the ground where Incendiary shells land, and explosive force within a short radius of where HE shells hit the ground. This allows for some inaccurate splash type damage to be dealt. The final step to that will be spawning shrapnel at the explosion site, each particle then deal out damage as a low powered round would, this would be bad for weak targets like aircraft or other small parts that are not armour.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeat is one thing I\u0027ve put some control on lately. When something burns it will heat to about 90% of that parts max temp... at that time it will randomly be determined if the part should outright explode or just burn-out and be fixable later. Parts containing fuel will check for an explosion around 60% of it\u0027s rated max heat. Engines that overheat will be treated the same way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDamage will take each part into consideration, wings lose lift, seize at a given position, or lose range of deflection. Engines shut down, turrets can\u0027t turn or fire... and so on. I haven\u0027t covered off everything but I\u0027ll try to cover the primary part types.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETorpedoes are back in! I have them skimming just under the waterline at about 20 - 25 m/s, they have a base range of about 2km, though that can be changed. They don\u0027t seek or anything... they track the line you drop them at, they will have an fx trail so they are slightly easier to see from the air.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood discussion, there is a lot to cover in something as broad as this!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a side note: I\u0027m picking some weapons/ordinance that I think would be neat to model and implement. I plan on adding an 88mm flak gun as I needed something in that range. My torpedo is modeled and set up to act like a ww2 Japanese type91, I just made a 30mm DEFA internal cannon. The tank turret has a 127mm smooth-bore gun and is loosely modeled after the turret off the Leopard 2 A6? MBT. The real tank has a 120mm... so this is slightly bigger... I was originally making a 5\u0022 naval gun, but decided a tank turret would be better.. so I kept the round parameters and made a tank turret model instead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERelease 2 candidates so far are: 88mm Flak artillery, capable of use as regular artillery or AT. Small portable mortar (maybe). Acoustic homing torpedoes (slightly better than nothing!). I\u0027m thinking of heat-seeking air-air missiles like a sidewinder... I\u0027m only pondering it right now, and if so... there will be flares. I\u0027d likely allow the flares to have an automatic discharge setting, or chime a note when the missile is 1 - 2 seconds from your plane to \u0027remind\u0027 you to deploy the flares.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyhow... too much to talk about and too little time!

So right now two identical armour plates, one at 45deg would currently offer the same level of protection. I could check against angles when the shot hits, I\u0027d have to do multitudes of tests to see how this would affect the current calculations and play-balance. This is something I could likely check into quickly to determine how much time it would take to implement and factor in. Anything that would take too much time would likely need to become a candidate for the second release.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt gets a little complicated as sloped armour is only sloped if the tank is sitting on level ground, equally if a shell impacts the armour coming down from a higher trajectory, it\u0027s effectively hitting the armour dead on. So vs. direct fire AT weapons... that have a flat trajectory, and when on level ground, the sloped armour would of course make a difference.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERicochet is something that could be done, again, it\u0027s a matter of finding the right deflection, or it could be randomized for simplicity. Again comes down to time and most importantly the game value. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESure it has some coolness factor, but if you are shooting at a tank 1km away... the last thing you care about is ricochet. The direct hit is the only thing that will have any real power to damage a hard target, as those are bits and chunks of the original projectile or target, traveling at a much reduced velocity and having no advantage in penetrator shape. Ricochet really only affects soft targets, like personnel or non-armoured components.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0027ll see what can be done.
