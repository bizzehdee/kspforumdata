I have to research some more info on it to see if I can get it close to the real thing. Not to mention that I did not want any over heat for any engine as well. I will mess with that later. Besides fuel and thrust I change a few decoupler settings too. The decouplers I have changed to for a bit less force, don\u00E2\u20AC\u2122t like to see my discarded parts slam into each other:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first item is just named RocketCo decoupler (first stage decoupler):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EejectionForce = .25\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 12t10 decoupler (second stage decoupler):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EejectionForce = .2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Noyuz decoupler (non 1.5m fairing):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EejectionForce = .05\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll the lower parts are from the RocketCo pack that includes the 2nd stage (some will call it the 3rd stage) as well. I specifically made the 2nd stage a bit weak if you want to call it that with the numbers from the original. If anyone has kept up with real launches then they will know several have failed because of the 3rd stage shutting down prematurely and the payload ending up on the ground which probably made a few insurance guys at Lloyd\u00E2\u20AC\u2122s of London mad. This is what I wanted, to make sure that I got every ounce of power out of the 3rd stage to get it to orbit. Then using the Noyuz orbital engine finish the rest off if needed. I have not messed with it in a few weeks but if I remember, you can get the start of a complete orbit out of it but you will have a low perigee and need to use the Noyuz orbital engine to increase the low point. The longer you wait to get the 1st stage horizontal close to the end of its burn will determine your apogee. Then with the 2nd stage you chase it until you have a decent perigee. At launch start with RCS off and SAS on I can start to bend it over right away. What ever key you use to rotate, I just toggle off the SAS (using the hot key) move it a few degrees and toggle the SAS back on to maintain that angle. Just repeat as necessary until you have the apogee you want. At first stage burn out I am usually 10-20 degrees off of horizontal which helps the second stage out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso after I put it together it was hard to keep the items in the right order if you messed with any the parts.

NASA never approached Paul Fisher to develop a pen, nor did Fisher receive any government funding for the pen\\\u0027s development. Fisher invented it independently, and then asked NASA to try it.
