Unfortunately the default interface relies on the HTTP API which has limitations that lead to a loss of services after a while.

Its really cool, and might be really useful. I work in an further education college (UK), and want to use the game in one of our classes: I could really do with being able to get at tables of data so the students can use it to prepare information from scratch. The class is usually dull, but I figured that using KSP and this data would let them work together on something simulated, then capture a load of info and report back to their team. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe plan as it stands is to get students to work in small groups, with a team leader, an engineer, a designer, a pilot, and one scientist who reports back to the group. Then they all swap places and try again: hopefully learning from their mistakes!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI saw that you were plaining on making tables available, is there a way to export data from the mod?
