As mentioned above, areo does now affect the way parts fall off the craft now. I have seen the people lower the boosters a little on the decoupler to provide a little more kick above the CoM. My mod might work because it\u0027s actually applying more force to the decoupler half on the booster than what the stock module does.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I don\u0027t want to dismiss you guys completely.

The advantage of this approach is that the seperatrons are really the only force acting to push the craft away, and if you\u0027re willing to fiddle the seperatrons around, you can account for the aero forces. Way more complicated, but satisfying for those of us that like that sort of challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Technical Ben","CreatedById":10512,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T18:41:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022vardicd\u0022 data-cite=\u0022vardicd\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI also get this with Lt-45 engines if theres more than one on the bottom of the craft.
