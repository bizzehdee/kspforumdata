Problem is, I can\u0027t add anything to my inventories in the VAB. It doesn\u0027t want to put an item I drag and drop into the inventory. it just places it in the vab as if the inventory wasn\u0027t there.\n\nAny ideas?\n\nHere\u0027s some details:\n\nI play with A LOT of mods (130\u002B) on Linux (Ubuntu 14.10).

I sent a resupply shuttle to replace all the KAS containers and their contents on my station. You can imagine my tantrum when I watch it all just float off when I couldn\u0027t grab them! But seeing KospY\u0027s view about KSP being about building ships and inventions to solve problems instead of relying on quick fixes made me pause. Now I use those little KAS winch socket thingies on the containers and just winch them wherever I need them. Being able to attach winches wherever I want is a godsend. Just attach a winch next to the receiver cradle and attach to the new container and pull it across. I normally have a follower winch on the donor craft that\u0027s unclutched to arrest the container when it gets near where it needs to be.
