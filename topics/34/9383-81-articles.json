The mod runs fine and all the parts work, but when I get up into orbit and start mapping the map screen itself doesn\u0027t show the progress for the ISA and Polar views, instead it just shows what I\u0027m guessing is that unit of the map and then refreshes to the next piece and so on.

I found some facts about it (with this mod \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/entries/1081-Mapsat-4-devbuild-2-now-available/page2#comments\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eblog 2nd page\u003C/a\u003E), in short the biome map works, but not the other two (files for those are saved as *ISA__topo.png and *_polar_topo.png, * stands for the planet scanned). What you have in your image is a generic background that is drawn, but normally is hidden behind the content of those files. If the mod gets \u0022confused\u0022 about something (e.g. the satellite position doesn\u0027t match with the map) it seems it can\u0027t correctly reference where to put what is scanned in those files, and overwrites them with just what is being scanned at the moment. It should return to work by deleting those two files.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease know about \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55832-PLUGIN-PARTS-0-23-SCANsat-terrain-mapping\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESCANsat\u003C/a\u003E, however.
