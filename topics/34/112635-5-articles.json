Also, would it be possible for the engines to have gimbles?\n\nI\u0027ve gotta go over that and double check. For now, in beta, the hulls should all be rated to a crash tolerance of 70. Once you\u0027re above 70 m/s, you\u0027re on borrowed time, and that\u0027s pretty much in line with stock parts. Now, I have had a yacht break 100m/s and cruise along just fine with no parts flying off at the same crash tolerances as the release. So they are capable of faster speeds. I do need to review everything though. I\u0027ll consider it, but keep this in mind (yea I know it\u0027s a game)... 1 m/s ~ 1.9 knots... Meaning, that little CVE I\u0027ve been testing does over 140 knots... which is unheard of IRL. Most CVA\u0027s do 35ish and they\u0027re considered fast. I also know that you don\u0027t want to spend a week driving your boat to the other side of the planet. I\u0027m trying to find a balance between realistic speeds for a boat and the impatience of humans.\n\nI am hoping eventually to have more hull designs. Wider ones for cargo and... those designed specifically for speed. The Clipper that\u0027s in the pack now will be a medium-fast hull.\n\nAs for the outriggers, I tossed those in at the last minute, they haven\u0027t been fully tested yet. I\u0027ll keep this in mind tho and see if others have speed related issues.\n\nOh, and as for gimbals... They did have in the alpha but... I had to make a choice. It seems that the spinning propellers you now see are incompatible with gimballed engines. I didn\u0027t try it to be certain, but that\u0027s how I read it in the Firespitter info (which is what allows them to spin).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-21T03:08:41Z\u0022 title=\u002206/21/2015 03:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fengist**"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-21T14:48:41Z","Content":"A while back, when I was screwing around with the not-boat thing, I noticed that boats actually make for decent parachutes, on Eve at least.\n\nThis is one of a whole bunch of debris which I noticed that had been falling slowly.\n\n[![screenshot104_zpscstojyt7.png](http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v214/smjjames/screenshot104_zpscstojyt7.png)](http://smg.photobucket.com/user/smjjames/media/screenshot104_zpscstojyt7.png.html)\n\nHuh?

For some reason they keep making my ship flip over.\n\nYep, I got an idea why. It\u0027s not the outriggers, it\u0027s the blisters. They\u0027re too close to your centerline. They lift the ship straight up and then the outriggers have to try to keep it level. Put your blisters on the corners, where the sides meet the bottom of the boat.\n\nAlso, the Outriggers are mostly designed, for now, to aid heavy boats with stability. On smaller, lighter ships, they\u0027ll cause you control issues and slow you down.\n\nUnlike aircraft, you want your center of mass to be as low as possible. Then use the blisters to keep your ship both, up and level. The wider you can space them and still keep them below the water line, the more stable your ship will be.\n\nWhen you need to use the outriggers, mount them so that the pontoon part stays below the water line. Any time a part breaches the surface, it\u0027s checked for breakage. Any parts you put on the hull you need to try keep the connection node either well above or well below the waterline.\n\nThat and you have the winglets on the pontoons. They float really well.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-22T02:12:02Z\u0022 title=\u002206/22/2015 02:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fengist**"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T02:12:43Z","Content":"Yeah that was it, spacing the blisters along the centerline.
