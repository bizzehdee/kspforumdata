It does seem that the CM has about 14 days worth of life support for 3 crew, plus a sizable quantity of rcs fuel. But I always thought most of the life support and RCS fuel was stored in the service module. Maybe the bulk of the life support and rcs fuel should be moved to the SM part? Or we just need to increase the capacity on the CM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) According to the CSM wiki, \u0022dry mass\u0022 should be 11.9t while the \u0022launch mass\u0022 should be between 14.7t (Apollo 7 is listed at 16.5t) and 28.8t (Apollo 8). The dry mass of the CSM appears to be 9.036t while the fully fueled mass is 30.556t. I assume that the lower dry mass was to allow for the addition of science modules and such. So if there is basically 2.9t of mass available for \u0022extras\u0022, then the wet mass of the completed CSM is about 4.6t heavy. These weights are without the LES.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) The only \u0022Spacecraft LM Adapter\u0022 I can find appears to be non-RP0 but the \u0022Spacecraft Lunar Module Adapter - Fairing\u0022 has been setup for RP-0. It should also weigh in at 1.84t but appears to only weight 1.789t (adapter \u002B fairing).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) The S-IVB should apparently have a dry mass of 10.6t but I\u0027m seeing 11.951t. I did include a pair of \u0022Saturn IB/V - APS Flight Pack\u0022 modules (\u002B.426t) and a pair of \u0022S-II Ullage Rocket\u0022 motors (\u002B.497t). Not sure if those should be included in the dry mass of the S-IVB or not, so it\u0027s 0.43t - 1.35t overweight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) The \u0022FASA Saturn iB Apollo\u0022 craft file is using a \u0022non RP-0 - Saturn S-IB Stage\u0022 fuel tank (FASA_SIB) which looks like it\u0027s a tank and thrust plate in one. The part is in the \u0022Improved Solids\u0022 tech node. But in the \u0022Advanced Construction\u0022 tech node there is a \u0022Saturn S-IB Stage Tanks\u0022 fuel tank (FASAApalloLFTS1BStage1). It doesn\u0027t have the thrust plate so can\u0027t mount the engines. In that same tech node there is a thrust plate that initially looks correct. It\u0027s listed as \u0022Engine Mount\u0022 (FASAApolloStrS1BPlate) but it\u0027s not sized correctly. Since all the other Saturn IB/V parts (other than engines) become available in the \u0022Advanced Construction\u0022 tech node, can we either get the FASA_SIB part moved and made RP-0 compliant, or at least resize the FASAApolloSTRS1BPlate so it actually fits on the FASAApalloLFTS1BStage1 tank?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) The \u0022FASA Saturn IB Apollo\u0022 craft file is using \u0022non RP-0 - Saturn S-1B Fin\u0022 (FASAStrS1BWing) which is currently in the \u0022Advanced Jet Engines\u0022 tech node. Since all the other Saturn IB/V parts (other than engines) become available in the \u0022Advanced Construction\u0022 tech node, can we get this part moved and made RP-0 compliant?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7) It seems like fuel weights are off. The S1-B stage should have a dry mass of around 42t and should carry about 399.4t of fuel giving it a wet mass of 441.4t and a 150s burn time (at least according to one source. Astronautix actually gives it a gross mass of 448.6t, 155s burn time, with the same basic dry mass resulting in 407t of fuel). Using the FASA_SIB part (which I know is non RP-0 but has the engine plate required to mount the eight H-1B engines), eight H-1B engines, eight FASAStrS1BWing fins, and four \u0022Baby Sergeant Solid Kick Motor\u0022 ullage rockets (not sure why those were used but that\u0027s what\u0027s in the FASA Saturn IB Apollo craft file I\u0027m using for reference), the dry weight of this stage is 31.708t. When I add enough fuel for 148s burn time (the max I can put in the FASA_SIB tank), the fuel weighs 411.305t. The end result is a wet mass of 443.013t which is only about 2.3t heavier then it should be. But that still means the fuel is weighing about 12 tons more than it\u0027s apparently supposed to and that\u0027s with at least 2 seconds less burn time. Not exactly sure what can be done here since adjusting the resource masses will effect alot more then just this one vessel but is there any way to validate that Kersone should weigh 0.82kg/L and that LOX should weigh 1.141kg/L?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, between the extra 4.6t on the CSM, and the extra 2.3t on the S1B stage, the Saturn IB is about 7t heavier then it should be.

It does seem that the CM has about 14 days worth of life support for 3 crew, plus a sizable quantity of rcs fuel. But I always thought most of the life support and RCS fuel was stored in the service module. Maybe the bulk of the life support and rcs fuel should be moved to the SM part? Or we just need to increase the capacity on the CM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) According to the CSM wiki, \u0022dry mass\u0022 should be 11.9t while the \u0022launch mass\u0022 should be between 14.7t (Apollo 7 is listed at 16.5t) and 28.8t (Apollo 8). The dry mass of the CSM appears to be 9.036t while the fully fueled mass is 30.556t. I assume that the lower dry mass was to allow for the addition of science modules and such. So if there is basically 2.9t of mass available for \u0022extras\u0022, then the wet mass of the completed CSM is about 4.6t heavy. These weights are without the LES.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) The only \u0022Spacecraft LM Adapter\u0022 I can find appears to be non-RP0 but the \u0022Spacecraft Lunar Module Adapter - Fairing\u0022 has been setup for RP-0. It should also weigh in at 1.84t but appears to only weight 1.789t (adapter \u002B fairing).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) The S-IVB should apparently have a dry mass of 10.6t but I\u0027m seeing 11.951t. I did include a pair of \u0022Saturn IB/V - APS Flight Pack\u0022 modules (\u002B.426t) and a pair of \u0022S-II Ullage Rocket\u0022 motors (\u002B.497t). Not sure if those should be included in the dry mass of the S-IVB or not, so it\u0027s 0.43t - 1.35t overweight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) The \u0022FASA Saturn iB Apollo\u0022 craft file is using a \u0022non RP-0 - Saturn S-IB Stage\u0022 fuel tank (FASA_SIB) which looks like it\u0027s a tank and thrust plate in one. The part is in the \u0022Improved Solids\u0022 tech node. But in the \u0022Advanced Construction\u0022 tech node there is a \u0022Saturn S-IB Stage Tanks\u0022 fuel tank (FASAApalloLFTS1BStage1). It doesn\u0027t have the thrust plate so can\u0027t mount the engines. In that same tech node there is a thrust plate that initially looks correct. It\u0027s listed as \u0022Engine Mount\u0022 (FASAApolloStrS1BPlate) but it\u0027s not sized correctly. Since all the other Saturn IB/V parts (other than engines) become available in the \u0022Advanced Construction\u0022 tech node, can we either get the FASA_SIB part moved and made RP-0 compliant, or at least resize the FASAApolloSTRS1BPlate so it actually fits on the FASAApalloLFTS1BStage1 tank?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) The \u0022FASA Saturn IB Apollo\u0022 craft file is using \u0022non RP-0 - Saturn S-1B Fin\u0022 (FASAStrS1BWing) which is currently in the \u0022Advanced Jet Engines\u0022 tech node. Since all the other Saturn IB/V parts (other than engines) become available in the \u0022Advanced Construction\u0022 tech node, can we get this part moved and made RP-0 compliant?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7) It seems like fuel weights are off. The S1-B stage should have a dry mass of around 42t and should carry about 399.4t of fuel giving it a wet mass of 441.4t and a 150s burn time (at least according to one source. Astronautix actually gives it a gross mass of 448.6t, 155s burn time, with the same basic dry mass resulting in 407t of fuel). Using the FASA_SIB part (which I know is non RP-0 but has the engine plate required to mount the eight H-1B engines), eight H-1B engines, eight FASAStrS1BWing fins, and four \u0022Baby Sergeant Solid Kick Motor\u0022 ullage rockets (not sure why those were used but that\u0027s what\u0027s in the FASA Saturn IB Apollo craft file I\u0027m using for reference), the dry weight of this stage is 31.708t. When I add enough fuel for 148s burn time (the max I can put in the FASA_SIB tank), the fuel weighs 411.305t. The end result is a wet mass of 443.013t which is only about 2.3t heavier then it should be. But that still means the fuel is weighing about 12 tons more than it\u0027s apparently supposed to and that\u0027s with at least 2 seconds less burn time. Not exactly sure what can be done here since adjusting the resource masses will effect alot more then just this one vessel but is there any way to validate that Kersone should weigh 0.82kg/L and that LOX should weigh 1.141kg/L?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, between the extra 4.6t on the CSM, and the extra 2.3t on the S1B stage, the Saturn IB is about 7t heavier then it should be. With 2-7 seconds less burn time available.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I found a reference that claims the S-1B stage could hold 405kL of fuel (155m3 of RP-1 \u002B 250m3 of LOX). The S-1B tank as it currently exists can hold 404137.4L. I haven\u0027t tested yet, but an extra 862.6L of fuel might give the extra 2-7 seconds burn time that various references suggest the S-1B tank should have.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Good eye on noticing the L of available volume.

There is minimal water aboard, most of the water consumed is generated by the SM fuel cells, and those materials are already in the SM. The rest (food, lithium hydroxide to clean the air) would need to be available in the CM cabin for obvious reasons, they can\u0027t be piped in from the SM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) I would appreciate any link you provide with specific CM/SM masses, I consulted half a dozen reputable ones in forming the current values in RO, but if you point me to any new ones I would love to see them \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt gets hard to know what is meant by \u0027dry mass\u0027 for the SM or CM unless more detail is provided by the source. Does it include LS supplies, astronaut masses, etc, etc. Also, different Apollo missions were flown at different masses for various reasons. For instance, Apollo 7 was the lightest because it was launched atop an early Saturn iB rocket. Later Apollo missions launched on Saturn iB rockets report more mass, I am assuming this is achieve through optimizations of the launch trajectory, slight improvements in tank dry masses, engine ISP, etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) What is 50 kg amongst friends? But seriously, the precise mass of all of these parts have been adjusted again and again slightly by different people looking at different sources. Remember not to take any one source as gospel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) There were a great many variations on the S-IVB flown, and their dry masses varied substantially. Some flew with more or fewer APS packs, some with a lighter J-2 engine without restart capability. Again, we collect multiple sources and make our best adjustments from there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) The FASA Saturn iB Apollo .craft files, and all the other FASA craft files were constructed for RO, before we got RP-0 up and running again for KSP 1.0\u002B. As far as I know, the FASA parts have never all been configured fully for RP-0 and your comment seems to confirm that. Personally, I am playing through RP-0 for the first time (and loving it!) and I am contributing minor changes to help improve RP-0 as I go along. For instance, I helped add the new RD-107 \u0026amp; RD-108 because I love building R-7 style rockets in my early career. Currently I have just placed a 1 man capsule into orbit, and when I progress to the \u0027Apollo\u0027 stage of RP-0 I will hopefully be able to improve the support for later FASA parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) We would be more than happy to help you help us make those changes. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7) Multiple sources were consulted in arriving at the current Saturn iB values, here is a pretty good one I recall using as well: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.b14643.de/Spacerockets_2/United_States_1/Saturn-1/Description/Frame.htm\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.b14643.de/Spacerockets_2/United_States_1/Saturn-1/Description/Frame.htm\u003C/a\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe whole \u003Ca href=\u0022www.b14643.de\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ewww.b14643.de\u003C/a\u003E is an excellent source in general. I added the ullage engines as sort of an afterthough, so they aren\u0027t factored into any of my mass estimates, but they are all relatively light and I found they didn\u0027t impact the ability of any of the FASA craft files I built to perform their intended missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, there are no \u0027perfect\u0027 dry stage masses, or exact fuel loads or engine burn times. There was a bit of variation in each of these from launch to launch, and we see variation from source to source and ultimately have to put one set of numbers in the game. Engines actually burn for a few seconds and consume some tons of fuel before they are released from the launch pad, some variable amount of fuel boils off and is lost, some small amount of fuel or oxidizer is left in the tanks when the engines are shut down, etc. etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have often switched into rocket mass pedant mode, particularly when a craft will not perform the intended mission when everything is put together, or ends up with waaay too much spare dV. In particular, I went through a lot of trouble figuring out issues with the Saturn iB - Apollo and Titan - Gemini launches with both of those issues and dug up plenty of bugs and inaccuracies and fixed them over time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy number 1 rule when configuring parts or creating .craft for public use is \u0022can this consistently perform the intended mission when hand-flown\u0022? Ultimately, a choice to adjust the LM Adapter mass 50kg, or decide whether or not to remove the ullage engine mass from the dry mass of a stage doesn\u0027t affect that prime goal, so I don\u0027t sweat it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, we are definitely more than happy to see PR (pull requests) for Realism Overhaul that intend to improve the accuracy and authenticity of the mod.
