It is possible and it has been discussed, however I have found it\u0027s easier to use the \u0022texture =\u0022 feature in the part.cfg files. After you have downloaded the additional names, extract them into your KSP installation directory under a new subfolder called \u0022textures\u0022 in your KSP\\Parts folder without the folder structure from the zip file and give them each unique names (such as ksoadamant.tga, ksodauntless.tga, ksotenacious.tga you get the idea). It has to be called \u0022textures\u0022 without the quotes or it won\u0027t work. So, to be clear, you should now have KSP\\Parts\\textures with four uniquely named .tga texture files in there. No other folders or files. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk, moving on: under the KSP\\GameData\\KSO\\Parts folder you\u0027ll find a .cfg file called commandkso.cfg. Copy that into your KSP\\Parts directory. Make as many copies as you have textures and again, give them unique names (such as ksocommand_adamant.cfg, ksocommand_dauntless.cfg, yada yada). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly, we have to modify a few lines in each .cfg file so that they call on the proper texture at load. Open the .cfg files. There are two lines we have to modify and we have to add one line. Modify both lines that say \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003Ename = KSO_Cabin\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E and \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003Etitle = KSO Cockpit\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E so that they are unique (such as... you know the drill by now).
