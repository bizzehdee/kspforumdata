I tried entering the same orbital parameters with hyperedit, but can\u0027t reproduce the problem.

It seems that MJ orbit transfer goes nuts when RSS configuration in any shape or form is present, regardless if anything is present in the configuration file. This also appears to happen quite late into the game as well. Try changing your UT to something like 10441471.7475303 and you\u0027ll see the behavior along with RSS present and I could even use an empty RSS config file to reproduce the issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003EREALSOLARSYSTEM\u003Cbr\u003E{\u003Cbr\u003E}    \u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I\u0027ll stop bothering you now since this doesn\u0027t appear to be your problem at all.
