[...]\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m guessing you\u0027re referring to EVE and / or AVP textures? If so, then you\u0027re way over the ~3.xGB ram ceiling, which implies that you\u0027re in 64-bit, which might imply Linux.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI run KSP64 in Linux as well, and CKAN is... not universally reliable for me. Especially with the EVE / AVP texture packs and sub-mod choices. Installing the base module was ok, but I found that manually installing the texture packs was advisable. (To facilitate this alongside other mod-conflict troubleshooting, I pre-assembled the modpacks into a single GameData drop within an external folder, so all I\u0027d have to do is merge-paste those folders and subfolders into my GameData folder of my working install. To undo this, I\u0027d need to perform a two-step process of uninstalling EVE and any other affected mod through CKAN (since AVP textures and some options involve overwriting files in Chatterer / TextureReplacer, depending on what options you choose) and then manually deleting whatever remains of those folders that CKAN didn\u0027t remove. I can then reinstall individual mods through CKAN (Chatterer / TR / etc.) as needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t directly know how those processes would interact with biome definitions, but I do know that RSS / RO has a LOT of batched mods and dependencies. Metadata tracking (the behind-the-scenes trackers that allow CKAN to automatically coordinate mods like that) are very sensitive; even single-character typos can throw off an entire installation. Since the biome maps are so radically altered in such a setup, I\u0027d wonder if that might be the case for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDisclaimer: I don\u0027t run RSS or RO, but I do run Sigma Mod Expansions (addons to Kopernicus, adding a lot of changes to the Kerbol planet locations and orbits) and I discovered that that mod that a corrupted zipfile had been uploaded by the mod author to the CKAN repository -- probably from a faulty Github pull, but that\u0027s just my own speculation. It was a fix that actually sounds a lot more complex as I describe it here: I went to the forum threads for those mods (they were bundled packages of several modlets); downloaded VIABLE zipfiles from there; decompressed and re-bundled them as the CKAN listing had apparently intended; compressed the bundle into a new zipfile; renamed the zipfile to mimic the embedded filename metadata information that the original CKAN zipfiles were supposed to have (random-seeming prefixes, possibly hexadecimal code but I\u0027m not sure, are appended to the beginning of the zipfile filenames downloaded into the CKAN download cache); and then installed the artificially-prepared zipfile through CKAN, from its download cache. Yes, a lot of trouble, but only took a few minutes, and has the benefit of allowing me to manage future updates to the mod through CKAN, which I wouldn\u0027t be able to do if I just installed manually and ran with it. (I reported the zipfile corruption to the mod author so that future updates could correct that issue, at least.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI at least hope that answer isn\u0027t off topic, but not only that I hope it helps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Felbourn\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Felbourn\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe flickering is happening on EVERYTHING not just the static assets.

Just recently started happening to me in a very mod-heavy Linux-64 build. Seems sensitive to KSC-scene camera angle, I even experienced darkening of the far horizon, distant hillsides of K2 and Island Runway, as well as underside of volumetric clouds (with EVE / AVP and Scatterer). Only seemed to be triggered during KSC-scene camera angles shallower than what I can only guess were 15-ish degrees from horizontal (and camera flattest possible is about 10 degrees from horizontal, so I only had a few additional degrees of downward freedom once I was shallow enough to trigger the dimming effect).
