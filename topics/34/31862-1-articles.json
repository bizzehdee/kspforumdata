These are both rebindable in the config.xml file found next to your screenshots.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScreenshots can be found in \u0022/GameData/BOSS/PluginData/BOSS/\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA massive thanks to SyNik4l for adding in many of the much desired features and giving the code a good clean-up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EImportant Information\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing this plugin can require a lot of RAM. Thus, burst fire mode is restricted to a supersample value of 1 - a.k.a no supersampling at all. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, you can still use supersampling without restriction when not using burst fire.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI recommend not going higher than 3 or 4; you may be able to pull off 5, but it may crash/freeze your game for a second. If the game freezes, you are not missing any frames. So just let the game sit while it processes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have added a limiter on the screenshot key/button if your super sampling value is set higher than 1, mainly due to the KSP ram limit. This is to prevent multiple screenshots being taken too quickly causing you to go over the KSP ram limit and crash your game. The plugin checks for the image to finish processing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen allows you to take more screenshots. You can override this limiter by toggling on the \u0027override limiter\u0027 button on the help window.(WARNING: By doing this. You are pretty much limited to 2 screenshots at a time(because it will crash if you take more). Though, you may still crash your game by doing it, everyone\u0027s computer is different, and everyone is using different Add-Ons/Plugins alongside this. In the end, it could work better for some than others. Just know by overriding that limiter, you are subject to crashes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBurst Fire mode: As explained above this is purely for automatically taking screenshots over a period of time. So no supersampling is allowed while this is toggled on. Thus you cannot \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Echange your supersampling value from one if the burst fire window is open. To use it\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Toggle burst fire\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Set interval(this field does allow point values - just make sure if for example you want .3 - You enter 0.3)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.
