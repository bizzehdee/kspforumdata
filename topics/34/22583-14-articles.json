The only way around that is to either remove that module if you are using FAR, or include some extra variable to allow you to keep the module, but skip the setup stage.

I\u0027m asking because I\u0027m trying to retrofit another modder\u0027s solar panels, which have problems with multiple animations per part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESaid part is the Balka Solar Wings Block from CardboardBoxProcessor\u0027s Kosmos pack - it consists of two extendable/retractable solar \u0022wings\u0022 mounted on opposing sides of a rotating hub. The combined rotation of both the solar wings and the hub usually allows the Balka to track the sun effectively, but when switching between flights, the panels would revert to their default retracted state due to stock KSP being unable to handle multiple animations per part. The panels are *enormous* such that it takes literally minutes to fully re-extend each wing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow is a snippet from CBBP\u0027s original CFG file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E// Right solar wing\u003Cbr\u003EMODULE\u003Cbr\u003E    {\u003Cbr\u003E        name = ModuleDeployableSolarPanel\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E        animationName = open_right\u003Cbr\u003E        raycastTransformName = sunCatcherRight\u003Cbr\u003E        pivotName = ArmLeft01_main\u003Cbr\u003E        resourceName = ElectricCharge\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E        chargeRate = 200\u003Cbr\u003E        trackingSpeed = 0.1\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E        powerCurve\u003Cbr\u003E        {\u003Cbr\u003E            key = 206000000000 0 0 0\u003Cbr\u003E            key = 13599840256 1 0 0\u003Cbr\u003E            key = 68773560320 0.5 0 0\u003Cbr\u003E            key = 0 10 0 0\u003Cbr\u003E        }\u003Cbr\u003E    }\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E// Left solar wing\u003Cbr\u003E    MODULE\u003Cbr\u003E    {\u003Cbr\u003E        name = ModuleDeployableSolarPanel\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E        animationName = open_left\u003Cbr\u003E        raycastTransformName = sunCatcherLeft\u003Cbr\u003E        pivotName = ArmLeft01_main\u003Cbr\u003E        resourceName = ElectricCharge\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E        chargeRate = 200\u003Cbr\u003E        trackingSpeed = 0.1\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E        powerCurve\u003Cbr\u003E        {\u003Cbr\u003E            key = 206000000000 0 0 0\u003Cbr\u003E            key = 13599840256 1 0 0\u003Cbr\u003E            key = 68773560320 0.5 0 0\u003Cbr\u003E            key = 0 10 0 0\u003Cbr\u003E        }\u003Cbr\u003E    }\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E// Central rotating hub\u003Cbr\u003E    MODULE\u003Cbr\u003E    {\u003Cbr\u003E        name = ModuleDeployableSolarPanel\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E        animationName = rotary\u003Cbr\u003E        raycastTransformName = sunCatcherRight\u003Cbr\u003E        pivotName = Main_Rotary_Pivot\u003Cbr\u003E        resourceName = ElectricCharge\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E        chargeRate = 0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E    trackingSpeed = 0.1\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E        powerCurve\u003Cbr\u003E        {\u003Cbr\u003E            key = 206000000000 0 0 0\u003Cbr\u003E            key = 13599840256 1 0 0\u003Cbr\u003E            key = 68773560320 0.5 0 0\u003Cbr\u003E            key = 0 10 0 0\u003Cbr\u003E        }\u003Cbr\u003E    }\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ganymede","CreatedById":60469,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-11T01:13:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAre nose/wing guns a planned feature?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/P-38L_nose.jpg/320px-P-38L_nose.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022320px-P-38L_nose.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
