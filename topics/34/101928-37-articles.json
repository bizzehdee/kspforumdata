Well done.\n\nNow I just have one request, is it possible to preserve custom action groups assigned to a part, when it is placed in the inventory? I removed a gravioli detector which I had assigned to action group 1. I put it in the kerbal\u0027s inventory to transport it. But when I re-attached it, the action group assignment was gone, pressing \u00221\u0022 no longer activates the detector. When placed directly without putting the part in the inventory this works but sometimes it\u0027s just too far away. So it\u0027d be nice if it remembers the action groups even when placed in the inventory. If that\u0027s possible.

Just take the KAS containers, remove the MODULE{} for KAS, and add the KIS MODULE{}. You\u0027re done! For instance, I wanted a smaller version of the KIS container. I simply copied the container CFG file, set Scale and Rescale to 0.70, adjusted the volume to 340L, the number of slots, and the costs, and renamed the part. Very easy.\n\nRight I mention this in my post.... But my concern is if the parts are removed then I can no longer use them as the model will no longer exist in the game. I could then rip the model out of an old version of the mod just to get the container back in and make a new mod that is nothing but the old model and the new KIS information... However if the old models were just updated to the new KIS standard and left in the KIS mod it would negate the need to do all this hacking to get the model back.\n\nOn top of this it gives the player more options for the design of their ship, as the old containers fit in places the new containers do not. And in my book variety is always better, it lets the player\u0027s creativity decide what their craft look like in more ways.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-15T00:06:01Z\u0022 title=\u002205/15/2015 12:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Bit Fiddler**"},{"CreatedByName":"ExplorerKlatt","CreatedById":107424,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T00:24:31Z","Content":"There is a download for the old kas parts on kas\u0027s curse page.
