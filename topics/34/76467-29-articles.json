The RTP Lite tech progression is very good in the way it\u0027s organized, but as you\u0027ve said, RftS breaks RealEngines, so I\u0027d probably look at a tech tree designed like that based on US/EU/USSR/Russian techs over the years, and contracts to match, including launching military and civilian satellites, exploratory missions, etc. It would be really nice if the contract system could instead of saying \u0022an orbit between xxxx and xxxx alt\u0022, define multiple orbital parameters.

IE don\u0027t want a generic tank of same characteristics as a Titan tank as found in FASA to have different mass/strength/etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Cost, everything has a price. So how do we deal with inflation...to me this requires another plugin to automatically adjust cost based upon inflation at that time. Obviously there are going to be some guesses here as cost figures are likely going to be few and far between. Then there is a point, cost figures are likely going to be for a whole launcher or at least pieces as an aggregate...so balancing the cost individual small pieces as found in KSP is going to be a challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*I agree with your contracts, I honestly haven\u0027t played with 0.24 contracts so I don\u0027t know the interface they used.
