I\u0027ve sent camlost a pull request, for now you can just grab AJE from my forked repo (that has the PR) rather than the original. There is nothing that can be done in RO/RP-0 since AJE does its patching on FINAL...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFriedrich Nietzsche: does Testflight report a failure at that point? Check the rocket-ship icon. Ah, nm, later you said that was it. Make sure you air-light the LR-87s, as samroberts mentioned the Titans with SRMs did not ground-light their engines, they lit them on SRM near-burnout (like, 5 seconds left). The issue with TF is that engines have rated burn times, and if you exceed them they\u0027re likely to fail...might also ping Agathorn, maybe the LR-87s don\u0027t have enough rated burntime for the IIIL application (although if memory serves the widebody core didn\u0027t burn longer, it had more fuel \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E more engines).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERothank: RCS, will investigate. However, Tweakscale will screw them up, so don\u0027t tweakscale them. Second issue, Tweakscale...sounds like there was an update and we\u0027re now mismatched; if you only get that issue when RO is installed, it\u0027s presumably an interaction issue. AJE needs to update for the latest FAR, please ask camlost to do so. (All it takes is a recompile.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOksbad: there\u0027s a lot that goes into making an engine restartable. First, has the high temperature melted anything you\u0027ll need again? Second, is the combustion chamber (or nozzle) now so ablated it\u0027s not safe to reuse? Third, how do you start up the turbopump, if there is one? Not needing an ignitor is important, but not the be-all/end-all when it comes to restartability. For example, the Apollo SPS was rated for essentially infinite restarts (although a set total burn time) because it was a pressure-fed hypergolic engine with ablative cooling: so long as there was still propellant to be fed to it, and the combustion chamber and nozzle hadn\u0027t ablated away too much, you could just open the vales and light it up (ullage willing). The Agena engine, however, was pump-fed, and thus needed to spin up its turbopumps before it could light its gas generator (which was there to power the turbopumps). A bit of a chicken-and-egg situation, but it could be gotten around by judicious use of stored electricity (IIRC) to spin up the turbopumps in the absense of the generator. That said, even with enough juice, after about 18 starts (well past the rated 15? Or was it 15 and 12?) stuff was getting too melty/corroded/whatever to work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe advantage of hypergolics isn\u0027t so much that they have infinite restarts, it\u0027s that they are \u003Cem\u003Estorable\u003C/em\u003E. LOX boils off. Means you can\u0027t store the missile, you have to fuel it up before launch--and that means you need a few hours\u0027 warning, not a few minutes. It\u0027s also an issue in space--that\u0027s why pretty much everyone uses hypergolics for on-orbit maneuvers and\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
