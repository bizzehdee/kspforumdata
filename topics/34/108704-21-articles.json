Can you check the GameData/Squad/Parts/CompoundParts folder to see if the fuel line folder is spelled \u0022FuelLine\u0022 or \u0022fuelLine\u0022. In Windows it is spelled fuelLine and it looks like the part model sharing feature of KSP is case sensitive, so changing it to \u0022FuelLine\u0022 in the part config breaks them. You can change the eva fuel line config file to look in the FuelLine folder instead of fuelLine and it should fix things, it\u0027s at the very top of the GameData/EVATransfer/EVAFuelLine/EVAFuelLine.cfg file (also make sure to delete the copy in the KSP/Parts folder, only use the GameData folders):\n\n    Change this:\n    \n    PART\n    {name = EVAfuelLinemodule = CompoundPartauthor = HarvesteRMODEL{\tmodel = Squad/Parts/CompoundParts/fuelLine/model\ttexture = model000, Squad/Parts/CompoundParts/fuelLine/model000 }\t\n    ...\n    \n    To this:\n    \n    PART\n    {name = EVAfuelLinemodule = CompoundPartauthor = HarvesteRMODEL{\tmodel = Squad/Parts/CompoundParts/FuelLine/model}\t\n    ...\n    \n    (the texture part isn\u0027t actually needed and doesn\u0027t do anything)\n\nI should probably file this as a bug report, since different spelling or case usage could break things for other mods, too."},{"CreatedByName":"cyberKerb","CreatedById":28891,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-30T15:17:01Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 2 hours ago, DMagic said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [@wile1411](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/28891-wile1411/) The portrait tooltips are mostly handled by stock KSP, Portrait Stats just adds some information.

I was getting a complete freeze of the game when trying to bring up a science experiment result. In this recent case it was specifically hitting the button \u0022Analyze Data:RADAR\u0022 from ScanSats Low Resolution Altimetry scanner. I\u0027m assuming it\u0027s not that mod/part causing the crash as I\u0027ve also has the issue with stock experiments on occasion. Also, by \u0022complete freeze\u0022, I mean that KSP stops all movement and the Windows waiting curser just spins waiting for a response from KSP. Interestingly I can move the window (I play in windowed mode) and it\u0027s just KSP tht seems stock in an internal/eternal loop somewhere. \n\nI\u0027ve manage to get a situation that is repeatable and I\u0027ve tried to lock down where the conflict is through scouring the logs, but so far nothing sticks out as an issue with everything seemingly normal until I hit that review data button in the right mouse menu button.\n\nThe additional wrinkle is that the logs also freeze when the game locks up. I\u0027ve tried to leave it overnight to see if it resolves itself with a timeout and hard crashes with some information in a log file, but unfortunately it seems to just stay at \u0022stuck\u0022 until I terminate through task manager.\n\nFor logs, I can grab the ksp.log file in the KSP root directory, but the last entry there is just \u0022Game Unpaused!\u0022 from when I was setting the logging to be on-screen. The output\\_log.txt file in the KSP\\_x64\\_Data - that one also has similar information stopping just after \u0022Game Unpaused!\u0022\n\nI was able to avoid the error by uninstalling Science Relay, but would still like to troubleshoot further and was hoping you might have/know something that might give more info?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-11-14T12:29:49Z\u0022 title=\u002211/14/2017 12:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 14, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by wile1411**"},{"CreatedByName":"DMagic","CreatedById":57416,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-14T22:46:34Z","Content":"[@wile1411](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/28891-wile1411/) The latest version has some extra logging whenever the science window is opened and when science is transmitted.

It only occurs when I have both Science Relay and CommNet mods in the same save .

This week I was trying to pull individual mods out to see what stop the problem= but no luck. I tried just with teh minimum amount of mods and found the issue went away, but then, so did a number of vessels that couldn\u0027t be loaded due to missing parts.\n\nHaving said that, [@TaxiService](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/74999-taxiservice/) did give me one great pointer to specifically check any mods that change antennas and see if that might help narrow down the suspects.

Turning off comm net fixes the problem and I can collect all the science I want. So though I would love to leave that on its really nice to have a work around for this problem. I also tried the Require Relay option you suggested with the other two options on, they were already on. At first I thought that had fixed the issue as normally I can only collect one or two experiments before I get the crash but this time I was able to collect about 10 in total when it crashed again in the exact same way as usual. Checked this twice with the same results. Turning off Require Relay just makes its so I can only collect one or two experiments again before crashing. Is there anything else I can try to help figure this out?"}]}
