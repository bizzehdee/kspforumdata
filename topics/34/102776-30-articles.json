The things that consistently blew were the reaction wheels in the nacelles (sandwiched between two tanks), and the solar panels - guaranteed to kerbang at timewarp, less likely at 1x. Never saw if any other components would go, since the first of those would destroy the ascent fuel and parachute as well, dooming the mission to F9. It\u0027s possible that if the SAS modules hadn\u0027t detonated (they did so instantly, with no thermal warning bars) then nothing would have overheated at all.\n\nI\u0027ll refine the lander for next run, dump the redundant Skipper engine, put some radiators on the nacelles, and push the SAS modules elsewhere in the stack, see if I can get them to settle down.\n\nMeantime, I think some orbiter probes to distant targets are necessary. Forgot what I\u0027ve set my science gain to, but it\u0027s clearly not a lot, and I feel like better tech is sorely needed... oh for a 2.5m reaction wheel!\n\nAlso, if any other NH users have some mission logs to share, I\u0027d love to see them!
