I\u0027ve installed Infernal Robotics a good half-dozen times, messed around with it for a few game sessions, and then promptly UNinstalled it again, because each time I try it thinking that \u0027this time it will be easier to create x ship that does all kinds of y things, it only ends up being even MORE complex and difficult than the last time I tried it. The only thing I\u0027ve really found it useful for is using 10 parts to perform a task that could just as well be accomplished by one or perhaps two well-designed and -animated custom made parts. Yes, it\u0027s modular, and the \u0027LEGO\u0027-like universality of the parts is attractive, but again, that same LEGO-ness creates the need to add way more parts and controls and commands than is practical or desirable, at least to me (and, apparently, Nothalogh, at least).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, it\u0027s not my intention to turn this into a \u0027bash IR\u0027 discussion thread, and I\u0027m sorry if I\u0027m encouraging too much topic-drifting. But in my opinion one well-designed custom VTOL engine using the Firespitter plugin, or even just the stock animation module, is still WAY better than using Infernal Robotics. And I apologize to the creators of that mod for criticizing it so bluntly, I know they\u0027ve put in a LOT of work to get it to where it is now.
