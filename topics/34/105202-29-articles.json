One would be the idea of a time-based mechanic - basically, the inherent recyclers (the things that provide heat, cooling, scrub CO2, etc.) would have a service life. So the built in ones might last 30 days, but for long journeys you will need more robust equipment (in the form of separate parts). Their efficiency would decay over time, so that giant recycling module you dropped on Duna ten years ago may still work, but not at full capacity).\n\nYes please, but not the actual parts, please - the idea of having \u0022maintenance\u0022, involving more-or-less abstracted swapping of internals is fine, but having to stick/unstick or just kill parts would be a bit annoying. I think you have similar mechanics in MKS already. Maybe something like the CactEye telescope mod (where there are small parts that need replacement) would be OK, but large-ish parts would be a bit too much of a bother.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E 2. In addition to resources and the mechanic above, where failure is life or death, add a \u0027happiness\u0027 factor, where the Kerbals need more space and more advanced facilities to keep them healthy and happy based on ship duration. The \u0027fail\u0027 penalty for this would be separately configurable - so a Kerbal squished into a lander can for ten years may not die, but they\u0027d be really grouchy. This would be a case where the lander can is good for, say, 30 days. But then you need simple habs to extend into the several months, and for super long term stuff, you will need centrifuges (for orbital stations) as well as medical bays, etc. to keep the Kerbals kicking.\n\nYou know KeepFit, right? It has a few rough edges, but I think it did remarkably well, all things considered. Making Kerbals frail was neat. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E 3. Automatic supply scavenging. If a Kerbal runs out of supplies, they can look not only in their current ship (and it\u0027s locked containers) but also other ships within a certain radius. This way, just by air dropping a bunch of supplies, Kerbals will happily EVA to pick them up. UKS already does this, but I\u0027d like it as something built into the core life support mod.\n\nYes please.\n\n\u003E I have a few other ideas, like enforcing temperature tolerances, etc. (so radiators are also need to keep crew alive), etc. but figured these were a good start\n\nYes - anything that makes Eve more Venus-like ;-)"},{"CreatedByName":"Kowgan","CreatedById":116874,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-17T18:26:48Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Could not help you without specific tbh\n\nJust want to confirm you were right all along.

I think Kerbals can live out their infinite lives perfectly happily in space/Eeloo if they have the right situation.\n\nThe thing that will make the difference is the interface. It\u0027s already getting a bit tough to tell in UKS, but a USILS update might be a great time to flesh out the UI to let us know why Kerbals are about to go on a murderous rampage, or be terrible at making me more machinery.\n\nI think a list with the status /Current state/ ideal state/ modifier would be handy; \n\n**LivingSpace**: Overcrowded / 12 Kerbals / *8 Kerbals*  / -50% Productivity \u0026 \u002B4.6 rage/sec\n\n**Food**: Ideal / 3 Food types / *3 food types* / \u002B100% Productivity\n\n**Temp**: Too cold / 4C /*15C-25C*  /-28% Productivity \u0026 \u002B25 Slugishness\n\nAnd maybe add ones for overworked (Modules running/kerbals) workspace crowding, low gravity weakness, communications with home and happiness luxuries like medbay or The Spacebar (Its the one part of a keyboard that gets kerbals drunk!

Since it looks like it just divides current supplies by the number of kerbals.
