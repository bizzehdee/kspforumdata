I\u0027m afraid the answer to all your questions is the correct one (yes engineer, yes read the manual, etc.). I did not mention that I got error messages many times while trying to re-attach the round-8 to my craft, though. Not always, and not always the same one, but I was never once, out of many attempts, able to get it to stick on, even though I had been able to with other parts. Maybe I\u0027ll try it with the Oscar B and see how it goes.\n\u003E KospY, I\u0027m very excited about the EVA tether. I think that will make zero-G work much easier.\n\nI know your problem: you can\u0027t attach parts radially if their config disallows it. You need to drag your part to a node:\n\n![UUpVfgz.png](http://i.imgur.com/UUpVfgz.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T11:57:23Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Currently there are two containers, the big 20.000L one and the small 1000L. The big container can contain small containers. That\u0027s as deep as currently possible.\n\u003E Bad idea imo.

For example, make a part only attachable on ground.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E - I would add a mallet as crude a tool which anyone can use to attach very light parts 0.05t and less.\n\u003E \n\u003E - Or another option, is to make a mallet attach things only to the ground. Very realistic.\n\u003E \n\u003E In both cases I really like the mallet idea.\n\nNo issue stacking containers if empty. But it should be posible stacking light stuff like we can do with some eva stuff. this is mostly relevant for small items who tend to be used a lot, the KAS connectors and strut connectors, small octagonal struts, perhaps small battery and solar panels.\n\nAgree that destroying stuff by using wrong tools is bad.\n\nOne nice thing might be an frame or breadboard everyone can mount things and remove from, thinking on science equipment mostly, as its expensive and nice to be able to move around."},{"CreatedByName":"Enceos","CreatedById":110725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T12:39:56Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E One nice thing might be an frame or breadboard everyone can mount things and remove from, thinking on science equipment mostly, as its expensive and nice to be able to move around.\n\nOvercomplication.
