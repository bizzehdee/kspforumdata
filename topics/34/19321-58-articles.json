As gravity is perpendicular to the axis we are interested in, it can be ignored without much impact, so the two primary forces we\u0027re looking at are Ft and Fd. I will also avoid going deeper into aerodynamic forces, as that is beyond my knowledge, and isn\u0027t strictly relevant for a hypothetical case where we\u0027re only considering two orientations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERecall that Newton\u0027s First Law describes the sum of all forces on an object, so we take those two forces, and look at their influence on our object. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the prograde case, Ft is acting in the \u002Bx, and Fd is acting in the -x. This means that the net force is Ft-Fd(or Ft \u002B -Fd if you prefer). In the Retrograde case, both vectors are aligned, and so the net force is Ft\u002BFd\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETherefore we have:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eprograde acceleration: ap=(Ft-Fd)/m\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eretrograde acceleration: ar=(Ft\u002BFd)/m\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, our mass is constant in each case, since you mentioned fuel level didn\u0027t change (or at least not enough to be significant.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETherefore, we can combine these equations by setting m=m, and get (Ft-Fd)/ap=(Ft\u002BFd)/ar, then simplify to ar=(Ft\u002BFd)*ap/(Ft-Fd). For the sake of math, let\u0027s say both thrust is 10, and drag is 1. Then, you have ar=11ap/9, or in plain words, the acceleration, which is proportional to the force felt by the tank, during retrograde is, in this case, 11/9 the acceleration during prograde. Even if we make drag 10 and thrust 1, that merely reverses the sign, indicating that our acceleration is in the opposite direction from what we assumed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease feel free to point out any mistakes I made in my analysis. Classical Mechanics is a few years behind me, and I was doing all the work in my head. Still, it\u0027s a very simple exercise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep in mind that DR only looks at acceleration, not forces. In Taniwha\u0027s example, the kerbal is under great compressive stress, but no acceleration, and so DR would be perfectly happy. Momentum and impulse are likewise irrelevant, as those only come into play when looking at a system over time. As we are only concerned with the peak acceleration, we can treat this as a static problem. This also avoids having to deal with all the nonsense of elasticity, exponential drag, etc...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-05T22:28:09Z\u0022 title=\u002209/05/2013 10:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 5, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Torminator\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-05T23:01:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ferram4\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ferram4\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAlright, the \u003Cstrong\u003E0.9.6.2 revision\u003C/strong\u003E is out, fixing the isShielded bug and the problems with my attempted fixes to Firespitter compatibility.
