However, Skillful allows you to have one craft do many different missions, reloading after each one, which means you can maintain a base/carrier independent of the KSC. The current drop tanks are a one-mission-only solution, and don\u0027t allow you to fly a mission without drop tanks to hit a close range target with more ordnance, resupply, then hit distant a target using drop tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003Ei dont think the hardpoints can carry usable resources but i may be wrong\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EYou may well be right - as I said, I have no experience with this sort of thing.
