I built a V-22 osprey a while back with two different deployable century guns. with this and horizontal control I can now make it hold a stable position for an extended period of time while manipulating the guns. A question I have is (and please forgive me if this was already asked I didn\u0027t see it yet) is there a way to tune the sensitivity of the stability hold, to react a little slower? With my Osprey the craft supported between two powerful engines is very heavy. This causes flex at the engine nacelles IR Rotatrons. And in turn the whole craft will continually bounce up and down attempting to hold a stable altitude. I managed to drastically reduce this issue by adding quantum struts between the engines and the fuselage (tacky). But I figured it was worth asking.

I understand it being a double edged sword. I remember seeing a real life demonstration of a drone rotor on the end of a fixed pendulum arm like a see saw. The design was to evaluate lag in a computer guidance system with physical hardware. Too much latency and it would react too late, causing a degrading oscillation up and down which would eventually cause the rotor to contact the ground. What they wound up doing was building in a certain amount of \u0022pre-cognition\u0022 I guess is the best answer. The idea is that it would react ahead of the problem instead of in response to it. I understand this is a very difficult problem as you would need to know the mass, thrust and so on of the given vehicle. And I am speaking very out of my depth on this one so I don\u0027t mean to sound like a know it all by any means. Just bouncing ideas around. What I am un-sure of is if this is an over compensation or under compensation issue. If it overshoots, the craft goes too high and cuts too much throttle. And in reverse falls to fast..... you get the idea. My thought was a buffered range of acceptable height. (a shock absorber) Say a range of 5 meters? But then have your mod split the difference and attempt to stay right at 2.5 in the center of the 5 meters. The idea is allow it to move up as well as down and the oscillation would be less aggressive causing less flex of an airframe and less aggressive up and down compensation would be required. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease don\u0027t get me wrong this mod is just great! And I haven\u0027t spent enough time tuning a vehicle to work well with your mod. So far I have had great results though.

The first is that when the engine nacells flex, the centerpoint of the vessel changes and since that is the altitude reference for the vessel, this means this mod sees the flex as an altitude change, even if the body of the vessel has stayed at the same altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other is that there is a very small delay in the control loop between when this mod sees the data from KSP and can pass command inputs back. (This is why you will never see the vessel stabilize at exactly your velocity or height setpoint.) As the flex results in such relatively small and fast changes, this control loop delay severely limits my ability to compensate for them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou don\u0027t say how big the bounce this flex is causing is, but if it roughly similar (or smaller) then the amount of flex happening, I pretty sure I can\u0027t do anything about that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf a tiny amount of flex (say under a meter) is causing the vessel to bounce up and down several meters, that is something I want to look at further as the reasons I\u0027ve stated above would not explain that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ED.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Galane","CreatedById":77949,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T05:19:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUser adjustable delay slider might fix the oscillation?

They are modified FS Rotors. I tripled the power output as well as tripled the reaction wheel torque. Honestly I\u0027m really beginning to think I barked up the wrong tree with my complaining. I\u0027ve been really focusing on messing with your mods the last couple of hours and I can\u0027t say enough good things about them. Between the two mods I can now land my osprey anywhere I want, with ease. If the only downfall is the fact that the nacelles wiggle slightly unless they are secured with quantum struts, I can live with that. Really thank you for putting this together.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
