When on the target body you activate your sensors and start data collection on the DAN, which will generate data at a rate based on the number and type of sensors active on the vessel. Then deploy an antenna and begin transmitting the data back to mission control, at a rate based on the size of the largest active antenna and the range to mission control. To accommodate differences in data generation and use, and possible power constraints preventing sending data as it is generated (both generating and sending data requires a lot of power), the DAN contains a data storage buffer (possibly add a battery-like buffer addon part).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESensors from mod parts could be determined by reading the module definitions of a part, picking out all the stock sensor types plus any mod sensors like kethane-based ones, cameras, and even lazor systems.

My craft\u0027s jet stage has 8 ram intakes on the side attached to cubic octagonal struts. Lowering your throttle makes the engines take less air to run, though very high up it becomes pretty much impossible to manually get the throttle in the tiny sweet spot between \u0022throttle off\u0022 and \u0022flame out\u0022. Being pointed closer to the direction you\u0027re moving also helps.\u003Cp\u003EMechjeb can handle auto throttling to prevent flame outs and I\u0027d suggest using it since it can handle the fine throttle control all the way out of atmosphere. If you\u0027re not using MechJeb keep the throttle open all the way until you flame out. After flaming out right click the engine to see its status and lower throttle until it starts back up, then move the throttle up a little. Keep flaming out, restarting, and adding a little throttle until you can\u0027t get it to start back up. It\u0027s possible to keep raising your orbit with jet engines all the way out of atmosphere with Mechjeb but even without it you can keep your orbit from degrading until you\u0027re so high that drag isn\u0027t going to slow you down very much. Around 60km is how high you should get before you stop using the jet. If you\u0027re using more than one jet engine this method won\u0027t work though since you\u0027ll end up spinning out when one engine flame outs before another.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just tried launching my craft completely without Mechjeb and managed to get it to orbit using 17.6 more seconds of fuel than my launch above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, note that my craft\u0027s winglets are set so they hit the ground instead of the engine. If the engine is landed on it tends to break off. You can still recover the broken off engine, but if you land on it hard enough it will explode and be unrecoverable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
