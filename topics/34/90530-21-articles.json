Which will likely get the issue fixed, but isn\u0027t terribly conducive to mod authors keeping track of their metadata files. It\u0027s very confusing if you, as an author who made their own CKAN definition, come back to it after a couple months to make a change, only to find out that people completely unrelated to you have changed your metadata multiple times to suit their own ideas without even mentioning it to you. That\u0027s why you should always come to the mod thread first and ask, like Prezombie did. Even if the author doesn\u0027t bother to manage their mod\u0027s CKAN listing, it\u0027s the polite thing to point out/request permission for changes made to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn case of CTT (and many of Nertea\u0027s mods), I\u0027m responsible for most of the current relationship settings, such as the conflicts. Technically. Unless changes are made without my knowledge, of course. I intentionally set conflict entires for \u003Cem\u003Eall\u003C/em\u003E tech trees I found at the time that weren\u0027t specifically CTT extensions (like SETI is), because the first and foremost assumption is that a tech tree mod throws out the stock tree and replaces it with a new one. That makes any two such mods incompatible by default. I can\u0027t really invest the time to track all of them all the time on the off chance that one of them adds a CTT compatibility mode. However, it\u0027s a perfectly easy thing to change once pointed out, so I\u0027ll make a pull request later today. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-21T07:25:36Z\u0022 title=\u002210/21/2015 07:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nertea","CreatedById":83952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-21T17:07:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you, Streetwind.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
