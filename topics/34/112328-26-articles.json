This is defined as 30 EC units for all the DeepFreeze parts by default (of course you can change it if you so desire). As long as your vessel is generating 30 units per physics frame then it will continue to consume 30 units until the 3000 is met.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Are you saying this is not working as described above?  \n\u003E \n\u003E If so, then it is not because of DeepFreeze but probably changes to the way resources are handled in stock from 1.2 onwards.\n\u003E \n\nJust looking back and noticed your edit here...

I had a generator designed to one-shot generate the 3000 in a few seconds, and it\u0027s power was being dumped overboard as far as I could tell.  The same generator had worked pre-1.2."}]}
