I used to use \u0026 recommend the ADIOS tech tree, but it\u0027s pretty much abandoned now i think. Finding the right one with the compatibility i need is pretty tough, so i usually just use the CTT and cut my science returns waaaay down to make it a struggle.\n\nYeah life support can be tricky with NH, some planets take decades to reach. I recommend USI life support if you\u0027re interested, as the crew doesn\u0027t die, they just go on strike, damaging part of your ships (which can be switched off on the cfg).\n\nI have rules for my games too, I usually RP my games - probe has to get to planet first \u0026 scan it (i use remote tech as well so it\u0027s crucial i have a network), manned missions can only be landed after scansat has finished mapping the world (apart from in the home system - I justify this as the planet is directly observable from the homeworld), no more than 2 probe landings can be made before a manned mission....and set up stations wherever feasible."},{"CreatedByName":"Mischief","CreatedById":105311,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T02:57:02Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E My favoured tree in 0.90 was [Mod Oriented Tech Tree](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/90938-Mod-Oriented-Tech-Tree-%28January-5-v0-3-1%29), and the author has been updating it recently, so that might be a very viable option now too ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) Been using \u0027plain old\u0027 [Community Tech Tree](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100385-1-04-Community-Tech-Tree-2-1-last-updated-06-05-15) so far and... well, it\u0027s done me ok to the point of one manned Mun landing, and probes orbiting\\* Serran, Aptur, Lave and Laythe, but it\u0027s got some empty nodes (presumably I lack some mods) and things like rover wheels are still quite deep.

Your Kerbals go without food for a week and they quit working until they\u0027re fed, that simple. You can easily take steps to put a couple of years supplies on a mission or even better build ships with a recycling/food production setup - think of it like a greenhouse and recycler. Probably about like living on algae for a couple years but it beats starving!

However, once you get to the point where you can reliably send interplanetary missions out, balance shifts and the sheer amount of science available in the system (no matter how much i cut it down) makes end game pretty easy. \\*sigh\\* the troubles of balancing science ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Not sure I can agree with this.

Ernus sits in a sma where the ambient temperature is 1500-1600K, you really need to build your ships to suit. Kerbals only get about 10 seconds on the surface before they blow up!
