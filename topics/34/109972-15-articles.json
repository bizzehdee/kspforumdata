Now utilizes a module manager config, eliminating prefab manipulation in game.  \n\n\\* New:  Code refactored to improve performance and garbage collection.  \n\n\\* Fixed: Some parts containing ModuleDockingNode without a referenceNodeName would be rendered impassable in some nodes.  \n\n\\* Fixed: NRE generated during Vessel load. The addition of a female kerbal broke the CLS Module attachment code when a vessel is loaded at Flight.   \n\n         (This was a old undetected bug, that may explain some parts not showing as passble)  \n\n\\* Fixed: Spammed Index out of range error during space changes while CLS Window is opened.\n\nNOTE:  as with all releases, there may be issues, and possible issues with existing saves that previously had CLS in place.  Be sure to back up your game save if you had CLS previously installed on the game save from KSP 1.1.3.\n\nThanks again for your patience!

RL has been kicking my behind of late :). \n\nFirst with no additional information besides that it is difficult to know exactly what you are doing, but I will venture a guess.  You have CLS installed and you are attempting a stock game crew transfer.  By default, CLS overrides the Crew transfer system and will not allow transfers if the target part is not \u0022Connected to\u0022 the source part by an internal pathway.  If you wish to transfer to such parts you will have to disable the CLS portion via the CLS options menu.

Usually it is simple, but there are times when a part has some \u0022interesting\u0022 features. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022) \n\nFor other folks that may be wondering about 1.2.9 and the upcoming 1.3 release of KSP, I cannot update this mod until [@sarbian](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/57146-sarbian/) releases a new version of Module Manager.  As far as I know, he is waiting for 1.3 to release before that will happen.  Please correct me if I\u0027m wrong.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-05-22T17:46:16Z\u0022 title=\u002205/22/2017 05:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMay 22, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Papa\\_Joe**"},{"CreatedByName":"linuxgurugamer","CreatedById":129964,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-22T18:34:03Z","Content":"Re. the K2, it had a patch, but was incorrect.

So you need to add that to the parts.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 23 minutes ago, usulrasolas said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Posted this in the PicoPorts thread as well.  \n\u003E \n\u003E Looking to make a config file for CLS and PicoPorts to work together.  \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E     \n\u003E     \n\u003E     @PART[PicoPortPlus]:NEEDS[ConnectedLivingSpace]\n\u003E     {MODULE{\tname = ModuleConnectedLivingSpace\tpassable = true\tpassableWhenSurfaceAttached = true}\n\u003E     }\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The above code does work.
