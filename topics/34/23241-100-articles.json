I built an 8 engine VTOL on a small plane, I\u0027m using it to pick up Kethane from my Kerbal Kethane miner and want it to have a snappy response hence the engines. Anyway on my first flight of this plane I got distracted for about 20 seconds whilst at 20,000km and next thing I noticed I had flamed out and was well and truly heading for space, 120,000km\u0027s out or some such. If I had a small rocket and some oxidizer on board circlisation would not have been a problem. Now, I look at the numbers of the VTOL jets vs the stock jets and they seem fairly balanced, perhaps a little too light.
