So yes the pods will drain first, and no that doesn\u0027t make the most sense. However, it shouldn\u0027t be too big an issue for reentry as your kerbals can go for one hour without resources and reentry doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t take that long. Just make sure you don\u0027t jettison everything until you are definably coming down.
