Those values need tweaked, since the 500 science nodes are going to take almost 75 days. Do keep in mind that the 90 point nodes will take 40 days at level 1, but you can upgrade to level 2 and they\u0027ll only take 20 (effective immediately, including on nodes that are part way completed). I think I\u0027ll probably cut those times in half or more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe issue you\u0027re having is that the R\u0026amp;D center controls the speed of the build rates, while upgrading the VAB only gives you additional rates.

I wound up having to scrap BTSM because of the upgraded building issue.

It also looks like it would\u0027ve made my other parts packs go away. Such a bummer that BTSM doesnt really work with other mods.

Just be warned that KSP really doesn\u0027t like turning a Vessel back into a Craft, so it can get super buggy. KCT will make a quicksave beforehand, so you can always load that if it gets too bugged. If it\u0027s just part of a vessel (like a booster) then you should just recover it normally and use the part inventory (which doesn\u0027t have the same bugginess, but still takes about 10x less time to build)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also just up the Inventory Effect if 1/10 build times aren\u0027t low enough for you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
