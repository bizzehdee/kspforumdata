If someone removes a node and puts it back, TweakScale must assume that it was moved intentionally (this is done by procedural parts for example). \n\nJSI could save the current position of a node when removing it. This would allow to switch them on and off for a manipulated part, but still break if you rescale it while nodes are switched off.
