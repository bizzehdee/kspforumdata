Do you have any idea how to fix this so I can fix it in my game until the next update gets uploaded. BTW, All other planets as far as I can tell, all look as they should. Great mod though. It\u0027s one hell of an improvement over the stock planets. Any help you could provide in fixing this issue would be greatly appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/77523-0-23-5-Better-Atmospheres-V5-June-14th-2014?p=1228293\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1228293\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/77523-0-23-5-Better-Atmospheres-V5-June-14th-2014?p=1228293\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1228293\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bignick277","CreatedById":75891,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-01T09:36:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RogueMason\u0022 data-cite=\u0022RogueMason\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E@bignick: You probably have another config file in the Clouds folder.
