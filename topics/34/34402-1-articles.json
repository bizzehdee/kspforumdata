Removes the background starfield texture to provide a more realistic effect of the darkness of space. Also, all sounds are muted during EVAs to simulate that the lack of air prevents propagation of sound. Instead, a spacesuit breathing sound effect is added. A cockpit sound effect has also been added when in internal view, but that\u0027s just a gimmick. I hope these two changes will provide a more immersive experience.
