Each experiment has several values associated with it that are used in assigning different contract types. All of my experiments (except the anomaly scanner, which requires special treatment) and all of the non-Kerbal (this is an unmanned-focused mod after all) stock experiments have been added. Any standard science experiment could be added so long as the proper format is followed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EContract descriptions are also included in this config file, allowing for easy creation of more; they make sense too. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe simplest type of contract is just an extension of the regular science contracts. Instead of asking for any science from a particular body these will ask for a specific experiment in a specific location, and biome in some cases. These contracts are selected based on the currently available science parts and your progression through career mode. These contracts aren\u0027t repeatable and they are only given for experiments that still have remaining science to collect, ie. they won\u0027t ask you to conduct an experiment with only 1 or 2 remaining science points to recover, so it is possible to finish all of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are also several survey types of contracts. These contracts ask you to perform a number of experiments from a given location. There are four of these type: orbital surveys, ground surveys, biological activity surveys, and asteroid surveys. These contracts select experiments of the appropriate type from categorized lists and assign a target planet for you to study. Planets are selected based on the contract prestige (the number of stars) and your progression through career mode. Only untracked asteroids can be selected for asteroid surveys. These don\u0027t actually consider the amount of science remaining for any given experiment, but since they are only given in limited numbers I don\u0027t think that\u0027s too much of a problem. I also might reduce the science gain from contract completion based on how much science the experiments actually recover.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m currently working on anomaly contracts. These will focus heavily on the Anomalous Signal Scanner, obviously, but I also want to incorporate other experiments.

I think I\u0027ve worked through all of them, at least all of them that don\u0027t require an overhaul of how I handle asteroid science... I still want to run through some things again to make sure it\u0027s all at least working mostly right, but I\u0027ll try to release a test update tomorrow. I\u0027m sure there are plenty of ways to break my contracts that I haven\u0027t though of. The rewards and other parameters aren\u0027t balanced at all, that\u0027s something which other people probably have a better idea of than me, so that will need work too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing I noticed, that I\u0027m sure pretty much everyone who has tried out career mode has noticed, is that the stock contract window isn\u0027t that helpful. It\u0027s ok for checking things at a glance, but I don\u0027t like that it\u0027s so small, can\u0027t be expanded, and can\u0027t be moved. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConsider this a very early preview, just imagine that it\u0027s a week from now and it looks prettier and has better functionality. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now it performs the basic task of showing you all of the your active contracts and changes color accordingly when they complete. I need to add toolbar functionality (which is simple), make a little grabbing icon to expand the window in the corner (fairly easy), and make the contract parameters collapsible like in the stock window (maybe not so easy, I have no idea really).
