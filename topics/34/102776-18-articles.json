It has made my current Lets Play significantly more interesting. I had also experienced the ~1400m camera glitch when I updated to 1.5 and wanted to add some things that I had noticed, in hopes that it can be properly squashed.\n\nComparing 1.5 to 1.4.21, this error DOES NOT occur until the 1.5 version of Kopernicus/Config/System.cfg is overwritten/added. Currently I am using all of the 1.5 files with the old System.cfg instead of the new one, it seems to be working fine. (I compared the two and only really see the addition of PQS to all bodies and light adjustments... nothing jumps out)\n\nThis does appear to simply be a camera issue, but it causes an eye twitch with every launch. I noticed that this happens about the same time there is a starburst puff of smoke that shoots out that does not occur in the stock version of the game. Also if the camera mode is \u0022Locked\u0022 or the vessel is being viewed at an angle greater than 45 degrees above, this jump does not occur. If the ship is being viewed from below, the same time this occurs that camera jumps to a side view on its own (none of this mattering with stock KSP of course).\n\nI tested multiple scenarios in a clean stock installation with only New Horizons so there are no other mod influences. An additional thing that I will add is that when changing between having the mod and not having the mod, removing the New Horizons, Kopernicus, and ModuleManager files from GameData would result in me having no parts in the VAB, at all. Starting a new game would result in the same thing, I think it may be tied to the persistent file from the save being loaded. Deleting any games that existed during New Horizons allowed me to start fresh without issue.\n\nLooking forward to all of the improvements to the celestial bodies! It will take me long enough to advance Career far enough to explore them that they will be in great shape by the time I reach them. \n\n-Tynrael"},{"CreatedByName":"cipherpunks","CreatedById":114858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T18:37:06Z","Content":"so,[**KillAshley**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/members/132074-KillAshley), have You been able to integrate NH\u002BOPM\u002BK\u002B ?

A couple more things.\n\nThe 1450 meter thing over KSC is not just a camera glitch. If you let a spacecraft fall through that altitude over KSC, it will explode when its hits 1450. \n\nAlso, the heat on Sonnah has actually caused some problems with spacecraft being built around probe modules (Some have a 1200 heat limit. I\u0027m having trouble with the HECS in particular at the moment). I\u0027ve had it explode a couple times around the 350,000 meter range. I\u0027m trying to do a recovery mission with a grappler for a part in low orbit at 318k altitude and its driving me freakin crazy. The delta V required to climb back out of a low orbit around Sonnah is ridiculous. Its like 3200 delta V to get back to Kerbin. Between that and the heat issues it turned into a ridiculous 8 hours of trying and I finally gave up. \n\nAnother general question. I\u0027ve noticed that atmospheres around your planets dont seem to gradually get thicker very smoothly. Once you go under a certain altitude, the meter suddenly jumps and boom, you\u0027re in the soup. This can make aerobraking quite difficult, you have to be extremely precise to pull it off on these new planets. Is this by design, or are you aware of it?\n\nThanks!\n\nGreg"},{"CreatedByName":"KillAshley","CreatedById":128696,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T20:45:23Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Okay so basically, im not sure why the texture res looks like this. i have settings on full res, but the added planets still seem pixelly fairly close up? on the map view they seem fine though, its almost like they get worse when i go out of map view.\n\u003E i dunno if this is just the textures, or if i have an issue with another mod or something\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/45380685815191773/3C895C3EBEB6DF879988484F9D3B27FDAC8356EE/?interpolation=lanczos-none\u0026output-format=jpeg\u0026output-quality=95\u0026fit=inside|1024:576\u0026composite-to=*,*|1024:576\u0026background-color=black](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/45380685815191773/3C895C3EBEB6DF879988484F9D3B27FDAC8356EE/?interpolation=lanczos-none\u0026output-format=jpeg\u0026output-quality=95\u0026fit=inside%7C1024:576\u0026composite-to=*,*%7C1024:576\u0026background-color=black)\n\nThe vie you show is under 120km, right? thats the approx change-over from the high-res map view texture the the actual generated terrain itself.

Hopefully it\u0027ll cause less explosions ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif). The problem with the massive delta-v requirements from returning from low Sonnah orbit, is caused by it\u0027s gravity. I could lower it to greatly reduce the needed power, but that would raise the requirements for going to other planetary systems, so it\u0027s kind of a pain to try and balance, this is somehing that unfortunately won\u0027t be addressed for quite a while\n\nAs for the atmospheres, they follow stock pressure curves exactly, theres an issue that I\u0027m aware of that makes the atmospheres a little strange sometimes and it\u0027s already fixed for the next release, however the curves for pressure follows stock exactly...planets are modeled from Kerbin, and the gas giants are modeled from Jool\u0027s curves, they are derived from a readout of atmosphereheight% against pressure% along the scale...just theres still outstanding issues that i have been (regretfully) too lazy to fix previously.![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Greg310","CreatedById":99471,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T20:55:12Z","Content":"Thanks for the responses, keep up the good work!"},{"CreatedByName":"Greg310","CreatedById":99471,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T21:55:24Z","Content":"Hey so I\u0027m trying to get KSPRC working with NH.
