I understood coding enough to know what was basically possible and what was not. I also understood texturing and art assets enough to know that artists needed to be periodically beaten or they would bloat their texture files to untenable sizes. That\u0027s the games industry for you though, 150-200 people working on a project, and about 1/4 of the managers ever actually knowing what is going on. You\u0027d be shocked at the shear amount of waste that goes into your typical AAA game...the fans think its some great magic being made, when the miracle really lies in the fact that anything gets made at all given the chaos and politics. I purposely avoided learning programming until this point for 2 basic reasons - #1 I was already annoying enough imposing on the design team, I\u0027m sure the programmers were happier being left alone. #2 Design done right, and management done right, are already massive skill sets, to pick up programming when I had perfectly good programmers to do my bidding would have been a waste.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, settled on making a \u0022core mod\u0022 project to make a teaser sampler of all the different good mods that are out. I\u0027ll post the full manifesto in the working section. Basic idea would be to gather together the best mods, strip them of all redundant parts, interconnect them where feasible using each other\u0027s modules, and then balance all parts to Squad\u0027s precedents. Sort of like the KSPX manifesto with much looser rules. Mod makers would have to do nothing except give permission, and Core users would be directed to get the \u0022full version\u0022 or \u0022realism balanced version\u0022 of whichever parts they like best. Hopefully most mod-makers would be on board, but many are very touchy about their stuff...especially the \u0022realism\u0022 fans. This would also keep the resource thing from spiraling out of control and have a lot of other benefits to the lay user as well as future mod-makers.
