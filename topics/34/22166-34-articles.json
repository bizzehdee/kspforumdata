Between Kethane, H.O.M.E. And the Extraplanetary launchpads mod that just came out, we now have all the utilities needed for complete colonization of the stars. All that remains is duct taping them together\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKethane allows us to create all fuels we need. In the case of a long-term base, the atmospheric miner in H.O.M.E. Lets us have a functionally infinite supply of liquid fuel and oxidizer on atmospheric planets in addition to habitation for our kerbals. This means we can gas up and crew up anywhere with kethane deposits and/or an atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe new Extraplanetary Launchpads mod allows us to harvest ore in the same manner as kethane (actually exactly the same as kethane) to the end of processing it into metal and assembling ships from it. This means that leapfrogging and colonization is now a potential reality.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point in time, the Extraplanetary Launchpads are incompatible with Kethane because of a shared .dll file, but that\u0027s a simple matter of adding a secondary mineral spawn attribute to the generator and/or creating a parallel resource.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll that remains to be done is for somebody to work on crosspeak between them and to put some spit and polish on the meshes (because lets face it, Launchpads still needs some heavy work). Once launchpads and kethane can crossspeak, a line of code to probe fuel capacities of the vehicle being spawned in could be added, requiring that you have enough processed fuels or raw kethane to fuel it up before you\u0027re allowed to spawn it in. Or, a more ambitious and undoubtedly more complex method would be that if you don\u0027t have enough fuel, it spawns in only partially filled. Though, due to obvious problems with manually setting resource quantities on the fly, that would be more trouble than it\u0027s worth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve already been tinkering on my own install and I\u0027ve had marginal success with combining these three mods, but I think if the original creators of Kethane were to get their hands into this, it would be the Midas touch it needs. As an added note, and what I think is the most pivotal point of my entire proposal, the ability to spawn ships in on other planets and moons is still very low on Squad\u0027s to-do list, meaning:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EA Kethane update of this fashion would NOT become repugnant in an update that adds vanilla mining!\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis means working on Kethane updates has purpose again!
