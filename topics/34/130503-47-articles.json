You may be right that it\u0027s offset, I haven\u0027t fully crunched the math - but LANTR and other LOX NTRs in \u0022afterburner\u0022 mode \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/enginelist2.php#lantr\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Egenerate 3x as much thrust using 4x as much mass\u003C/a\u003E.

In many of them, the engines are usually high(er) Isp and low(er)\u00A0thrust than chemical propulsion, and additional propellant (or another propellant with a higher MMW) is injected to increase the mass leaving the nozzle and improve thrust. In may of those cases, the added propellant acts as a coolant due to a higher specific heat. (an example is a LHyd engine using H2O for thrust) Additionally, there\u0027s other ways to reject heat through the use of flash coolers of other types of heat sinks which can be flushed into space (i.e. single use) to reject large amounts of heat other than through radiation.

But what I do is to use nuclear reactors (from NF electric)\u00A0to power the tanks.

I\u0027m at work, so I don\u0027t have a screenshot at hand, but one way I design ships to minimize power requirements is to build them around\u00A05m tanks rather than the large spherical ones and then radially attach the smaller spherical tanks in rings alongside the central tank. That way, you can set the fuel priorities of the external spherical tanks so they are used from bottom to top and stage them as they become depleted, so you no longer need to power them. Essentially: the payload sits atop two 5m cryotanks with the engine at the bottom. Around those tanks, there are four \u0022rings\u0022 of six radial decouplers (per \u0022ring\u0022), each with fuel crossfeed enabled and holding a smaller spherical tank.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat means you\u0027ll need less power while coasting towards Jool because one or two rings would have been staged while making the trans-Jool injection burn at Kerbin. On the downside, if you\u0027re refueling at your destination for the trip back, you won\u0027t have the ship\u0027s full fuel capacity, as you\u0027ll only have the center tanks for the journey back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brigadier","CreatedById":147109,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-10-08T16:47:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223864994\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022130503\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221602154957\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022207041\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sesshaku\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 hours ago, Sesshaku said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nhow do I apply the patch?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/207041-sesshaku/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022207041\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/207041-sesshaku/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Sesshaku\u003C/a\u003Esimply copy the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E code into a txt file, and save it with a descriptive name and a .cfg extension.\u00A0 Place the file in your GameData folder (I use a unique folder within GameData to store all of these personal .cfg files so they\u0027re easy to find and aren\u0027t overwritten by mod updates).\u00A0 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E reads all .cfg files in GameData at loadup.\u00A0 Since these two \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E patches are marked FINAL, they\u0027ll be implemented towards the end of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E patch sequence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nertea","CreatedById":83952,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-10-08T17:11:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223864900\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022130503\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221602122052\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022207041\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sesshaku\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n15 hours ago, Sesshaku said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/SSyGd25.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EPhoto 2\u003C/a\u003E Once I have the complete ship.
