It first looks for the module for the Rapier engine and, if it is there, it tries to handle the two engine modules. Next it looks for any ModuleEnginesFX module. If it finds any then it gets the first one and uses it for the thrust/isp etc of the whole engine.

I only have the MM config to add build and flight to all command pods and probe cores in my realism overhaul install (that needs module manager for lots of stuff anyway) though I haven\u0027t got around to updating it to 0.23.5 yet due to realism overhaul issues with updated mods. I still tend to stick a build and flight engineer board on everything out of habit. I just wish I could get into the same habit with solar panels/RTGs... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E Hmmm, perhaps a mod that gives advice about your design would be good. It could display a window listing things that you\u0027ve forgotten when you go to launch (e.g. if you haven\u0027t got at least one RTG or deployed solar panel, or if your staging looks obviously messed up, launch clamps on wrong stage etc) and give you the choice of continuing or cancelling the launch...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my various development and test installs, to speed up the edit/recompile/test cycle, I tend to only have the absolute minimum of mods I need to do what I need to. Testing KER with full realism overhaul is painful as it takes KSP about 8 minutes to start up on the machine I\u0027m currently using...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-06T19:37:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Padishar\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Padishar\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYour craft file still says 0.23.0.
