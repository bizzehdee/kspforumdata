The reduced mass (and improved thrust and therefore fewer engines) of a H2 upper stage makes your first (liquid fuel) stage a lot lighter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI agree that the H2 tanks are somewhat absurdly heavy, but I also note that all KSP tanks and structural components are. I think my preference for how this is to be resolved would be for the non-cryogenic tanks to have a much higher boil off rate and be similar weight to the other tanks (for LOX) or even somewhat lighter (for H2). Also some kind of cube-squared benefit to larger tanks (you spend a much smaller mass on insulation per-volume on large tanks) would be nice, but as I don\u0027t have the skills/motivation to program it myself I can merely suggest it and hope that ialdabaoth implements it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stochasty","CreatedById":57264,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-28T00:28:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022The Lone Wolfling\u0022 data-cite=\u0022The Lone Wolfling\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...is this intended?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s closer to the RL performances of various engines, although in the real world the engines have much better TWR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, because of scaling issues in KSP, it breaks the game. It takes around 4.5km/s delta-v to achieve LKO in KSP (with FAR, it drops further to ~3.5km/s); it takes closer to 10km/s delta-v to achieve LEO in real life. Delta-v costs for maneuvering around the solar system are also higher by about the same factor of 2.5 for RL versus KSP. Thus, a 10km/s delta-v rocket in KSP is the rough equivalent of a 25km/s rocket in RL, meaning that in KSP with modular fuel tanks it\u0027s quite easy to build high-payload SSTOs (without even utilizing air-breathing engines). Adding FAR to the mix, I managed to build a ship theoretically capable of single-stage-to-Eve-landing-and-return (total delta-v expenditures are on the order of 12km/s for such a trip).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus, sadly, while this mod adds a lot of interesting realism, once you understand the system it makes the game too easy. I would recommend rescaling the fuel tank mass ratios to put them back closer into line with those in the stock game, even if fuel tanks in the stock game are unrealistically heavy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frederf","CreatedById":3844,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-28T06:19:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETime scales are also a bit skewed for boil off.
