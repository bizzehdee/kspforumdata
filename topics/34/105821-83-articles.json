And they all depend on RPM.\n\u003E \n\nI have to agree, I think this is the biggest roadblock to MAS being used.  One of my goals early in MAS development was to create MAS versions of all of the ASET props, so that a (probably very large) \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E patch could \u0027upgrade\u0027 RPM cockpits to MAS by replacing old props with new props.  However, with hundreds of MAS props, and a conversion that can not be completely automatic, it is something that would take many, many hours.  I\u0027ve already spent hundreds of hours working on MAS over the last three years, and other things have happened in Real Life, so I no longer have many, many hours to spend writing the config files and testing the new props.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 3 hours ago, Manul said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Does MAS affect the framerate less than RPM?\n\u003E \n\nI believe that it does.  I\u0027ve measured the effect of MAS on framerate, and it is usually only a couple of milliseconds per FixedUpdate - and that is with a complex IVA that uses Lua scripts, multiple MFDs, and dozens of props.\n\nRPM had inefficiencies in its design that were not easy to remove without breaking existing RPM cockpits.  One of those inefficiencies caused the upside down MFDs that happened with 1.8 (and with 1.5 or 1.6 - whenever we had the last big Unity update).  Another inefficiency is that literally every prop uses a few CPU cycles during Update and FixedUpdate, even if they\u0027re not doing anything differently than last the update.\n\nRPM also was designed so some instruments and MFDs would not update as frequently, and that leads to a perception of lag, because you can see MFD values (like altitude) not updating continuously.  That does not affect actual frame rate, but it provides the impression that RPM lags.\n\nMore advanced IVA designs, like most of what alexustas created, would benefit a lot from the efficiency MAS adds for certain tasks.\n\nAbout the only way I could make MAS faster is if I wrote a complete Lua to IL translator (instead of the partial one that MAS has), and I integrated it into core KSP code, instead of a mod.  Or I redesign KSP to use native code, instead of C# and Unity.  But that\u0027s far more work than I\u0027m willing to do for a mod that doesn\u0027t provide me a paycheck. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"Jacke","CreatedById":103694,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-16T04:12:12Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 4 hours ago, MOARdV said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E One of those inefficiencies caused the upside down MFDs that happened with 1.8 (and with 1.5 or 1.6 - whenever we had the last big Unity update).\n\u003E \n\nThat was 1.4 that last changed the Unity version (and had up to 1.4.5 in minor releases).\n\nDo any existing MAS IVAs use parts of ASET Avionics and ASET Props?"},{"CreatedByName":"CSA","CreatedById":97949,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-16T10:07:38Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 15 hours ago, Manul said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m currently using Defender Cobra M5 but I can not recommend anyone to use this monstrosity since it requires tons of upgrade parts from VKB-sim and these parts are not produced or sold anymore.

It allows you to batch-process props that have a common look-and-feel without having to copy/paste/edit every single prop.  Hopefully, it\u0027s easy enough to figure out.
