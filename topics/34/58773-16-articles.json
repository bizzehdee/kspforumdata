Squad only allows two attach nodes to be used for child-\u0026gt;parent attachment in the editor (i.e. when first placing the docking port in the game, only two attach nodes will be valid). This preference is determined by the order in which they appear in the part file (first and last, as I recall), so there\u0027s nothing I can do to work around it. This means that you can\u0027t use an inline port as a \u0022T\u0022 where the vertical leg of the T is the existing stack you\u0027re building in the editor, which is a bummer.
