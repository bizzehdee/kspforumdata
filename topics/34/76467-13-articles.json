The things I\u0027ve established so far:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. I was a bit off in my initial measurements, the biggest of Porkjet\u0027s habitats, PA550, is actually slightly larger in your config than the real-life Transhab, not slightly smaller. In any case, the original Transhab is among the smaller expandable habitats proposed , so it probably shouldn\u0027t be the biggest habitat available in RO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. An expandable habitat roughly the size that PA550 is now in your config would weigh about 13.5 tonnes as an empty shell, about 23 tonnes as a bare-bones space station module, and about 27 tonnes in deep-space mission configuration (this includes ECLSS and communication equipment). This would be considered a sufficient habitation for a crew of six on a Mars mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. The dimensions. I\u0027m only talking about the inflatable part of the modules in its fully deployed state, since it\u0027s the dimension that matters most. In your current config, PA 330 is approximately 7 x 7 m (height x diameter, both external) and PA 550 is approximately 9.35 x 9.35 m. Real life designs and proposals are: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBA 330 9.5 x 7.6 m, 330 m3 volume, crew of 6, 23 tonnes including furnishings;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBA 2100 18.6 x 13.4, 2100 m3 volume, crew of up to 18, 70 tonnes empty shell, 100 tonnes including furnishings;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBA 1150 no data, 1150 m3 volume, no data, 70 tonnes (furnished, I guess?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETranshab 8.5 x 8.3 m, 342 m3 volume, crew of 6, 13.2 t as an empty shell, 27 t furnished for a deep space mission; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESundancer 7 x 7 m, 180 m3 of volume, crew of 3, 8.6 t as an empty shell;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t seem to find any data/proposals on anything resembling the F.L.A.T. part, and only one data point for the centrifuge - the inflatable centrifuge on Nautilus-X would be about 18 m in diameter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGiven that none of the modules listed above has actually flown yet, I think we are under no obligation to copy their dimensions exactly. Therefore the least labor-intensive solution would probably be to assume that PA 330 (inflato2) equals Sundancer, and therefore has a dry mass of at least 8.6 tonnes and a crew capacity of 3, whereas PA 550 (inflato1) represents BA 330/Transhab and therefore has a dry mass of at least 13.2 tonnes and a crew capacity of 6. These masses however are for empty shells; given that these are supposed to be habitation modules, it would probably be better to account for furnishings and ECLSS. PA 550 would weigh over 20 tonnes in this case; I can\u0027t seem to find any estimates for Sundancer, but we can guesstimate it would weigh around 12-15 tonnes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can of course provide sources and explanations for everything if necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-10T20:51:29Z\u0022 title=\u002207/10/2014 08:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 10, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Hattivat\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-10T20:55:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ecipherpunks: I don\u0027t really understand your question.

In light of this information, I guess the RO-configured centrifuge should not be any smaller than that. To reach Nautilus-X size, the porkworks centrifuge would have to be in 2.5 scale. That would have about 450 cubic meters of space, enoughto provide habitation to 6 people over long periods of time.
