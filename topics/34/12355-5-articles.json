I followed all the instructions in the manual, unless I missed something all four times I read it. First you do the practice launch with the height and heading you want to rendezvous with, end the flight, land or crash, and then do the same thing with the timer on. But during the final ascent MechJeb always pitches my rocket sideways and it crashes into the ground a short way from the KSC, killing the kerbonauts.
