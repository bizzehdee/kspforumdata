Before, depending on the weight of the vehicle, I would decrease the thrust on the solid boosters significantly so that they weren\u0027t pushing the craft needlessly past terminal velocity. Normally I might reduce them to 20% or in some cases even 0%. In the latter configuration, the boosters still produced a fair amount of thrust and the exhaust effects were still substantial. Now however, when using 0% thrust, there are no exhaust effects and the thrust seems much higher, which means I often have to reduce my main engines to idle while the 0% boosters carry the vehicle, all the while there are absolutely no effects coming out of the engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou might argue that I am simply just using solid boosters unnecessarily (imagine two Globe V SRBs on a 1.25m rocket 150% their height) but pre-1.0 I was flying rockets like this without issue.
