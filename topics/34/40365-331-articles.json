When you activate the warp drive, the only thing that changes is your position based upon the vector your ship was facing when activated. You cannot change this vector while the drive is active. When you drop of of warp, your previous velocity vector is still present. Which may be more or less than it was previously relative to your current body of reference. It is not an engine, it does not produce thrust or change your velocity in any way. There was ways to use it to modify your velocity using gravity wells and aerobraking, but the engine itself does nothing more than change your position along an initial vector a fractions of the speed of light.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DivisionByZero","CreatedById":62591,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-11T07:08:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, I saw all these comments about the new radiation reporting features and I was noticing the same in my recent game.

When you activate the warp drive, the only thing that changes is your position based upon the vector your ship was facing when activated. You cannot change this vector while the drive is active. When you drop of of warp, your previous velocity vector is still present. Which may be more or less than it was previously relative to your current body of reference. It is not an engine, it does not produce thrust or change your velocity in any way. There was ways to use it to modify your velocity using gravity wells and aerobraking, but the engine itself does nothing more than change your position along an initial vector a fractions of the speed of light.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the meat of his issue is that once he activates the drive, the button does not switch to \u0022Deactivate\u0022, but just stays on \u0022Activate\u0022, and clicking it again makes his speed jump up again by whatever \u0022c\u0022 factor is set on the drive.

It\u0027s not that I would necessarily object to having Minmus be a deadly radiation environment, it\u0027s just that it was so unusual that I wanted to see if this was intended. I mean, there could be advantages and new challenges to making Minmus a hot potato. It\u0027s currently the easiest planet to get resources from and extreme radiation could significantly alter that impression. I guess it might be challenging to explain 5 orders of magnitude difference in rad dose comparing Minmus to the real Moon, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI look forward to seeing what you do with the radiation in the end!
