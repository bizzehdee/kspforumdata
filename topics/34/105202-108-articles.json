Three Kerbals each effectively consume fertilizer at a certain rate. The fourth effectively consumes supplies directly at a certain rate. Load up the appropriate combination of fertilizer and supplies. In some scenarios you may also want extra mulch storage, which you can do with the liquid-type Kontainers from USI Core or UKS.
