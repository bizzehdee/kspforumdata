That should allow the MFT plugin to figure the masses for the tanks while using stock fuels in the same way that does using real fuels, and as it is assuming cylindrical tanks you end up with far smaller masses.

I changed them myself in my own config to a utilization number equal to the utilization numbers for food, water, and oxygen. I assume that a utilization number less than 5 accounts for structure, but I have no idea why the TAC Life Support waste resources would be less than the number for food, water, and oxygen.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just looked at it, and it would appear that I made a copy/paste error when updating to the new TAC resource naming scheme.
