I got this addon and I have to say it looks really sweet. My only problem is that I\u0027m missing half the parts of it for some reason. I got it from curse yesterday. I tried removing and re-downloading twice. Today, I dowloaded from this link, from dropbox. Still, I dont have the:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- 4 Fuselages\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- 3 Mk2 to 1.25m Adapters\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- 2 Mk2 Cargo-Bays\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- 13 different Wing segments\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny ideas or suggestions?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Got it...
