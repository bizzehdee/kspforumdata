Had a heartbreaking moment when I got my crew to my mining site on Minimus. Hooked up the Drill/Converter to my silo (via KAS) and bam, 4000 kethane will not convert to liquid fuel or oxidizer. At first I thought it was the KAS mod not working properly so I started searching that down,, but I went to make monopropellent and everything worked as expected... Checked my kethane 7.4 folder and looked at the config files for the various parts, but I can\u0027t find any inconsistencies. I thought maybe they changed the variable names for LiquidFuel and Oxidizer with the update but the resources match the stock Squad parts. So basically. I can drill and transfer Kethane to the Kethane tank (build on same assembly) and transfer Mono to the Silo assembly at the same time, but I cannot make Liquid Fuel or Oxi. The mono tank is on the far side on the liquid fuel tank so I don\u0027t think it\u0027s a connection problem anywhere. Just strange. Restarted several times and the problem has not remedied himself, but I (so far) cannot find a record of anyone else having this problem. Running 0.21.1 and Kethane 7.4, other mods are KAS, Engineer, Procedural Fairings, KSPX, and Subassembly Manager (though this one is on my to-be-deleted list). Should I post a bug report on this?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OopsThatNotWork","CreatedById":45740,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-28T15:14:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kodemunkey\u0022 data-cite=\u0022kodemunkey\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo...I struck paydirt today, three whole hexes worth of Kethane.
