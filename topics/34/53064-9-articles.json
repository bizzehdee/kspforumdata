To me static tanks sizes have nothing to do with realism and more to do with default game mechanics/progression -which are mostly rendered obsolete and tedious with stretchy tanks. My guess is that the same progression mechanic -in a more sensible form- will live on through ModularEngines tech-levels (hopefully tied into the tech tree). If progression is tied to the engines instead of tank size the player decision/choice is tied more to engines available and stage TWR/dV requirements.

If that were a capsule instead of a probe body the total dV would drop quite significantly. So always ditch weight where you can.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for motor\u0027s, fuels n stuff. For Mun missions LH2 is you\u0027re friend but not so much on interplanetary missions since LH2 evaporates slowly even in the cryo tank. For other missions I try to make an educated guess on what is required and set it all up accordingly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see that rocket is split into 4 stages. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first stage consists of the standard LF/LO2 combined with the LR88-4(KW Rocketry - 25000kN) @ tech level 6. Setting yourself up with the highest thrust engine you got means you can stick a lot more on top. The fuel tank is sized for a 1:3 TWR. The boosters on the side really should be LF boosters instead of stretchy SRB\u0027s but at the time I really cbf. They are set to run the exact duration of the main rocket just to squeeze a bit more dV out of the first stage with out building outwards like crazy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second stage uses a LR69-3(I think it\u0027s from FASA) @ T6, also 1:3 TWR. This is a Lower\u002B LH2/LO2 engine with extremely good ISP and thrust (6000kN). Because the first stage will give me enough altitude and a good chunk of sideways speed this engine is always fired at full ISP. Remember to use cryo tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe third and forth stages are just a high ISP LH2 engine @ T6, but are generally fueled for what they are required to do @ a 1:1 TWR. So if it were a Mun return mission I would fuel the final stage to give me like 3k dV or w/e it is plus a little extra to get into orbit and perform the Kerbin injection burn. The stage before that would be fueled for performing hopefully say the last quarter of the munar injection burn, mun circularize orbit burn. Then 99% of the powered decent, dropping it off and having the final stage do the touchdown.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom there you now have essentially a final mass of what you\u0027re trying to put into orbit. So it\u0027s just a matter of building the lifter to put it there and giving yourself enough delta V in the second stage to ensure the upper stages can do there jobs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI found that as I was increasing rocket tech level giving access to better engines, higher tech level\u0027s on lower tech engines I was allowed much more freedom in my design\u0027s because of the ISP increases and bigger lifting engines. You could if you wanted stick a bunch of like 5000kN engines on to get plenty of thrust but you\u0027re not getting the increased ISP which is where the most benefits come from.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am by no means an expert when it comes to this but these are just some of the thing\u0027s I myself go through when building rockets specifically in conjunction with RSS.
