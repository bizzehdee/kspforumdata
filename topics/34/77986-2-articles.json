By viewing the parts from a very low angle when placing, they snap right into place. In fact, thanks to solving this problem in Hex Truss placement, I resolved another issue I\u0027ve had with placing stock docking ports for over a year-and-half. That is, when placing a docking port onto command modules and probes, it wouldn\u0027t snap into place. I had to eyeball it to the center; this often took about 30 seconds. Now, by viewing the parts at the very low angle and placing the docking port, it snaps right in.\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-08T14:51:19Z\u0022 title=\u002208/08/2014 02:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 8, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Apollo13\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Apollo13","CreatedById":74572,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-10T15:05:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@SpeedyB, I offer you a challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe current stock Hitchhiker part is round. \u0022Round\u0022 is not in keeping with the \u0022Hex\u0022 theme.
