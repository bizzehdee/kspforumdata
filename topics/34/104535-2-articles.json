All robotic parts can now be scaled at relatively fine increments from 0.25x their original (normal) size to 5x. HUGE! Wooooo!\n\u003E 2. Trusses and wheels can also be scaled at these fine increments, though I didn\u0027t allow for wheels to become huge since I just don\u0027t know if they behave correctly when enormous. You can easily change this if you want.\n\u003E 3. The mass of robotic parts except at the smallest scale is increased somewhat (most Rework parts originally: 0.1t, my changes: 0.3t); this gives them slightly stronger joints. Smallest-scale parts now weigh ~ 0.02 instead of 0.025ish.\n\u003E 4. Much simplified TweakScale stuff - fewer SCALETYPES to edit if you want to fiddle with scaleFactors or what have you.\n\u003E 5. Hides the three pointless (I think? I just couldn\u0027t figure these out) half-size Athlete trusses.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Downsides:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1. Biggest downside: when placing parts, they start out huge and you\u0027ll have to scale them down for normal-sized ships. This is currently unavoidable if you want parts more than 1.5X (or so) the size of the originals.\n\u003E 2. Telescopic pistons didn\u0027t get upscaled - they don\u0027t cooperate and I don\u0027t know why. Maybe someone else can figure this out. You can still make trusses match their size (or pretty close) since they\u0027re made to freescale.\n\u003E 3. Heavier robotic parts could be a downside too.\n\u003E 4. The original SCALETYPES for reworked parts had a cool system of matching names of scales to absolute sizes of parts - this is somewhat broken with my system, but only for half-size bits like RoboTruss Lite and RoboTube parts, wheels too, I think, and maybe some others. I.e. a RoboTruss Lite part at \u00222x\u0022 scale will no longer exactly match every other part scaled to \u00222x\u0022. I think the bonuses outweigh this.\n\u003E 5. No Legacy part support. They break like the telescopic pistons. Also don\u0027t know why.\n\u003E 6. Didn\u0027t mess with electric charge required, so that will be way off - maybe in another version.\n\nSome thoughts on this:\n\n\\* Telescopic pistons are not special in any way, the only difference I am aware of is that zodius made them for use with powers of (third root of 2), which is why they have their own scaletype. What does \u0022they don\u0027t cooperate\u0022 mean? You could try adding \u0022:FINAL\u0022 to the patches so they run last, and see if that changes anything. Just in case they tried to change something that was not there yet, or were overwritten by later patches. \n\n\\* I\u0027d consider part patches like \u0022@rescaleFactor \\*= 4\u0022 as problematic because adding or removing your config will likely break every affected part, scaled or not, both in the save file and in craft files."},{"CreatedByName":"AccidentalDisassembly","CreatedById":110936,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-22T21:12:43Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Some thoughts on this:\n\u003E \\* Telescopic pistons are not special in any way, the only difference I am aware of is that zodius made them for use with powers of (third root of 2), which is why they have their own scaletype.

Essentially the patch breaks the telescopic parts - they will extend, but when they extend, they shift upward/sideways as well as outward, ones at the base don\u0027t extend fully, etc. I don\u0027t understand it either, since I also couldn\u0027t figure out how those parts could conceivably be different than the others... all I was doing was changing the exact same variables as for the other parts, didn\u0027t change the SCALETYPE or anything else. I also couldn\u0027t figure out why some legacy parts (like gantries) broke in a vaguely similar way when doing this...\n\nIt\u0027s possible it was just some error/typo when I was making the MM config too, I just left it out because it was still broken.\n\nYeah, the @rescaleFactor \\*= 4 definitely wrecks stuff, but until TS and IR play together nicely for upscaling, it\u0027s at least one way of having larger IR parts without duplicating everything (a method I\u0027ve also tried) and therefore cluttering your part list. Is there a way to do this without breaking things? Duplication was the only thing I could think of.\n\nEDIT: Added the telescopic parts back to the patch. New behavior I haven\u0027t seen - now they explode when you extend them. This is the starting point:\n\n![ExplodingTelescopics1.png](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/59567837/ExplodingTelescopics1.png)\n\nWhen you press the control to extend them, they do begin moving outward. If you just press it for a moment and extend them a tiny bit, the craft will begin rotating (constantly) counterclockwise.\n\nIf you extend them farther, they explode. Beats me... Totally guessing, but could there be an issue with these parts specifically and the new nodes sizes I apply? Works OK for the other parts, but they aren\u0027t usually in robotic-on-robotic-part chains.\n\nEDIT AGAIN: Aha! That\u0027s got something to do with it - when I place other IR parts (rescaled) end to end - one robotic part on another, oriented correctly - they also cause weird forces in the ship and explode if moved too far. Huh. So much for the patch as is. =( I seem to remember this phenomenon with the stacked telescopic parts being less pronounced when in an original iteration I tried using stack nodes of size 2... not sure about that though.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-22T21:42:33Z\u0022 title=\u002204/22/2015 09:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by AccidentalDisassembly**"},{"CreatedByName":"Ziw","CreatedById":135292,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-22T22:08:44Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Great work guys, I love the fact that when assigning parts to an action group you no longer need to toggle a direction on and then off again.

But as soon as I would press the action group to advance to the next preset past 240 degrees, it would over rotate back to 0. My work around was to use negative numbers for the last two (first two) presets. So I would have 0 as my center position and a range of 0 - 240.

Try and lower the angle of the legs more horizontal. Much like the rover in the tutorial video. The wheels extend more outward than downward.

Look at your nav ball. you are controlling from a command pod pointing straight down. and by pressing (w) you are driving the wheels as well as any reaction wheels you may have added or what is already equipped in your command pod. This could be adding torque to the legs bending them and altering your intended path.\n\nEdit: I just looked at a larger version of your picture, I should have led with that. Each arm is attached to a separate structural panel. this could be a lot of your issue. Try attaching all the arms to one common part using symmetry and then see what happens.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-23T22:19:25Z\u0022 title=\u002204/23/2015 10:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by V8jester**"},{"CreatedByName":"ZodiusInfuser","CreatedById":76163,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T22:18:07Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E doesnt work, [http://imgur.com/a/BiUXc](http://imgur.com/a/BiUXc)\n\nAre you sure you wheels are all parallel to the ground when deployed, as it really doesn\u0027t look like it from that shot. If they are angled then your far more likely to experience this behaviour. Also even if they are parallel as you move variations in forces on the legs will make this effect marginally occur. At least that has been my assessment from testing the parts during development.\n\nEdit: Just tested with my Athlete rover and I get no drift at all, even with angling the wheels to the ground, so scratch what I\u0027ve said above.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-23T22:30:44Z\u0022 title=\u002204/23/2015 10:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ZodiusInfuser**"}]}
