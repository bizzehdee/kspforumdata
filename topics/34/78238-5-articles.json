Out of close to 300 people, only two people ever reported it. The way I figured out to reproduce it was to take a plane, crash head first into a building, then go to the tracking station before the rest of the debris hit the building. I\u0027m pretty sure I narrowed it down to referencing the partRef, but that was a while ago so I may not remember perfectly. It may not fix any of the problems people are reporting now, but it might save you some headache later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Btw, just added KCT_Utilities.AddPartToInventory(String, float).
