You\u0027re not going to have an easy time building a HTHL (Horizontal Takeoff, Horizontal Landing- i.e. a spaceplane) SSTO in RSS 64K with conventional technology. In fact, without at least using RealFuels, FAR, and SABRE (not RAPIER- which runs on Kerosene instead of Hydrogen) engines you don\u0027t stand a chance. With them, you could build something like \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skylon_%28spacecraft%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESkylon\u003C/a\u003E- but you should still only expect a 2-3% mass-fraction... (so a spaceplane massing at least 500 tons or so on the Runway just to get a 2-ton Mk2 cockpit into orbit...) Without Realism Overhaul scaling-up, you can pretty much forget about something that big actually getting off the runway though...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven with KSP-Interstellar, if you stick to near-future tech (Molten Salt and Particle Bed Reactors, and Microwave Beamed Power) you\u0027re going to have an extremely hard time. Your best bet is probably to build something that relies on Microwave Thermal Turbojets to get to about 27 km and Mach 3-4 (similar to Skylon but a bit higher relative to atmospheric height) and then switches over to Microwave Thermal Rockets to make it the rest of the way to orbit... Even so, while you may double your maximum ISP and eliminate the need for fuel until you switch to rocekts- and thus more than double your mass-fraction, expect a spaceplane of at least 200 tons with LH\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E alone (which with the low fuel-density of Hydrogen means an enormous spaceplane- even larger in volume than the 500-ton behemoth discussed earlier) and easily 400 tons (but with higher fuel-density) for a combination of LH\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E, HydroLOX, MethLOX, and pure Methane...

According to REL\u0027s data, the real SABRE\u0027s rocket thrust will be something like 2.5x it\u0027s static air-breathing thrust, so maybe that\u0027s a good starting point.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBased on the implementation of the RAPIER engine in RealFuels (Kerosene-airbreathing and Kero/LOX rocket) I\u0027m not sure it is actually meant to be a SABRE analog... And since many players using AJE are probably also using RealFuels...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, B9 Aerospace has an engine which is actually called SABRE, and even looks like the real SABRE. It even uses Hydrogen and HydroLOX in RealFuels. What about balancing this to be the SABRE engine, and leaving the RAPIER as a lower-ISP Kerosene-burning alternative? (which couldn\u0027t possibly make orbit on a HTHL SSTO in RSS, of course- due to the much lower ISP of Kero/LOX than HydroLOX, and is mostly limited to stock-sized systems for spaceplane use)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, regardless of what RAPIER is meant to represent, it really should have higher thrust in rocket-mode than in air-breathing mode. Anything else just seems silly to me from a realism-perspective: though of course it\u0027s not my mod (in fact, I don\u0027t even use AJE in my saves), and you\u0027re free to do whatever you want with it.
