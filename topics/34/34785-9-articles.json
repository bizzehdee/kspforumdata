I have decided to attempt to expand the solar system for myself. Now I am aware that I cannot save planet persistence files in this version, which is 1.2.4.1 so for now I am just going to mess around in an alternate download so i do not destroy any important things in my main save. I have a few quick questions, though about this mod. My first question is is there a way to copy the planets? Like I could copy, say Eve, place it in a far out orbit, readjust the copie\u0027s gravity, atmosphere, color, ETC, and name it something else without changing the original? and second, if I can copy planets, is there a way to copy and make orbit, the sun? So i can have a sun with an edited gravity to be much smaller, in orbit around the sun?
