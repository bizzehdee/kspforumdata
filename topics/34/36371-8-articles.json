My immediate reaction was to start pulling the source apart to work out how it can be used to to interstage fairings. In particular I am keen for an engine housing that has a baseplate (\u0022under plate\u0022) that engine clusters can be attached to, and the interstage fairings adapt to depending on the siza and shape ofthe engines, but also crutally the fairing/baseplate provide a bottom node to that the lower stage can be attached to the fariing and not the engine cluster that it is concealling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf this is what you have in mind then I will sit back and enjoy your work, but if not then I hope you would be supportive of me having a fiddle with your code.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tigermisu","CreatedById":58477,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-14T21:42:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo does it work with FAR now?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Yes it does, awesome!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-14T21:55:03Z\u0022 title=\u002207/14/2013 09:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 14, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Tigermisu\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EFound the asnwer\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"betaking","CreatedById":58281,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-14T22:09:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think that proceedural interstages would be awsome, However I don\u0027t think that requiring two rings is a good Idea, perhaps a single ring that doubles as a decoupler or stack seperator.., but basically if I\u0027m using interstages, its because they can cover up things like engines and/or stack node-size adapters for the upper stages of a rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpeaking of which, proceedural interstages would probably lead to me removing most of the current interstage models on the stock parts that have them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
