Perhaps would be an idea to transfer them (and all resourc  gathering related stuff) to IFS package. Technically it should be possible and would allow IFS to specialize more in universal resource storage and gathering \n\nNote that I explicitly mention Universal Resource gathering as we need some way to make the resource harvester switchable, similary you can do now for a tank, you switch resource gathing mode. This should allow you to create Surface/Ocear/Atmosphere resource gatherrers that can switch to a multitude of minable resources. It would also be able to switch storage resources at the sam time, similar to how texture switches which resource content. This will also reduce resource cluting and make it a bit more intuitive\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-27T08:22:21Z\u0022 title=\u002206/27/2016 08:22  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 27, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by FreeThinker**"},{"CreatedByName":"raxo2222","CreatedById":110750,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-27T09:00:34Z","Content":"MOVED TO KSPI THREAD\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-27T09:17:13Z\u0022 title=\u002206/27/2016 09:17  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 27, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by raxo2222**"},{"CreatedByName":"gamerscircle","CreatedById":151261,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-27T13:35:13Z","Content":"I have IFS 2.0.9 and I was curios, as I am not 100% sure if this is a 1.1.3 or a IFS bug.
