Where TWP might suggest a 1000 burn and 800 insert, MJ will promptly require 1200 and 1000, sometimes far worse, but I don\u0027t know which of the two porkchops to fault, if either. Not sure I understand enough about what TWP is trying to tell me to optimise my departure... \u003Cstrong\u003Emaybe what I\u0027m seeing is my failure to match TWP\u0027s suggested inclinations before burning?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t suppose there\u0027s any progress on the idea of getting TWP to set a manoeuvre node for the current ship?

Maybe I\u0027m just being a dumbass and choosing the wrong part of the porkchop in MechJeb when the day of departure comes. With my recent Eve launches, I noticed there were two options; one for a ~90 day transit, and one for nearly double that, both with about the same \u003Cem\u003Elaunch\u003C/em\u003E delta-v as reported by MJ - but MJ doesn\u0027t tell you the arrival. Maybe I just missed TWP telling me that it\u0027s the longer transit that would have been more efficient at the destination.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I guess if if my ship has looped around the sun for longer, the difference in trajectory and speed is probably smaller than for a shorter trip, and thus will need less delta-v to achieve capture. My maths isn\u0027t good enough to tell me for sure, but my guess is that you want to arrive on the opposite side of the sun to where you started for the easiest possible capture (basically a classic Hohmann transfer, arriving at your solar apo/periapsis, rather than mid way along the elipse).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEither way, TWP and KAC is still a great mod combo for those of us who like to keep stuff happening on short time scales - I just overspec my ships and go with the windows as they come up. Lol, been 6 real-time days since I launched a fleet for Eve, and only the fast-track comms relay has arrived so far! Meanwhile KAC is tracking expeditions to Minmus and Mun, and when it\u0027ll be time to bring back my Duna return probe. I have 51 flights active, and about 7-8 of them need attention at some point.
