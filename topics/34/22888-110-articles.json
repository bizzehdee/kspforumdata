If you want something you ask politely, if you have constructive criticism you approach the topic carefull, with tact and diplomacy and with respect.

He hasn\u0027t updated the American Pack, Soviet Pack, and HOME in months! Why? Because people were constantly on him about updates, opinions, and changes that they demanded/expected him to make. So what happened? He lost interest, he stopped caring, and lost the desire to maintain the mods because of ingrates pestering him. Just go a few pages back Frizz is feeling the same way, and yes I might be overzealous and fanboyish but I guess I am also kinda being selfish because I don\u0027t want this mod to die with the next updates because Frizz has no motivation to update it.

Really, you\u0027re talking like it was your mod and stuff \u003Cem\u003Eyou\u003C/em\u003E believe to be impolite (you\u0027re wrong, IMO) was directed at \u003Cem\u003Eyou\u003C/em\u003E. It isn\u0027t, you can stop now. You\u0027re probably right about Frizzank not wanting suggestions, but you\u0027re neither his spokesman nor his attorney; you\u0027re a bloody fanboy. Modders can take their criticism, probably better than you do. Oh, and BobCat did not lose interest because of people wanting to see his stuff (if he told you he did, show me where), he\u0027s got RL problems as far as I know. In fact, it\u0027s possible that because he sees that people want his stuff, he\u0027s still working on them at all, because he know it\u0027s needed.
