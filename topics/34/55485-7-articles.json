In windowed mode, it is quite easy to move the window up far enough that the grabbable area is out of reach. I\u0027ve sent a fix to sarbian that will prevent this by repositioning each window to be wthin the current screen dimensions when the settings are loaded, and also when the windows are hidden by the Toolbar icon. (Just click to hide, and then click to show it again and the windows will be moved back.)
