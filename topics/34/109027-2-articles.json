For example, VABUpgrades = 100000, 250000, 1000000, the initial building upgrade cost to go from level 1 to 2 will not be 100,000 but rather 250,000. What is the first value for and is it needed for some reason I\u0027m just not seeing?\n\n2) Is there a way to enable something in the configuration file to be on by default? I understand the .2/.4/.6/-1 usage for establishing when something becomes available. However, when I change something like EVA capability or Custom Action Groups to be available at the start without paying for any upgrades it doesn\u0027t work. I set those values to .2 but I still have to upgrade the building for it to become available. Additionally, if I set the value to .4, it reacts the same way so the first time I upgrade it, the new capability becomes available at Level 2. No matter what I do I can\u0027t seem to get it to be turned on by default so I wasn\u0027t sure if this was even possible.\n\nOther than the second point though, all other configuration values seem to be working properly. I do think that some documentation needs to be written if this is going to go to a full release because the .2/.4/.6 value is confusing and it took me a little bit of experimentation to get how the various scaling factors worked for things like kerbonaut hiring costs and contract scaling for reputation/advance funds/science rewards. If you need any help with that for a full release version I would be more than willing to contribute what I can and let you correct anything that might be incorrect.\n\nOne last note as a suggestion - I don\u0027t know how hard it would be so don\u0027t know if it\u0027s worth the time but...\n\nIf an interface GUI could be built to allow people to configure these values either at career startup or on the initial load in screen after starting (kind of like the TAC-LS config window pops up on first load) then it would make setting these values up far more accessible to average joe user who doesn\u0027t dig into .cfg files regularly like us obsessives. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) Just a thought...\n\nGreat work Sarbian, this is exactly the kind of control I wanted for career mode when I started playing and lacked since I am no code jockey. Really glad you did this!\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nReported one thing working that isn\u0027t by accident since I had forgotten to save my config file. activeStrategyLimit and strategyCommitRange are not working at all. No changes I make to them are allowing me to change those limits. I also have to retract dataToscienceRatio since that was another one of the values that I didn\u0027t save. If I see that appears to be incorrect I will report back.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-16T01:13:53Z\u0022 title=\u002205/16/2015 01:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by rasta013**"},{"CreatedByName":"Minwaabi","CreatedById":91050,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T14:46:51Z","Content":"So over on [this](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/121934-Modding-the-cost-of-Kerbalnauts)thread, you mentioned that this mod can change the cost of hiring Kerbals.

(The costs for hiring new kerbalnauts did not change.) Previously, I had tried recruitHireFlatRate = 0.0 and recruitHireRateModifier = 0.0 and again, no change. Am I supposed to be changing the default config that comes with the mod or creating a new one? (Because I\u0027ve been changing the one that comes with the mod).\n\nEDIT: Okay. Weird. I deleted the mod, downloaded it, reinstalled it, did everything exactly the same and recruitHireFlatRate = 0.0 and recruitHireRateModifier = 0.0 sort of had the desired effect. They did something. Namely they set the astronaut cost to 0. In case anyone is interested, the equation for astronaut cost seems to be cost = abn \u002Bacn^2, where a = recruitHireBaseCost, b =recruitHireFlatRate, c = recruitHireRateModifier. Correct me if this doesn\u0027t seem to be the case. If I\u0027m correct, that\u0027s kind of annoying, because there is no getting around the fact that each kerbal will always cost more than the previous one.\n\nI take it there\u0027s no way around that right? The equation will always be a quadratic or linear equation with a y-intercept of zero, right? I can of course continue to change the equation as I get more kerbals, but I was hoping for a more permanent solution.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-25T03:59:07Z\u0022 title=\u002205/25/2015 03:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Minwaabi**"},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T23:13:47Z","Content":"v1.1.0 :\n\n - changed the config files to use the buildings levels instead of strange floating point values ![:sticktongue:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif)\n\n - added a \u0022recruitHireFixedRate\u0022 to change the cost of recruiting to a fixed rate equal to the value of recruitHireBaseCost\n\nThis release should be OK for a wide audience.
