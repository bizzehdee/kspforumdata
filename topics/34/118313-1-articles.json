You can choose between two governments that have different play styles. Each quarter (106 Days) you will receive a review for that quarter and be paid out (or fined) depending on your performance.\n\n**State Confidence (SC) / Public Opinion (PO)**\n\nYour space program is tracked by both State Confidence (SC) and Public Opinion (PO). A combination of State Confidence and Public Opinion determines your funding for each quarter. Unlike Contracts, you can increase your SC and PO with permanent modifiers- or at least permanent while a condition is met. While SC and PO are equal when it comes to deciding your funding, depending on the government you choose, you will either receive more PO or SC for meeting a PO or SC condition.\n\n**Public Opinion Modifiers**\n\n- Having Kerbals on Flights.\n- Having Kerbals on a Space Station or Base.\n- Having more Vessels docked with a Space Station or Base\n- Having a Base with a Science Lab and/or Drill\n- Having a Space Station with a Science Lab\n- Having a Space Station landed on an astroid- additionally having a drill on that space station\n- Having Rovers on other bodies\n\n**Public Opinion Penalties**\n\n- Kerbals Die\n- Kerbals are Stranded\n- Kerbals are Left for Dead\n\n**State Confidence Modifiers**\n\n- Having more Satellite coverage of a body\n- Having Science Labs in orbit of bodies other than the Sun or landed on bodies other than the Home Planet\n- Having Drills in orbit of bodies (landed on an astroid) or landed on bodies other than the Home Planet\n- Having more Fuel on a Space Station / Base\n- Having more Ore on a Space Station / Base\n- Having higher Crew Capacity on a Space Station / Base\n- Having more Docking Ports on a Space Station / Base\n- Having a Science Lab on a Space Station / Base\n- Having a Drill on a Base\n- Having a Drill on a Space Station that is landed on an astroid\n\n**Static Confidence Penalties**\n\n- Destroying Vessels\n\n**Customization / Mod Support**\n\nTo add/modify governments. Update the contents of \u0060GameData/StateFunding/data/governments.settings\u0060. Many checks involve checking if a vessel has a module. For example, to see if a vessel has autonomous command, it checks for a ModuleSAS module on the Vessel. Since Mods have their own module names for similar types (i.e. RT\u0027s \u0022ModuleSPU\u0022), there is an aliases file mapping an alias to a set of similar Modules. You can update the aliases by changing the \u0060GameData/StateFunding/data/modulealiases.settings\u0060 file.\n\n![Screen_Shot_2015_08_16_at_7_07_02_PM.png](http://s14.postimg.org/4q6jvfqn5/Screen_Shot_2015_08_16_at_7_07_02_PM.png)\n\n![Screen_Shot_2015_08_16_at_7_04_44_PM.png](http://s14.postimg.org/6e5pa34ip/Screen_Shot_2015_08_16_at_7_04_44_PM.png)\n\n![Screen_Shot_2015_08_16_at_7_04_52_PM.png](http://s14.postimg.org/3lchq2469/Screen_Shot_2015_08_16_at_7_04_52_PM.png)\n\n![Screen_Shot_2015_08_16_at_7_04_59_PM.png](http://s14.postimg.org/3zdtpno9t/Screen_Shot_2015_08_16_at_7_04_59_PM.png)\n\n![Screen_Shot_2015_08_16_at_7_05_08_PM.png](http://s14.postimg.org/6j9gjrbtt/Screen_Shot_2015_08_16_at_7_05_08_PM.png)\n\n![Screen_Shot_2015_08_16_at_7_05_23_PM.png](http://s14.postimg.org/fsbmtvkpt/Screen_Shot_2015_08_16_at_7_05_23_PM.png)\n\nGithub Source: [https://github.com/iamchairs/StateFunding](https://github.com/iamchairs/StateFunding)\n\nKerbalStuff Download: [https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/1069/State%20Funding](https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/1069/State%20Funding)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-11T02:23:55Z\u0022 title=\u002202/11/2016 02:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 11, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by iamchairs**\n  \nNew Minor"},{"CreatedByName":"ABZB","CreatedById":98947,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-12T18:38:02Z","Content":"Love it!\n\nOne problem - none of my satellites are being detected as such.

There is decay so unless you are achieving permanent modifiers your funding will disappear quickly. There could be more measures added to prevent cheesing.\n\nA confidence of State Confidence and Public Opinion is what determines your funding. They have equal weight in how much funding you will receive but are acquired differently. Depending on the government you choose it may be easier to raise one over the other. All modifiers can be seen in the StateFunding Hub window from the Application Launcher toolbar at the Space Centre.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nYou can also, from that window, see your current review status and how well you\u0027re performing that quarter."},{"CreatedByName":"Doughy","CreatedById":147090,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T00:56:42Z","Content":"this is not detecting any of my satellites. unlike person above im not running kopernicus, just stock system."},{"CreatedByName":"HarlyKin","CreatedById":145605,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T03:06:48Z","Content":"Figured out a partial solution to the stranded kerbal problem.

It would be on the honor system for the person to label their vessels correctly. But that probably won\u0027t be an issue.

By some dark magic it\u0027s \\*seems\\* more stable when I register the event listener \\*after\\* the game started. Maybe I\u0027m going crazy. Additionally, since any piece can emit a crash event I\u0027m only listening to command modules (manned and unmanned) and counting those as vessels. That would mean if you had multiple command modules they would count as vessels. I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s possible to search for vessels in the immediate vicinity of a vessel.
