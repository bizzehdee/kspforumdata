However, if I could recommend one thing, I\u0027d make the star orbit tracks invisible, since there is no central body, it looks odd that they\u0027re orbiting anything. The relative motion would likely be so small that you wouldn\u0027t notice over the time scales required to travel.

To fix it you simply have to go through the parts on your ships and strip the mod based parts one by one and see what the issue is. For most of my crafts (in Alternis) it was the Mechjeb AR202 case causing it.
