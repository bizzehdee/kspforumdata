Other mods and parts use differing values so the correctness of what the actual values are could possibly remain forever in debate until Squad publish what the actual values should be. As these parts follow the ratios from Universal Storage, the ElectricCharge usage will only be changed if Universal Storage changes and so will always remain in sync.

The default configs match Universal Storage with Paul Kingtiger and Daishi\u0027s research on the Electrolosys unit aboard the International Space Station. Regardless of the accuracy, the production of Hydrogen is very time consuming and requires large quantities of power. With this as a baseline, it is then possible to tweak and adjust the values to individual needs in the hope of providing the best ratios for everyones style of gameplay. For Example: If you want to use less ElectricCharge, you have a base value to work from.
