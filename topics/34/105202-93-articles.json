I\u0027m imagining it would be used by the largest base and station parts, for example the stuff from Civilian Population would fit the bill, or UKS\u0027s upcoming Mk IV parts.\n\u003E \n\nActually, with the right scales, you quickly end up there anyway.  That being said, there will be provisions in the future for turning any calculated value past a certain threshold effectively \u0027home\u0027.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, Mr Shifty said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E But say, for instance, send a crew on a five year mission to Eeloo, but only have enough hab for 2 years on my main vessel.

Bottom line is that unless you can get the hab vessel for each individual kerbal past that five year mark, you\u0027re kinda toast.  Because the home timer is based on when you left Kerbin, and it\u0027s starting point is never reset.\n\nAbout the best you could do is do a LOT of shuffling and give each of your Kerbals the complete individual run of the ship long enough to reset the timer.  And that I am ok with, given the amount of gymnastics involved (and you\u0027re still a slave to the short term timer).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, ibanix said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Is there a way to turn off the \u0027home\u0027 counter/effect but keep the \u0027hab\u0027 one?\n\u003E \n\nNo, the two go together, because if you turned off the home timer you could effectively last forever just by hopping from ship to ship, even if they were all tiny capsules, which I consider an exploit."},{"CreatedByName":"ibanix","CreatedById":147140,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-09T00:01:22Z","Content":"Hm, you have a point there.

A Hohmann transfer to the Mun is about 7.5 hours one way (though it\u0027s relatively cheap to make this significantly quicker.) 7.5 hours at 0.01 EC/kerbal/sec consumption for supply use is 270 EC for one kerbal and doesn\u0027t include time to do stuff at the Mun or the return trip. To send multiple kerbals means packing tons of batteries, at least until you\u0027ve unlocked solar panels. (Engine generators mitigate the problem somewhat as well.) I could also just not supply them and they won\u0027t consume EC, but that seems like cheating.\n\nI really like this actually. These are the kind of constraints that create [emergent gameplay situations](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/76731-get-my-kerbals-home/) which require creative problem solving and/or make great narratives. I think I\u0027m gonna reduce the no supply grace period to 3 kerbal days. I may create a MM config that adds supplies to stock command modules too, to force supply (and thus EC) consumption. (And it makes sense thematically that the command modules would be supplied, at least for a few days.)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-10T02:28:09Z\u0022 title=\u002205/10/2016 02:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 10, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Mr Shifty**"},{"CreatedByName":"karamazovnew","CreatedById":63072,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-10T10:06:24Z","Content":"~~Ups, sorry, disregard this post.~~ \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-10T10:13:22Z\u0022 title=\u002205/10/2016 10:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 10, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by karamazovnew**\n  \nWrong reply"},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-10T10:57:48Z","Content":"[@Mr Shifty](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/68146-mr-shifty/) - yep, the 15 day grace period was built to give folks a leg up on getting to the mun, but it\u0027s a bit snug for minmus.
