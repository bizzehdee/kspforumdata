It has this line in the cfg: \u0022NoCrossFeedNodeKey = bottom\u0022. The part can feed two engines from one tank but not one engine from two tanks. Give me a few minutes and I\u0027ll get some pics and a craft file for you.\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Here you go:\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for that. I see the problem in the simulation code, caused because the root part of your vessel is on the \u0022bottom\u0022 side of the bicoupler. The NoCrossFeedNodeKey is being correctly handled but the code is then going on to (incorrectly) search the parent part (the fuel tank) for fuel. If you place another fuel tank on the other half of the bicoupler it won\u0027t burn that fuel in the simulation (the deltaV will go down to the increased \u0022dry\u0022 mass), or if you make the bicoupler or the engine the root part then it will correctly calculate as zero.
