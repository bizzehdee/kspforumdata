Because RealChutes doesn\u0027t have this, it can mess up staging. Any chance we could see something like this in a future release?\u003Cp\u003EBasically it would be a state where you could activate (but not deploy) the chute at any altitude, and then when the chute got to its maximum predeployment altitude, it would automatically predeploy, instead of what it does now, which is just bump the chutes to the next stage without any triggering at altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYep, you are looking for \u0022arm parachute\u0022 \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E And if you want this to happen everytime you stage, go change \u0022autoArm\u0022 ro true in RealChute_Settings.cfg\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kiwiak","CreatedById":82796,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-05T13:53:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI dont know why, but i cant see parachuteson parts list after installing new version.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe has something to do with part catalogue?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-05T13:59:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kiwiak\u0022 data-cite=\u0022kiwiak\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI dont know why, but i cant see parachuteson parts list after installing new version.\u003Cp\u003EMaybe has something to do with part catalogue?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELook closer, there\u0027s only four parts \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AbeS","CreatedById":80644,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-05T14:10:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the catalog click settings, then click auto-tag and the new parachutes will appear\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Orum","CreatedById":97814,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-05T16:05:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022stupid_chris\u0022 data-cite=\u0022stupid_chris\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYep, you are looking for \u0022arm parachute\u0022 \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E And if you want this to happen everytime you stage, go change \u0022autoArm\u0022 ro true in RealChute_Settings.cfg\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAh, I had forgotten about the context menu after configuring almost everything in the editor window.
