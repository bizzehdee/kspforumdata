I actually face 10 to 20 degrees downward. Thrust is still mostly behind centre of mass. I also don\u0027t have my centre of lift matching my centre of mass. Why? Because with larger plane designs, it\u0027s better to have the mass below centre of pressure. As a result my SSTO\u0027s tend to be far more stable. Gravity simple balances out the plane. My largest issue is that with a very good glide angle, my planes don\u0027t want to stop. Though that was pretty much fixed with air brakes.
