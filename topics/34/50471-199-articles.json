Please let us know on the RO thread, we\u0027d probably like to either roll that into RO or make it a recommended mod for RO if you release it separately.\u003Cp\u003ETaki117: It should be needed only once, but if it\u0027s needed more than once let me know. :\\\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately it\u0027s not my mod, I just made the cfg packs for it, although it has been released under an \u0022anything goes\u0022 license, so it will probably have to just go into the recommended mods section. Tell you what, I\u0027ll repackage the cfgs so they\u0027re a little more user-friendly, then post the download links in the RO thread. Maybe add a few more names while I\u0027m at it, at the moment, I only have the 100 most common from each country, so there is some repetition if you have a lot of Kerbals out there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-22T00:17:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://strawpoll.me/3458365/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://strawpoll.me/3458365/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShould I remove Dres\u0027 superspin in my Jumbo rescales?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-22T02:31:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100453-Jumbo-32-v1-2-For-KSP-0-90-RSS-Config\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJumbo32\u003C/a\u003E v1.3 is released.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GregroxMun\u0022 data-cite=\u0022GregroxMun\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100453-Jumbo-32-v1-2-For-KSP-0-90-RSS-Config\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EUpdated to 1.3\u003C/a\u003E.
