It\u0027s an interface problem, probably with Unity itself. I was just hoping that since it only affects parts with the new \u0022mass/strength\u0022 bar, you might have some idea. I\u0027m also guessing you couldn\u0027t replicate the problem. Thanks for taking the time anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@bdito In the aero viz view, nosecones don\u0027t have any effect on the part immediately below them. Notice the drag on the small fuel tank. Also notice that all radially attached parts produce drag in all cases. However, the rocket behaves quite logically, only becoming unstable in the last pic, as you\u0027d expect from the shockwave hitting the gap and the radial parts. On the same rocket I\u0027ve also placed different antennas, instead of the small structural boxes. As you\u0027d expect, the ones that \u0022stuck out\u0022 were immediately broken, while the smaller ones which fitted in the diameter, didn\u0027t. In conclusion, always use fairings with FAR.
