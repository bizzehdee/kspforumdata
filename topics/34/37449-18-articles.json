Even in Earth/Kerbin\u0027s shadow, the heat produced in the spacecraft by the electronics and the crew is more than sufficient to heat the cabin.

I read a post a bit back in this thread that said they have 90% efficiency so 140 water would effectively work as 1400 water over enough time. It would be nice if this info was in the part info pane instead of in one post buried in the middle of this thread.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m considering changing the water splitter\u0027s .cfg to making oxygen and liquid fuel instead of oxygen and waste. I play with the Interstellar plugin and LF is considered hydrogen for the purposes of mechanics. What are ya\u0027lls thoughts on this? I\u0027m assuming that the resulting H2 would be pure enough to be able to be cooled and used as liquid hydrogen. Maybe increase the EC usage to 1000 instead of 100 if I make this change? Increased EC usage to represent cooling the H2 from a gas to a liquid.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do like very much that units of resources have been standardized to 1 unit per day.

Strange KSP code for the tooltips.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, added a fix for this bug, and integrated it into ModuleManager (best place for it since many mods use it). It searches all the loaded parts after loading screen, and adds a \u0022Dummy description\u0022 to the parts that need it. Somehow fixes it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/unqr7kyli8m6auy/ModuleManager_1_5.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/unqr7kyli8m6auy/ModuleManager_1_5.zip\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eremoved the link. will make a plugin to fix the issue.
