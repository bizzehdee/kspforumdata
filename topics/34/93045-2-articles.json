Or, is there a better, more efficient way to do this? Cant you combine launch and inclination change so that your parking orbit is already equatorial so you just hohmann?(How?)

I think I bought a part I likely didn\u0027t need to be buying. I shouldn\u0027t have purchased the mystery goo and other stuff I didn\u0027t need.\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m thinking you and I are playing on a very different rp-0. Or maybe you have extra part mods installed? The guys working on rp-0 have done an amazing job rebalancing everything so that sounding rockets are your first set of missions. I don\u0027t think crewed missions are supposed to be possible until much later. The missions are there, but I don\u0027t see how you got the parts to do crewed missions by mission 3, or the funds to unlock the tier 2 launching pad. It takes 70k funds to unlock the launching pad for the mass of Juno and 75 science to unlock crew capsules. That just seems like a lot of funds for one mission (and there is no way two sounding missions gives 70k, lol) and a lot of science from two missions. Although if you did get into a polar orbit on mission two, I suppose with the probe reports of all biomes could get you that much science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am not using any part mods at all other than the engines from sxt and ven\u0027s revamp, to top it off im using remotetech too. It is quite possible and easy to get the crew capsule by the third mission. As I have done it twice. This is with default normal diffaculty career settings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Grab all the contracts you can at the start. On the first mission with wac corporal and an srb first stage (antenna is needed) ascend north sub orbitally with a thermometer and a barometer and hit every single biome on the way up (use science alert mod to help you catch every one)(should be atleast 4) Since you dont have a heatshield it wont survive re-entry but dont just leave because you may get upper atmosphere over highlands biome before you burn up. After that mission, between the contracts and the science from the biomes you should easily have enough science for the first unlock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E With the new parts you can build A rocket capable of reaching orbit with a small probe with several antenae and a battery with enough power to last a long time. Also add a thermometer and barometer so you can get several other biomes on the way up. Grab any new contracts and ascend east utilizing the gravity turn. Try to place the probe in an orbit with a periapsis above 200. The barometer is useless in space but you can still transmit situation reports and temp readings (and serve as a relay if required in the future) so, warp around till you have a connection And try to grab any biomes you can. Then exit to space center.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E With the transmissions and contracts you\u0027ve completed you can now unlock the capsule. Note that since the rcs thrusters arent known yet the biult in rcs does not work so you may have to get creative if you make any mistakes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E After the payout from that you now have a large amount of money, With 1.25m heatshields (which were unlocked with the capsule) you can now make a few sub orbital probes with 3 goo canisters that can survive re-entry( each can get 3 biomes (I do not think they are the same as the thermometer, situation report, and barometer as I think flying in LEO no matter where you go is all one big biome. You can then unlock science jr (only one fits on a 1.25m heatshield) and do the same. Ive made it this far without worrying about upgrading the launchpad at all and everything is fine. Needless to say if I did I would have the money to do so. I am aiming to put a geostationary relay up (not necessary but I have the money and I want the challenge/experience),5 but I am waiting on hydrolox and solar panels/ dtms antenna. from there I am looking at the rescue contract and then the moon stuff. If you are ever short a few science for an important unlock you can just go to the tracking station and fly your second mission which should still have plenty of power, just warp around till you hit a biome and get your free science with the probe report or thermometer.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-24T03:58:09Z\u0022 title=\u002212/24/2014 03:58  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 24, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Bender222\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BevoLJ","CreatedById":77242,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-24T03:57:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow did you launch the Juno in your second mission w/o upgrading the launch pad?

Then after seperation, I was close enough to where the retrograde would be when I hit 80km that descent mode could easily orient me correctly for a smooth slow descent and recovery. note that I do not use engine ignitor but I believe aj10 has 2 or 3 restarts.
