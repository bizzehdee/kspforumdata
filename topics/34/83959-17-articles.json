The normal effects on the engine are some of the oldest, simplest effects settings that the game supports, and they only get removed if the MM config\u0027s \u0022NEEDS[HotRockets]\u0022 test says that HotRockets is still there. It\u0027s possible another mod set up their config wrong. If another mod has a block that says \u0022FOR[HotRockets]\u0022 instead of \u0022NEEDS[HotRockets]\u0022, it effectively tells MM that the mod is there, instead of asking for it as a requirement. Also, if the \u0022HotRockets\u0022 folder is still in GameData at all, MM will probably think the mod is still installed too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NecroBones","CreatedById":105424,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T17:14:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1.6.5 is up, with mostly fixes and tweaks:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E1.6.5 (2015-05-22) - Fixes \u0026amp; Tweaks\u003Cbr\u003E - Corrected the HotRockets config for the 0.625m jet engines.\u003Cbr\u003E - Explicitly defined fuelCrossFeed=False for radial decouplers.\u003Cbr\u003E - Added \u0022ModuleCrossFeed\u0022 to small radial fuel tank, for Crossfeed Enabler.\u003Cbr\u003E - Increased heat conductivity of flat adapters (so they don\u0027t impede heat management).\u003Cbr\u003E - Corrected an issue with normals on mini radial fuel tank.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T03:21:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust some quick thoughts, not sure whether they are intentional or not, and I\u0027m not explicitly asking for change here (as people might hate me for that but whatever)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.
