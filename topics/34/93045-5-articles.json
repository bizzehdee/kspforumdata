Basicly if you go look at the height of an unupgraded launchpad and then the height of the upgraded launch pad you will notice that the spot where the rocket is sitting is much higher on the upgraded launch pad. The VAB is simulating its \u0027floor\u0027 from the height of the upgraded launch pads (like those from .25 ksp).\u003Cp\u003EAnother issue this causes is with the maximum height of the rockets you build. So for example if you have an unupgraded launch pad and build a rocket \u0026amp; place that rocket on the floor of the VAB. Than add some sort of launch clamp onto it. You will notice that the height of the rocket suddenly jumps 1.5 meters. If you lower that rocket 1.5 meters into the floor then you now have a good rocket again. It just looks a bit silly with half the rocket buried in the floor. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you upgrade to the old launch pads all this is fixed.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-09T03:52:33Z\u0022 title=\u002201/09/2015 03:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by BevoLJ\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AChE","CreatedById":135021,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-09T23:02:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been working on moving the RD-107/108 from KW into the RP-0 tech tree to simulate the R-7.

This is by volume not by mass and HTP has a higher density than LOX or Kero, so if someone wants to calculate the exact ratio that would be good.

The 1m is a bug. .2m is plenty though even if it looks funny. An alternative is make a .3m stub with an empty pFuel Tank, and then put a bunch of tiny inline separators at the bottom.

BTW, its possible to use the cash advance from the sounding rocket contract to upgrade the contract building, then you can grab the rest of the contracts (don\u0027t even need to get the human orbit one either) and easily be able to complete like 5 contracts with a rocket costing like 2-3 grand.
