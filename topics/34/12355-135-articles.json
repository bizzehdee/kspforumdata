When a flying machine develops a bit of a wobble and the pilot\u0027s reaction time is not fast enough and/or overcorrects slightly, attempts to bring the machine under control only make it go more out of control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe cure is to either keep a firm hand on the controls without trying to do any correcting, or if the vehicle is inherently stable, let go of the controls and allow the vehicle to stop oscillating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe same seems to apply in this virtual world. A rocket with an oscillation period and/or magnitude that exceeds MechJeb\u0027s ability to control with the available control systems on the virtual rocket will constantly overshoot the correction inputs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomething else that seems to be a control issue with KSP is that aside from the throttle it all appears to be full on or full off with moving aerodynamic surfaces and engine gimbals banging back and forth, lock to lock. Control would be much smoother and gentler on the virtual hardware if there was even one stop between center and full movement. Two would be even better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat you get with snapping back and forth is parts ripping loose (such as Mainsails under orange tanks) like the tailfin on that Airbus which crashed in New York, October 2011. The flight recorder showed that the pilot was flapping the rudder back and forth, stop to stop, without any pause in the middle as prescribed by the Airbus flight manuals. Would \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E have happened to a Boeing because Boeings are built to take such abuse by pilots whereas Airbus\u0027 design philosophy has long been to design the aircraft to be \u0027just enough\u0027 to do the job - as long as the pilots also adhere to the limits. (Look up the Airbus crashes caused by their initial idea to save fuel by not allowing full throttle takeoffs or full throttle override during landings. \u0022I\u0027m landing here. You don\u0027t need full throttle. Oh, hey! Trees!\u0022)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what it looks like to me is that locking the center or central group of engines (or an outer ring of engines) provides a steadying thrust vector that does not wobble about, helping to bring the rocket back onto the desired vector after a control input, while also reducing the need for corrective control inputs because of that always aligned thrust. Sort of like the tailfin and horizontal stabilizer on an airplane provides a constant alignment force while the rudder steers and elevator pitches. (Unless your aircraft is a deliberately unstable fighter jet with a control system and full flying fins that maneuvers by allowing the aircraft to be unstable in the direction the pilot wishes to turn.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I can see may be an advantage of locking central engines is the non-varying thrust vector is all aligned directly with the center of mass and having the engines farther from the center do the steering gives them greater leverage and thus a stronger control authority.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Goatgas","CreatedById":67221,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-21T01:48:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDoes MechJeb work in career mode?
