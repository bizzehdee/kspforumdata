I\u0027m the type of guy who posts in the forums maybe once every 6 months, which is to say, almost never, but I\u0027ve been playing KSP for years. I tell you this at the outset because I feel like you\u0027re getting a misrepresentation of the community\u0027s feeling towards Mechjeb by reading the forums. And even the forums are much more positive than not when it comes to the work you\u0027ve done. I tell you this, again, so you realize there\u0027s a BUNCH more players like me than you think, you just don\u0027t hear from them. And I feel pretty confident that most of them would agree with the following.\u003Cp\u003EMechjeb is one of the best, most useful, and most liked mods there is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure there\u0027s a large \u0022stock-only\u0022 group out there, but they won\u0027t have an opinion regarding Mechjeb, anyway.

I personally like a challenge, but dislike needless repetition. I usually do a few unassisted landings, a few unassisted rendezvous/dockings , etc. every version just to keep my mad skillz up, but then I go full force Mechjeb. Who wants to spend 15 minutes docking after the first few manual successes when building a station, especially after it gets big enough to start tanking the FPS? So I just wanted to say, thank you very much for your work on Mechjeb. You have only increased my enjoyment of KSP which was already one of my favorite games of all time.
