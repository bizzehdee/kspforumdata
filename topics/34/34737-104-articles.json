But hell, I don\u0027t even know if I built the damn thing right, and when I thought I got one (finally) right, when I saved it in a subassembly, the stack attach node that the game kept was the one inside the largest piston, not on the inner part of the smallest one...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone have a picture of one that works? I think what\u0027s getting me confused is the placement of the stack attach nodes on the A segments, which seem to necessitate that the whole thing clip through whatever it attaches to.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-20T11:39:47Z\u0022 title=\u002204/20/2014 11:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 20, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by phoenix_ca\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"loppnessmonsta","CreatedById":58525,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-20T11:37:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eif you build it right, the piston stack should protrude out in increasing increments. like a big ole square pointy nipple. each piston should be visible on top of the last.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"phoenix_ca","CreatedById":50380,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-20T11:42:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes.
