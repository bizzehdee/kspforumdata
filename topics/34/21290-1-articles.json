Originally attracting investors throughout Kerbin for their promise of \u0027permanent manned-facilities\u0027 in orbit, this ragtag group of what Jeb likes to call \u0027college-jockeys\u0027 produced enormously heavy hunks of science for years before anyone in the investment game realized that no rockets available could propel them to orbit. The company then quickly went bust, and it disappeared from the public\u0027s knowledge. Years later, long after rockets became available that could lift the heavy loads, the Kosmos company warehouse was discovered fully intact, undisturbed, and full of dusty modules. The KSP was able to purchase the entire company (including the engineers, who were found living in the warehouse subsisting on tube-food and several types of rodent!) The station parts themselves were sold cheaper than the metal they were made from. Freshly employed and entirely grateful, the Kosmos engineers strive to continue to not live in a warehouse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERecently, Kosmos has shifted initiative to produce safer, better quality parts, due to its increasing role in the space community. The entire line of space station parts was removed from the company catalog, and some of the company\u0027s best engineers went on a soul-searching quest to the south pole. For weeks, the company\u0027s future was in doubt, until Kergei Kerman, the legendary designer of the Angara engines, returned from his own soul-searching quest to the \u003Cem\u003Enorth\u003C/em\u003E pole. With vision restored, Kosmos has released updated versions of its most important components, and is currently developing a new generation of space station modules.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E-Spacecraft-\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF0000;\u0022\u003EAs always, delete earlier versions of Kosmos from your parts folder before installing new ones.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropbox.com/u/43321825/VA.png\u0022 alt=\u0022VA.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbal.net/mod.php?id=52\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://kerbal.net/includes/functions.php?landing=mod_infographics\u0026amp;target=mod_signature\u0026amp;id=52\u0022 alt=\u0022functions.php?landing=mod_infographics\u0026amp;target=mod_signature\u0026amp;id=52\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVersion 1.0x (October 4th, 2012)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe VA capsule and its accompanying Drotik RCS module has carried the company through some rough times, and its classic ruggedness and reliability has won it a special place in the hearts of many.

Kergei Kerman, a lone engineer commissioned to produce an RCS block, produced the enormous RD-170 quad-chambered engine instead. His department scrambled to excuse the error by labeling it as the beginning of a Universal Rocket Module program, or URM, and Kergei happily obliged by producing an array of engines and tanks in all shapes and sizes. While brilliant, the plans were rejected by management as \u0027unnecessary\u0027 and \u0027counter-intuitive to the macro-conceptual ideascape that is Kosmos Spacecraft Design Bureau.\u0027 Kergei was fired, and was later found working at a kitchen appliance R\u0026amp;D department, producing high-thrust refrigerators and aerodynamic blenders, before taking a long soul-searching quest to the north pole. Now that he\u0027s back and leading the Angara division of the company, he has helped produce a new wave of designs that strives to push Kosmos into the future, both figuratively and literally. However, it was recently discovered that Kosmos\u0027 aerodynamics division was producing parts from low quality metal, and by low quality metal we mean asbestos. Until new parts can be machined, Kosmos is only selling its engines, tanks, and a few structural elements.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF0000;\u0022\u003EZip Download Backup:\u003C/span\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./?p9eiw4a5xz1udx7\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www./?p9eiw4a5xz1udx7\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropbox.com/u/43321825/LK.png\u0022 alt=\u0022LK.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbal.net/mod.php?id=49\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://kerbal.net/includes/functions.php?landing=mod_infographics\u0026amp;target=mod_signature\u0026amp;id=49\u0022 alt=\u0022functions.php?landing=mod_infographics\u0026amp;target=mod_signature\u0026amp;id=49\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVersion 1.0x (October 4th, 2012)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInspired by the way that cats always land on their feet when dropped, several engineers were injured while attempting similar aerial maneuvers. This confirmed suspicions that landing a large craft on \u0027all fours\u0027 would require special mechanical attention. The product of these experiments was the Powerpack, a decoupler designed to attach small fuel tanks and engines to the sides of modules, doubling as a location to place landing legs as well.
