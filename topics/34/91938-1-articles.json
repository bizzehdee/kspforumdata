Somewhere, perhaps in the mountains, perhaps somewhere at sea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea with the mod is to create a story, for now a short one. But the plan is to expant the story over the next few months. I suspect the best way to play this mod is in sandbox mode (for now). The mod is based on a set of missions. Each one advances the story. The first two chapters are finished, but the story will continue past these two initial chapters of about 15 or so missions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mod presents 3 windows, one for the chapters (left below), one with a map, description of the current story, the target coordiantes and the present coordinates. The map will also show the goal (green circle on the impage (far right top) and the curent location on the map (not shown in this screenshot). The third window pops up when the particular goal has been reached. The map window can be hidden by using the \u0022map\u0022 button on the main story window.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FGTgACJ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022FGTgACJ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe target positon also indicates R (radius, closeness to target) and H heigh above (and below) target that is acceptable. On some flight missions the target alt may be 90km, with a H=20km. That means that any height vrom 70 to 110km will be acceptable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a fun mod. The goals will slowly increase in complexity as the story progresses.
