Instead, the warp drive will be powered by an exotic matter resource, which the warp drive will automatically generate when it has electrical power available.

Immediately the utility of an engine increases the moment standard fuels are available. Basically, the Liquid Fueled version of the plasma thruster will function exactly as the plasma thruster does now - only using Liquid Fuel instead of Xenon.
