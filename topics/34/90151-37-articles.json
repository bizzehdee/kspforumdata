Essentially, to control your descent with a capsule you offset your center of mass so that the capsule tilts into the airstream, which gives you lift. Using your RCS thrusters, you can rotate the capsule, and use that lift to steer you to your landing site, or to increase or decrease your rate of descent:\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://nassp.sourceforge.net/w/images/5/59/Command_Module_Aerodynamics.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://nassp.sourceforge.net/w/images/5/59/Command_Module_Aerodynamics.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you for explaining!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut is it realistic that the center of mass is shifted?

If something has \u0022liquid\u0022 in its name, it means that it is NOT a liquid under normal conditions. Take liquid oxygen as an example - it is only liquid because it is extremely cold, and once it gets warmer (for example, warmed by sunshine) it transforms into the gas that you breathe every day, and is no longer suitable for fuelling your engine. This is the price you pay for the higher performance that these propellants have. As Rabada said, you need to use storable hypergolic propellants (such as hydrazine and its varieties MMH, UDMH, and Aerozine) for longer stays in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E@DaZeInBok: \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost people don\u0027t know this, but KSP is producing logs all the time, not just when there is an error.
