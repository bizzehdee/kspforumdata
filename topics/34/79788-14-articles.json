I\u0027d second (or third or fourth) the request for AP/PE info in the contract overview screen and if it\u0027s on the way, then my apologies and I\u0027m looking forward to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEntirely unrelated, but who would I have to ask to get integration with \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/81543-0-23-5-NavHud-a-NavBall-inspired-Heads-Up-Display-1-0-1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ENavHud\u003C/a\u003E? Because doing the aerial surveys is a lot easier when I know I\u0027m heading towards the target area so at the moment, I\u0027m using MechJeb to target the surface directly below the aerial waypoint, and lining that target up with my heading. So I guess my question is either \u0027how can the aerial waypoints be shown in NavHud?\u0027 or \u0027is it possible to change the navigation waypoints to actual targets so they show up on the navball/NavHud?\u0027. Just wondering,mind you.. My current method works fine, it\u0027d just be easier and look nicer if I had a little plane icon appear on my NavHud \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
