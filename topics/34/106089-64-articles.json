It really does seem like this is just a simple install issue though so let me see if I can get you through this. \n\nSTEP 1: Delete the folder \u0022GameData Waterfall\u0022 inside your GameData folder. Or whatever folder you have in there currently that says Waterfall. \n\n2. Go [HERE](https://github.com/post-kerbin-mining-corporation/Waterfall/releases) and download the file \u0022Waterfall\\_0\\_6\\_3.zip\u0022\n\n3. Once you open the download you will see the following files:  \n\n   \u0022GameData\u0022  \n\n   \u0022changelog.txt\u0022  \n\n   \u0022readme.txt\u0022\n\nDouble click the folder titled \u0022GameData\u0022\n\n4. Now you will see the following files:  \n\n   \u0022Waterfall\u0022  \n\n   \u0022ModuleManager4.1.4.dll\u0022\n\nCopy the folder \u0022Waterfall\u0022\n\n5. Go to your GameData folder where all of your current mods are. Paste.  \n\nNow you should see a folder titled \u0022Waterfall\u0022 inside you GameData folder. Boot up the game and check your plumes, they should work."},{"CreatedByName":"rocketman525","CreatedById":211801,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-06-06T04:18:39Z","Content":"I will do that now.
