The payload cannot be tipping in the fairing as it is secured with struts and it is not very flimsy, and i turned the gimbal distance on my engines way down because i thought that maybe it was the gimbal putting it in a spin but nothing seems to do the trick.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have all mods associated with Realism Overhaul and Real Scale Solar System such as mechjeb, remote tech, deadly reentry, etc.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny help would be greatly appreciated! \u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nightside","CreatedById":150244,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-06T04:44:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou will get better response in the Gameplay questions part of the forum or maybe in RO discussion, but one mod to make sure you have is Kerbal\u00A0 Joint Reinforcement.
