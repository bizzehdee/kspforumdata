But I always had alot of trouble orbiting the Gemini. I had to be pretty spot on because there\u0027s really no dV to spare. I use the Mechjeb ascent guidance and set the ascent path to start my turn at 100m/s, end turn altitude of 120km, final flight angle of 0 and turn shape of 50%. After launch I watch my Apoapsis and when it goes above 130km, I manually change the \u0022Turn end altitude\u0022 to whatever my current altitude is. If I time it right, my Apoapsis should increase to just around 150km in the time it takes me to finish climbing. Usually I\u0027ll reset the \u0022Turn end altitude\u0022 backt o 120 after I\u0027ve passed 120km though it\u0027s not really required. Normally with Gemini that\u0027s about all I need to do but it\u0027s worth watching your Vertical speed. If it every get close to 0 while you still have fuel in the stage 2 tank, I increase the \u0022Final flight path angle\u0022 just enough to arrest the fall, and slowly decrease that angle back to 0 as the last of the fuel is burned up. Usually, if I do everything just right I end up with 140km-160km Periapsis and 150km-200km Apoapsis.

Oh, it\u0027s probably a few dV off from what the real rocket historically got but it\u0027s about as close as you\u0027re likely going to come. Keep in mind that the Titan II only put the Gemini capsule into orbit (and my apsis range is within a reasonable margin of error to the actual flights - better ascent profiles will have better results). From there all it\u0027s orbital maneuvers were handled by the RCS system which has a significant amount of dV available to it (somewhere in the neighborhood of 500dV). I\u0027ve sent up multiple Gemini/Agena flights and have successfully docked all of them. Though I do admit that I tend to have the Agena come to the Gemini but that\u0027s mostly my being impatient (200dV with the agena happens alot quicker than 200dV with RCS thrusters).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JoseEduardo","CreatedById":127759,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-03T01:40:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022chrisl\u0022 data-cite=\u0022chrisl\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhat mod is SSTU?

You want to aim for your altitude to be 130-160km when the second stage burns out, which allows more efficient fuel use. It is even worth it to pitch a little below 0 degrees later in ascent to manage that final burnout altitude.
