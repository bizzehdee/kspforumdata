Any hab module as long as it powered should be able to last a week without any additional supplies/tanks (with full crew) as long as its powered. O2 and CO2 recycling is a sore point, as of now we just dump our excess CO2 and make more O2 out of waste water electrolysis. Excess CO2 should be dumped overboard if the air system is powered, if its not powered instead of an increase in CO2 there should be a drop in O2 (that means lack of oxygen should cause kerbal death, not rise in co2), if someone is running a greenhouse, CO2 could be converted back into O2, wastewater converted back into water, while increasing food generation. Water/wastewater can be recycled at 100% efficiency with electricity via electrolysis. This gives a person the option of storing only water for future generation of water and oxygen. Food can be generated via electricity with an algea farm (giving you your space food production), that could in theory also recycle CO2 into O2. In order for any life support module to make sense in the long term is for some sort of greenhouse module (space deployable for space stations or ground deployable for planets). I can hear the cries already \u0022But Temeriki, that means you can have 100% efficiency with only electricity\u0022, my response to you is SO? With a small crew and large enough greenhouses you could run at 100% efficiency (well 99.999999%). Well technically youd have excess of something, most likely water and O2, food production would be your limiting factor, with a space algea farm youd most likely need 2 to support one kerbal, with greenhouses lets say 1 kerbal each. This would require you to bring excess food and water for the transfer phase of colony missions, and require large bases to support more than a few kerbals. The life support parts should be heavy along with water storage, this would require one to actually have to plan for their additional weight.

If I decrease the 1.1 real-time seconds, then I run the danger of not slowing down early enough and overshooting by minutes (or hours at high time warp). The same issue will come up when recycling gets implemented because you will not need a large capacity for any of the resources.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA work around for now to allow higher time warp rates is: add more batteries. More capacity means that you should have enough ElectricCharge remaining to pass the checks, so it will leave your time warp rate alone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a suggestion for a workaround. It\u0027s a lot of work, and wouldn\u0027t be perfect, but it would be a step up from what you have now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you don\u0027t have enough ElectricCharge to last 1.1s real-time, calculate the net power draw. Unfortunately, there isn\u0027t any good way to do that - the stock Module* doesn\u0027t separate \u0022how much power will this produce\u0022 from \u0022Add power generated to stockpile\u0022. About the best way I\u0027ve found would be to (save the current power level and) temporarily add an absurdly large ElectricCharge capacity to a part, then call the update method of all \u0022unconditional\u0022 generator modules (solar panels, RTGs, etc.) on the ship. This will give you the amount of power produced that tick. Remove the temporary capacity and revert to the amount left before the magic. Calculate the net power draw this tick (=use - production). If the\u003Cem\u003Enet\u003C/em\u003E power use won\u0027t last 1.1 seconds real-time, then don\u0027t allow warp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I think the entire resource system needs an overhaul into three phases, at least at higher timewarps. First have all parts that produce/draw resources unconditionally (as in not transforming resources) do so, ignoring storage limits (this also includes allowing negative resources temporarily.) Then have all \u0022generators\u0022 do their transformations, but only within normal limits (only produce power if you aren\u0027t already topped up, etc.). Then clamp all resources to normal limits, and inform any unconditional resource drawers if their resource(s) are at 0.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout the only time this would have issues is if you have chained resource transformers, and that isn\u0027t too too common. The logical next step would be ratios, and it would solve that problem too, as well as the recycler problem, but would be an even bigger pain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, still working on the IonCross configs. Not sure if I should seperate the food into the greenhouse and have the mechanical recyclers only deal with air (but have a stock of food / water), or not.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-14T16:12:37Z\u0022 title=\u002209/14/2013 04:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 14, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by The Lone Wolfling\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TaranisElsu","CreatedById":57742,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-14T17:24:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022fenderzilla\u0022 data-cite=\u0022fenderzilla\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ehmm... you should add a part that converts IntakeAir into TAC_Oxygen, so you don\u0027t have to keep shipping O2 to Laythe even though you can breathe there.
