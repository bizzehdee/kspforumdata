However, once I\u0027ve started turning, I oftenly don\u0027t get to turn a lot due to my rocket accelerating to aa velocity where, if I try to turn it more, it\u0027ll flip over itself. This means that I have to get to about 20-25 km before I can get to more than 30 degrees off vertical. My rockets have a takeoff TWR of about 2, but I frequently throttle down in-flight so as to not go too fast - that is, too fast to do a gravity turn. So my question is this: is this problem best solved by reducing my takeoff TWR, or should I do something else, like putting ballast on top to make it top-heavy? I do use procedural fairings, by the way, so there\u0027s no problem with the payload being un-aerodynamic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Completely forgot to post my other question: How do I make a part FAR compatible?

You don\u0027t want to be too fast, so the dynamic pressure does not get too high. Generally you don\u0027t want your orbital prograde to go too high up anyway. In addition it\u0027s obviously easier to turn if you are slower. To prevent flipping you can add finns, but if you are too fast you might have difficulty turning. In any case in the lower atmosphere don\u0027t go too far from your surface prograde.

You should start your turn somewhere between 50 m/s and 100 m/s for TWRs around 1.4 - 1.7, but if you want to keep a TWR of 2 and not throttle down you can try giving it a slight kick right off the pad. If you\u0027re still having stability problems, the fairing might actually be the issue; fairings are very low-density, but do add a lot of surface area, so that can help make the rocket unstable; you can try putting whatever service module you have for the payload at the top of the fairing (upside-down, so the heavy engine is at the top) or you can try counteracting it with fins on the first stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd most non-wing parts are already FAR compatible, it\u0027s only the ones that are very, very different from stock that tend to be a problem. In that case, those need their own FARBasicDragModel Module defined, and the info for that can be found in the README. For wing parts, those need a FARWingAerodynamicModel or FARControllableSurface module, and the documentation for that can also be found in the README.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a development note:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI figured out why landing gear (at least the B9 gear) made so much more drag! It wasn\u0027t the gear, it was the struts attached to them; when a strut\u0027s first point is attached to a part, it adds another attach node to that part, which could mess up FAR\u0027s orientation detection algorithm.
