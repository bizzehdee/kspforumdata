They have been skilfully configed by OtherBarry, and will remain as faithful to the originals as possible. These will automatically work when you have the appropriate mods installed, you don\u0027t need to do anything.\u003Cbr\u003EBoth the decoupler and SRB changes \u003Cem\u003Eshould\u003C/em\u003E upgrade from previous versions cleanly, although I\u0027m not totally guaranteeing it so you might want to back up your saves.\u003Cbr\u003EI\u0027ve done some tweaking with the decouplers - they now show the decouple force as an impulse, in newton seconds, which is the correct dimensions. Stock decouplers have a bug (have reported to the Squad overloards) where they use a force where they really mean an impulse. As a result you can fire a decoupler in phys-warp and have it be up to 4x more powerful. What\u0027s a newton second? Well if you had two 500kg masses (1T total) and decoupled them at 1kNs, then the departure velocity would be 1m/s.\u003Cbr\u003EI\u0027ve also done some upgrades to the SRB code. The thrust, heat, and scale factor for the SRB is now stored with the save, so you can tweak the config parameters in the PART file safely and it won\u0027t affect ships in flight. There\u0027s also an improved way of doing the config too, full details are within the Parts/Tank/4SRB.cfg file. There\u0027s a new, somewhat easier formula for mass which stops tiny SRBs from getting ridiculously hot, and the config for the scaling of the thrust / bell is much easier to figure out. (same basic maths, scale proportional to sqrt(thrust)).\u003Cbr\u003EThis will be the last set of features prior to a 1.0 release, which I will do on Friday.
