It does affect your a/c - if you make a standard-configuration plane (main wing and rear stabilizers), if you leave pitch at ailerons, they will counter elevator\u0027s input - if you pitch up they will act like spoilers, pushing you back down, and if you pitch down, they will act like flaps, lifting you up. Also if you leave roll on rudder, it may overdo its input, leading to unnecessary yaw \u002B IRL it\u0027s pilot\u0027s job to take care of rudder and apply correct yaw to prevent side-drift. Leaving pitch on rudder and yaw on elevators/ailerons shouldn\u0027t do any harm since they don\u0027t work in those axis anyway but only if your wings/horizontal stabilizers are perfectly horziontal, and vertical stabilizers are perfectly vertical, otherwise they will make unnecessary input in axis they are not meant to work in. Also leaving roll on elevators is only a good idea if you build a fighter and use winglets for elevators.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. I guess some study on aerospace engineering XD.

But wikipedia should be enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@Ferram - I think I also hit the node drag problem, I was reentering with soyuz descend module from bobcat - since it has both, top and bottom node, free at reentry, the torque from drag they made them cancelled out (though it should\u0027ve been applied on top node only, since it isn\u0027t aerodynamical, forcing proper orientation) which togeather with intentionally offset CoM allowed me to stay in correct orientation. However, the drag of whole pod was so ridiulously high, that while normally I would probably overshoot the target with FAR (since it lowers drag), I landed almost 300 km short of target. I had like 5G on flattest possible reentry trajectory and didn\u0027t even see reentry plasma.
