The closer the angle, the better the reception, the further the angle, the less reception until about 90 degree where you will receive no power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA very simple way to use beamed power is with a big reactor on the ground, with an array set to transmit, and at least 3 arrays in orbit around kerbin set to relay mode at 0 degree inclination and 120 degree separation around 750km. This should give you 360 degree power availability around kerbin. You can use more relays/transmitters with smaller separation if you wish. And you can launch whole powerstations with 2 arrays to both transmit and relay power if you wish.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my main save, I personally use 6 3.5m fusion reactors orbiting kerbosyncronously at 0 degrees inclination and 60 degree separation, each with two arrays, ktec and direct drive generators, 2 of the flat radiators, a computer core, and docking ports for refueling. This setup however gives me obscene amounts of power, something like 220GW, which is overkill. But it\u0027s late in the save, so absurdity is the rule. I can get usable amounts of power all the way out to Jool with the deployable array (Area/size only matters for recieving power, not transmission or relay modes, and it mostly only useful to combat losses due to very long distances.).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can learn this and much more on the wiki, located here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/FractalUK/KSPInterstellar/wiki\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/FractalUK/KSPInterstellar/wiki\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-27T19:21:41Z\u0022 title=\u002203/27/2014 07:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 27, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by WaveFunctionP\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tery215","CreatedById":89094,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-27T20:01:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFractal(UK), there are significant issues in the power priority system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFuusion Reactors powered by lasers and such really need higher priority than power transmitters, since the reactor needs power to run (obvious)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo solve this, I highly recommend allowing players an \u0022up\u0022 button (^) and a \u0022down\u0022 button(v)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WaveFunctionP","CreatedById":104784,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-27T20:02:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tery215\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Tery215\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFractal(UK), there are significant issues in the power priority system.\u003Cp\u003EFuusion Reactors powered by lasers and such really need higher priority than power transmitters, since the reactor needs power to run (obvious)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo solve this, I highly recommend allowing players an \u0022up\u0022 button (^) and a \u0022down\u0022 button(v)\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a bug involving direct conversion mode generators.

My repo has both the source code, configs and assets all integrated into the project. (Which is why you see nested assets inside each solution folder, because they are imported assets. It\u0027s how visual stupid handles things.) Which then builds the proper gamedata folder as an output. The reason I use xcopy on post build is that visual studio requires that I go to each asset in the project individually and set it to output (I can\u0027t just click on the folder and set everything to output), which is a pain in the butt as there are a lot of files. And even when I tried to do so (by editing the xml for the project script), it didn\u0027t copy files to output properly as it put them into all the same base folder. So my build would compile the dlls and put them into the targeted plugin folder, but it would also put the configuration files and assets in the plugin folder as well.

This is DESPITE having more than enough power for everything. The power currently being drawn in the image is only 5.19 GW from the KTEC reactor and the nose reactor - i have tried running the ship with the nose reactor off by the way - off of an upgraded fusion reactor, so its capable of at least 25GW of output.

First time post, got an odd thing happening and I wonder if it\u0027s a bug in the plugin / the game, or just a bug in my brain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have KSP 023, KSPI and a bunch of the planet packs from kerbal universe active.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERunning the AIM reactor - reactor shows ~0% active when turned on, even when under load. It will power up initially to ~100% and then drop off to zero. I assume that it is supposed to throttle to zero when there is no power required however, it does not throttle up again in line with power requirements.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI noticed this when the ship has a microwave transceiver:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- With the microwave transceiver turned ON (in either send or receive mode) - If I time warp for a while, it will activate at 99%, then go back to 0 very quickly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- With the microwave transceiver turned OFF and with no other load, after time warp it will function correctly when put under load. If I then turn on a microwave transceiver (in either send or receive mode) it will again fail and go back to 0%.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Without using time warp, the reactor will remain at 0% regardless of the power configuration, occasionally perking up a little, i.e. to 0.0001%. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- If the ship does not have a microwave transceiver then the reactor doesn\u0027t seem to work at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve tried a clean install of KSP and KSPI with a blank sandbox save, but that didn\u0027t work either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone have any ideas / has anyone experienced the same problem?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WaveFunctionP","CreatedById":104784,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-28T14:58:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jinks\u0022 data-cite=\u0022jinks\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhile that\u0027s a nice gesture, it \u003Cstrong\u003Emight\u003C/strong\u003E create problems down the road. Say, I make a change to the repo, test it and want to send you a pull request. Those DLLs will be part of every pull request since everybody has to recompile them all the time.\u003Cp\u003EGithub has a download feature, maybe that is better suited for those cases. People that don\u0027t intend to compile the code have usually little business in using the latest checkout.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry, I worded that wrong. I meant, you might \u003Cstrong\u003Eadd\u003C/strong\u003E obj/* and *.dll to .gitignore (if it isn\u0027t already there) so those files don\u0027t get checked in by accident in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s hope so. To be frank, the changes up to now might already dissuade Fractal_UK from including your changes in the official repo.
