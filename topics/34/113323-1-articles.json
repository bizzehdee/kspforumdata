It just makes you get the 100% science-reward the first time you do the experiment.\n\n***But only if you recover it**. This mod does **not** get rid of the penalty for transmitting data, **it only affects the execution of an experiment.***\n\n**Here is what it does \u0022in action\u0022; Fresh game, first time on the launchpad, full green bar:**![xN7DxzK.png](http://i.imgur.com/xN7DxzK.png)  \n\nNeeds: **[Modulemanager](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/50533-131-module-manager-304-feb-11th-2018-early-christmas-gift/)**\n\nDownload/Source:  \n**[Download](http://spacedock.info/mod/74/Science%20-%20Full%20reward!)** from Spacedock\n\n[Source](https://github.com/maculator/Science-Full-reward) on Github\n\n*Thanks to [@Malah](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/96644-malah/) and the guys from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003Eckan\u003C/abbr\u003E IRC it is now in the repository, thanks alot.*\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-09-28T07:56:30Z\u0022 title=\u002209/28/2019 07:56  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 28, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by maculator**\n  \nUpdated for 1.7.3"},{"CreatedByName":"Nansuchao","CreatedById":135151,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T13:54:04Z","Content":"Great idea!"},{"CreatedByName":"nightingale","CreatedById":119307,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T16:58:29Z","Content":"Awesome!
