Since I guess it\u0027s a bad idea to land on Duna with an unfolded dish antenna which breaks in atmosphere, the orbiter will relay communications until the landing is done (at which point, the lander can use its own antenna). Both parts are equipped with a Communotron 88-88 (dish antenna aimed at Kerbin) and a Reflectron DP-10 (omnidirectionnal antenna to keep contact with the lander). I managed to get into Duna low orbit (first time, yay), so, considering the communication delay, I planed the landing:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003Eexecute maneuver node to meet the ground \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Eactivate chute, retract lander solar panels \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Edecouple lander \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Eexecute maneuver node to get the orbiter back into orbit (the mass will be decreased but that\u0027s not really a problem) \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDecoupling goes fine (though, I should probably switch the controlling probe before in order to be able execute the second maneuver), but then, the lander cannot be controlled, even though:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003Eorbiter is still in communication with KSC \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Eboth still have electricity left \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Eboth probes are activated \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Eboth DP-10 are activated \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen looking up in the debug console, I get the following errors repeated a varying amount of times, when switching back back to the orbiter:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E[Exception]: IndexOutOfRangeException: Array index is out of range.\u003Cbr\u003E[Exception]: ArgumentException: Getting control 0\u0027s position in a group with only 0 controls when doing Repaint\u003Cbr\u003EAborting\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are the SFS files (quicksave) before and after the decoupling (there is one more KSS-DUN probe orbiting the Sun that failed to enter Duna orbit and that I have not retrieved yet):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://sinon.org/ksp/dunaLow.sfs\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://sinon.org/ksp/dunaLow.sfs\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://sinon.org/ksp/RTbugged.sfs\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://sinon.org/ksp/RTbugged.sfs\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the craft file: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://sinon.org/ksp/KSS-DUN.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://sinon.org/ksp/KSS-DUN.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEdit:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe craft uses a part from the Engineer Redux mod and the error message appears after:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E[Log]: [FLIGHT GLOBALS]: Switching To Vessel KSS-DUN Probe ---------------------- \u003Cbr\u003E[Log]: Camera Mode: AUTO\u003Cbr\u003E[Log]: stage manager resuming...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand before:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E[Log]: RemoteTech: ModuleRTAntenna: Find TRANSMITTER success.\u003Cbr\u003E[Log]: RemoteTech: ModuleRTAntenna: Add TRANSMITTER success.\u003Cbr\u003E[Log]: RemoteTech: ModuleRTAntennaPassive: Find TRANSMITTER success.\u003Cbr\u003E[Log]: RemoteTech: ModuleRTAntennaPassive: Add TRANSMITTER success.\u003Cbr\u003E[Log]: RemoteTech: ModuleRTAntenna: Find TRANSMITTER success.\u003Cbr\u003E[Log]: RemoteTech: ModuleRTAntenna: Add TRANSMITTER success.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEdit 2:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a few more tries, I identified that decoupling was sufficient to trigger the bug (no other order to either detached module) in dunaLow.sfs.
