Firstly you have the cover petals closed - even with the correct combination of ports, you would not be able to dock as the petals are physically blocking the docking interface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe intention is to pair an active port with a passive port, as in real life - Common Berthing Mechanisms are not androgynous systems. To give players some leeway so you don\u0027t have to plan out space station layouts quite so meticulously, the ports are technically compatible with each other in-game (i.e. you can dock an active to active, passive to passive). This is why the guide fins can be retracted (also to allow backwards compatibility with existing craft files, since the old CBM model gets converted to a passive port - if I made the ports correctly gendered it would totally break existing craft). \u00A0However, the geometry of the active type II prevents it from docking with itself. This is just a consequence of the way the petals have to deploy when attached on the radial node of a 2.5m part (i.e. their use on the ISS).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou are the first person to have been caught by this so I haven\u0027t really considered it an issue until now. I can put a warning in the part description for the type II port that it cannot self-dock. It would certainly be more elegant if the ports were able to dock with each other, but there are a limited number of ways to do this given the constraints of the game and the intended use case - believe me when I say I looked into a lot of different options and the current one seemed to be the least problematic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"davidy12","CreatedById":143411,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-06-24T02:34:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224293659\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022133501\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221686933593\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022208484\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Lil_Bread402\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 6/16/2023 at 11:39 AM, Lil_Bread402 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca data-fileid=\u0022undefined\u0022 href=\u0022https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1034619776233897984/1119305215313715271/screenshot164.png?width=405\u0026amp;height=676\u0022 title=\u0022Enlarge image\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022screenshot164.png?width=405\u0026amp;height=676\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage ipsImage_thumbnailed\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022166.91\u0022 height=\u0022676\u0022 width=\u0022405\u0022 src=\u0022https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1034619776233897984/1119305215313715271/screenshot164.png?width=405\u0026amp;height=676\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthere\u0027s going to be a \u0022Space Station Freedom (1986) craft file too for anyone who wants dual keel.

In terms of the Kraken attack when you rendezvous with your ISS replica my best guess is that there is a bug with your install of KSP. It could be one of the mods, another is I have found using the stock inventory system causes a lot of bugs I have noticed and lead to my installs getting buggy and unusable in one case. My best advice is if you use the stock inventory system try to use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E if you can to avoid it. My last idea is that you may need t reinstall KSP and back up your mods and save files. It is rare but sometimes while downloading KSP it can somehow get corrupted a little during the download and reinstalling is the best thing to do. It also does not hurt to download a fresh set of mods either. Your saved files should be fine I hope at least, these are all my possible ideas as to how to fix your issues when making installs download KSP off the what was the squad now private division store and download each mod by hand as I find \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECkan\u003C/abbr\u003E rather annoying to use.

This is possibly due to the main drive already beginning to fail or a separate issue with the backup drive.

In a couple of cases I have WIP files on another drive or files I\u0027ve shared with other users, but for the most part it seems that the source files are gone. This scuppers (or at least vastly complicates) any plans I had of revisiting or altering existing parts, as well as my hopes of repurposing much of the newer work for KSP2. Also gone are 3 years worth of textures, reference material, tools, presets and plugins I have accumulated, as well as my Unity setup. I\u0027m currently without a Unity install at all so can\u0027t even get parts in game, though I can do some basic modelling on my laptop.\u00A0Some of this I will be able to rebuild, and thankfully the finished products are already out there for people to enjoy. Incredibly frustratingly, just a couple of weeks ago I was planning to put all my KSP source files up on Google Drive as a publicly accessible resource, but had such a busy week with work that I never got chance to set it going.
