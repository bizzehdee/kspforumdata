At that point, thinner wings will have much more sudden stalls than thicker wings (the difference being leading edge versus trailing edge stall). In general, anything with a thickness greater than ~12% chord will have its peak lift dropped severely by early onset of trialing edge stall while anything thinner than ~12% chord will have its lift dropped severely by leading edge stall at much lower AoAs.\u003Cp\u003EFAR doesn\u0027t bother with this, since it\u0027s kinf od complicated to figure out and would make procedural wings a de facto required mod.

That is, the thinner the air, the lower speed the aircraft, and the heavier the payload, the closer an aircraft operates to stall. Thus, thicker wings would allow flight in more marginal conditions, to higher altitudes in subsonic flight (which is what I\u0027m interested in- especially with thick wings and relatively weak propulsion in the form of propellers, Flying Fortress style), etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, thicker wings allow you to build in greater camber, and according to NASA:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022\u003Cstrong\u003EIn general, low to medium speed airplanes have airfoils with more thickness and camber. \u003C/strong\u003E\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://quest.nasa.gov/aero/planetary/atmospheric/aerodynamiclift.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://quest.nasa.gov/aero/planetary/atmospheric/aerodynamiclift.html\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a lot of data out there on \u0022The Effects of Airfoil Thickness on Lift Coefficient\u0022.

Thickness was a consideration as well as size- and of course wings that are thicker at the base can support a greater maximum span if they gradually taper.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI find the perspective of history and the evolution of aircraft particularly interesting. Take, for instance, this quote from a discussion )on Reddit) of the replacement of biplane/triplane designs with thicker-winged planes after WWI:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u0022during WWI wings were thought to be most efficient when thin. This was logical since thin wings would simply slice through the air. It was not until later that it was discovered that thicker wings could actually create more lift with less drag by way of the Venturi affect (thicker at the leading edge, thinner at trailing edge). This negated the advantages of the second wing, and inadvertently created new uses for the wings such as fuel storage. \u0022\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1k5fjn/why_were_biplanes_the_preferred_method_of_early/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1k5fjn/why_were_biplanes_the_preferred_method_of_early/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve heard a lot of similar lines in historical documentaries on WWI-era aircraft, as well as on the History Channel (back before it went to Hell), etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIMHO, Procedural Dynamics (aka Procedural Wings) \u003Cstrong\u003ESHOULD\u003C/strong\u003E be a huge advantage and practically a requirement for any serious plane-builder in KSP who wants to build craft with low wing-load and high Glide Ratio.

Also, you need to start the gravity turn slow and early (not 10 km straight up and then yank over, that\u0027s not a gravity turn) in order to keep the rocket from becoming unstable.
