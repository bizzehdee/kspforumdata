I dunno if any of the tech tree mods is to blame for it being below expected parameters for DR?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think your shield is leaking enough heat for that to be the issue. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E is probably causing convective heating of the pod. It will not be fully occluded like in stock. (and depending on its shape may not be fully occluded even in stock)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat skin max temp means you\u0027re probably seeing hull damage when skin temp reaches 867 assuming default parameters (damage starts at 85% of max temp; 1020 x 0.85 = 867). Since DR has no configs for that part then you have to assume defaults are in play.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, see recent posts on the subject of cargo bays and small 1.25 heat shields. It sounds like you\u0027re describing a similar craft. Something a bit long with with low temperature parts clipping into the reentry wake? Again, don\u0027t expect that shield to occlude very well if it\u0027s about the same size as the parts you\u0027re trying to protect.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"chateaudav","CreatedById":177643,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-04-14T21:25:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s not very clear which parts are modified with DR... only heatshield ??\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBesides, is DR changing the behaviour of parts from other mods (nearfuture, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E, etc) ?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks !\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwaster","CreatedById":71262,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-04-18T05:59:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223583313\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002250296\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221555277124\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022177643\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022chateaudav\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 4/14/2019 at 5:25 PM, chateaudav said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s not very clear which parts are modified with DR... only heatshield ??\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBesides, is DR changing the behaviour of parts from other mods (nearfuture, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E, etc) ?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks !\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny part which use the stock heat shield module (ModuleHeatShield) is converted over to the DR version which alters shield characteristics when the shield is depleted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe inflatable heat shield\u00A0is changed (thermal characteristics to match real world equivalent, mass reduced and smaller/larger versions added)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEvery single part is gone through to make sure it max temp and other thermal characteristics are realistic and not overpowered.
