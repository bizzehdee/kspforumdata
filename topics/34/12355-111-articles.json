All are assuming I\u0027ve only set auto throttle on. A) Am I solely responsible for my roll? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E I mainly use asparagus launch systems, and therefore like manual stage control, is this messing with the auto pilot or will it adapt on the fly? C) Is auto throttle not also a flight path controller? aka Is it just adjusting my throttle based on where I\u0027m pointing? I suppose what I really want to know is what are the limits of the \u0022ai?\u0022 What does it look at for each sparameter and how does it respond?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NeoMorph","CreatedById":58200,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-01T08:20:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Simplicity\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Simplicity\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI remember reading somewhere that the fault is because you have mechjeb on an angle.. - before you take off, right click on your pod and go control from here, I think from memory that fixes the problem...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you know something... this is actually the reason my ship was taking off at an angle. It\u0027s even a reasonable failure too because in real life it could be the gyros inside Mechjeb being tilted.
