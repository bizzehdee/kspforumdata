For instance, the atmosphere is shallower, and the gravity well of Kerbin far less deep than that of Earth - we can make do with an escape velocity of 3500-4500 m/s to 70 km or so on Kerbin while Earth requires 10\u002B km/s delta-V and ~150 km as a minimum for a stable orbit. As such, the game balance is based on certain things being unrealistic - and the atmosphere model is a big culprit there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, FAR does make for challenging rocket launches, once you\u0027re trying to launch things that are not aerodynamic in shape.

I\u0027ve had a dickens of a time building lifters for the station I\u0027ve been planning, because it has some rather large and unwieldy parts (based on LLL\u0027s 4x4x2m habitat block).
