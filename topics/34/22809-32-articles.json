But it did bring up an issue in that KAC only seems to look for an SOI change in the current orbit, not within the current maneuver node. It\u0027s assuming therefore that all craft transferring from one SOI to another would do so in one orbit. I think this assumption makes perfect sense.

So the way this works is that there is a target phase angle between the planets that this watches for. As the orbits are elliptical this does not move in a consistent fashion, so if you have the autorecalc option turned on then as the game progresses it will update the alarm time. so while that says 84 days to go at day 66, it may well fire the alarm at day 200 when the angle arrives.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETBH my order of preference for these things is:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Alex\u0027s tool - keeping in mind that the best value is not the only one and you need to look at all the blue areas then decide whether you want to use one of the less efficient times\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E The Model data one - which will give me good windows, but not as easy to see whats going on (and only 100 earth years of data)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E The circular formula\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MOARdV","CreatedById":60950,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-27T12:38:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TriggerAu\u0022 data-cite=\u0022TriggerAu\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EUnfortunately the only thing on the background thread stuff is the Version Update Check that happens once a day.
