Think I am having confusion with a change in longitude of ascending node \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gunso","CreatedById":103860,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T02:43:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ehi, just want to ask. I\u0027m using the current dev version. Does the ascent path editor still work or the new ksp broke it? I\u0027ve been wondering because i noticed the gravity turns starts at the same height no matter what value i set in the editor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E------------------------------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEverything else seems fine to me (only used it up to minmus on career mode tho). At 1st I\u0027m kinda puzzled with the rocket spinning at mid air the 1st few times but manage to fix it by reducing the % thingy on the ascent guidance(also saw in forum about top heavy rocket). Last night tried the auto landing on kerbin, 1-2km diff from the hq is really quite nice i would say. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis new issues with the new atmosphere kinda gave me an idea for career mode. Imagine if u need to do contract missions of collecting data for the atmosphere 1st at multiple level and area and only after doing that mechjeb will be able to be used properly in that planet atmosphere. So if u go to a new planet, u need to drop a few probes before mechjeb can do proper calculation for the landing. If not the landing will be like when ksp broke mechjeb with the new atmosphere update XD\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethat gonna be fun\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"futrtrubl","CreatedById":77310,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T02:54:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Gunso\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Gunso\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ehi, just want to ask.
