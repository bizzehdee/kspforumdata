It handles restoring the state of any mod which stores its data in the vanilla persistence file (basically any of them worth their salt), and even handles it if you exit the game during a simulation. \n\nDownload: [Mod](https://github.com/fingerboxes/HoloDeck/releases/tag/ksp1.0-beta1) \\ [Source](https://github.com/fingerboxes/HoloDeck)\n\nScreenshots:\n\n[![jBBY1Axm.png](http://i.imgur.com/jBBY1Axm.png)](http://i.imgur.com/jBBY1Ax.png)\n\n[![EJeiEnOm.png](http://i.imgur.com/EJeiEnOm.png)](http://i.imgur.com/EJeiEnO.png)\n\n[![VkEQ8kvm.png](http://i.imgur.com/VkEQ8kvm.png)](http://i.imgur.com/VkEQ8kv.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T08:35:41Z","Content":"Very cool.
