Therefore, I believe that a high-friction \u0022foot\u0022 for walking machines (or bases that end up planted on cliff-faces) would be a useful and welcome addition to your mod pack, and would give the ksp community a new type of machine to build. I have searched quite extensively, but have not been able to find such a part in any other mod. nor have I been able to find if such a part would be possible at all (does KSP even have friction mechanics outside of rover wheels?)
