Manned version (crew removed and an OKTO2 set on top for control) farther down the thread, with a Skipper can\u0027t be landed by MechJeb on Eve even though it should have enough TWR to land if the final burn starts high enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m wanting to build a ship with just enough capability to lift off from Eve and make a 100KM orbit, after refueling on the surface. That would also involve reducing the weight of the vehicle during landing. With on surface refueling it won\u0027t matter how much it burns on the way down, as long as it lands intact and will have enough fuel capacity and available thrust to lift off and reach orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechJeb could land on Eve with less TWR if it\u0027d start the burn higher. I\u0027ve had it land pretty hard a few times where it almost broke engines off (without KJR the engine would\u0027ve been off) and jammed the legs into the surface, refueled with hyperedit and was able to lift off. With a bit higher final burn start those would have landed just fine. Wouldn\u0027t be able to get back to orbit of course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechJeb should be able to land anything on Eve with a TWR greater than 1 *and enough fuel* to last until touchdown. A vehicle built to only land (which would be whatever I build for the refueling) should not need an excess of thrust or fuel just to land. I\u0027d like to get that part of the mission down with fumes in the tanks, less mass to move from Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThink of it as being the way Airbus designed their early computer controlled airliner takeoff and landing systems. It used \u003Cem\u003Ejust enough\u003C/em\u003E thrust to do the job*. It\u0027s a bit difficult to develop such a design for Eve in KSP when MechJeb requires a Mainsail where a Skipper would work using different flight parameters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Nevermind that at least two crashes were in part attributed to the system not allowing manual full throttle override in an emergency.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Skorpychan","CreatedById":72052,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-07T20:43:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022BigD145\u0022 data-cite=\u0022BigD145\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou have multiple copies of the part folder somewhere.
