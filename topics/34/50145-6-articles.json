I absolutely love what you\u0027re doing with this, and it would be the bee\u0027s knees to have all the stock experiments require the same time / resource investment. Being able to strap half a dozen nearly-weightless goo experiments onto a pod that barely fits one Kerbal and vacuuming up tons of science without any effort is one of the more terrible dings against the stock science system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E*IF*\u003C/strong\u003E (if, if, if) you\u0027re planning on encompassing the stock system, I have a few bits of input.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Crew reports are changed. Based on the biome that you\u0027re in, every capsule (or anything that can collect a crew report) will gradually build up \u0027report points\u0027 over time. A capsule on Kerbin won\u0027t tell you ****, but one on the surface of Duna will be interesting. Every report gives you only a few points, but the idea is that \u0027checking in\u0027 on your crews is rewarded. It doesn\u0027t really make sense that I *wouldn\u0027t* want a report from my crews, because I already got a report from a different ship two months ago.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Scientific instruments (thermometers and such) contribute exponential amounts of data towards a full \u0027science package\u0027 based on how many different readings you get, how far apart distance-wise your readings are, and how much time has elapsed. A stationary science lab, for example, could be put into a \u0027constant monitor\u0027 mode that gradually builds up points over time, whereas they could probably be gathered a little quicker if you had a rover roaming around getting readings in various locations. Simply pushing the button once to gather a single data point, however, tells you almost nothing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- A single Kerbal or probe core can only accomplish a single experiment at a time.
