I have FAR switched on so I thought I\u0027d use a fairing to improve fuel consumption. The problem is the weight of the procedural fairing parts. The payload is just 0.15 tonnes, proc fairings adds another 0.08 bringing the total to 0.23t. This is enough to throw the balance off and the rocket tips over when starting the gravity turn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA reaction wheel is too much and it becomes twitchy and again does a loop. Adding control surfaces also shifts the weight balance again - it works lower down but as the air thins out it loops again.
