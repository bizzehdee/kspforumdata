Using latest dll and IR core. Only free moving rotatrons joints on this WIP Rover wheels:\n\n![GhmJnVu.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/GhmJnVu.jpg)\n\nFree rotating Rotatron with wheels attached working fine when alone. However there is need to limit movement \u002B/-45 or 35 degree. It is not possible to do that with free moving parts. So, I tried to limit movement by adding additional free moving parts. Tried different combo, using rotatrons and/or free moving joints, but no luck.\n\nExpected behaviour is that wheels stay on the ground all times, while rotate around rotatron axis. With strut conection to secondary free moving rotatron or free joint, movement should be limited to less degree, but 5-15 degree of rotation should still be possible. Unfortunately, it is not.\n\nLooks like free moving parts were locked in place, similar to powered parts like others described before, just there is no option to unlock it since those are free moving parts. Haven\u0027t found anything suspisious in log file. Let me know if you need craft file fro testing.\n\nAlmost forgot to mention, I tried this with and without KJR mod, behaviour is the same.

With latest release, however it is no longer a case, despite my bad WIP design, those joints were no longer locked at 0%. There is at least some small degree of movements shown.\n\nAlso, you must not forget about stock KSP \u0022feature\u0022 with wheels autostutings. Showing them trough ALT\u002B12 cheat menu helps with troubleshooting of craft designs flaws. Following picture shows some progress with my own design flaws and how wheel autostruts were attached between IR parts.\n\nI have put additional truss adapter between wheel legs and free moving IR parts, creating a subassembly of it, that will make it easier to try general idea with different kind of IR parts.\n\n![EjNwDnX.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/EjNwDnX.jpg)\n\nOrange lines are visulisation of wheel autostruts.\n\nIt would be great if those free moving parts could be limited in editor, so additional strutting were not needed, but it is not absolutely necessary, there is more important stuff to iron out.\n\nI have yet to try stuff with powered IR parts, but first testings shows that autolock of parts is no longer issue.

So annoying, lol! As far as the \u0022toolbar-settings.dat\u0022 file, I have tweaked it, deleted it, ect. I am truly stumped!  I am very well versed on removing residual files left behind. I take \u0022snapshots\u0022 of the file structure before adding mods to help prevent such file trash from being left behind when removing a addon or mod! Most every time I add or remove a mod or addon, I do so with a fresh clean instal of KSP. This also helps to clean out and residual file that I may have missed. I try to be very careful to keep things neat and clean when modding. Thank You so very much for the quick responce! It is without a doubt, that all help is much appreciated!"},{"CreatedByName":"DrScarlett","CreatedById":146555,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-15T22:11:00Z","Content":"Hiyas again,\n\nso regarding [@RoverDude](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/105198-roverdude/)\u0027s remark that I can drop the crew down, I only need one guy to operate an ASM.

However in the Blizzy ToolBar  the radio button is available  to click. But when it is active the toolbar disappears! I have spent countless hours and countless configurations trying to get to the UI and I have never been successful in getting to servo control or and editors at all.
