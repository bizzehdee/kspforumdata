I\u0027m learning how to do it myself but i only just started, and you are obviously very good at this kind of thing already.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo be honest ,It will take at least 100 people wanting something before I spend the time doing something like that again. I agree it would be a great ship in KSP, but it\u0027s already a great ship in Halo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI prefer to make things that are not available to actually use anywhere. The only reason I did the dropship is because there has not been an aliens game yet where you actually get to fly one (not that Im aware of)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then on the other hand, something like Starwars ships, or Star Trek ships..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are so many games that already have those ships at your disposal to fly, and in much better detail than KSP allows (lets be honest, something like the B9 pack looks beautiful...that\u0027s if you run your pc at full spec playing KSP... most people don\u0027t so the entire thing comes out looking like crud in most of the screenshots, its not a low res friendly pack thats for sure) so it\u0027s about finding a balance as well and seeing how your craft will go once you downgrade it to KSP physics.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Knight123","CreatedById":58373,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-18T03:25:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would like to see you make the pelican since nobody has made it yet for whatever reason and the remakes of the pelican all suck\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wasmic","CreatedById":64885,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-18T13:51:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDevo said some (maybe a lot) of pages ago that he was tired of making sci-fi ships, and generally tired of making stuff that he knew what was going to look like, and that he now invents his addons while making them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Devo","CreatedById":22750,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-19T07:04:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022wasmic\u0022 data-cite=\u0022wasmic\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDevo said some (maybe a lot) of pages ago that he was tired of making sci-fi ships, and generally tired of making stuff that he knew what was going to look like, and that he now invents his addons while making them.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPretty much.. half way through making the space eagle 1999, all I wanted to do was go watch space 1999..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would even love to do a proper Rocket pack, like a NASA set or something like Bobcat does with his historical craft, but even that doesn\u0027t hold my interest for very long, if I come up with a cool idea, then that seems to keep me interested long enough to actually finish the mod.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-19T07:11:32Z\u0022 title=\u002206/19/2013 07:11  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 19, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Devo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hladow","CreatedById":62697,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-19T11:33:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan you update Space Eagle to 0.20?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZobrAA","CreatedById":65233,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-19T17:16:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESome whine about Clamp-o-Hatch:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ckZBmnZ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ckZBmnZ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut nevertheless it\u0027s a great idea!
