Being able to see the data transmission range as the crow flys as well as over your relay would also be awesome if anyone knows how to access that data without manual number crunching.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sporkafife","CreatedById":38208,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-12T17:39:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey guys, I\u0027m having a major problem. I\u0027ve just started setting up a RemoteTech network for sending probes out into the universe instead of just manned pods, and I\u0027m not entirely sure if I\u0027ve set it up properly, because it\u0027s a little broken!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first thing I did was send up 3 Keostationary satellites, two have a view of mission control and the third one doesn\u0027t. They each have two directional antennas with 50Mm range. I set one dish to point at \u0022mission control\u0022 and the other to point at \u0022active vessel\u0022. Are these the correct two options to make sure they can relay a signal from any vessel? Because the third satellite, the one with no direct view of mission control, won\u0027t relay it\u0027s signal through one of the other satellites unless I specifically tell it to point one of it\u0027s dishes at one of the other two satellites.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShouldn\u0027t pointing it at \u0022mission control\u0022 be enough for it to figure out to route the signal through one of the other satellites? After all, they both have a dish pointed at \u0022active vessel\u0022 as well as a second pointed at mission control... at the moment I have to specifically select one of the other satellites as the target for RemoteTech to connect to mission control. Is this just how the mod works, or have I set up my dishes wrong?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
