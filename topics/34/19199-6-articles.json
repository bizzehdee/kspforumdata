This time I had something a bit more practical in mind. I downsized the stock aerospikes (keeping them balanced to the stock parts, no overpowered super-parts here) and downsized Novasilisko\u0027s Radial Flange from the Novapunch Pack (Yes, I have permission from Nova and Tib)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese two engines are a little heavier (plus the weight of the flanges also adds a bit of weight) and have a little less combined thrust than a single stock aerospike which you could stick on the bottom node, but this preserves the look and ground clearance. I increased the Isp by 2.5% to 400 to balance the extra weight and drag. I think it looks very nice on the DEMV and is very well balanced to the stock parts.
