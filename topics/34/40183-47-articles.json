Then I\u0027m also wondering what happens with constructed in orbit ships...\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn KSP persistent.sfs settings, turn off QuickSave but enable Autosave. I did this for my own (non-MCE) \u0027ironman\u0027 game where I wanted to be challenged but found myself not having fun because certain mods kept disassembling my ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat this means is that you can\u0027t quickly reload and you can\u0027t pick a convenient time to quicksave, but in all likelihood you won\u0027t lose too much work if the game crashes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote: this sometimes puts you in a \u0022uncontrolled rapid suborbital trajectory descent\u0022, i.e. plummeting towards the ground. If the game crashes and you go back in, try to get to your craft quickly before it performs \u0022autonomous enthusiastic lithobraking maneuvers\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rowns","CreatedById":66524,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-06T10:52:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have a question, coudn\u0027t find the answer, does this mod work only in campain mode or also in freebuilt mode?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
