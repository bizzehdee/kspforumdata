Once you remember that MechJeb can hold specific heading and pitch related to surface, spaceplanes become much easier. At least, I\u0027ve been able to take stock Aeris, tweak it slightly and get it to orbit with some fuel left over -- probably enough for docking and refueling. But I haven\u0027t been able to combine that experience with an airship envelope yet. But to be precise, for starters, I am trying to make an airship that takes off and gets a stable above-atmosphere Kerbin orbit without dropping any pieces off and some fuel left over for docking. The Eve mission would be using a design derived from that as the main lander -- there should be no problems airdropping them fuel to refuel it on the ground after landing, or mining kethane on Eve itself and hauling it by smaller electric airships, etc, as long as a fully fueled lander can actually leave -- and then it can be reused.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing a deployable envelope to boost a spaceplane up to about 10-12km on Kerbin and pretend I\u0027m just starting off from a very high mountain does not produce particularly good results, it seems it hinders the takeoff more than it helps.
