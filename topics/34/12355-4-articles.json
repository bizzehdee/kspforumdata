My latest Mun Project, MunLab I, stacks a re-designed MunBase module on top of a big ol\\\u0027 rocket and, I figured since I seem to lose BigTraks more than I can land them, I should throw a whole bunch on there. Using a radial mechjeb to control the now unmanned and autonomous Munolith and Public Transportation craft, I figured that these puddle jumpers would be the bees knees.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, they are not. Upon reaching the mun and preparing to land them one by one (after I got the Lab down of course), I found that I had no control over the beasties like I would if they had a capsule in them.

I followed all the instructions in the manual, unless I missed something all four times I read it. First you do the practice launch with the height and heading you want to rendezvous with, end the flight, land or crash, and then do the same thing with the timer on. But during the final ascent MechJeb always pitches my rocket sideways and it crashes into the ground a short way from the KSC, killing the kerbonauts. Does anybody know how to fix this?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Menelmacar","CreatedById":29221,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-30T00:37:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SOLIDninja\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SOLIDninja\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyeah thats the thing i don\\\u0027t want to decouple a satellite from my craft - my craft *is* a satellite and it want it to act like it - every time i use the dynasat decoupler under my probekit parts it just detatches and flys away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe dynasat converter is meant to do that \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E you build the sat on one side, decouple it when you want and it flies of and does it\\\u0027s sat thing.
