Then I reinstalled it with the 17. Jan DLL and build the bigger ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso another strange thing happens, maybe it has nothing to do with it, after my attempt to undock i terminated the ship and build a bigger one for more payload, so untin _now_ i did not come close again to my station to, perform another docking sequence, however, now i can\u0027t select a port as a target port, only \u0022rename\u0022 is displayed.
