There was also a Juno II which was developed from the Jupiter Medium Range Ballistic Missile, which was an evolution of the Redstone family, but not a Redstone Rocket. There were other Jupiter rockets in the Redstone family, but they were used for testing components for the Jupiter Missile. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESources:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redstone_%28rocket_family%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redstone_%28rocket_family%29\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGM-19_Jupiter\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGM-19_Jupiter\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_rocket\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_rocket\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juno_I\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juno_I\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MGM-29_Sergeant\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MGM-29_Sergeant\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd to answer your first post (DOUBLE POSTING IS BAD), the Kerbolar system is 64% of the Solar System\u0027s scale.
