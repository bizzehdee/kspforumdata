Part of my problem is that I want to make these mods as unintrusive as possible. So it\u0027s been particularly difficult to modify this functionality while not actually changing the way stock works, and also not make it obvious to the player. It\u0027s possible I may build this one and release it as a separate add-on since it might not retain the \u0022stockiness\u0022 that I strive for with these mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~Claw\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vardicd","CreatedById":75832,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-12T15:28:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ObsessedWithKSP\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ObsessedWithKSP\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESmall enquiry - what\u0027s the status on AsymmetricFlameoutFix? \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/97285-KSP-v0-90-Stock-Bug-Fix-Modules-%28Release-v0-1-7d-6-Jan-15%29?p=1557783\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1557783\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ELast update\u003C/a\u003E was on 23 November and it wasn\u0027t looking promising... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis might help you until the problem gets addressed here: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/104704-0-90-Intake-Build-Aid\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/104704-0-90-Intake-Build-Aid\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: and may-haps this mod could give some clue as how to implement whatever fix is necessary for a \u0027stock-bug\u0027 fix?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-12T16:43:14Z\u0022 title=\u002201/12/2015 04:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by vardicd\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vardicd","CreatedById":75832,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-12T19:10:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust experienced the stuck on the launch pad bug, even with the fix installed. output log and persistence: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/sh/kepbpuk742o4tdl/AABPA-Z2VzHc0Rj0pqpEnbgra?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/kepbpuk742o4tdl/AABPA-Z2VzHc0Rj0pqpEnbgra?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E Let me know if you need anything else, i\u0027ll try to find it for ya\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-12T20:55:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022vardicd\u0022 data-cite=\u0022vardicd\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EJust experienced the stuck on the launch pad bug, even with the fix installed\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor this particular bug, the best feedback is a picture and/or a .craft file, plus the launchpad tier.
