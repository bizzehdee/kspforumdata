Am i the only one getting this issue? I tried several things to fix it but didnt manage to succeed. If you guys have any hints ^^.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E edit:  \n\u003E just found that in the astronaut complex. \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E ![Kerbal.png](https://i.ibb.co/cg07L10/Kerbal.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Tried as well to EVA Jeb and it kinda fixes the thing but the nullref is still there. So means i have to forget about jeb and let it stay in orbit forever. \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E If i destroy him then the astronaut complex becomes empty on the left column that is specialized for hiring.\n\u003E \n\nHi,\n\nI have the same issue you had: every time a kerbal becomes grouchy or whatever it corrupts the game file, when they return to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003Eksc\u003C/abbr\u003E they don\u0027t do XP and then disappear.  \n\nWere you able to find a solution to this bug? Editing the save file afterwards? I\u0027m not well versed in the editing of ksp file, I have downloaded KML but could not figure out what to do..."},{"CreatedByName":"paul23","CreatedById":120544,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-12-18T19:06:14Z","Content":"Hmm so I\u0027m not sure which pack of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E adds the extra kerbal classes (miner, technician etc). I\u0027m guessing this mod, otherwise tell me and I\u0027ll post this is the correct thread.\n\nAnyways; is it possible to make the extra kerbal classes available from other \u0022missions\u0022 that give kerbals? - rescue, and with tourism plus I\u0027ve got the space campe missions. If this is \u0022hard\u0022 - would it be possible to allow \u0022retraining\u0022 certain classes to the specialisms? IE, there are 10 specialisms, allow retraining of \u0022pilot\u0022 to \u0022kolonist, quartermaster or scout\u0022. \u0022engineer\u0022 to mechanic or technician and \u0022scientist\u0022 to Miner, geologist, farmer, biologist or medic.\n\nThose missions easily give me more than enough kerbals, so it\u0027s weird that I have a few dozen pilots but no specific classes."}]}
