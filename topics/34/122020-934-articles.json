The program was struggling with the paraglider, and most importantly the Titan II launch vehicle was experiencing a lot of teething problems, not the least of which was a severe longitudinal oscillation known as pogo. Test flights were experiencing a pogo rate well above what NASA felt was safe for astronauts. The Air Force\u0027s Ballistic Systems Division (BSD) didn\u0027t care much about solving the pogo issue, because as long as the pogo was not affecting the performance of the missile in its mission of delivering a nuclear warhead (it wasn\u0027t), the Air Force had little incentive to spend time and money correcting the issue. Indeed, the BSD was worried that working on the pogo issue may actually delay the introduction of the missile into active service, and they heavily resisted doing anything about it. NASA also had some valid concerns about combustion instability in the 2nd stage engine, and overall parts and manufacturing reliability. The Titan II had only a 50% end to end reliability record to that point. NASA was so worried that in October 1963 they initiated a study to look at the feasibility of shifting the launch vehicle to the already flown and tested Saturn I.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome very high level meetings and discussions took place between the BSD and NASA and the bureaucratic log jam was cleared. The Air Force intransigence melted away and thy began to incorporate the recommended pogo suppression equipment in some of the test missiles. In November 1963 they had a full up success with the test flight of missile N-25. The issues were all then quickly resolved and the Titan II turned in sterling service to both NASA and the Air Force.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut let\u0027s say for the moment that NASA got spooked by the Titan problems and actually shifted Gemini to launch on the Saturn I.

Changing the spacecraft adaptor section and all of its internal systems would have resulted in an unwarranted delay.

Lots of things aren\u0027t optimized. Everything is a compromise between performance, development cost, time, how easy it is to manufacture, etc. So the S-1\u0027s issues, I think, have been blown out of proportion as time has gone on. The S-1 was doing what it was meant to, and trying to switch to something like a monolithic tank would mean essentially starting over from scratch. I\u0027ve seen a lot of stuff talking about upgrading the S-1 with stretches, boosters, etc. As \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/206664-daveyj576/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022206664\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/206664-daveyj576/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@DaveyJ576\u003C/a\u003E mentioned the S-1 uprating reports were all done by Chrysler.

The Instrument Unit in particular, originally a substantial fraction of a Saturn 1B\u0027s cost, would have been made significantly cheaper to fly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith that said - yes, by the time you reach the \u0022Shuttle Decision\u0022 as I call it, the Saturn 1B isn\u0027t even in the running anymore. It was basically between the Shuttle, some variant of Titan, or INT-20 for how to move forward.
