The file is fully documented, but ask away if you have questions, or if you think a module needs special handling (or, very importantly, if that partmodule is NOT derived from class PartModule. But, most are, whew).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESame goes for resources, like Kethane or Ore or SpareParts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe point is this: I need help adding support for mods. Adding support for mods is non-destructive, so any mod support in MCESettings.cfg can safely be used by someone who doesn\u0027t have that mod. Further, the cost function is pretty flexible--there\u0027s a lot of stuff in there you can do without special handling. For instance, I could (I planned to but didn\u0027t have time) add support for a RemoteTech antenna of type ModuleRTModalAntenna by adding this to the MODULESCOST node:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003EModuleRTModalAntenna\u003Cbr\u003E{\u003Cbr\u003E\tFLOATS\u003Cbr\u003E\t{\u003Cbr\u003E\t\tantennaRange0 = 5\u003Cbr\u003E\t\tantennaRange1 = 1\u003Cbr\u003E\t\tEnergyDrain1 = -1000\u003Cbr\u003E\t}\u003Cbr\u003E}\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat means multiply the value antennaRange0 in the partmodule by 5, multiply the value antennaRange1 in the partmodule by 1, and EnergyDrain1 by -1000, and sum them all together to get the module cost.
