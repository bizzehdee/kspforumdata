It\u0027s a decent program that does it\u0027s job. The problem is that once you really get involved in modding the game, you generally completely stop playing it. At least, that has been the effect for all of us who contribute to DMP; out of Darklight, RockyTV, VITAS, and myself, none of us really play KSP anymore.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know RockyTV is still doing some work, and I\u0027ll be doing some stuff in the upcoming months - so DMP isn\u0027t completely dead/inactive. Whether or not this work gets continued in the main repo or in a fork, well only time will tell.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo clarify a bit, all of RockyTV\u0027s work and improvements will probably go into unstable/master, so you will get these updates like any other. This is assuming RockyTV continues to work on DMP, which I am inclined to believe is true. The work that I\u0027m planning to do will mainly involve GUI code improvements/new features/very obvious bugs/coding horror reversal. RockyTV has been working on immediate issues with the 1.0 release and some bugs with scenario modules. I\u0027m not sure what he plans to work on next.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile I haven\u0027t discussed this with darklight yet (I\u0027m just coming up with it now), there are a few possibilities we have from here, with darklight taking a (temporary?) bow:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EWe can start a new fork of DMP.

Cons: We code into Unstable/Master, and the current system requires Darklight to keep it going. We also diverge from the current codebase (maybe only slightly though?) in the main repo, but the git history is always there.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the end, we will probably be picking the last option, unless RockyTV/someone else wants to start a new fork/Darklight wants us to move on XD Anyone is free to do so, and several have been in the works before, but none have come to fruition as far as I\u0027m aware. I hope this calms the minds of anyone who might be worried about the future of DMP. As Darklight said, there hasn\u0027t been a great deal of work done on it for a while (I know I sure haven\u0027t contributed anything in a \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Elong\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E time), so nothing is really changing with the state of the mod. And of course, anyone is free to make pull requests or suggest features in the github issue tracker. However, I would suggest discussing your ideas for contribution/bug fixes with us in #DMP/the issue tracker first so we can make sure your pull request will be accepted to the main repo \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, again, anyone can feel free to fork the mod and start your own version/whatever of DMP.
