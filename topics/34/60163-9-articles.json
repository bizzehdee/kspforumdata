If you are trying to load \u0022Disable\u0022 while \u0022Basic\u0022 is loaded, you won\u0027t notice any change. This is because there are no biomes to load in the \u0022Disable\u0022 set. If you load the \u0022Empty\u0022 set, you should see the new biomes disappear. At least that\u0027s how it behaves for me. Let me know if that\u0027s not the behavior you\u0027re experiencing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://1drv.ms/X18z0k\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EDownload 1.6.5\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVersion 1.6.5 fixes the bug where a GUI button would still display even if the GUI is disabled via the config file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://1drv.ms/1zklYyy\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDownload Source\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
