I also want to be able to keep it realistic as possible in that there isn\u0027t a 100% conversion in resources from one to the other so you would always need to replenish stock from outside sources. In RL the ISS will always need resupplies for snacks and oxygen from Earth and I\u0027m thinking the Kerbals will probably need a similar supply but they could mine Water from the moons and have hydroponics for food etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I plan to go through this thread soon and get a feel for what TAC LS does and what parts have been added but I was wondering if anyone would be interested in my idea of linking it with the Kethane mod (if this has not already been done).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Ability to harvest Water\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Water can be used by TAC LS for kerbals to drink\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Converter to convert Water in to Hydrogen \u0026amp; Oxygen\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Oxygen can be used by TAC LS for kerbals to breathe\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Converter in the form of a hydroponics to take sunlight, CO2 \u0026amp; Hydrogen and convert to O2 and Food (I\u0027m thinking of perhaps an algae that can change Hydrogen \u0026amp; Carbon-Dioxide in to Hydro-Carbons perhaps?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- None of the conversion are 100% - so you wont get 1 tank of Hydrogen and 2 tanks of Oxygen from 3 tanks of Water. Same with hydroponics so you\u0027ll always have to source nearby Water to replenish stock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo you\u0027ll have a moon base with a couple of hydroponics connected to it with a load of tanks for waste water, water, o2, co2 etc and different converters for them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-12T13:23:31Z\u0022 title=\u002203/12/2014 01:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 12, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by psyper\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eadding url for the kethane addon\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sidfu","CreatedById":70409,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-12T18:30:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Epsyper any resouce u add for mining/harvest will work with tac resouces long as they they same mass. even if they have same name if mass is off it can cause problems with the calculations tac does. i had tac stop workign when waas trying to get biofuel to work with it. most dont use biofuel is cause instead of chaging biofuel to work with tac u have to change tac to work with biofuel which is wrong way to do it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"psyper","CreatedById":90641,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-12T19:13:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sidfu\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sidfu\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Epsyper any resouce u add for mining/harvest will work with tac resouces long as they they same mass. even if they have same name if mass is off it can cause problems with the calculations tac does. i had tac stop workign when waas trying to get biofuel to work with it. most dont use biofuel is cause instead of chaging biofuel to work with tac u have to change tac to work with biofuel which is wrong way to do it.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can bring out an add on which will just amend the Water resource in TACLS using ModuleManager so that its picked up in the Kethane mod - all we need to do is add scanning and mining ability to the Water resource and nothing else needs to be touched. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only reason why I have it currently set to a different mass is for selfish reason as I have a mining operation that moves Water and Kethane tanks around and I wanted to keep them the same mass so I don\u0027t have any balance issues but I can soon bring out a version which is compatible with TAC and throw in some more parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes TACLS need to have water replenished though?
