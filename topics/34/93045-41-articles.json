Everybody knows that the A4 flew in the early forties. If it\u0027s in the game, it pretty much has to be in the starting node, together with avionics that allow for a controlled flight. If that means one can make orbit on starting tech, that\u0027s just how it is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn a similar vein, nothing stops you from combining RD-107/8 engines with balloon tanks, for Titan-like capabilities in 1959.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore we wonder how it\u0027s possible to preempt this, I\u0027d like to ask if we should even try.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jovus","CreatedById":117163,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-06T18:59:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Laie\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Laie\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIn a similar vein, nothing stops you from combining RD-107/8 engines with balloon tanks, for Titan-like capabilities in 1959.\u003Cp\u003EBefore we wonder how it\u0027s possible to preempt this, I\u0027d like to ask if we should even try.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess that depends on the scope and intent of the mod. Namely, if the purpose here is to provide a (fairly) realistic historical tech progression while possibly making concessions to playability, then I\u0027d say no, don\u0027t try at all and leave it how it is. If the purpose here is to take RO/RSS and make a playable career mode out of it with a passing nod to history, then yes, it might be worth a try.
