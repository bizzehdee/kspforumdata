Look at it from the readouts in the VAB and in-game.\n\nBut basically: Kerbals need space to live in.  Every \u0027seat\u0027 is assumed to be a set amount of space - unless specified otherwise in the part config.  Some parts (like the cupola) make the Kerbals happier, making the space they have last longer.\n\nIf you coup up a Kerbal to long, they\u0027ll get unhappy with the space they have, and stop working, or whatever your hab requirements are set to.\n\nHab time is how long they are comfortable in the ship they are currently in.  Larger ships mean they are more comfortable, and they can hang out longer.  Smaller ships mean they are cramped, and start getting grumpy sooner.  (And certain parts - again the cupola as an example - can make smaller ships feel bigger.)  That\u0027s based on habtime and habmultiplier.  It resets the moment they change ships.\n\nHomesickness is how long they are comfortable away from Kerbin.  If they\u0027ve had room to stretch and move around in the past, they can go quite a while before they get to missing Kerbin - even if the ship they are currently in is smaller.  The same things come into play for it, but instead of tracking just how long they\u0027ve been in this one ship, it tracks how long they\u0027ve been away from Kerbin, and what the biggest ship they\u0027ve been in is.\n\nBoth of these start counting down the moment you leave Kerbin.  Both can be countered to an extent by larger ships with more hab time.  Hab time can be completely reset by changing ships, while homesickness cannot - the coundown can only be extended by putting them into ship with more available living space."},{"CreatedByName":"lude","CreatedById":150904,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-12T19:32:43Z","Content":"Thank you two, that was very helpful, I also found the other settings file, it\u0027s very unintuitive that it\u0027s called USI-LS (at least to me)\n\nI will use thecopula from now on and try to give them some more space since with no space minmus missions already become a problem, so homsickness with the right station years long missions are possible?"},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-12T20:20:00Z","Content":"Why is that unintuitive?

I mean, are nuclear reactors really radioactive? I would hope not, they are used on aircraft carriers, submarines, ice breakers ... It would be very uncomfortable if they would irradiate the room they are in along with the maintenance workers.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-13T14:06:57Z\u0022 title=\u002204/13/2016 02:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 13, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Kobymaru**"},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-13T14:10:17Z","Content":"See \u0027shielded\u0027.

Pretty much the only things running off nuclear reactors these days are too big to launch into space.\n\nWould you be adding any parts for this?  It has been forever but IIRC the really old original interstellar mod had some shielding parts that you could use specifically to put in between radioactive parts and crew parts to help with shielding.  I seem to even remember you could get higher dosages of radiation when on eva and moving past the \u0022shield\u0022.
