One involves a having a copy of the original save and going to the tracking station on that, which will mess with orbits, but when you go back to the original save there will be no problem. Another solution is to download the patch file made by [@Sigma88](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/113260-sigma88/), which will create a fake body that your satellites will orbit instead of Kerbin. It requires you to know how to edit the persistent file to change your ship\u0027s reference body."},{"CreatedByName":"Nori","CreatedById":41334,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-10T03:49:45Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 7/10/2016 at 5:03 AM, KillAshley said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E however there is a ***highly experimental*** cfg i would like some volunteers to try.
