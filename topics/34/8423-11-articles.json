You ignite the primary engines, wait a few seconds then light the Srbs, at or around 24000 you start the roll over, and watch the SRB fuel, when it hits 98% burned, e shuttle will start to flip, jettison the Srbs, and \u0022go with throttle up\u0022 you usually use up the fuel tank by 55000 so jettison it, and switch to the OMS.
