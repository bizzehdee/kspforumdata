I\u0027m going to run some tests tonight to see if non-tweak-scaled ports have the same issue. Funny thing, though -- the port itself was fine.

Tweakscale doesn\u0027t change anything besides mass with ports, though that MAY have a factor in it. Otherwise I think you are onto the right path, besides the ports having too much strength (known and fix coming), the PPs have too little.
