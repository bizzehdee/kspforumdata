The Pioneer\u0027s 75% Recycler is theoretically capable of reducing the total supplies by a max of 60.75 (5 Kerbals \\* 16.2 \\* 75%)\n\n5 Crew Scenario:  If the vessel has only 5 crew, their total daily supply requirement is 81 units of supplies.  Because of the max recycling limit of 50% per vessel, recyclers can only reduce the total usage to 40.5. \n\n8 Crew Scenario: If the vessel has a crew of 8 however, their total supply requirements would normally be 129.6.  This allows the Pioneer\u0027s recycler to operate at max efficiency, and reduces the total ship\u0027s requirement by the full 60.75 units.  The ship therefore only consumes 68.85 units, for a 47% total savings (and does not trigger the max vessel limit.)"},{"CreatedByName":"ModZero","CreatedById":89470,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-29T22:47:25Z","Content":"So, sorry if someone already did that, but I did a [mindless config](https://gist.github.com/anonymous/93e5d8f1b73fed052702) for @Nertea\u0027s space station \u0026 spacecraft habs and cupolas, along the lines from the comment on top of LSModule.cfg (if I understood them properly, which isn\u0027t a given this late).
