Sounds like a win to me. I hope they put your talent to good use. I like the pieces save for they are very circumstantial. I have the same complaint with a few other parts mods; I like the stock parts because they mostly all fit together (some of the aerospace parts, obviously, not so much). The command pods are freaking awesome. And the quality throughout cannot be denied. Fantastic work. I eagerly await what is to come from your official capacity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I do not know if there are rules that prohibit a staff member from having a \u0027pet project\u0027, so it may be possible he\u0027ll decide to maintain it on the side. This is the problem with mods and modding in general. There is a sort of general agreement with the staff that they will work on the game, but mods can come and go as they please, regardless of promise or popularity. All it takes is the creator to lose interest and voila, gone. It\u0027s incredibly selfish to be bothered at all that he would be employed by Squad. After all, he could have been hired by EA or Ubisoft, or some other third party making AFN commercials to the same effect. His fans should be glad that they\u0027ll see his work in an official capacity instead, might even ensure he\u0027ll be sticking around for some time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-14T14:04:38Z\u0022 title=\u002205/14/2013 02:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 14, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Hyomoto\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AndreyATGB","CreatedById":62674,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-14T14:29:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t understand how you can be unhappy with his new job.
