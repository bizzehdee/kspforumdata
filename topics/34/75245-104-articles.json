There\u0027s just no point in trying to use it to queue up a list of actions to occur at a specified future time because the timer is relative to when you manage to finish typing in the parameters and click the commit button. So the time it took to type the actions in affects when they go off. In order to get two commands to fire back-to-back, you have to put a long delay on the first one, commit it, then get the second one set up, and give it a shorter delay than the first one had. then wait ... wait.... wait.... and hit the button......NOW. That just seems utterly ridiculous when presumably the probe HAS a clock on board and can be told to trigger something based on that clock time. The only limitation should be that the command can\u0027t go off any earlier than the time it takes to get the signal to the probe. If you set a fixed time that isn\u0027t far enough in the future, then it won\u0027t go off when you said, and instead goes off once the signal arrives.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was half of why I gave up on the RT flight computer. The other half was the UI inconistency where SOME fields you MUST press enter after typing for the change to take effect and other fields you must NOT press enter because enter commits the command rather than just the one field you\u0027re on. That was such a pain.
