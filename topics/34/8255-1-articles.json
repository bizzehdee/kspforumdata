A few days ago, some lab technicians at Anatid Robotics accidentally created several thousand 5-meter wide black holes that they barely managed to contain before they plunged into Kerbin and consumed the planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext, the good news: working without sleep, the same technicians managed to set up some force fields that allow the black holes to be attached to rockets and launched into space, where we won\\\u0027t have to worry about them destroying us all:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/yOfdh.png\u0022 alt=\u0022yOfdh.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, the payoff: the black holes can be connected together to allow essentially instantaneous transportation along a wormhole network. Put up two black holes and we have a superluminal highway between any two points in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lOTrH.png\u0022 alt=\u0022lOTrH.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a dangerous business. While the black holes are completely safe while attached to the ship, they become lethal as soon as the confining force fields are released. They have powerful gravity at close distances, and anything entering a black hole will be destroyed unless it carries a properly programmed Wormhole Interface device, which can manipulate spacetime to create the temporary wormholes used for transportation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/aT8lh.png\u0022 alt=\u0022aT8lh.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually using a wormhole transportation network requires rendezvous with an orbiting wormhole (or bringing one up with you). Rendezvous is made somewhat easier, however, by the black hole\\\u0027s gravitational attraction. This will be dramatically clear when you make a close approach to a hole, but it\\\u0027s enough so that it can pull you in from several hundred meters if you reduce your relative velocity. It\\\u0027s even possible to get into a tight orbit around a black hole (or, probably, to get several black holes to orbit each other).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EDetails:\u003C/span\u003E This currently consists of two parts and an associated plugin. One part is a 5-meter black hole, or wormhole mouth. You should attach this to a rocket via a decoupler, launch it into some orbit, and then decouple it. Once you decouple it it will start to act like a black hole, complete with gravity and death for those who enter it. The other part makes black holes safe: a Wormhole Interface. Attach this to your rocket and you will get a GUI window that allows you to set a destination wormhole mouth. With this set, you can pass unharmed into any other black hole and emerge at your destination. Because a black sphere strained my 3D modeling skills to the limit, the wormhole interface currently uses the stock ASAS model.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote: Your ship will be destroyed if you do any of the following: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-fall into a black hole without a wormhole interface\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-fall into a black hole with a wormhole interface without a destination selected\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-fall into the same black hole selected as the destination on your wormhole interface\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuggestion for how to start with this: send up one crew with a black hole on a suicide mission. Just get the black hole into some orbit. Then decouple it; the crew will fall in and die but you\\\u0027ll have one wormhole up. Then send up another crew with a wormhole interface and a second black hole, and before you decouple the black hole, program the interface with the other black hole as its destination. When you decouple the second black hole, your ship will dive into it and emerge at the other one; when you emerge, you may have to thrust away a bit to avoid being sucked back in and dying. Now you can shuttle between these two holes at will, and put up more destination holes at your leisure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027ve been liking \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=8524.0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ERinComp\u003C/a\u003E as an aid for rendezvousing with black holes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis project is currently pretty rough.
