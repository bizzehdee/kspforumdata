Particularly on lower gravity worlds, this speeds up the rate at which the vessel responds as even the maximum default tip of 20\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 only provides a sideways acceleration of about 15% the force of gravity currently pulling downwards on the vessel. Note that the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E system does not affect if the mod is engaged or not, it is optional.

I\u0027ve been using the B9 air thrusters, seeing as how I\u0027m on a VTOL rampage at the moment, and have found using this mod to kill the horizontal speed works much better than the MechJeb version, since it doesn\u0027t pitch and roll the ship to hold steady, which MJ could never quite get right. The red landing marker is a nice touch, and well-done. However, if the ship becomes \u0022physics unloaded\u0022, by heading back the Space Center, or changing to a vessel outside of physics range, the mod stops working altogether on that ship.
