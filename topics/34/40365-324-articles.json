I\u0027m going to try and take this opportunity to make some much needed tweaks to the Interstellar tree as well. Hopefully the result will be a nicer technology progression in career mode, this will allow me to incorporate some much needed balance changes - such as stopping the likes of gas core nuclear reactors from appearing in the same node as the DT Vista, which are really on a completely level and thus don\u0027t really belong in the same node.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI agree that 2 is the much better option long term. However if its going to add alot of extra time to your workload and further delay the next version significantly you may want to consider doing both. A quick patchjob MM config to shift the grabber for the next release and slate option 2 for a future release.
