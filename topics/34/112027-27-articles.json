Running more than one converter may put it over that limit. If I\u0027m correct, you would see the same behaviour with a fully stock craft. There is little this mod can do if that\u0027s the case. You could increase the max cooling numbers of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E with ModuleManager.\n\nNote that Squad reasons this (the setting of max requestable cooling capacity \u003E max effective core heat transfer possible) opens up a bug where parts want to consume more radiator capacity than they need so that a sufficient amount of radiators is not enough (despite the numbers suggesting otherwise). I think Squad decided that rather than solving this bug (in a more complicated way?), setting those fields to equal values accomplishes the same. However, that does mean the limits in any part are now enforced in a stricter way."},{"CreatedByName":"Keldion","CreatedById":184008,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-19T13:37:50Z","Content":"Yeah it does make sense, I get the same problem when using the Whirlijig Nuclear Reprocessor with 3 formulas...\n\nThe max cooling of the convert-o-tron 250 is set to 200kW is the description as well, I have a feeling it was highter than that before.\n\nUsing ModuleManager do seems to be a good idea, I know I need to create a .cfg file but can anyone can easily tell me what I should write to raise the max cooling of the convert-o-tron 250 to 800 or 1000 ?\n\nThanks,"},{"CreatedByName":"Keldion","CreatedById":184008,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-19T21:31:01Z","Content":"Nevermind !

KSP\u0027s heat system is mostly workable for environmental heat, maybe nuclear reactors if you use NFE\u0027s hack. These things don\u0027t require keeping the temperature at an exact value, but they work with relatively large heat loads. The low temperature loop, on the other hand (crew, electronics, batteries and solar panels), needs strict temperature controls, but it doesn\u0027t move a lot of heat around. Even the technology involved is completely different for high and low temperature systems. Implementing the latter would likely have to be a separate mod, as this system would be more related to life support mechanics than nuclear reactor heat. Crew cooling for Apollo was about 10W per person, which was a footnote even in that case (most heat came from mechanical gyroscopes).\n\nFor the record, Apollo cooling system topped out at about 3kW, of which 2.4kW was for cooling the attitude gyros. ISS solar panel cooling system can dissipate 56kW. The ISS medium temperature loop runs at 17 degree Celsius, with a low temperature loop at just 4 degrees, while Apollo radiators nominally ran at 26. For comparison, SNAP-10A cooling ran at over 530 degrees. I can imagine heavy-duty chemical reactors having a shared loop, or at least radiator tech with the nuclear power system, seeing as hot-running radiators can be *much* smaller, but there\u0027s no way you\u0027re going to use the same radiators to cool a crew compartment.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-05-25T00:53:57Z\u0022 title=\u002205/25/2019 12:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EMay 25, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Guest**"}]}
