All of the probes did lose contact, and any probe using dishes had them fold up (probably applies to extendable antennas too), however, I was able to use short range antennas to re-establish contact with those probes, since everything I launch has them anyway. Now, the one caveat I noticed is that even once you\u0027re in communication range, you still need to manually load/control the probe in order for it to restore its connection and show up in the RemoteTech comsat list. Once you do that, just go back to the tracking station and you should be set.\u003Cp\u003EAgain though.

I had to write a custom drag model for all the pieces flying off the dish due to the krakensbane. But it was worth it in the end. I\u0027ve also made sure to take dish direction into account when calculating airflow. So if your dishes are rotated towards the horizon they might just make it intact, but the moment they turn their broadsides towards the airflow, they\u0027re gone:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/AhPUuGFrA4s?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xZise","CreatedById":59798,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-25T16:08:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022JDP\u0022 data-cite=\u0022JDP\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Elow speed? at kerbin sea level you need to travel at around 210 kmh (or 130 mph) before it breaks off.
