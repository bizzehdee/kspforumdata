After simple editing the original radial mount parachutes CFG file I have come up with a high altitude... (maybe too high of an altitude) parachute capable of bringing down a command pod from 2k m/s down to 100m/s before it reaches Kerbin! Now you may be thinking, \u0022I love the radial mounted parachute that comes with the stock game! I Don\u0027t want to replace it!\u0022 No need to worry we have you covered!
