Whenever I right-click on the TH-NKR module (the main science lab), the game throws a single null reference exception in the log, and then makes me unable to see ANY right-click menus until I close out of the game. My logs are posted in this support thread:\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/109165-Station-Science-TH-NKR-Science-Lab-breaking-rightclick-menus-in-VAB-and-flight\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/109165-Station-Science-TH-NKR-Science-Lab-breaking-rightclick-menus-in-VAB-and-flight\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt looks like StationScience uses the index of the modules to refer to them in the dll, instead of the name.
