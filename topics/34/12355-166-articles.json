And the total delta-v reported is off by a factor of ~two. Computing the delta-v manually, I get somewhere between 2100 (atmo) and 2500 m/s (vacuum). And indeed, when launching that rocket, after I run out of fuel MJ reports a \u0022delta-v expended\u0022 of 2310 m/s.

I built a fresh rocket, and upon ascent guidance launch, it tries to turn one loop before getting back underway correctly. My rocket had enough thrust to get out of it, but still it was a new thing. I tried several things and from what I\u0027ve found, when I launch now, my north (red line on navball) is facing down instead of up. switching various \u0022control from here\u0022 doesn\u0027t work. I have a pod, a probe core, and docking port and switching between them does nothing.
