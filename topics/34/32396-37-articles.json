I made one for every spherical fuel tank and every EPL resource. However I calculated the volume of the tanks by the weight of the fuel (which, iirc, is 5tons/m^3). So the large tank holds 38.4 m^3, so 7680 units at 200 units per m^3 (as per resource density definitions). That works out to a little less than 20 tons rocket parts per large tank, which I can live with. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E If anyone wants my config files I can upload them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fyrem","CreatedById":57131,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-10T02:13:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Enot letting me download.... are you updating it? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedit : nevermind, I finally got it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-10T05:27:55Z\u0022 title=\u002208/10/2013 05:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 10, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Fyrem\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"taniwha","CreatedById":57176,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-10T03:43:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eurablahblah: well, here is a set of configs for the sphereical tanks (all 5 sizes, all 3 resources): \u003Ca href=\u0022http://taniwha.org/~bill/el-sphere.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://taniwha.org/~bill/el-sphere.zip\u003C/a\u003E.

The density of the Jumbo-64 is 0.1t/m\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E (1/5 of rocket parts). Even a mainsail is around 0.35t/m\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E. My 0.5t/m\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E assumes you have to build a mainsail from sub-parts. Really, you shouldn\u0027t be able to store rocket parts in anything smaller than a very large crate, and even then, that will get you a smallish rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, the density changes are a pretty harsh change to what you\u0027re used to, but the previous density was so bogus it wasn\u0027t funny: 200t/m\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E is just not feasable. The densest known substance this side of neutronium (4x10\u003Csup\u003E14\u003C/sup\u003Et/m\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E) is osmium (22.6t/m\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E). If you think KSP is \u0022just a game\u0022, then \u003Cem\u003Eplay\u003C/em\u003E it: meet the challenge, find ways to work around the low density. The old densities were, IMHO, just plain \u003Cem\u003Ebroken\u003C/em\u003E. I had the parts density at 6t/m\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E during my play in 0.20.2, but even that was just too high and too easy. There was no challenge (other than getting 40t of parts into orbit).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis change was about 1) making containers hold a sane mass of ore/metal/parts, 2) bringing logistics into the game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
