(v4.0.3 is for KSP 1.7.3) ...When you do, delete the 4 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E files that show right below the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E .dll  \n\nAlso, next thing, is, what exactly is in the /! inactivemods/ folder?  \n\nI ask, because during KSP loading, ANYTHING and EVERYTHING in /GameData/ will try to be loaded. Its best to move anything you dont want KSP to try to load completely out of your main /\u003Cksp_install\u003E/ folder... ie I would just move that inactive mods completely out of your install... no telling what in there could be currently be giving you problems, or at the least, eating up RAM \u0026 VRAM (textures, especially)....\n\u003C/ksp_install\u003E\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-12-31T21:45:01Z\u0022 title=\u002212/31/2019 09:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 31, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Stone Blue**"},{"CreatedByName":"Beetlecat","CreatedById":92207,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-12-31T21:43:25Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 5 hours ago, jpkerman said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Another approach could be if there was a way to add a money or reputation reward to the empty nodes then the play balance against gaining higher tier tech too quickly and making tech trees more adaptable to individual play styles could be achieved.

Unlocking nodes provides upgrade bonuses that can be used to speed up research (unlocking nodes themselves takes time) as well as the other craft building and facility upgrades time-taking features. You can disable /adjust things that you don\u0027t want to use, but that immediate functionality is certainly there.  \n\nOtherwise, forcing empty nodes to be achieved as a way of making later tech that much more expensive still makes sense.
