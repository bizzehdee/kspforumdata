So some of the KW rockets are good for 0.5m from what I can tell but there isn\u0027t any tanks available for 0.5m rockets. Should I still be using procedural parts or should I be going to the older StretchySRB\u0027s? I liked the stretchy being able to make them very small. Can\u0027t seem to do that with PP.

We can very easily counter overpowered items ourselves: Simply don\u0027t use them. Or, if you want to, edit the relevant cfg files. That\u0027s not really a big issue there. There\u0027s other balance issues, like the size of the Sputnik2 and how Explorer and Vanguard are relatively late in the tree compared to the mentioned Sputnik-2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut ... while we\u0027re at comparably minor issues... did I forget a step or do something wrong? There\u0027s a lot of engines in my collection that not only don\u0027t \u0022fit\u0022 into the tech level (considering their TWR or ISP), but they simply don\u0027t fit AT ALL (being too friggin\u0027 big by any kind of stretch, no pun intended). The LR37 may be TL0, but it is also 2m diameter (at least for me), which makes it pretty much useless for TL0 which consists mostly of teeny little other bits. The D4-2 as well as the N1 are TL1 and 2.5m wide, I don\u0027t even have any fuel tanks that I could stack above (btw, do the stretchable tanks only go to 2m, or is that TL dependent?). And there\u0027s more like that, like the SPS, which would be a great Orbital Engine but it is INSANELY huge with 5m diameter. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf that\u0027s all a balance issue and subject to change, just ignore it. My question would be whether that should NOT be that way and I forgot to install some kind of mod that shrinks those engines to some sensible diameters and allows stretchy tanks to grow beyond 2m.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MedievalNerd","CreatedById":84735,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-06T14:45:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Creature\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Creature\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhile I understand and agree with your basic idea, I think game balance is more important here than simulating exact historical specs. It\u0027s overpowered in every way, also because it weighs essentially nothing. I don\u0027t think anyone is going to watch their probe orbit over and over again so it really only needs to last a few orbits to simulate the original mission. Also to balance the tiny size I\u0027d suggest you give it a power consumption that\u0027s at least 2-3 times bigger than the other probes, then add a big battery to last maybe 12 hours (that\u0027s 6 orbits on it\u0027s actual orbital period) to counter the fact that it\u0027s so small that there\u0027s no point in using other cores as command units in case you\u0027re building a non-replica flight, such as a comms relay.
