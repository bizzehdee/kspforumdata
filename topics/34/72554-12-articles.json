With only Engineer, MFT 5.0.1 and TweakScale 1.19 installed, tanks do not scale in mass correctly when you attempt to change any MFT values. I tried fiddling with scale exponents, but could not figure out how to get it to scale correctly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample: A Rockomax X200 scaled to 5m should have exactly 4x the fuel (and overall 4x the mass) of a Rockomax Jumbo-64.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you (only) put the part in the VAB and TweakScale it, size, mass, resources all scale correctly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs soon as you use the MFT interface to remove tanks/add tanks/whatever, which is necessary in order to get the values displayed by MFT to read out correctly, weird things happen. In this scenario, tanks do not maintain the same wet/dry mass ratio (becomes something like 3:1 when scaled to 3.75m, and 2:1 when 5m). Final mass becomes 128 tons dry/256 tons wet at 5m, instead of 16 tons dry/144 tons wet, which is what happens if you ONLY TweakScale the part. Engineer tells me this is indeed the mass of the tank, so not just a weird readout problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t actually know what\u0027s going on, of course, but It *seems* that only the mass of the fuel (but exactly twice as much as it ought to weigh) is taken into account in the new mass of the tank. The dry mass is what the fuel ought to weigh, and the wet mass then somehow becomes the dry mass \u002B the actual fuel in the tank, so 2x what just the fuel ought to weigh... The value of the original dry mass of the tank doesn\u0027t seem to enter into the equation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn all cases, actual fuel volume of the tank (amount of LFO you can put in it) does scale correctly, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you scale it back to original size, it regains appropriate masses and ratios of masses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince I don\u0027t know how most of this stuff actually works: is this a TweakScale issue? Is this some problem with MFT that it just can\u0027t handle rescaled stuff?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMillionth edit: Also discovered that if you use MFT to edit the tank while it is normal sized (not TweakScaled yet) and then use TweakScale to increase the tank\u0027s size, all the values scale accordingly.
