I was using far flight assistance each time, and launched maybe 10 different kinds and didnt notice the problem until I tried using the \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esame simple rocket with 3 normal canards, not placed with the tri-symmetry setting, but two on the side mirrored and one on the back (dorsal?) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eside as a vertical stabilizer.

A while ago in a ferram thread, somebody mentioned to keep the center of lift behind the center of mass (going away from the command pod). For me this works nearly every time in keeping this from happening to me. But if you put the center of lift too far behind the center of mass, the plane will be difficult to pitch up (pull up) at all. Planes that have the center of lift nearly on the center of mass , just a barely visible bit behind it are very easy to pitch. Keeping in mind that the center of mass can move in flight as you burn up fuel, and that could cause instability later while you\u0027re going kerbal at mach 7. The total mass changes this too and also the shape of the plane and thrust to weight ratio, which you can get by using Flight Engineer or Mechjeb\u0027s in-editor window. If there is a way to fly a plane with the center of lift in front of the center of mass in FAR, I haven\u0027t really tried with that, planes tend to go crazy on takeoff in that case.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat would be really useful is a display in editor to see where the center of mass moves to at all points between full and empty of any tanks you\u0027d choose.
