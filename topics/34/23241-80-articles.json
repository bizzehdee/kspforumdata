Also i always have quite a lot of jet fuel to spare. I really need some help and advice about proportions of rocket/jet fuel per sabre, or any other advices. Maybe for such a rookies as me would be more effective using 2 engine types? Also, a little note: designing a cargo plane, the size is quite good. About as half as Strugatsky, maybe wings a bit shorter, and all in all a bit shorter. The goal is carry at least 1 jumbo tank into orbit. Quite successfully climbs throughout the atmosphere with a jumbo(36 tons) in it\u0027s belly untill 25-26 km, but getting into the orbit is the problem... It is armed with 4 Sabre-M\u0027s, and 2 additional jet engines which i added in my desperate quest for TEH SPESS. Also, it can\u0027t lift off earlier than the runway\u0027s end.
