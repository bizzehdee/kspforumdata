AdmiralTigerclaw is listing values in kPa, but is missing the prefix for his units. And you\u0027d be surprised how little dynamic pressure it takes to tear something apart; you need to remember that static pressure is quite often felt on both the inside and outside of the vehicle, resulting in a net force on the structure of 0, but dynamic pressure results in different forces across the vehicle (measured using lift and drag coefficients), resulting in bad times. And 20 kPa with a rocket sideways at supersonic velocities are more than enough to cause it to break up.
