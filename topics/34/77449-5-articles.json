Right click, \u0022Get Ship Status\u0022, which will open a small dialog which allows you to view the state of every part affected by my mod. As for decouplers, yes you can fix them, but you must use an Engineer or be in Sandbox or Science Mode to use the proper fix option. I think I want to redesign how and when decouples fail anyway.

One was an altimeter failure on a muli-pod jet, so no real harm. Another was a glitched engine failure, and the third was a tank failure on my SCANsat probe, which I thus was forced to leave in orbit for future return. This is at around a total of over 50 flights.

The other half of the decoupler failures I right clicked on the part during flight and spammed decouple until it exploded. I\u0027d say those failures increased the actual flight failure rate to about 10%-12% in total. By my books, even with their high rate of failure, decouplers so far have been a very minor setback, usually only causing a small loss in efficiency due to carrying around dead weight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and Phenakist, failures currently cannot happen if the vessel is unloaded.

This was confirmed by a user that isolated the issue to your mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpecifically, in your Update method, you test for \u0022highlightcolor != kerbalgreen\u0022 to see if you need to turn off highlighting. During my update of Ship Manifest\u0027s highlighting in the last version, I attempted to do exactly the same thing. What I found is that you cannot match the color specified. So, your logic as written will always return true and you are actively turning off highlighting every frame. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had to use a different method. I tested for the presence of the colors I use for highlighting and then turned it off if they were present.
