Your dreams can come true with the **CommNet Relays** contract pack!\n\n![CommNetRelaysLogo.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kerbas-ad-astra/CommNet-Relays/master/CommNetRelaysLogo.png)\n\n## \nFeatures\n\n**CommNet Relays** is a contract pack for Contract Configurator which gives you contracts for each body in the solar system (besides the homeworld, of course). The contract is to send a satellite with an appropriate dish or combination of dishes into an orbit low enough that surface missions can use the whip antenna instead of having to pack a big dish (so long as a relay is overhead, of course). Missions to your homeworld\u0027s moons are required to use an HG-5 or equivalent, missions to the inner planets (Duna/Mars and inward) are required to use an RA-15 or equivalent, while missions to outer planets or moons will need an RA-100 or equivalent. You also have to have your tracking station upgraded to the appropriate level.\n\nThe contracts are generated based on the lists of planets and moons in your solar system, so you can install Outer Planets or Real Solar System or whatever you want, and the contracts will automatically adjust themselves accordingly. Additionally, the antenna requirement does not depend on specific parts, but on the combined antenna power of the relay, so it\u0027s compatible with all modded antennas automatically. If you really wanted to (and had a computer that could handle it), you could build a relay with 20,000 HG-5 antennas for Jool missions.\n\n(That said, be aware that the contract range requirements are based on stock CommNet ranges, which are in turn based on the stock solar system. I\u0027ve got some patches that will modify ranges to adapt to Outer Planets and Real Solar System, but those patches assume particular balance choices for antennas and the solar system. At the end of the day, the contract requirement is just a lower bound -- check your link budgets before launch.)\n\nIn addition to the basic \u0022relay around body X\u0022 contracts, there are a few extra contracts to help improve uptime around the network. You may receive contracts to place relays in highly-inclined, highly-elliptical orbits around the gas giants, so that missions to their moons or in low orbits can stay in contact around them, as well as contracts to place relays in solar orbits to keep contact with probes going behind the Sun (and also the homeworld\u0027s parent body, if you\u0027re using an alternate solar system in which the homeworld is a moon).\n\n## \nDependencies\n\n- CommNet Relays depends on [**Contract Configurator**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/101604-1-0-2-Contract-Configurator-v1-0-4-2015-05-08), version **1.22.0** or later.\n- You will need [**Module Manager**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/50533-105-module-manager-2613-november-9th/) to patch the contracts for compatibility with other addons.\n\n## \nDownload and install\n\n- [**GitHub**](https://github.com/Kerbas-ad-astra/CommNet-Relays/releases)\n- CurseForge\n\nFrom there, just unzip the \u0022ContractPacks/CommNetRelays\u0022 folder into your GameData directory.\n\n## \nKnown issues and limitations\n\nIt might be cool if nightingale implemented a coverage-checking feature like there is for RemoteTech, but as things are, I use the number of relays or relay-like vessels in orbit as a proxy -- four is the minimum to get full coverage (though that could be as low as two depending on how forgiving you\u0027ve set the line-of-sight \u0022fudge factor\u0022 to be), so if you\u0027ve got five ships with enough relay antennas in low-enough orbit around a body, I figure you have coverage that\u0027s good enough and the config won\u0027t generate contracts for that body. In general, I\u0027ve left most of the details of your network unconstrained -- the minimum and/or maximum values in the requirements will keep your satellites within range of the ground, but it\u0027s up to you to put your satellites in orbits that are useful for your particular situation.\n\nIf you find any other issues, please let me know in the [**KSP forum thread**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/129704-1-0-2-4-Contract-Pack-CommNet-Relays-1-0-0-%282015-Jul-24%29) or on the GitHub repo\u0027s [**issue tracker**](https://github.com/Kerbas-ad-astra/CommNet-Relays/issues)!\n\n## \nVersion history and changelog\n\n- 2015 07 24: Initial release.\n- 2015 07 25 (1.0.1): Added NewVessel parameter to missions, so each relay will have to be a newly-launched satellite. Bumped up the maximum number of satellites from four to five (to give some redundancy).\n- 2015 08 08 (1.1): \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003Eand New Horizons compatibility.\n    - Moved altitude constraints into DATA nodes so that Module Manager can affect them more easily (as opposed to having magic numbers in both the orbit parameter and the target planet selection logic).\n    - Fixed some initial \u0022Escape\u0022/\u0022Orbit\u0022 requirements -- they were referring to \u0022Kerbin\u0022 specifically, now referring to whatever the homeworld is.\n    - Also updated comments on target planet selection logic to match the actual logic used.\n    - Added a new \u0022CoMoon\u0022 contract to be used when the homeworld is a moon.\n- 2015 12 14 (1.2): Antenna pack compatibility\n    - New patches that allow antennas from some addons (Asteroid Day, Hangar, SSR Microsat, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E Kolonization Systems) to qualify for the contracts.\n    - Clarified contract wording.\n    - Added a dedicated agency to give the contracts.\n- 2016 05 03 (1.3): Antenna rearrangement\n    - Moved High Gain Antenna from its own patch, now that the Asteroid Day probe parts are folded into stock.\n        - Because this will cause errors on pre-1.1 installs without Asteroid Day, **this and later versions are no longer compatible with KSP 1.0.x.**\n    - Removed the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E patch, since it was causing exceptions for MKS Lite users.\n    - Compatible through KSP 1.1.2.\n- 2016 06 26 (1.3.1): Expression expansion\n    - Refactored targetbody expressions to reduce calculations-per-frame when contracts are generated.\n    - Compatible through KSP 1.1.3.\n- 2016 07 23 (1.4): Mission Control\n    - Changes to support Contract Configurator\u0027s 1.15.3 update.\n        - Because this depends on variables introduced in CC 1.15.3, **this and later versions are no longer compatible with KSP 1.1.0-2.**\n    - Contracts are broken out into individual cfg files (I got tired of scrolling all over the place when editing...)\n    - The license is changed to the GPL v3 (or later).\n- 02017 02 25 (2.0.0): Constructing New Relays\n    - Renamed to \u0022CommNet Relays\u0022. Because it uses the new CommNet system, it is not backwards-compatible with pre-1.2 versions of KSP or 1.x versions of AntennaRange Relays.\n    - Backend logic overhauled to use new CC antenna parameter. Specific parts are no longer required to complete contracts.\n    - Adjusted some of the contract parameters to reduce duplication and increase available choices.\n    - Max/min apoapses adjusted to CommNet balance.\n        - Adjusted \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E patch.\n        - Added OPM patch.\n    - Added new \u0022Super DSN\u0022 contract to build enormous DSN relays. Why? Because we can!\n- 02017 07 04 (2.0.1): Hiccup Suppression\n    - Adjusted facility requirements to suppress random failures when entering the Tracking Station.\n- 02017 09 04 (2.0.2): De-Proliferation\n    - Added \u0027maxSimultaneous\u0027 values for all contracts.\n\n- 02019 01 13 (2.1.0): Global Coverage\n    - Added support for localization (so the minimum KSP version supported is now 1.3.0). Added \u0027title\u0027 field to agent to reduce log spam.\n\n## \nRoadmap\n\nAs my schedule permits, I\u0027ll get this mod released on CurseForge and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\nIf you have other suggestions, please bring them up in the [**KSP forum thread**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/129704-1-0-2-4-Contract-Pack-CommNet-Relays-1-0-0-%282015-Jul-24%29) or raise an [**issue**](https://github.com/Kerbas-ad-astra/CommNet-Relays/issues) on the GitHub repo!\n\n## \nCredits\n\nMany thanks to nightingale for Contract Configurator (and for implementing the SemiMajorAxis() method at my request, and accepting my HasAntenna parameter), toadicus for AntennaRange (which inspired the initial revision of this contract pack), and Squad for implementing CommNet!\n\n## \nLicense\n\nCommNet Relays is copyright 2015-2017 Kerbas\\_ad\\_astra.

[@nightingale](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/119307-nightingale/), if there\u0027s some nuance to PartValidation that I\u0027m missing that will let me check a part parameter against a bound, please let me know!  (This would also be a nice feature to have if it doesn\u0027t exist yet...similar to the current MODULE-within-PartValidation feature, just with the capability to have \u0022range \u003E= 1000000000\u0022 or the like.)\n\nTo get that kind of functionality right now, I think I would have to write a DLL with \u0022ModuleLunarRangeAntenna\u0022 and the like (they wouldn\u0027t have to do much, just indicate in the VAB that \u0022this antenna has the range to connect a planet with its moons\u0022 and so on -- but it would need to be a DLL so that the PartLoader doesn\u0027t eat the modules during loading), use MM (which I know can filter by comparing variables in greater-than/less-than boundaries) to apply those modules to appropriate antennas, and then set up the contracts to look for those modules.  At this time, I don\u0027t feel that it\u0027s worth the trouble to go this route, since there actually aren\u0027t that many antennas which (a) ship natively with AntennaRange patches (there are lots of third-party patches flying around, but I don\u0027t want to request an antenna unless I *know* it will do the job) and (b) have a long enough range to be useful as relays."},{"CreatedByName":"nightingale","CreatedById":119307,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-17T20:28:08Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 3 hours ago, Kerbas\\_ad\\_astra said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E To your actual question -- reading the Contract Configurator documentation, I can query if a part has the ModuleLimitedDataTransmitter, and look for a specific range (e.g. must have an antenna with range X), but it doesn\u0027t look like I can specify a minimum bound (e.g. must have an antenna with range at least X).
