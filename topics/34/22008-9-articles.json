Let the aero braking kill off speed, inflate balloon to about 1% when your speed gets low enough, then just increase it slightly as you get lower to the ground.

Once there, punch buoyancy to max and let the inertia carry you to over 30 km up. Then, start your engines and wait until your over 42 km up, then set buoyancy to 0.
