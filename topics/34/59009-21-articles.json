Now when you try to load a contract type that doesn\u0027t exist it simply fails and moves on to the next rather than blowing up the whole system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo you should be able to leave any DMagic contracts in your offered, active, or completed contracts list without problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey didn\u0027t, however, improve error checking for \u003Cem\u003Eagencies\u003C/em\u003E. So if any contract (stock or mod) uses an agent that no longer exists it will totally break the save file. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are two ways to fix this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. \u003Cstrong\u003EBefore \u003C/strong\u003Edeleting the addon go through your contract list; check all three types in the mission control center. Anything that has the DMagic agent, signified by the red DMagic flag and a note about the agency in the contract list, \u003Cstrong\u003Emust\u003C/strong\u003E be deleted. For offered contracts you can decline these (and make sure that no new contracts are generated), for active contracts you will have to cancel them (and suffer the cancellation penalties) or finish them, for completed contracts you must remove them through the Alt\u002BF12 debug menu. Go to the contracts tab, select completed, and select the \u0022Rem\u0022 button next to any contract with the DMagic agent (all contracts can be removed this way).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. \u003Cstrong\u003EAfter \u003C/strong\u003Edeleting the addon you will have to check the mission control center for any contracts with a blank agent flag, these contracts will also fail to give any type of description when you click on them. You will have to remove all of these contracts through the mission control center or through the Alt\u002BF12 debug menu*.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESend any complaints about this onerous method to Squad, as there is nothing I can do about error checking for non-existent agencies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* See the picture below for a demonstration of what a broken contract looks like and how to remove it (the orange text in the debug log is triggered by trying to load non-existent contracts and should be harmless).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WG2cVRI.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022WG2cVRI.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nanowinner","CreatedById":100275,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-19T18:49:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is all well and good but I\u0027m only removing this because I can\u0027t properly use it.

The most well-known example of this type of instrument is Curiosity\u0027s ChemCam module, a laser ablation and remote imaging spectrometer mounted at the top of its upper mast.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022518px-PIA16149_MSL_Curiosity_Rover_Self_Portrait_colour_correction.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/PIA16149_MSL_Curiosity_Rover_Self_Portrait_colour_correction.jpg/518px-PIA16149_MSL_Curiosity_Rover_Self_Portrait_colour_correction.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe principal component here is a high power, low duration laser that can be fired rapidly and repeatedly at a given target. The laser light strikes the surface of the target, vaporizing a small amount of it. This now-vaporized material is excited by the laser, and when it returns to its ground state it emits photons at frequencies characteristic of its chemical makeup. By matching the resulting signals to that of known samples the chemical composition of the target can be determined.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Laser\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo be effective a very high power laser is needed. Curiosity\u0027s has an output of over 10MW/mm\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E, which is incredibly high, but it only fires pulses of around 5 nanoseconds (five billionths of a second) to a target less than 1mm around, so the total energy delivered is more like 30mJ per pulse. This very focused approach means that anything outside of the target area will remain unaffected.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe laser itself (a diode-pumped, rubidium titanium phosphate Pockels cell Q-switched, neodymium-doped potassium-gadolinium tungstate (Nd:KGW) linear oscillator, if you must know) is a solid state design, able to operate under a wide range of temperatures, withstand the trip to, and the hostile environment of, Mars, and to be very lightweight, about 500g. Because this instrument can be used repeatedly, and at relatively long ranges, many more samples can be analyzed than could be using the older techniques of other Mars rovers. These used physical drills to study samples, requiring close contact and sometimes multiple days to analyze one sample. The laser is also not susceptible to the same type of physical wear-and-tear of those instruments.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EElectron Excitation\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen the laser strikes the target a small amount of it is atomized in the process known as laser ablation. The initial portion of the blast is sufficient to ablate a small amount of the surface, usually only a few nanograms, or even picograms, making this essentially a non-destructive analytical technique (repeated blasts can cause more damage though). After a few nanoseconds the trailing end of the laser blast excites the resulting plasma, creating a kind of self-propagating reaction where electrons are stripped off of their atoms and react with other atoms, causing further electron excitation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is a thermal image of the expanding plasma plume shortly after the laser blast.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022LIBS-Step-2-Image-large.png\u0022 src=\u0022http://appliedspectra.com/images/technology-imgs/LIBS-Step-2-Image-large.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor a short period while the plasma plume cools a soup of photons are released as the electrons fall back to less energetic states, little useable signal can be collected during this period. After about 1 microsecond the electrons begin to fall back to their ground states, emitting discrete bands of photons. The frequency of these photons can be correlated with the composition of the atoms in the plasma. By matching up the emission lines produced by known samples the composition of the experimental sample can be determined.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy recording these emissions with a spectrometer (see chapter 3), which is built into Curiosity\u0027s ChemCam module, a nearly complete analysis of the composition of any sample can be made.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is the spectrograph of Curiosity\u0027s first target. The photon counts are arranged by wavelength and labelled according to their corresponding source element.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Melikechi-fig3.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://www.osa-opn.org/opn/media/Images/Articles/1301/Features/Melikechi-fig3.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ability to rapidly fire the laser allows for multiple samples to be recorded in a very short time. It also allows for interior samples to be collected by drilling down through the outer few mm of the surface (or more if it is merely loose dust covering the surface).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ELIBS Science\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ability to quickly analyze the composition of most any sample (it can be used for liquids too) obviously makes for a very powerful tool.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRocks can be studied to determine their origin.

Their composition could tell us about the source of the meteor, or whether it differs in some way from meteorites found on Earth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA LIBS instrument can also serve as a useful way to select interesting targets for further analysis. Curiosity\u0027s Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) instrument (Curiosity\u0027s largest) can be used for a more accurate chemical analysis as well as for determining isotopic abundance. This can give clues about the age and possibly origin of a rock or meteorite. Or the exact mineral composition (rather than a list of chemical elements and their abundance provided by LIBS) of a sample can be determined through X-ray diffraction using Curiosity\u0027s CheMin instrument.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the next segment we\u0027ll look more closely at the biodrill and its inspirations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-03T19:26:14Z\u0022 title=\u002203/03/2016 07:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 3, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by DMagic\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Elinks\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Exitalterego","CreatedById":4564,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-01T13:51:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022falcon2000\u0022 data-cite=\u0022falcon2000\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMake sure when you extracted the zip files for the US files into your gamedata, that you followed the included installation instructions - which is to copy out the Universal Storage folder into the main gamedata folder instead of leaving it nested in the \u0022US_Core...\u0022 folder.
