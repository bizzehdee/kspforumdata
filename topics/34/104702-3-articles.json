It seems as though destroying the top part of it will register the target as being taken out. Destroying the bottom part of it will then /cancel/ that, so it\u0027ll register as the target still being alive. Or at least, \u0027not dead\u0027.\n\nOn top of that, after killing one and having it register... If you take out another one or two, the first target will change from being destroyed to registering as still alive (the objective becomes \u0027not fulfilled\u0027). Sometimes killing the /next/ target after that will cause each target to register as being destroyed (objective is completed, again).
