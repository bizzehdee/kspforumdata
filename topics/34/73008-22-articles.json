Recently I was able to get a long and stable game going with only a few crashes when switching from space view back to space center or exiting the VAB. I use this mod for some detailed ships, one is on the way to Jool in my most recent game. Few days ago I had just completed a Munar shipyard using Extraplanetary Shipyard mod when my computer locked up. It was KSP, but that scary \u0022huuurrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr\u0022 noise that Windows makes when everything goes to and you have to do a hard reboot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did that, and restarted KSP. KSP crashes during load. What does this have to do with Space Planes? It locks up when it reads GameData\\SpaceplanePlus\\Parts\\mk2Cockpit_StandardCockpit_Lum.. It stays locked up for a minute or more then CTD. I\u0027ve replaced the entire mod with a fresh DL, no luck. I\u0027ve erased the file, then it does the same with the dockingportMk2 file, then CTD. I\u0027ve rechecked the local files with STEAM constantly and no difference in outcome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt gets very frustrating. I\u0027ve played KPS for 1500\u002B hours with little to show for it because of the constant CTD.

Recently I was able to get a long and stable game going with only a few crashes when switching from space view back to space center or exiting the VAB. I use this mod for some detailed ships, one is on the way to Jool in my most recent game. Few days ago I had just completed a Munar shipyard using Extraplanetary Shipyard mod when my computer locked up. It was KSP, but that scary \u0022huuurrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr\u0022 noise that Windows makes when everything goes to and you have to do a hard reboot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did that, and restarted KSP. KSP crashes during load. What does this have to do with Space Planes? It locks up when it reads GameData\\SpaceplanePlus\\Parts\\mk2Cockpit_StandardCockpit_Lum.. It stays locked up for a minute or more then CTD. I\u0027ve replaced the entire mod with a fresh DL, no luck. I\u0027ve erased the file, then it does the same with the dockingportMk2 file, then CTD. I\u0027ve rechecked the local files with STEAM constantly and no difference in outcome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt gets very frustrating. I\u0027ve played KPS for 1500\u002B hours with little to show for it because of the constant CTD. Why does it work one moment, then fails the next when I\u0027ve changed none of the files?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis really sounds like you have more basic computer problems than just KSP crashing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst off you need to either look at your KSP output_log.txt or post it so others can look at it. Here\u0027s were output_log.txt is. \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003ESteam users should right click KSP in Steam, click on Properties, then in the Properties box, click Local Files, then Browse Local Files.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, please do some diagnostics on your computer, specifically RAM tests and Hard Drive tests. I don\u0027t believe KSP (or rather the 32bit Windows Unity Player) can Hard Lock a modern OS without something else being wrong.

KSP is a 32 bit program, and it can therefore only use ~3.5 GB of RAM, no matter how much is available. You can try fixing this by installing Active Texture Management (reduces RAM load), Alternative Texture Loading (might not be available for download currently, has a few incompatibilities, but is much faster than ATM) or Loading Textures Only as Required (works with ATM, but not on all platforms).
