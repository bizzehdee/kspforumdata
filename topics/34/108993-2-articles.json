Thanks!\n\nSome problems with the new update:\n\n- With the new Corvus heat shield, craft want to turn upside down during reentry. Adding the following (taken from the stock heat shield .cfgs) seems to fix it:\n\nCoPOffset = 0.0, 1.0, 0.0\n\nCoLOffset = 0.0, -0.15, 0.0\n\n- The Corvus no longer flies straight! It always turns towards the horizon at liftoff. The nosecone seems to be the culprit.\n\n- I feel like the ship should be leaning the opposite direction when the parachute is deployed. i.e. the parachute string should not be clipping through the nosecone:\n\n![H7Q8slG.png](http://i.imgur.com/H7Q8slG.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"CosmoBro","CreatedById":142301,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T16:20:55Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E With the new Corvus heat shield, craft want to turn upside down during reentry.\n\nI was just about to say that.
