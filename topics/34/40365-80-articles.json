I\u0027m with Chase on the subject of the grindyness, i posted my observations a few pages ago but was ignored...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth science systems both of .22 and of KSP interstellar have good and bad sides.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E.22 really ties effort to results. So if you put in effort you get results where KSP interstellar ties timewarp to results. Basically your willingness to timewarp determines your results. That\u0027s not a challenge and it isn\u0027t fun either. If you put one science lab on the launchpad and let it research and timewarp a few years hey presto you have science. So .22 is superior in that account.. Timewarping for success is lame.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E.22 doesn\u0027t motivate you to build outposts. An outpost doesn\u0027t give additional science benefits where ksp interstellar becomes pretty much pointless without semi permanent outposts. So KSP Interstellar is superior on that count!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E.22 doesn\u0027t motivate you to re-use craft. In fact it motivates you to ditch and recover crafts (and the science bonus). Where in KSP interstellar it\u0027s a waste to ditch a craft once it\u0027s upgraded. And I really enjoy the idea of re-using my spacecraft. Only using cheap ditch crafts for kerbal ascent and landing and keeping most of my fleet in orbit and in constant use. KSP interstellar is superior there. The idea that you can incrementally improve performance of your vessels is simply awesome and the primary reason to use this mod as far as I am concerned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo KSP Interstellar adds improvements to the original game as any mod worth it\u0027s salt should. But there are valid alternatives to using the timewarp button as an \u0022I win\u0022 button. I already proposed a solution that makes science labs shutdown after a certain amount of science is researched forcing the player to keep sending out new science labs. In return the speed of research could be improved so it stops being such a grind, it\u0027s quite allright to need a science lab to be in orbit for a few days to weeks.

That\u0027s not a challenge and it isn\u0027t fun either. If you put one science lab on the launchpad and let it research and timewarp a few years hey presto you have science.

If it were, that wouldn\u0027t have been suggested, because it doesn\u0027t accomplish the goal at all. There are two \u0022easy\u0022 fixes to change the nature of science gathering in the mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst...take it out of the time-warp effect. It gains science at the same rate, or not at all, during time-warp. But retain the unfocused gains so that one doesn\u0027t have to babysit every lab individually just to get them to work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond...adjust the upgrade costs accordingly so that it takes roughly the same amount of overall play-time, including time spent sped up for travel purposes. No more supposed \u0022I win\u0022 time-warp button. Everyone gets what they want that way...supposedly. We get to keep our complex resource infrastructure management, and others get to have the goodies without as much apparent repetition or \u0022time-warp, I win\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow we come to \u0022grindyness\u0022. It does exist...it really does. Online gaming is utterly saturated with it. But here\u0027s what a grind really is...it\u0027s actively repeating the same task in an attempt to make progress. It\u0027s Sisyphus rolling his boulder up the hill. If people could time-warp through the half a million \u0022Kill 10 rats\u0022 quests they have to do just to gain a level, that would kill the grind instantly, but it would also make the game pointless. A grind is not what happens when one simply has to take some extra time to get a wide variety of things done. Grind is not specifically time-sensitive, grind is about repetition.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe key here isn\u0027t to bypass the time it takes, it\u0027s to diversify the activities enough that it feels like actual progress, and not repetitive tedium. It should take years to cap one\u0027s level in an online game. But every single level of the journey should feel as exciting and unique as the endgame content. That\u0027s the problem. That\u0027s the grind. Obviously, different types of games express the grind in different ways.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP\u0027s sandbox didn\u0027t really have a grind because it wasn\u0027t really a game, it was a toy. Now with the first chunk of its career mode, it\u0027s become something of a game, and it still doesn\u0027t grind because there are different things to do. But, it\u0027s cutting it close. Unfortunately, the trade-off of this has been that most players have already reacquired all of the tech in that mode, and so it\u0027s just a sandbox again. And the update has only been out for less than a day. That\u0027s...pathetic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo want the progress of a game to take less time, rather than more, is just childish \u0022gimmie-gimmie\u0022 thinking. It\u0027s a sense of entitlement to instant gratification that borders on the obscene.

And that\u0027s how the grind is born. People want the gigantic gains, but since the industry MUST make money off of it, they have to get people to keep playing. So they spread out the chunks. Spread it too far, and people complain about grind because there\u0027s not enough to fill the space between.

I think what we need is to give time a value so that people don\u0027t waste decades just timewarping, this could be done by giving the kerbals salaries, or something similar. That way people would be encouraged to actually play the game (to pay for the kerbals or w/e) during the in-game time they would normally spend timewarping.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"forsaken1111","CreatedById":2703,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-17T15:11:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI also have to point out that if you\u0027re just timewarping with a lab sitting on kerbin, you\u0027re doing something really really silly.

The system in Interstellar was specifically made to work even while you are not focused on a vessel so that you can continue playing the game while things happen in the background. Go to duna, drive around, fly home. Maybe launch some other crafts. Check back on your lab and you have accumulated some science. Yay\n"}]}
