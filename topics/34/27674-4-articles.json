The place where they are radially mounted seems to twist sideways, leading to the entire craft walking around on the ground. This is especially visible when landing on any type of slope. I used Module Manager to add SQUID to them to see if that would help, but they still end up sliding around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really love the leggings because they provide a lot of ground clearance (something sorely missing in landing legs), but is there any way to get them to be a bit more stable?

That said, I will look at the stats and the colliders of the legs. Currently the legs do not allow surface attachment; you can change it in the cfg file. I will probably have to adjust the actual collider at the attachment point of the legs though. In the meantime you can try editing the breakingforce and crashtolerance to insane levels and see if that helps land heavy stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nazari1382","CreatedById":62013,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-03T04:11:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFalcon IVA is in the works.
