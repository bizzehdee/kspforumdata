I made a great map from a 427 km Orbit (at 10x timewarp) and recorded some 700 MB of CSV data in the process. This took just one night. I think in the old version, the map would have been still quite patchy at this altitude, and certainly not usable for the higher default resolution in the new version. This was with a scan resolution of 250. Also, the 500 km limit apparently doesn\u0027t exist anymore, so you can try even higher orbits. I was actually thinking I should complain that the new scanning technology made it to easy to scan a planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit, to clarify: With the new version, scanning the whole planet took about 15 hours mission time, while you\u0027d need plan with about 39 hours and an ~82 km orbit in the old version to fill a 2048 x 1024 map.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-06T17:14:35Z\u0022 title=\u002206/06/2013 05:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 6, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Lexif\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Ecorrected orbit altitude\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Weatherman159","CreatedById":48008,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-06T17:47:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m waiting to see a comment from the dev about this.
