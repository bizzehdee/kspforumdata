Currently I\u0027m only generating a single test cloud, but it looks promising. I want to expose all the shader parameters to the config and a \u0022dev\u0022 gui, so I\u0027ll probably add a button there to generate those test clouds in the next release along with all these changes.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was wondering about the volumetric clouds: are the, what I assume are, sprites making up the clouds going to be definable through files in the mod or are the cloud textures from the base game? I was going to play around with the clouds when they came out in whichever release it was, but want to know if I should make a series of sprites in preparation like the following two I quickly whipped up while toying with ideas for making cloud cover textures not derived from the same satellite images of earth that everyone is using:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xhp2JKM.png\u0022 alt=\u0022xhp2JKM.png\u0022\u003E 2. \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XUWUSLn.png\u0022 alt=\u0022XUWUSLn.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-12T19:27:32Z\u0022 title=\u002211/12/2013 07:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 12, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Stiggles\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EImage hosting issues\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rbray89","CreatedById":48847,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-12T20:08:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Stiggles\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Stiggles\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI was wondering about the volumetric clouds: are the, what I assume are, sprites making up the clouds going to be definable through files in the mod or are the cloud textures from the base game?
