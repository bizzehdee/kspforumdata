Note that that means, in either case, that I\u0027m assuming that 80% of the \u0022tank\u0022 volume is used for actual fuel tanks, which comports pretty well with Greys\u0027s calculation of actual usage for normal-shaped tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe save breaking issue is twofold. First, MFS and Stretchie now care about loading order; the StretchyTanks module must appear after the MFT module in the .craft file (and in your SFS files). Second, RealFuels volumes changed but volume per tank (also basemass, also everything else) is persistent so if you want your old save and/or craft to work you will need to (1) multiply volume by 5, (2) multiply all resource amounts and tank amounts by 5, (3) fix basemass and each mass = line in every MFT module to be correct according to the new basemass and tank mass configuration in RealTankTypes. Note basemassPV is what appears at the top of the tank defintion (basemass = x * volume; x is basemassPV).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHoneyFox: LqdMethane is where it\u0027s at.
