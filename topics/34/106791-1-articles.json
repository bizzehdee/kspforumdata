Useful to burn extra oxidizer left over in a spaceplane, or to build a simple ISRU hopper.\n\n![1430544294ksp_quadcopter.jpg](http://f3.to/quickgal/1430544294ksp_quadcopter.jpg)\n\nJust your average quadcopter fan. Contains both an throttleable motor and a RCS, to allow for somewhat realistic steering. Needs atmosphere to work, but not oxygen, so good to get that Eve glider back in the air if it has enough solar panels.\n\n![1430544302ksp_solsail.jpg](http://f3.to/quickgal/1430544302ksp_solsail.jpg)\n\nA solar sail - this will work according to what angle it is to the Sun (if at all), so you\u0027ll actually have to tack by pivoting your space probe! Like the ion engine, the thrust is exaggerated. To turn off, fold it.\n\nThere\u0027s a few other things but they\u0027re not very interesting to look at.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-02T05:37:28Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2015 05:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by spiritplumber**\n  \nAdded pictures"},{"CreatedByName":"gmpd2000","CreatedById":37101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T04:55:09Z","Content":"Hmmmm.\n\nThere are no pictures and the download link gives me a virus warning.\n\nCan you clarify what\u0027s going on?"},{"CreatedByName":"spiritplumber","CreatedById":84232,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T04:57:16Z","Content":"I think it\u0027s tripping on the two small executables that do the FTP stuff.
