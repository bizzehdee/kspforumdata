On the philosophical side, that means that \u0022free will\u0022 is only a concept afforded to us by the fact that we can\u0027t know everything at once, but on the practical side it means that your thing keeps getting reverted because something that\u0027s supposed to be happening isn\u0027t happening.\n\nWhatever it ends up being, I\u0027m using CryoEngines 2.0.3 with a bunch of other mods (including most if not all of your mods) and I don\u0027t really have any issues that I\u0027ve noticed (granted I don\u0027t really use the hydrolox engines much, I use Methalox 1st stages and nuclear 2nd stages from Kerbal Atomics), so I\u0027m sticking with what I have until this all blows over and I see a clear benefit to upgrading.

With all restock, lauch vehicles, H2 engines, etc. there are simply too many engines to keep them all usable as the tech level progresses.\n\nIn my opinion, it simply does not have the power for a 3.75m upper stage. In the Editor, with a payload of 15 T (an Elara Command module plus a Hostel Habitation) and enough fuel for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E=2500 -which barely gets anywhere higher than the Mun (depending on the lower stage size)-  it shows a puny thrust to weight ratio of 1.07.\n\nCompare the Tharsis with the other 3.75m upper stages: the 6.5 T, 1000 KN Vulture (methane), the 9 T, 2000 KN Rhino (Stock) or the 5.25 T, 750 KN Corgi (Restock\u002B).\n\nKeeping the same T/W ratio as the Ulysses it should have 520 KN.
