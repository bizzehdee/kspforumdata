I have noticed that this game remembers files really really bad lol if you copy a mod folder to your desktop(so you have a back up), at least for me, that folder can not be deleted while the game is running because it thinks its open in the game but I have seen my memory usage increase over time too ( like the two people were talking about) Reinstalling usually fixes it but I havn\u0027t been able to find what is causing it yet. All I know is somthing is making the game unstable over time and reverting exacerbates the problem big time. Reinstalling fixes it for me until the first time the game crashes, after that, its just a matter of time b4 the game won\u0027t run anymore.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedited: but I don\u0027t think its TR, I was thinking it was unity but now im thinking it might be DX... in fact im thinking the KSPx64issues in window is not unity at all... or not as much as everyone says. Im thinking its DX. More specificly DX11 because, when I was running kspx64 I didn\u0027t have the issues using DX9c. B4 I was forced to use KSPx86 due to mods disabled for the windows version of KSPx64... with all my textures and mods and no DSSloader or ATM the game simply could not run on the 32bit version. This is however, forcing me to go small and keep it tidy and I don\u0027t think thats a bad thing. once I get this back on the x64version, it can only run better... at least thats my thinking lol\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-08T22:35:19Z\u0022 title=\u002211/08/2014 10:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 8, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Enriched Uranium\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Helix935","CreatedById":71312,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-09T22:07:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eam i the only one that is experiencing the can\u0027t enter any buildings except R\u0026amp;D and can\u0027t leave, whenever i have this installed?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"djnattyd","CreatedById":63737,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-10T12:40:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Helix935\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Helix935\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eam i the only one that is experiencing the can\u0027t enter any buildings except R\u0026amp;D and can\u0027t leave, whenever i have this installed?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGetting that too along with all the contracts breaking by either not existing or not showing any text.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shaw","CreatedById":64788,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-10T13:09:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Helix935\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Helix935\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eam i the only one that is experiencing the can\u0027t enter any buildings except R\u0026amp;D and can\u0027t leave, whenever i have this installed?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis happens if you remove an agency you finished a contract for.
