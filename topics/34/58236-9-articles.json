As for the instability, I\u0027m not sure if the trunk is the cause. My CoL indicator is far above my CoM indicator and I have never launched a stable rocket where this was the case. I think there is some drag value or something that needs to be changed along with the rescale. For instance, when I take off all the bits such as ladder, parachute, interstage, fairing covers, superdracos, etc then my CoL will be below CoM. The only explanation I have is that these small parts are providing more lift or drag than they should, and being near the top of the rocket it pulls the CoL toward it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow I\u0027ve posted 3 pics, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 is with no changes (unstable)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 is with fins (stable)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3 is with the bits removed and no fins (stable)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nDUZxvQ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022nDUZxvQ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/pzQwwZt.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022pzQwwZt.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rleXbbq.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022rleXbbq.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-09T19:09:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry adding a size-2 node under the 1st stage engines.
