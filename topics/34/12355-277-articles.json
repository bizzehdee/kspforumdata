I get really weird planetary transfers (high delta-v, multiyear, or just misses). They almost never match up with the Kerbal Alarm Clock transfer windows or even when I just eyeball the phase angle. I thought it was just because I was doing really long burns so I used mainsails to lower my twr - same problem. I noticed when I do a course correction (say to 50km off the planet) I get a great looking trajectory but if I go to edit it with the node editor if I change it even .01, say retrograde, the trajectory jumps way off. Fine change it back -.01 and the trajectory is still way off. In fact it takes a big change in the node editor to get it even close to that 50km trajectory it showed at first. This seems buggy to me since it\u0027s giving two different values for the same trajectory. It also makes sense why I\u0027ve been having really weird long distance transfers that require multiple corrections. Anyone else have this problem? I\u0027m kind of new at this and may be making a simple mistake.

That\u0027s also a no-no. Your controlled from part has to be in the next stage. If the decoupler is upside down then that means you\u0027re detaching your upper stage and not being in control of it.

All the fuel and oxidizer drains evenly from all those tanks and runs out at the same time. Quite useful when the rocket can\u0027t have all the same engines - each attached to exactly the same fuel volume - in a stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat log is from a flight with all the inline decouplers right side up. The pastebinned craft file has some Kerbodyne ones upside down. (Later I\u0027ll make an all stock parts craft in similar fashion to fly in unmodded KSP to see if MechJeb still won\u0027t trigger them.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the upside down decouplers, that\u0027s for dropping tanks off the tops of the side mounted tanks to shed weight. Same concept as just having a tank without an engine mounted to a radial decoupler. (Except for fuel lines being unable to cross inline decouplers so either the line has to go diagonally to another tank or a small hardpoint stuck to the decoupler and two fuel lines to feed around the decoupler.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s always worked with any inline decoupler, with mechjeb or manual triggering, until the Kerbodyne one. They\u0027re heavy parts and it\u0027d help a bunch to tip them off with the upper fuel tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also have used upside down decouplers to drop docking ports that were used for in orbit assembly, but those get manually triggered with space bar or by right clicking the part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s one of my early uses of inline couplers upside down. The upermost orange tanks feed into the rat\u0027s nest below then when they\u0027re empty they are dropped along with the decouplers. Much safer for the rest of the rocket than having free roaming stack separators flying about and possibly getting stuck.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/fHnhtK\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5446/9657123873_3cdddd2e2d_o.png\u0022 alt=\u00229657123873_3cdddd2e2d_o.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/fHnhtK\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Edepot-on-pad\u003C/a\u003E by \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.flickr.com/people//\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eg_alan_e\u003C/a\u003E, on Flickr\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-16T00:52:03Z\u0022 title=\u002206/16/2014 12:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 16, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Galane\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"loppnessmonsta","CreatedById":58525,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-16T01:06:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMaybe I missed it: Is there a way to move the mechjeb sidebar?
