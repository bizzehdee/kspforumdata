Start with a clean RealSolarSystem.cfg file, and add a node for each body. In each body\u0027s node, add an Orbit node, and inside that set inclination to (28 \u002B whatever it was originally). However, you will also have to match LANs such that they\u0027re in the same plane, or things will get funky. The delta V map will then be wrong because Kerbin equatorial orbit (what you launch into from KSC) will no longer be in the plane of the ecliptic, so you\u0027ll have to launch into that latter plane (at higher cost) in order to do transfers at stated cost.

With KSP 0.25 and RSS 8.2.1 I found that if I kept my rover below 8.6m/s it would never fall through the terrain. At 8.6m/s it would eventually fall through, and the faster I went the shorter the distance it would go before it would fall through. I\u0027ve accepted that as a reasonable speed limit on an alien world with no roads. But here\u0027s a trick-I was landing a ship on the Moon\u0027s South pole when I discovered the \u0027jagged\u0027 appearance of the surface there, it\u0027s a result of the terrain cells not meshing well where a whole bunch of them come together. I read that you could eliminate the jaggies by changing the game\u0027s graphics settings, \u0022scenery\u0022, \u0022terrain detail\u0022 to \u0022high\u0022 so I did that and the jaggies disappeared. I then discovered that my rovers would not fall through the scenery anymore, at any speed! (Well, above 30m/s or so I always wipe out quickly so I can\u0027t be sure about really high speeds). I switched back to the default terrain detail and they fell through again. At least one mod makes getting rid of the jaggies impossible (active texture management), and then no matter what terrain detail is set at the rovers fall through. Conclusion: Poles are jagged, rovers fall through. Poles smooth, rovers don\u0027t fall through. You have to put something on the ground at the pole to see if the terrain is truly smooth, as looking from even a kilometer above the ground can hide the details.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I\u0027ve just upgraded to KSP 0.90 and RSS 8.5, and it\u0027s behaving a bit differently. With ATM on (so poles jagged) and terrain detail on high the critical speed is around 9-10m/s but with detail on default it is lower than 5m/s. I\u0027m still experimenting with that. If anyone else has done experiments on this I\u0027d love to hear it. I want to check if any of the other scenery and rendering settings make a difference too. I\u0027ve only done these tests on the Moon, I wonder if it\u0027s the same on other worlds?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StoryMusgrave","CreatedById":131938,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-04T16:23:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s been mentioned before, but how about people keep in mind that 8.6m/s is nearly 20mph or about 31km/h and is 8\u002Bmph faster than the moon speed record. For more reference the curiosity rover top speed is 0.025m/s and average speed is 1/3 of that.
