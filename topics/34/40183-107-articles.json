The contract infomation as a bonus is actual ISS missions conducted in the last few years and generates a random reason for the EVA Fix to the Repair Panel. (Repair Panel Required on Stations for contracts to show).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E B. New Civilian Contract. Bring civlians to either the Mun or Minmus for an expedition.

Time Based contract.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. The old repair contract has been completely redone. You no longer need to dock with the satellites and can do the whole repair from outside the satellite. (on older vessels launched before 1.09.2 you will have to still do the CheckSystems while in control of satellite)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Repair Parts has been removed and I am now using Community Resource Pack SpareParts. The same parts used in colonization and dangIt! All values updated to use new resource.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. CIT Kert is now included with Mission Controller. This mod gives you the ability to transfer Resources while on EVA and is about the only way to do Repair Contracts. Highly suggest using KAS. Repair Can and Repair panel both have Module Grab added to them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Huge rewrite of all contracts and how parameters work. I have totally bitten the bullet and decided to take a look at how some of the other contract mods fix the issue with contract goals being completed by the incorrect vessel. The short answer is that their really IS NONE! But decided to use the method that FinePrint uses to at least reduce this issue! So hopefully it helps. Won\u0027t fix it completely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. After playing around with fineprint method I decided to add another check. FinePrint uses this to some extent but I expanded it to Mission Controller Needs. All parameters (or goals in contracts) now require a Brand new Vessel that is launched after you accept a contract. This method itself solves about 75% of the issues with number 5. Only goals that are not contract types these don\u0027t effect is Repair Contracts and a few Time Parameters. Other than that pretty much if you don\u0027t make a new vessel for every single contract then it won\u0027t work! Just a warning!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Massive overhaul of how Contract Save info is loaded. Before I just used the Kerbal Space Program Node Method. This method works but is not very pratical for saving any contracts that might have load errors, and causing strange lock up issues. My new method (not really new both FinePrint and Dmagic use similar controls) pretty much will reduce I think about 75% of the load errors that could happen but most likely won\u0027t. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E A. For instance if I add a new parameter to a contract in a later version, this should help your end from doing silly things like clearing out your Archives! Only way Archive wipe will happen now is if the whole contract is GONE!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. Oh While EVA your kerbal can now hold on his own 1 Spare Part..

Before I was using the default Kerbal Space Program Landing Parameter to do landing goals. This parameter is not very good so I wrote a new one. Which gives me much more control over when its fired. So should pretty much completely get rid of the goal being fired while launching.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E11. Many more things I just can\u0027t remember.

Hopefully you got you eccentricity set, and your objective height (you said eccentricity did not work) then maybe possibly your height fell below or what not at any rate you objectives are not longer met but the you have green checks for everything (which is normal). You switched vessels... All your green checks went goodbye. You went back to your civilian vessel and the green checks did not come back. They might not have come back because when they rechecked your vessel it was not passing the checks because you no longer were at correct height, or what not (yes it will check again if you switch vessels) this usually is not a big deal to switch vessels because if you other vessel is set up right when it comes back the green checks will come right back.

Any time you switch vessels the objectives get cleared. Don\u0027t switch vessels during a landing attempt for civilian contracts. Its a problem, but not as much as a problem as objectives and contracts being completed by other vessels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI highly suggest only doing 1 Mission Controller contract at a time, and using 1 vessel.
