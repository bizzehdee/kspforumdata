If it is shielded then it won\u0027t do convection updates. If you\u0027re seeing convection happening to something in a fairing then either it\u0027s not being marked as shielded or you need to update Deadly Reentry. (the shielding check only went in recently because I thought that such checks were already being done stock, upstream of DRE code execution. I\u0027ll probably stick in a check for radiation and shielding next update as well. (otherwise, they will pick up extra radiant energy from supersonic shock)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eint flux = internal flux and it\u0027s basically anything that is NOT convection, radiation or conduction. It has no real world analogue, it\u0027s the means by which other modules can add or subtract heat from a part. (it could be considered either of the 3 but isn\u0027t actually handled by any of them) The way it works is that rather than code directly adjusting a part\u0027s temperature, they just add or subtract the mount of kilowatts they want to add, and when the thermal code runs, it looks at the net amount of internal flux and calculates the result then clears the internal flux property.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ExEvolution\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ExEvolution\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI don\u0027t know what happened, I thought it was KW rocketry because I installed it at the same time as the DRE update, which was working fine on the previous version, but the latest DRE update completely killed my FPS.
