Cardboard and I are working to restore the engines and tanks from the last working version of Angara, and are going to outfit the pack with many more features to make it much larger and more elaborate. To give you an idea, we won\u0027t be calling it the Angara pack anymore, because it will contain not just the Angara parts, but parts from N1 and Rus-M as well, and possibly even Soyuz parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbolman","CreatedById":42680,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-13T06:14:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m looking forward to the tanks, the engines look amazing don\u0027t get me wrong, but they seem a little off compared to others parts from parts from the AIES, NP ect. packs.

I decided to not bother making it look like stock or any other mods. If they don\u0027t like it oh well. Sure I could easily simplify it all and make it look like stock. tha would be a cake walk. But I refuse to do such things as more detail looks alot cooler IMO.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Redkid","CreatedById":7434,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-13T14:57:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022CardBoardBoxProcessor\u0022 data-cite=\u0022CardBoardBoxProcessor\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe old Angara stuff provided parts to allow you to make an UR-700 style lifter. they worked quite nice actually. Since I favored UR-700 more at the time for is practicality and modularity I still do. So when ever 3m parts are developed I would definitely like to make the stuff to do it again. I definitely like the big boy toy Rd-270 and RD-0120 engines. Currently trying to set about standards for things.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAwesome.
