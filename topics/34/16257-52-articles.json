The wire comment was referring to the dipole antenna configuration which is stiff not flapping in the breeze. it helps if you imagine radio as sound and the antenna as a speaker of sorts. how clear it is on the receiving end depends on the shape of both the transmitter and the receiver.(this is the main reason the army hides their antennas from view you can tell very easily what the antenna is for and how it works just by its shape)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"smunisto","CreatedById":57789,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-29T10:39:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo the way module manager works is not by downloading something related to it directly, but rather leaves it to the mod devs to include an appropriate dll in their mods which has the ModuleManager code in it?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StainX","CreatedById":57820,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-29T12:34:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Emy stock antennas are now retracted in v2... is there a debug menu to temporary disable RT2!?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"m4ti140","CreatedById":67296,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-29T13:12:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022smunisto\u0022 data-cite=\u0022smunisto\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo the way module manager works is not by downloading something related to it directly, but rather leaves it to the mod devs to include an appropriate dll in their mods which has the ModuleManager code in it?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003ENO!\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is only one modulemanager.dll and you should only have one (preferably newest, downloaded from Module Manager thread link) in your GameData folder (in root GameData folder, not in any particular mod folder).
