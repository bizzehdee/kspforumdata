Make an RCS thruster variant that, when attached to a tank that has boiloff, would be able to work for free as long as the fuel is in the tank. It\u0027s Isp (and thus, thrust) would depend on the boiloff rate and the percentage of tank that is still filled (essentially, on the ullage gas pressure). They would be very weak, especially when attached to a tank of something other than hydrogen (say, LOX, which also boils off).\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETBH, I\u0027d rather have a resource that would build up over time to a certain maximum (remainder gets vented) as cryo-liquid fuel boils off into gas, and is expended when using the RCS.

It has better hydrogen density than LH, isn\u0027t cryogenic, and has the same pressure requirements, plus has the added bonus of holding a lot of oxygen at the same time. IN my case, I have a nuclear reactor to power my ion engines on an interplanetary vessel, so hydrolysis power requirements aren\u0027t an issue. It only brings Argon, Water, and Food, and has dV in the 5-digit range, with years of life support.
