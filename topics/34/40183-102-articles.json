All time missions can now be completed without being in the active vessel. Meaning as long\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eas the contract is still active the time countdown is also active. Even in Editor, space center view.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. The time countdown will now only show for the vessel its attached to. So switching to another \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Evessel the time countdown for that vessel and contract will disapear. But Number 1 still applies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Added new Satellite contract. Has different objectives then the other two and also as objective to\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eadd a certain Science Part to the payload. This part can and will include any mods you have installed\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethat have parts that are classified as science parts in KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Added new Civilian contract Low Kerbin Orbit tour. This is a new contract type that has you bring\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea random number of kerbals to Kerbin orbit for a paid tour. This new special contract simulates adding\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea random number of Civilian Kerbals to your vessel. On this vessel you have to have open seats for \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethem to occupy, if not then you cannot finish the contract. If at any time you take up the seats with\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecrew then the objective will be cleared until you open up the seats again. Please note that the civilians\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eare simulated and not actually represented in game with Crew. Sorry I tried to find a way to do this\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand have not figured it out yet, or if its even possible. All civilians have random names.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Updated the config.cfg file to all new values including the newer Historical Contracts, so settings can be changed for other game types Like RSS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. New updated RSS config file updated with new values for Historical Contracts.
