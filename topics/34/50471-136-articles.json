I\u0027m much more of a mapper than a graphic designer, so, while I\u0027ve been able to get pretty good elevation maps going, the color maps are a pain. I have quite a few from NASA and other sources that are mostly good, but have some huge areas of low resolution that I\u0027ve been trying to hand edit into looking good, but I\u0027m guessing you\u0027d have a lot better luck than me.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-10T22:27:31Z\u0022 title=\u002207/10/2014 10:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 10, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by SpacedInvader\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
