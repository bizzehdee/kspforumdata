Unfortunately, even if you update the KSPAPIExtension.dll in the SmartParts folder, it will still use the outdated KSPAPIExtension.dll if it exists ANYWHERE else in your mods folder. So if you have any mod that hasn\u0027t been updated for 1.0.4, it will use it\u0027s KSPAPIExtension.dll. Frankly, as linuxguru pointed out, it really shouldn\u0027t do that. If anyone has any ideas on how I can get it to always use the latest version, I\u0027d love to know. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, what I would suggest is doing is doing a search for that file in your entire mod folder and replacing all of them with the latest version.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Glorious Dear Leader","CreatedById":34116,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T07:00:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EReal life always has a habit of getting in the way.
