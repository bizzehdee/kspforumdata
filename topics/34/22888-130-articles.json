First, accept that you\u0027re not gonna get a circular orbit. (This is actually BETTER for science, because the elliptical orbit you\u0027re going into is one that will net you geiger counter data for both low- and high-altitude Kerbin orbits, assuming your battery holds out.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, you launch with a fairly efficient gravity turn (I recommend holding vertical to 7.5 km altitude, then turning 5 degrees every 2.5 km increase in altitude until you\u0027re either horizontal or reach 70 km altitude, whichever comes first--if you aren\u0027t horizontal by 70 km, since you\u0027re now out of the atmosphere, turn horizontal immediately) and thrust until you achieve an apoapsis of at *least* 100 km. You\u0027ll probably not hit it that exactly, as there\u0027s a good chance you\u0027ll need to use the first two solid-fuel stages to get Ap. that high, but that\u0027s not critical--you just want to make sure it\u0027s comfortably outside Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point, you can, of course, jettison any remaining spent stages, and wait for apoapsis. (This is a good time to get your low-altitude Science data, before the battery is worn down by maneuvering.) Once you\u0027re at apoapsis, aim prograde and fire your remaining solid-fuel stages. (For me, this was just the last stage, but if you\u0027re better at hand-flying gravity turns, you might also have the Sergeant-3 stage left, too.) Hold your nose prograde until the motor burns out, and congratulations, you should be in an elliptical orbit of roughly 100-200km periapsis and about 1000-2000 km apoapsis!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemember, you\u0027re not going for a pinpoint accurate orbit with it--Explorer I wasn\u0027t about nailing a precise orbit to get the best data, it was about getting something--ANYthing--into LEO to try and regain face after Sputnik and the Vanguard launch failure. That it had an apogee that had it fly through the Van Allen belt was merely a bonus; getting it into orbit, ANY orbit, and beeping away to prove it was there, was the real goal of the mission. I\u0027m not sure of the exact trajectory flown, whether they launched it on a direct-insertion trajectory (where you just burn all the way to your final orbit in a single burn) or if they used a mechanical timer to delay firing the last stage or two until predicted apogee, but either is possible, and I personally would have chosen to use the latter; with the known (planned) course at cutoff of the last stage before final orbital insertion, a rather simple inertial, sun-seeking, or horizon-seeking guidance system could have been used to conduct a planned turnaround of the spacecraft immediately after separation, which would then solve the issue of making sure the final motor\u0027s delayed burn was in the correct direction, and we already had such simple inertial guidance systems... they were what was used to steer the launch vehicle on its preplanned trajectory, after all. (Simple being a relative term, in that they didn\u0027t need to be able to detect any form of acceleration, only detect vessel attitude compared to reference axes--THAT part can be done with a couple of gyroscopes; just about every airplane that\u0027s flown since the late 1920s has had that sort of IMU in the form of the Artificial Horizon, which just uses a coffee-and-sandwich-fueled voice-activated electrochemical autopilot to maintain the target attitude. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E Basic three-axis autopilots that could hold a selected pitch, heading, and bank angle--a.k.a. pitch, yaw, and roll--were commonplace on large aircraft by then, so if all else failed, you could purchase and adapt one of those...)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PapkoBodrik","CreatedById":113454,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-27T14:06:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethis mod will work with 23.5?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RedAV8R","CreatedById":94171,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-27T14:41:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Erdfox: tmikesecrist3\u0027s question was directly related to RSS/RO and FASA, of which your technique does not apply.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PapkoBodrik\u0022 data-cite=\u0022PapkoBodrik\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ethis mod will work with 23.5?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYep, it sure does.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rassa Farlander","CreatedById":63627,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-28T04:37:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI just downloaded this mod for the first time today, after watching it for quite some time.

Well, while my specific numbers won\u0027t work, the same basic concept should still apply--don\u0027t bother trying to get a circular orbit, just try to fly a gravity turn to a comfortably high apoapsis, then use the remaining solid motors prograde at that apoapsis to insert into an elliptical orbit like done with the real one... I\u0027d expect that would still get you into SOME sort of orbit, anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
