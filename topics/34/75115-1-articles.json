Clicking on the delta-V column header will show an estimated burn time for the estimated delta-V. You will want to stop at the correct closest approach distance, and not necessarily when this reaches 0. When the throttle is off, uses max thrust. Otherwise, uses the current throttle setting for the current thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Cleaned up the init sequence properly to get rid of any and all related errors (such as the toolbar button disappearing). Hopefully.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Closest approach line will only appear when the current trajectory is not already an intercept with the destination SoI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChanges in 2.4.13 (10/08/14)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Updated version number and recompiled with KSP 0.25.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Fixed problem with initialization happening too late, after it was needed. This fixes the non-functional non-Toolbar icon, as well as a problem with opening it from the Toolbar button.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChanges in 2.4.12 (8/11/14)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Fixed a NullRef during startup that just happened to also be causing another bug I was trying to fix with the Advanced mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChanges in 2.4.11 (8/11/14)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Borrowed some code from MechJeb2 (which is GPL3) for switching GUI skins. Added a new button right before the help button called \u0022Settings\u0022 where the skin can be switched. One of these is the Unity default theme.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Moved the Protractor parts to Flight Control in science/career mode. It is now available earlier. It is also now 400 funds, down from what I felt was on the high side.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Replaced some code for SI postfixes, and parsing seconds into a date/time string which comes from MechJeb2 (also GPL3). The times are now in a different format which should be clearer (but slightly longer). Added font metrics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Other tidbits.

If you have it installed, it will be used. Otherwise, it will behave as it always has.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChanges in 2.4.6 (6/14/14)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Fixed ModuleEnginesFX support.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Added support for Kerbal time.
