Start with an I-beam, cubic strut, fuel tank, ect. Then put your command seat on that. From there you should be able to assign a Kerbal to the seat from the Astronaut selection tab. For example, I built most of this rover before putting seats in it. [http://imgur.com/eBKyBgK](http://imgur.com/eBKyBgK) On loading it looks like this.

Someone else mentioned it once, and I admit I just accepted it. The problem seems to stem from seating a Kerbal in a command seat, it does something wonky to wheel colliders. So on a craft with no Kerbals when separating a part balanced on wheels against the main part it works correctly. Put a command seat somewhere and seat a Kerbal and then suddenly the wheel colliders are sinking through. it does this regardless of whether you seat the Kerbal using Take Command or EVA them and walk over to the seat."},{"CreatedByName":"Spheniscine","CreatedById":125755,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-25T03:02:32Z","Content":"Hm there seems to be a side-effect of this mod, where rescue contracts can sometimes spawn with Kerbals in command seats.

It actually seems to cause some serious problems. When I get close enough to the derelict command seat to take control of the kerbal, Take Command switches control from the rescue ship to the derelict command seat. The first time I encountered this I was in the middle of a burn and when I switched back to the rescue ship it had gone from almost being in orbit to a steep suborbital trajectory.  I did manage to rescue one kerbal from a command seat. The focus still shifted to the command seat, but I think having the rescue ship coasting when it happened prevented the sudden trajectory change."},{"CreatedByName":"Rodger","CreatedById":153575,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-29T14:36:44Z","Content":"I had the same issue as Kron, and after that I had another rescue contract with the kerbal in a command seat, but with the 2nd contract the kerbal just disappeared, and is listed as MIA in the KSC.

Sorry for not being very active in here lately - I\u0027m afraid work and family commitments haven\u0027t left much time for Kerbal these days!  I would like to respond to a few recent issues though:\n\n1) Adding Take Command to all external command seats\n\nI had considered doing this, and there\u0027s actually a discussion back on page 1 of this thread about that.  Here\u0027s the working config we had settled on at the time:\n\n    @PART\n    [*]:HAS[@MODULE[KerbalSeat]]:FOR[TakeCommand]\n    {\n        CrewCapacity = 1\n        MODULE\n        {\n            name = TakeCommand\n            minimumCrew = 1\n        }\n    }\n\nI haven\u0027t made this the default yet since this was originally designed and tested only with the stock command seat, and I wasn\u0027t sure if adding it to other modded seats would cause issues.  I probably will make this the default for future versions, provided I find a fix for the next issue:\n\n2) Rescue contracts spawning Kerbals in command seats in orbit\n\nThis odd behavior is the result of a recent-ish update to KSP itself - I forget the exact one.  It used to be that rescue contracts would just spawn a lone Kerbal in an EVA suit, but then this was changed so they would spawn in a command pod (which makes sense - how else would they get to orbit?).  The way Take Command works is that it basically turns the external seat into a command pod.  The problem arises because the contract generator code just randomly picks any available command pod that has seats (which now includes external command chairs).\n\nI\u0027ve taken a quick look and I\u0027m not quite sure yet how to fix this.  Ideally I\u0027d like to make KSP ignore command seats altogether when generating contracts, but I don\u0027t know if the contracts API will let me control that.  I\u0027ll keep digging and see what I can come up with."},{"CreatedByName":"TheSpaceManiac","CreatedById":152329,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-28T15:18:14Z","Content":"I\u0027ve encountered a slightly annoying issue of sorts, which is that clicking on the \u0022Leave Seat\u0022 button on a Kerbal spawned in with TakeCommand does not do anything.

Specifically, I find that when I Take Command spawns Kerbals in a seat, that craft has a problem. When it goes over about 2.5 m/s (across the ground, like a rover; up like a rocket, doesn\u0027t matter) the game resets it to the ground, rotated 90 degrees (so lying flat if a rocket) and then KCT spawns a ton of exceptions. Sometimes the game recovers (from the exceptions, and sometimes not). This only happens after KCT builds something over time. It does not happen if using KCT\u0027s simulation feature.~~\n\n~~It does not happen with normal command pods, unmanned craft. It does not happen if I spawn a kerbal in a normal pod then move him over to the seat. This is happening on an install with only KCT, Take Command, and GCMonitor.~~\n\n~~Logs: [KSP.log](https://www.dropbox.com/s/7szmxkemzgkgec3/1-KSP.log?dl=0), [player.log](https://www.dropbox.com/s/6mojic27gjp8nvq/1-Player.log?dl=0)~~\n\n~~Has anyone else encountered this?~~\n\n~~I\u0027m gonna crosspost on the KCT thread also.~~\n\n~~Playing on Linux x64~~\n\nEDIT: Turns out Take Command isn\u0027t the problem, Take Command just makes it easy to get command seat only vehicles that don\u0027t move at all before a Kerbal is in the command seat, which seems to trigger the problem.
