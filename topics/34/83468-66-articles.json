I\u0026#39;ve built several scale looking planes to attempt a mid air refuel. I\u0026#39;ve successfully hit a scoop the size of a Kerbal\u0026#39;s head, towed by a KAS winch. With a part the size of a large antenna. The issue I run into is I use mechjeb to pilot the tanker as well as the chase plane. Using heading and altitude hold thus allowing me to make very tiny course and speed adjustments to hit such a small target. But using a \u0022docking port\u0022 (It\u0026#39;s a scaled down / modified version). It merges the two ships into one, confusing the heck out of mechjeb, and once the smoke clears no more planes.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow at the end of my very long story. What I\u0026#39;m asking is. Would it be possible to make a part that functions just like a docking port. Magnet / connection, but doesn\u0026#39;t actually \u0022dock\u0022 the two ships together? Basically like the trailer hitch Lo-fi was working on. Having two ships held together by a solid connection but leave the two vessels separated? And in turn possibly make use of Dmagic1\u0026#39;s EVA Transfer to actually refuel the chase plane.\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-16T18:54:05Z\u0022 title=\u002211/16/2015 06:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by V8jester\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ckfinite","CreatedById":10410,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-24T20:40:10Z","Content":"\nI\u0026#39;m working on building a small crawler crane, and was wondering if anyone had suggestions for a pulley mechanism?

In my parts, I standardized the transform names, so that on the Saddle and Trailer Hitch, the names of the ports are defined like so:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode prettyprint lang-html\u0022\u003E\n\tMODULE\n\t{\n\t\tname = KASModuleStrut \n\t\tnodeTransform = plugPort1\n\t\ttype = PipeSize1\n\t\tmaxLenght = 50\n\t\tmaxAngle = 100\n\t\tbreakForce = 600\n\t\tallowDock = true\n\t\tallowPumpFuel = true\n\t\thasCollider = false\n\t\ttubeScale = 0.15\n\t\tjointScale = 0.15\n\t\ttextureTiling = 1\n\t\ttubeSrcType = Joined\n\t\ttubeTgtType = Joined\n\t\tevaStrutPos = (0.05, 0.059, -0.21)\n\t\tevaStrutRot = (0.0, 0.0, 0.0)\n\t\ttubeTexPath = KAS/Textures/pipe\n\t}\n\n\tMODULE\n\t{\n\t\tname = KASModuleStrut \n\t\tnodeTransform = plugPort2\n\t\ttype = PipeSize1\n\t\tmaxLenght = 50\n\t\tmaxAngle = 100\n\t\tbreakForce = 600\n\t\tallowDock = true\n\t\tallowPumpFuel = true\n\t\thasCollider = false\n\t\ttubeScale = 0.15\n\t\tjointScale = 0.15\n\t\ttextureTiling = 1\n\t\ttubeSrcType = Joined\n\t\ttubeTgtType = Joined\n\t\tevaStrutPos = (0.05, 0.059, -0.21)\n\t\tevaStrutRot = (0.0, 0.0, 0.0)\n\t\ttubeTexPath = KAS/Textures/pipe\n\t}\u003C/pre\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there a way to set up my configuration so that I won\u0027t get the duplicate pipe connections upon load?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for making such a great mod, and thanks for your help. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-02T17:12:26Z\u0022 title=\u002212/02/2015 05:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Angel-125\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CajunInABox","CreatedById":152185,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-04T02:46:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, is the only real way to attach heavy things in space multiple kerbals?
