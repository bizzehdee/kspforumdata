But if you have locked a contract in (and in the game you sent me you had a locked contract, that means you accepted one) then the 24 hour check is actually paused until you finish the contract or dismiss the contract. You should not have to use the debug tool at all. I even tried to see if maybe your 24 hour check was not working, and noticed it was not at first. Thats when I checked if you had a locked contract and you did. You can tell you have a locked contract when you enter the contract screen there will be a yellow warning telling you that contracts are locked on top of the GUI Screen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter that everything worked fine, including the automated checks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Drew Kerman","CreatedById":103177,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-23T04:49:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022malkuth\u0022 data-cite=\u0022malkuth\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHey gaiiden is that engine from a mod?

You can cheat the mission done by adding the completed mission to the .sp file. If you have already completed some missions you can copy one of them and replace the name with the current mission, you will have to give yourself the payment though also, so might as well add it while your in the .sp file. Maker sure KSP is not loaded while doing this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ABGDEZ\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ABGDEZ\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ECan you have an existing save, install this mod, and everything will work?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes work fine.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cedex","CreatedById":111813,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-26T23:48:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022malkuth\u0022 data-cite=\u0022malkuth\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHmmm never had an issue with repair missions before, are you sure your docking with the correct satellite?

I played hard modded KSP, maybe it\u0060s a problem with kerbal attachment system, or other mods. I will tell you if i figure out what causes the bug. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethx for your reply. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAwesome Mod!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGreets \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECedex\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KevinGelking","CreatedById":111869,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-27T11:18:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI must say I\u0027m quite surprised that the \u0022Known Issues\u0022 section had so few entries.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tested the mod yesterday and I noticed that various things did not work and made playing impossible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1st. After researching \u0022Recycling\u0022 for 300 Science and clicking \u0022Recover Vessel\u0022 - you don\u0027t get a s*t back. Instead you get to pay the whole rocket all over just to make a tiny adjustment like updating the Action Groups or adding Fuel Lines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2nd. When taking the Contract to Orbit around Minmus and perform orbital Research for 1 Day --- I went into correct orbit around minmus, started the \u0022Orbital Research Box\u0022 Research and the counter started counting. I accelerated time --- it went Past 6H (1 Kerbin Day) --- and past 23:59 hours after which it returned to 0 and turned red again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn short: Research missions are impossible to complete. Another batch of money wasted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3rd. Taking another mission which was to Orbit around a certain body... well, the body I had to orbit around was no other than \u0022none\u0022. Meaning it is impossible to complete the mission due to the fact that its not possible to orbit around \u0022Nothing\u0022 as you\u0027d always orbit around the sun at least. (leaving the orbit of the sun would take 14 years and I think the vessel would simply disappear in that event)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall I must say I\u0027m very disappointed in the mod. It looked nice to have a challenge and a tight budget to build rockets, but having no (WORKING) way to get money back from vessels and it not being possible to complete any of the interesting missions makes this impractical.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I\u0027m stuck with a budget of 64.0 $ because I never got money back from the vessel I had on the launchpad~ now being unable to actually make any money because its impossible to build a cheap rocket to perform an impossible mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESad Fox Here \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
