I edited the EWBCL texture (just a name change) and now all of these black marks have sprung up inside the cargo bay (I didn\u0027t do it). I remember someone else having this problem, but I cannot find the post. If someone could tell me how to fix it, that would be great.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, so I had this problem. Turns out all the free image editors I\u0027ve tried (GIMP, Pinta, etc and I tried a lot of them) are not handling TGA files that originate from PS properly or something. I don\u0027t exactly know what the issue is and nobody else seems to either since I\u0027ve had zero help with it. I had to ask a friend who owns PS to use their computer. Only way I was able to fix the issue. Not the mod author\u0027s fault, but it would be nice to be able to edit the texture properly with free software. Maybe if the blank textures were also provided in another format (PNG for example) it might not be an issue, but I don\u0027t know if this sort of bug is irrelevant of the image format. So, I\u0027m not condoning you download or purchase PS, I\u0027m just informing all involved that this is an issue, but not helldiver\u0027s issue. More like GIMP\u0027s or PS\u0027s. Maybe someday I\u0027ll post a bug on their site. I don\u0027t know. For all I know it could be some form of DRM or just simply a software issue. It is weird how crystal clear the texture showed up in PS and you could see all the detail whereas in GIMP or any other editor I tried it showed up as mostly transparency.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-28T11:18:57Z\u0022 title=\u002206/28/2014 11:18  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 28, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by qnistNAMEERF\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
