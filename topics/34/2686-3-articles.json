IIRC, the VASIMR ion engine which provides 5N of thrust requires something like 200kW to function. To give an idea, each solar array wing on the ISS weighs 1,088 kg and provides approximately 31kW of power. To get 200kW, you\\\u0027d need 7 of these arrays -- weighing 7.616 metric tons. The engine itself weighs 300kg, bringing the full mass of the system to approximately 7.9 metric tons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo put this in KSP terms, an ion engine/solar array combined system would weigh 7.9 units, and provide 0.005 units of thrust. Fuel consumption (based on the VASMIR specific impulse of 5,000 sec) would be 0.0000231 fuel units (based on the stock fuel tank\\\u0027s propellant mass) per second, for a total burn time from one can of fuel of 249 days (21.5 million seconds).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGreat for long-term exploration missions at 10,000x warp. Not so great for orbital maneuvering. The efficiency is there, and it\\\u0027s significant: 107,500 N*s (total thrust) for the VASMIR vs. 12,500 N*s for the stock engine.

The \\\u0027800\\\u0027 capacity tank weighs more when full, but the same when empty, as 4 of the \\\u0027200\\\u0027 tanks :-\\. If anything, I thought the advantage of 1 large tank over several small ones was the fact that volume increases faster than surface area - more fuel inside the same amount of metal. Since the larger tank is in fact a larger diameter, this should definitely be the case. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, where is this extra mass coming from? *boggles* It\\\u0027s the same when empty: 1 ton (for the \\\u0027800\\\u0027) or 1 ton (4*0.25 for the \\\u0027200\\\u0027s). So it\\\u0027s not the metal. The \\\u0027200\\\u0027s each contain 200 units of fuel in their remaining 1.75 tons of mass, whereas the \\\u0027800\\\u0027 contains 800 units of fuel in its remaining 8 tons of mass. The \\\u00271600\\\u0027s are similar - they\\\u0027re exactly twice the mass of the \\\u0027800\\\u0027s (full or empty). At least that\\\u0027s consistent (and since they are simply twice the height, I wouldn\\\u0027t expect any particular improvement due to the geometry like I would coming from the 1m \\\u0027200\\\u0027s.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELiterally the only thing I can see that\\\u0027s an advantage is the doubled (or quadrupled, in the case of the \\\u00271600\\\u0027 tank) impact strength - which, again, I found bizarre - if anything I thought that in general, the larger tanks were more fragile (the Atlas would collapse under its own weight if not pressurized, etc.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe extra mass and subsequently reduced performance are just ..weird, though. If nothing else you could put the fuel into the same (rough) shape as a stack of 4 tanks, but use stringers instead of actual partitions between the \\\u0027tanks\\\u0027 and still accomplish a weight savings that way, albeit much less than the improvement from improved geometry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETesting confirmed the crappier TWR - straight up, full throttle, got to 58.5km @ ~2700 m/s using 4x \\\u0027200\\\u0027 tanks, while only reached 51.5km @ 2440 m/s using a single \\\u0027800\\\u0027 tank. These numbers are at burnout.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etl;dr - Why are the larger tanks heavier instead of lighter than the small tanks?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS - for what it\\\u0027s worth, the \\\u0027compressed\\\u0027 fuel tank seems correct to me. You pay more of a mass penalty for such a small tank - running 4 of them (200 units of fuel) gives a crappier TWR than a single \\\u0027200\\\u0027, as it should be. However, the name is deceptive! Allllll the other tanks, even the FL-R25 RCS tank, have the numbers indicating fuel capacity. This one is called the \\\u0027M100\\\u0027 but has only a capacity of 50.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPPS - I think using the 100:1 fuel to weight system that the \\\u0027200\\\u0027 tank was supposed to weigh 2.25, not 2.0. If that was the case it would be functionally identical to the other 3 tanks .. which is still wrong, the fuel:structure weight ratio should improve with tank size, but it would at least be a start.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NovaSilisko","CreatedById":3897,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-10-14T18:21:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI still need to do some tweaks to the large tanks.
