It gives you the option to restore the node or not restore the node, but frankly I can\u0027t imagine why anyone would not want to restore the node, and on the off chance they do no longer want the node at that point, they can always delete it \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did try the timewarp at the tracking station a version or two ago and KSP simply wont let you.

I have a similar problem when two ships are docked (I have a spent lander stage I leave in orbit for just this purpose) and I do planning, after which I decide if the maneuvers are worth doing (ie safe), undock, and the nodes (and vessel ID) follow the wrong ship in KAC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny chance of an option for nodes to follow kerbals in addition to to vessels? That way wherever the kerbal goes, the node plan follows him instead of the ship, which I know the ID follows based on node root-ness (or whatever), but is basically out of my control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo idea how this might look in the GUI, but I am impressed with the distance to surface option in the last couple of updates.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Iron4venger","CreatedById":89812,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-29T12:44:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlthough I do not use this plugin for anything else but showing universal time.

So what happens is that I leave the Alarm hanging around, get back in the capsule, warp to SOI, and get the ships alarm (as I should) and an error message, because the EVA-Alarm can\u0027t find it\u0027s vessel.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis one was pretty straight forward. added an option to ignore EVA\u0027s for SOI Alarm adding. code is commited and will be in next release.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Dweller_Benthos\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Dweller_Benthos\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAn auto maneuver node alarm would be nice, if it\u0027s not a hassle to do.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGot in my head how to do this, the biggest challenge I see is how to track changes to the maneuver nodes - when you create one it can set an alarm, but I\u0027ll have to update the stored node whenever changes get made or it\u0027s just a time marker, would rather not resave the file 10 times a sec, but will come up with something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022miceliux\u0022 data-cite=\u0022miceliux\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m experiencing some problems with KAC 2.6.2.0\u003Cp\u003EMany times the buttom \u0022Jump to ship\u0022 doesn\u0027t work.

I can stop the restore easy enough, but would be ace if you could check your output_log.txt file for when this happens, there should be something in there about why the backup failed. Some other things you could try would be to turn off the \u0022backup\u0022 function in the settings and then it should ignore that. If you\u0027re happy to help out would be ace to see your ksp.log and output_log.txt (pastebin or some such) - its probably bad code or me not knowing how to handle an OS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022miceliux\u0022 data-cite=\u0022miceliux\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnother issue I have with 2.6.2.0 is the Kerbal icon not showing properly:\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsually this is as simple as a file missing from the install. the one for that icon is called img_buttonTypeCrew.png . can you see if it\u0027s in the folder (or if you have an error in the log when the scene starts) - I could have made a case mistake when I prepped that image.
