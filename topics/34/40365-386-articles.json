Above 50% on the reactor, the radiators tend to run hot enough to reduce the power output significantly (assuming you only have the minimum required to get the Thermal Helper in the green). Below 50% on the reactor you get better power generation efficiency, but then you still end up producing little power as you\u0027re running at a low setting. YMMV, but as I said, I found ~50% total output on the reactor (measured from the reactor) is ideal, this means your transmitter will usually be set slightly lower than 50% to ensure all other power draws do not put the reactor too far over the 50% mark. This also allows the reactor to run longer before needing to be refueled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to seeing what your reactor is running at, the right click menu for the reactor should tell you, should be the Reactor Status line, this is also true for the other reactor types.
