This works in two ways; background (Non active vessels) and foreground (active vessels).\n\nWith this system the size and mass of the vessel directly influences the decay rate (in a mostly opposite way to that of real life). For example, a large but light satellite will have the same rate of decay as a small but heavy satellite, if you have a small and light satellite in orbit the decay rate could be very low. This might explain why the satellites decay rate is so low in the background, but even then 10 meters in 6 years is incredibly slow...\n\nThe active decay system kicks in when the vessel is the active vessel in a flight scene, the decay rates here are the same as in the background but their implementation leaves much to be desired, I have struggled a great deal trying to find a method of updating the active vessels velocity with a calculated velocity reliably - without crazy rates or eccentricity changes, I suppose this is a worst case scenario of the differences between the two systems ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif \u0022:(\u0022) I will see what I can do for 1.4.0, I have been focusing on RSS alot lately and the stock system needs some love so these issues are on my to do list next!\n\nThanks for the report though, I will see what I can do for the next release!

I\u0027m still in the early \u0022Can I even do that?\u0022 phases myself.  What I probably should do first is see if I can throw together something basic that ignores fuel usage altogether, considering that [this](https://github.com/CYBUTEK/KerbalEngineer/pull/96) is my sole KSP modding experience so far.\n\nI wonder if modelling fuel consumption is something that KER\u0027s VesselSimulator is capable of (which is also used in some other mods).  It has the means to calculate dV, so it\u0027d seem that something could walk that path in reverse to \u0027subtract\u0027 it. (I also think there\u0027d definitely be utility in a standard \u0022Simulate activity of unloaded vessels\u0022 plugin that other things can hook into for acurately figuring out things like EC/fuel usage and recovery of unloaded vessels.)"},{"CreatedByName":"Filigan","CreatedById":121058,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-07T09:38:14Z","Content":"When i accept a LKO rescue Mission the created capsule has an icredibly high decay rate, leaving me with less than 0.5 days before it enters the atmosphere, even when i lower the decay multiplier to 0.1\\* .
