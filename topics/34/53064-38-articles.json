I managed to get my probes back by aero braking and periapsis of around 65km from the moon, they just about made it! But seems a bit harsh for manned pods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4)The only downside I have is the terrain on Mun and Kerbin is all very flat and boring, also some clipping issues with lander feet on moon, is that the part (AIES legs) or the terrain due to rescaling?

So hopefully I won\u0027t have to do \u00222\u0022 jobs at once, hence free up brain and free time!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBrain being the rarest commodity these days.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWeekends were seas of Netflix, with eating and drooling. I\u0027m starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the saddest thing in all of this, there isnt\u0027 much left to do for RPL. Just had no time whatsoever! Frustrating!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry for being away from the boards for the past 2 weeks, it was totally insane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll slowly reappear this week, with some hopeful final sprint segments for RPL this very weekend. I have to install Windows on my wife\u0027s brand new PC (finally fully assembled), but that\u0027s just a question of keeping an eye on the progress bars. Which I\u0027ll be able to do all the while working on RPL.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMega desk is complete, Mega PC is missing only a few more parts (only fans). So the ragged setup I had is now prim and proper.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApologies for the seemingly endless delays.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHang in there everyone, I\u0027ll git\u0027er done!\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHE LIVES!
