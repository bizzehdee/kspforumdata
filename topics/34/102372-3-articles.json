Wiseman, I\u0027m not 100% sure why you\u0027re not getting the casino contract (unless it\u0027s not have the slots open, which sucks but the only work around is to get more prestige).

It didn\u0027t just kill those contracts, I had some null ref errors and was unable to click buildings or go to the investor tour rover.

Still poking at it including taking steps to ensure that it\u0027s not either of two of some of my own mods (Stock Drag Fix and Deadly Reentry)\n\nEdit: Well, I have to conclude it wasn\u0027t any of the mods... I think it was just a KSP glitch. I found the process behind it all... the part\u0027s state field in the save file was set... which then apparently caused an error when the part went off rails. The part never properly loaded in and absorbed heat from the rover which it couldn\u0027t dissipate because its own code wasn\u0027t executing.
