For instance, Argon is 300.9 times denser as a supercritical fluid (535.6 kg/m\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E) than as a gas at STP (1.78 kg/m\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E). Argon is only pressurized to 48.63 barr at its critical point, meaning you\u0027re going to require about 50 times the tank mass (the minimum tank-mass is directly proportional to internal pressure for a pressure-vessel in vacuum) for about 300 times the fuel mass. Which isn\u0027t a bad deal really- even if you chill ArgonGas to just above its boiling-point (-186 C) you\u0027re only going to increase fuel-density 3.24-fold (based on a density of 5.772 kg/m\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E for Argon at -185 C). A better fuel tank mass-fraction means lower propellant-requirements for the same Delta-V or more Delta-V for the same fuel mass: which amounts to major cost-savings when you\u0027re sending a probe all the way to Eeloo...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E(2)\u003C/strong\u003E Your much higher fuel-density means your ion probe (or even nuclear-electric manned spacecraft!) has a much smaller aerodynamic profile. It\u0027s the difference between trying to lift a crumpled up ball of paper and a ball of lead through the atmosphere- and your Delta-V costs are going to be much, much lower (several hundred m/s lower if your launch vehicle only carries your probe to Low Orbit) to get the same mass of supercritical fluid to orbit considering the incredibly low density of the gas-phase... With the new drag-model in the stock aerodynamcis system coming out in 1.0, things like fuel-density will actually affect Delta-V costs to orbit without having to install FAR, and you will also be able to get away with a smaller probe inside cheaper\u002Bsmaller fairings if you are using supercritical propellant on your interplanetary probe...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-15T23:11:31Z\u0022 title=\u002203/15/2015 11:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-15T23:09:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar1989, you\u0027ve been asked to stop, so stop.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-15T23:11:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat talk can wait till after 1.0 as this boat has left.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan we please eliminate the theorycraft?
