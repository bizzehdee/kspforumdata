Upon updating to .23 i added only a few mods, FAR, KJR, and enhanced navball. Everything was working great until I tried my first orbital flight in the new patch in my brand new career save. It seems that something was broken with the decouplers. They behaved very strangely at high altitudes and in orbit. I can only say that this happened with the standard medium decoupler that is unlocked I think in the first science purchase. It seemed that after decoupling the spent stage would fly away at a tremendous rate in a retrograde direction. To test that I placed my craft facing retrograde and staged, which resulted in the spent stage colliding with the upper stage instantaneously. After this happened once I exited the game and deleted Kerbal Joint Reinforcement from my mods and tried again, and I got the same result. So, I exited out again and this time deleted FAR, the next test fixed the problem and the decoupler worked as usual.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: I wanted to add that I updated through steam, and also verified integrity of game before even starting up for the first time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-18T00:54:05Z\u0022 title=\u002212/18/2013 12:54  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 18, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Wafflz\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ferram4","CreatedById":21328,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-18T00:45:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E@nullreference: \u003C/strong\u003EAt what altitude and angle of attack?
