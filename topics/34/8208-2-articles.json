The wheel hit ray-cast, the Unity routine that finds where to draw the wheel, seems to measure the moving part as if it\\\u0027s lagging behind in time a bit, but the lag isn\\\u0027t constant, and the measurement error\\\u0027s relation to velocity isn\\\u0027t linear.

The Unity wheel-collider tutorials have a tendency not to mention what to do if your car is flying upward, atop a platform, very fast... so go figure. Increasing the physics step does increase the error in the measurement, so that\\\u0027s one more variable I\\\u0027d need to compensate in a solution.
