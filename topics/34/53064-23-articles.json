And there was a pack during [0.22], but it was partial. Not all modders agreed to be part of the pack, so there is still some level of Easter egg hunting going on. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E And no jokes, you have a great point about checklist. I personally have an excel sheet dedicated to KSP. For my mod, and also, just keeping track of all my favorite mods. The list of the mods I use got so long, that I\u0027d sometimes just leave one behind out of pure forgetfulness. Not anymore, excel is your friend!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWon\u0027t go over the pros and cons of a pack, but NathanKell will be doing a RealismOverhaul pack. Which might very well contain a good part of the essentials/tweaks.

Apparently as I develop more along the rocketry tech stream the conical tank will gain in its ability to be stretched. I haven\u0027t been able to do that yet (Wow! Getting the research going after the first few flights needs a network of communication sattelites, and getting that network up and running at this tech level is hard!), but once I do I\u0027ll post back to let you know whether that is working.

Because Tree Edit, may the kerbal gods bless it for the infinite pleasures it allows, but it\u0027s not the most user friendly interface when moving specific parts in long lists.
