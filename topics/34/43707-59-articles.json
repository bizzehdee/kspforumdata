Normally I prefer to play KSP with permadeath - meaning I don\u0027t manipulate the save game folder and I just accept it if I die and crash. But ever since using KOS I have had to abandon that and use save-scumming by backing up savegame folders behind the scenes so I\u0027m able to revert when something goes haywire. This is because a lot of the time the disaster isn\u0027t my fault but a bug. This \u0022half the ship disappears\u0022 problem is one I get a lot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hadn\u0027t noticed before that it was always disconnecting RIGHT at the spot where the KOS SCS part is attached. But you\u0027re right, it is always right at that spot. That might be relevant? I\u0027ve wanted to make a bug report on it in github but I just can\u0027t get a consistent set of circumstances that trigger it. I figure until I have that there\u0027s no sense in reporting it. (Programmers HATE it when bug reports don\u0027t tell them how to make the problem occur. You can\u0027t discover the cause of the problem that way, and even if you can make a good guess about it and try to fix it, to prove it was fixed requires being able to see a difference between the \u0022before\u0022 behavior and the \u0022after\u0022 behavior. And that means being able to have a test to run that had previously made the problem occur.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe since we\u0027ve both seen this happen we can help trace down the exact circumstances that cause it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor me, the following have always been necessary but not sufficient conditions to make the truncating spaceship problem happen:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 - Prior to the spaceship truncation, some other error with KOS caused the terminal to stop responding to typing. Sometimes just to the point where toggling the SCS power will fix it, and sometimes even worse where all of KSP freezes up and it has to be killed externally (from Task Manager, or kill -9 for unix people).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 - You make the vessel containing the KOS piece that had the error have to be reloaded from rails back into the full physics engine, either by traveling within 2.2 km of it with another vessel, or by switching to it in the Tracking Station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately although I know those two things seem to be required for it to happen, they don\u0027t seem to be sufficient to make it happen every time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-10T20:56:32Z\u0022 title=\u002210/10/2013 08:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 10, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Steven Mading\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ptreese84","CreatedById":75486,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-11T00:23:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESorry if posted.

The ship you\u0027re flying is its own computer, so when you leave it its programs vanish.\u003Cp\u003EWhat you want to do is \u0022switch to archive\u0022 and then create your script there, while on the ground.

That folder is your archive, and you can actually edit the scripts there with notepad or whatever text editor you prefer (notepad\u002B\u002B is my favorite), and they\u0027ll show up on EVERY SHIP you make, so long as you SWITCH TO ARCHIVE first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can\u0027t do that in orbit, though, unless you\u0027ve brought antennae with you.
