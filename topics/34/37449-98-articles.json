For example, orbital bases and landed bases especially, they are extremely easy to the point of boring/abusable, because with the giant base contract combined with the many subsequent \u0027collect science\u0027 \u0027plant flag\u0027 contracts to come, bases are incredibly valuable without providing any serious difficulty (in fact, standard landers are typically much more difficult, because they tend to require engineering for a return trip, while bases tend to be just left in place). Not only does TAC Life Support add the difficult to justify the massive value, but it also gives much more reason to create bigger, more complex bases with actual functions, as the bases now either need to receive food from KSC, or they need to be self-sufficient to produce their own food (ala Kolonization mod). \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:verdana;\u0022\u003E Mods like TAC Life Support and RemoteTech2, both of which make the game significantly harder, also led to some of my proudest most creative missions I have ever made, that is why I love these mods.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:verdana;\u0022\u003ETo quote one of the KSP devs, as he learned from an influential music teacher, \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/264zl3/in_praise_of_slowly_filling_out_the_tech_tree/chog7lc\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:verdana;\u0022\u003E\u0022Restriction is where creativity is born.
