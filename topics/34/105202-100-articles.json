If you didn\u0027t modify any settings, then ReplacementParts aren\u0027t your problem. Since you had the hab timer running, it\u0027s even possible that they got grouchy before running out of supplies, just from homesickness/lack of habitation.

I can see wear numbers on things like the science lab, but nothing else, and since the spare parts are invisible, I can\u0027t know if they\u0027ve run out.

If not, then Wear is off by default unless you set it to on.  On the latest version of USI-LS, you can go into the spiffy new UI screen in the SpaceCenter view, and look for a wear value which is anything other than \u00220\u0022.  \u00220\u0022 means Wear is off.  Anything else means Wear will happen.  Wear only happens if there are Kerbals actively occupying the space, so if your Kerbals are all in the science lab, then that\u0027s why Wear isn\u0027t at 0.\n\nStreetwind is probably right - it\u0027s likely the Homesickness timer - and that information in the latest USI-LS is also present within the UI screens, so it should be easy (now) to see that."},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-20T07:42:24Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, panarchist said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Replacement Parts can be replenished from MaterialKits, if an Engineer performs maintenance.

I used to just RP it (make long duration ships extra big, centrifuge, etc) but now I can\u0027t see my game without that feature.  \n**Oh and my USI-LS hardcore mode:**  High power consumption (like 0.15/sec per Kerbal) so bring batteries!  And very short time without supplies (about 1 hour).  Just enough time to re-enter in a pod (I assume there is some simple life support systems in command pods).  This forces one to carefully manage supplies and always bring something in the service module.  I also enjoy the idea that O2 production/water cleaning is being performed by ship systems representing the high power consumption.  So far it adds interesting challenge.  Plus everybody dies without supplies and goes tourist when hab or homesickness happens.  So mission planning and resupply is veeeeeery important, which is how I like it.  \n\nOh and combine with the USI DERP parts and you get a nice tiny fuel cell which is great for those times when the batteries go dry and a planet is in the way of the sun!  \n\nI think I enjoy torturing myself with resource management."},{"CreatedByName":"panarchist","CreatedById":63336,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-21T19:20:23Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 5/20/2016 at 10:07 AM, RoverDude said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Yup, they are compatible, feel free to mix and match ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E (Edit) Realized this was in the USI-LS thread.

The MM file in that mod for USI-LS is pretty standard, implementing Mulch\u002BFertilizer\u002BElectricCharge=Supplies, and the Recycler function.  Other than the recyclers being really efficient (75%), it doesn\u0027t look like there\u0027s anything in there which would be a game-breaker for those using both mods.\n\nUnlike a couple other mods I\u0027m using, like the DarkSideTechnologies Centrifuge, which is an awesome part but which has ridiculous amounts of Supplies listed in the incorporated MM config file.\n\nIf any other mod makers are reading this thread, and putting together a USI-LS MM file, I\u0027d strongly encourage you to look at RoverDude\u0027s existing OKS Kerbitat and OKS HabRing parts to see what values are in use before setting things like Supplies, Recycler Efficiency, or values like KerbalMonths in ModuleHabitation.  KBPS sets KerbalMonths=37.5 for the Central Hub, (which supports 6 Kerbals) and 13 for the Mk2 Habitat. (Which supports 4) - basically 6 months per Kerbal for the Central Hub and 3.25 months for the Mk2 Hab.
