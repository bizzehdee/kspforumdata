If you want to scan somewhat faster, launch one into a polar orbit, one between polar and 45 degrees and one between 45 degrees and equatorial. Switch to each in turn and crank up the time warp. Using various orbits like that overlaps to help fill in what each one misses and you can do some small plane adjustments to catch more missed spots rather than shifting the plane of a single satellite all over the place. For Minmus I just sent one satellite with one large scanner and a big fuel tank.

As far as config file changes go, whether through manual changes or ModuleManager script, I think Majiir would be pretty open-minded about that sort of thing so long as you\u0027re not redistributing original files. ModuleManager scripts should be the way to go anyway, it\u0027s a great tool for users as well as developers.

It accepts raw height data and builds a min/max table for each subdivision level, which is about a hundred times faster than the current method which builds a full-fledged collision mesh. Then it produces a list of candidate cells (shown in green) from a ray. The only requirement for these steps is that one of the candidate cells be the cell we\u0027re actually casting through, which is usually the case but there are a couple problem spots. I think I\u0027ve worked around those, but my fix involves a hand-tweaked value which only works if it\u0027s high enough and hurts performance if it\u0027s too high.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe last step is to check each of the triangles comprising the candidate cells and pick the cell with the nearest triangle intersection.
