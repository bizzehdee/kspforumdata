If you can arrange the tanks so that the booster tanks get emptied first, and have a configuration with liquid fuel engines in both the core and boosters firing at once, you can throttle back and drop the boosters after they\u0027re exhausted leaving the core engines with full tankage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: \u003Cstrong\u003E This isn\u0027t what\u0027s happening, as others have pointed out, just my puny core engines are not consuming much of the central tank before I stage, and mine\u0027s *not* cross-tanking for whatever reason. Sorry for the confusion\u003C/strong\u003E /EDIT\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI believe this is how Spacex intends to get extra payload out of the Falcon 9 Heavy when they get that going - having two Falcon 9s as boosters for a core Falcon 9, and cross-tanking to keep the centre one full until the boosters stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI used this principle and got an 18 minute burn for my core engines (7xSPS-10). The result was a pretty rocket which lofted a (Command \u002B 2 x FLS-100 \u002B K2-X) final stage to 4900 m/s. That final stage is good for about 9000\u002B m/s dV, so it was a satisfying launch. EDIT: \u003Cstrong\u003Ewell, that\u0027s what the rocket does; just not \u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ewhy\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve also spent a while trying to figure out what\u0027s wrong with the 3m to 5x1m and 3m to 7x 1m adapters. There seem to be two problems involved. The first is that when the rocket is placed on the pad, I\u0027d swear it gets dropped there. The forces involved with just standing there is often sufficient to break off one or more liquid engines, and results vary with the position of the spacecraft in the VAB. So when you launch, Bad Things happen. However, if you attach, say, some SRBs that extend lower so that the core engines don\u0027t take the weight, they\u0027re usually fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly, and more dangerously, the combination of high thrust and an adjacent heavy mass gives very large vibrations of the adapter relative to the tank it is attached to. e.g if you put on 5 or 7 M-50s (the largest single liquid engine) for thrust in the 2000 or 2800kN range, you get .5m\u002B oscillations. This usually breaks off an engine or three eventually, and certainly yields stability issues. I\u0027m wondering if there\u0027s a programmed-in vibration to these engines that\u0027s identical (ie: using the same RNG seed) and results in a compounded vibration when using multiple engines. Certainly it doesn\u0027t help that these monsters are directly stuck to the heaviest part of the rocket, so there\u0027s a tremendous amount of inertia to work against. It\u0027s not clear that there\u0027s any way to fix this through the part.cfg \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E Since running heavy, inefficient engines at part-throttle makes no sense, I\u0027ve tended toward using 7xSPS-10 on a couple of the new 5000 fuel 3m tanks. While not enough thrust to lift the stack at 10m/s/s from the pad, with prudent use of boosters to get them to higher altitudes and lower gravity, they are stable, work well and burn \u003Cem\u003Eforever.\u003C/em\u003E (At full thrust, almost 12 minutes!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, for those who haven\u0027t adjusted their part.cfg for the Aero Decouplers, do so!
