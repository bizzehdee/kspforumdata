So, as long as Squad doesn\u0027t make it impossible for the system to be modded (and I have to say, it is impressive how mod-friendly KSP seems to be!), I don\u0027t think this announcement may mean much for RT users.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd whether Squad credits the RT and Antenna Range devs or not, I personally am grateful for their continued development efforts. I refuse to launch a single unmanned mission without RT.
