Thanks\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t had any MAJOR trouble with the ascent autopilot - it sometimes overshoots the circularization burn, so I always keep an eye on that part of the launch... but otherwise, it does great. Things to watch out for - you must have \u0027control from here\u0027 set to a part that points towards the sky... if you\u0027re putting together a rocket that includes docking ports, probe cores, landers, etc. that face some direction other than \u0027rocket up\u0027 you need to verify before launch that the controls are being referenced from something that points the right way. You can tell easily by looking at the navball - if it\u0027s all sky before you launch, you\u0027re ready to go. If you see half ground or all ground, you need to right click a reaction wheel, docking port, or command pod that points the right way until you see all sky. If you don\u0027t, the autopilot will helpfully pitch you right over into the ground. Otherwise, if the rocket flies well - as in the loads are mostly straight over the centerline and there\u0027s not excessive wobble in between stages then mechjeb can launch it just fine. Does any of that help with your issue? Have you tried launching the rocket manually? Do you have any trouble controlling it at a certain point in flight?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe docking autopilot frequently makes strange decisions- the only situational awareness it\u0027s got comes from looking at the math... so it doesn\u0027t see things the same way a human does. With two small ships that have well layed out RCS thrusters, it will do just fine. If you\u0027re trying to do anything more complicated... it has to make guesses about what is where based on the vessel size and such... so it will assign a far-off starting point and safe distance... and even when it doesn\u0027t get confused it can waste a lot of rcs fuel getting lined up the way it wants to. Here\u0027s a better way to dock with mechjeb - \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. On the less maneuverable vessel, you can select \u0027control from here\u0027 at the docking port you want to use, set the docking port on the OTHER vessel as the target, and then turn on Smart A.S.S. and select \u0022Target \u002B\u0022. This will make the vessel you\u0027re going to dock to point their docking port at you. You don\u0027t have to do this step, if it\u0027s a big station or something that doesn\u0027t like to rotate - but then you have to work a LITTLE harder because you have to get lined up yourself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Switch back to the more maneuverable vessel. Target the docking port you\u0027re headed for. Select \u0027control from here\u0027 for the docking port on your vessel. Turn on Smart A.S.S. and select \u0027Parallel Minus.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Now one vessel is keeping the ports parallel and the other vessel is keeping them facing at each other. Switch the navball to target mode, if it isn\u0027t already.
