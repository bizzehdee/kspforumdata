However when you\u0027re on the surface, or in a chair, it is immediately counter-balanced by the strong and weak nuclear forces preventing your constituent elements from passing right through the chair. This is why you feel pressure in your behind while you\u0027re sitting. You are being accelerated downwards by gravity, however the ground counters that acceleration perfectly. As a result, you are pinned to your chair and not allowed to drift away from it at the slightest shift. It\u0027s important to remember that gravity and acceleration are intricately linked. If you remove all frames of references and I strap you to a rocket chair with a 1 G engine, you have no way of telling the difference between 1 G of gravity pulling you against that chair, or the engine firing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo wit, you have to realize that when starting on a surface, you are starting from a condition where you\u0027re already behind. Before you can begin accelerating UPWARDS away from the earth at a positive rate, you have to FIRST negate 9.8 meters per second of gravity-based acceleration. So, your TWR must meet, and then exceed the cost of neutralizing gravity. Especially important when you consider that the moment you leave the ground, the ground\u0027s physical counter-force to gravity no longer applies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETWR of 0 means no thrust. TWR between 0 and .99 means any upwards velocity you have will slowly be lost until you start falling again. TWR of 1 is a hover, and even the tiniest TWR of 1.0000000000000000000000000000000001 is a gain in velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo a TWR of 1 while still in contact with the surface means you\u0027re standing there, and you\u0027ve negated gravity, but without even a starting velocity, you\u0027re not moving. However, if holding a TWR of 1, even a stiff breeze could pick you up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, it may be semantics, but no, it really isn\u0027t. The Force of Gravity results in continuous acceleration. It exerts almost evenly across all physical objects in a defined system save for macro events like strong Tidal Forces or spaghettification of a black hole. Which is why you don\u0027t \u0027think\u0027 you\u0027re accelerating in a Zero-G situation such as orbit. However, you really are.
