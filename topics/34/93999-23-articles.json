It would fling the body well out of the SoI of the host star, which would be seriously immersion-breaking even if it worked (which I am not sure of, because I am just a player). Like, why is this planetoid still in orbit around a star whose SoI it has already left? Even if it never encountered another star\u0027s SoI (which it probably will at some point regardless of LAN), that\u0027s not a good idea IMHO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would also raise the question of where you\u0027d position that body along its orbit at game start. Real Sedna is currently approaching periapsis, but the last time it was in this position, humanity was still tying pointy rocks to sticks in preparation to go hunt mammoths. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E The next time it comes around, humanity as we know it will no longer exist - either wiped out by the Great Filter, or transcended into a civilization so advanced it will be beyond all comprehension to us today. In game terms, this body\u0027s orbital period will be so enormous that 99.9% of all players will never see it complete even a quarter of an orbit. So things like transfer windows lose meaning. The player who makes the choice to fly to the Sedna-alike will be forced to fly whenever he makes that decision, unless he wants to hit maximum timewarp and then walk away for an afternoon. Ergo, the position of this planetoid at game start directly defines the difficulty of sending a mission to it in nearly all cases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGiven that, it might be better to give the Sedna-alike a more sane orbit. Still highly eccentric, sure, but much closer to the sun, with an apoapsis still within the SoI, and an orbital period that doesn\u0027t laugh at attempts of timewarping.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptRobau","CreatedById":41695,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-29T16:47:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022_Augustus_\u0022 data-cite=\u0022_Augustus_\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI love this mod so much.

Once that\u0027s done we\u0027ll try to make existing dwarf planet Plock more interesting (can\u0027t wait what New Horizons will show us). Stock Eeloo is already barely visited by people, so making a dwarf planet like Eris or even crazier Sedna (Streetwind makes an excellent point why its orbit is undoable for KSP gameplay) would a lot of work for little return. After that I\u0027d rather do something like a 67P-like comet. That\u0027s a much more doable goal for most players and is also more interesting than Eris or Sedna (which have little of interest aside from their orbit).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aegrim","CreatedById":2155,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-29T17:56:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf i don\u0027t have the config to make AVP work with the outer planets, the game should still load right, just those planets will look wrong?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m trying to narrow down what\u0027s causing me problems.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"[email\u0026#160;protected]","CreatedById":80529,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-29T19:08:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESlate looks absolutely incredible...I almost want to ask you to do a pass over of all the stock planets and moons to bring them up to that level of quality...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aegrim","CreatedById":2155,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-29T19:33:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Etygoo7, i\u0027ve been slowly installing AVP one part at a time and seeing if it works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen i get to step 3 \u0022core mod\u0022 with no optional features, with your file I have zero clouds, without your file it looks like polands ball \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qyofUtw.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/qyofUtw.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the core mod is making the clouds go crazy, but your file is making them disappear completely.
