It isn\u0027t very readable anyway (especially in the clouds: light green on white... yeah). Can you overlay staging icons? Changing them in flight is possible, but RealChute (and the game itself) already does that, so there might be a conflict. Overlaying it with read cross/triangle/crossed circle or exclamation sign, if possible, would look much better.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course you can always suggest it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the answer is no, I\u0027m not removing it. It\u0027s there because people\u0027s chutes were failing and they had no idea why. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to not being readable, the chute messages aren\u0027t the first time DRE has displayed messages in that area and in that format and color. It\u0027s always displayed unsafe g-force warnings for crew, and there\u0027s been enough feedback about that to suggest that readability isn\u0027t an issue. Still, if it will make it MORE readable, I could look into changing the color. If that is possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do not know enough about the feasibility of altering the staging icons, especially from a 3rd party mod perspective. And as far as attracting the player\u0027s attention, it sounds insufficient to alert the player about unsafe chute opening conditions. Neither the stock game nor any mods (AFAIK) make use of such icon overlays and players would be unfamiliar as to their meaning. At least a message displayed at the upper half of the screen in plain English has the benefit of already being established by both stock KSP and DRE itself for displaying feedback messages to the player.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do thank you for your suggestion and your feedback however.

Less density means less heat transference.

Less density means less heat transference. The reason it came about though was because when changing density exponent (to shift start of heating to higher in the atmosphere) it resulted in extremely destructive heating lower in the atmosphere. Especially to supersonic planes and space planes. What I did not intend was for Hard mode to become a \u0027realism\u0027 mode, but it seems like that\u0027s sort of what happened. Well, at least when used with Real Solar System. I\u0027m probably going to have to rework \u0027Hard\u0027 mode to work properly with stock Kerbin. The jury is still out on that one. You should be careful with its use because it can really nerf things, especially if you\u0027re playing stock. I wouldn\u0027t enable it for Normal mode for instance, but, you know: Your sandbox, play how you like \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAwesome thanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MonkeyLunch","CreatedById":57799,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-16T22:22:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for giving us a 64bit version.
