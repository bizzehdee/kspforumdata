You probably have mod and/or version conflicts, and the possible combinations are too numerous to count.\n\nOk, that\u0027s not entirely true.  Start by not playing on the Steam download.  Always download from Steam and then copy that KSP directory to somewhere new and mod and play that version.  You\u0027re allowed as many copies of the KSP folder as you like; people often have separate game directories for different KSP versions, mod combinations, planet packs, and mod development.  Also, this way, when Steam releases an update, it doesn\u0027t overwrite your game.\n\nHave you installed or updated something recently after which you\u0027ve seen this behaviour?  If so, undo it.\n\nDo you really need to be running 1.8.1?  I can\u0027t tell because of the 160\u002B mods you\u0027re running.
