Problem is, in order to fill it up I need to land near the station which is occupied by a team of kerbals. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am going for minimal part count here, so an auxiliary set up would be redundant (may as well go with methane/LF \u0026amp; Ox in that case). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo.... since I need to turn off radiation safety in order to land, it kills my kerbals. Honestly it doesn\u0027t make any sense at all that radiation is not implemented and yet it is indeed working for one single engine, very frustrating and pointless IMO. So if someone could be a savior and explain to me how to disable this \u0027feature\u0027, I would be most appreciative!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S. I am well aware I could move the kerbals, thing is....what I really want to know is if I can just disable this feature from the vista engine. Browsing the dll file, seems like I may need to change \u0027GameConstants/public const double rad_const_h = 1000.0;\u0027 or perhaps something under \u0027VistaEngineController\u0027 in order to disable this, am I wrong?

It does this everytime you enter timewarp or activate the Alcubierre Drive... It freezes for a set time and by the time it finishes I am past my mark for deactivating warp.
