In other words, Altair is desgined for the Mun and has a structural capacity suited for that environment. The NOS lander has far greater structural loading capacity suited for Duna E, D, and L. Also it has nice snacks boxes, a wider platform and engines that are high from the ground to avoid kickup damage.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Just wanted to post my thanks\u0027 date=\u0027 love this mod and looking forward to the update![/quote\u0027]\n\u003E Thanks!
