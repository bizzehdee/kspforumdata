I started playing with KSO last week when I realized that KSO would fit nicely into making spaceflights cost effective in .24.2. Helldiver and Nazari, your mod\u0027s quality is stunning! It\u0027s clear that the two of you put a great deal of effort and thought into creating the shuttle system. Having multiple nodes on the KSO\u0027s engine block, for instance, really makes alternate configurations possible, and the cockpit of the KSO can easily be used as a command module for an interplanetary spaceship. I could easily see you making a version of the KSO that replaced the cockpit and cargo bay to make a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/2a/High_Confidence_Heavy_Lift_Launch_Vehicle_Diagram.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EShuttle-C\u003C/a\u003E type spacecraft.

The OKS/MKS system fits nicely inside, for instance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI rather like the space station components you made for the craft as well. Among other things, the station parts enable me to make a KSP version of Mars One from the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.amazon.com/The-Mars-One-Crew-Manual/dp/0345318811\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMars One Crew Manual\u003C/a\u003E by Kerry Mark Joels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have no videos to share, so here are a couple of screen grabs. First is Duna One, my analogue to the Mars One craft. The lander on the nose is a placeholder. The probe-sized airplanes aren\u0027t shown. While a few components like the core module and lander and propulsion system will have to be brought up with a conventional rocket, the rest will be launched via shuttle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LFidFpT.png\u0022 alt=\u0022LFidFpT.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the X-18. In my playthrough, KSP needed to test the S25\u0027s components and validate the whole shuttle concept. Hence, they built a smaller version of the S25, the X-18. And in order to cut launch costs, engineers built modules small enough to fit into the X-18\u0027s payload bay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mNgvlvr.png\u0022 alt=\u0022mNgvlvr.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, some fan fiction. I\u0027m writing a story as I play career mode in .24.2:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill looked past the gantry and marveled at the brand new spacecraft residing in High Bay 4. Unlike the Kapollo capsule that took Jeb, Bob, and himself to Kerbin\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s moons, this new bird did the avian name proud; it had wings. Perched on its external fuel tank like a woodpecker clinging to a tree and rivaling the size of an airliner, the X-18 Freedom looked part rocket and part airplane. It had a pug nose that hid a small docking port, a cockpit and crew deck that seated six- though quarters were tight- a sizeable payload bay, a graceful double-delta swept wing, and a single vertical rudder that the engineers wanted to double. An array of engines sprouted from her tail, ranging from a mini turbojet to orbital maneuvering engines, and she even had a pair of brand new Thrustmax main engines. All this new technology amounted to a vehicle that could make many trips into space, unlike Kapollo\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s one and done approach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA veteran of a half-dozen spaceflights including two Pioneer missions and four Kapollo flights (three of them included walks on the Mun and Minmus), Bill saw potential in this technology demonstrator. Current boosters like the Duna II and the Duna IV Heavy took weeks to build, only to throw away all their hardware after one mission. Only the Mk1-2 Kapollo command capsule returned. With Kerbal Space Program forced to continue to rely upon contracts to get funding, each mission\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s cost quickly added up. Kapollo 6, for instance cost just north of 240,000 in funds for the D4H booster, Kapollo command module, and MK II ALCOR lander. A simpler Kapollo mission to Starlab set the space agency back sixty grand. With the Kerbal Shuttle Orbiter (KSO) program, launch costs and time between launches could easily be cut in half. And if KSC recovered the boosters and external fuel tank that the orbiter clung to, then they could recoup nearly all of the launch vehicle costs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFreedom actually cost more than a Kapollo/Duna II launch and was a little underpowered, but she was a prototype, after all. Her Thrustmax 300s were designed to fit the jumbo-sized S25 in development, as were her OA-900 liquid rocket boosters, and thus weren\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t optimized for the X-18. But given enough development time, appropriately sized boosters and a remodeled tail section, the X-18 would make a cost effective launch vehicle. The problem is, KSP didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t have the time right now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe President wanted kerbonauts on Duna soonest before the Eastern Bloc or the Babylon Corporation or some other billionaire\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s private space agency got the chance. While some use of the Duna series of launch vehicles was inevitable, the gold-plated version of Duna One, based on Starlab, would require its components to fly on the D4H and that would break the bank. With the S25 still on the drawing board, Duna One\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s components had to fit inside the X-18 whenever possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s engineers envisioned a line of 1.8-meter diameter octagonal modules as a compromise between converting 1.25-meter fuel tanks into living space and using the 2.5-meter Starlab modules that were too big for the X-18. But to get them into orbit on the X-18, engineers had to add an auxiliary fuel module in the shuttle\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s payload bay as well as bolt on auxiliary fuel tanks to the external fuel tank.

I started playing with KSO last week when I realized that KSO would fit nicely into making spaceflights cost effective in .24.2. Helldiver and Nazari, your mod\u0027s quality is stunning! It\u0027s clear that the two of you put a great deal of effort and thought into creating the shuttle system. Having multiple nodes on the KSO\u0027s engine block, for instance, really makes alternate configurations possible, and the cockpit of the KSO can easily be used as a command module for an interplanetary spaceship. I could easily see you making a version of the KSO that replaced the cockpit and cargo bay to make a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/2a/High_Confidence_Heavy_Lift_Launch_Vehicle_Diagram.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EShuttle-C\u003C/a\u003E type spacecraft.

I don\u0027t believe it really has ever been (as far back as when I started the first 1.8 Standard shuttle). Squad\u0027s goal are generic, sterile, standalone parts (think Legos).
