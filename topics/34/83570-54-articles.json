When it gets stuck KSP (32 Bit version) consumes 1,37 GB out of the ~3,7 it could adress, so there shouldn\u0027t be a reasonable memory problem. Before that i tried loading the 64 Bit version and it got stuck aswell (same step, cockpits of B9) and it could adress 8 GB in that version, so memory shouldn\u0027t be a problem at all. I worked with cutting out parts in the past, where there was no ATM and stuffs, but stopped doing that because oddly enough KSP 64 Bit worked perfectly fine for me in 0.24. So I just used ATM and 64 Bit and it went well with around 25 installed Mods (B9, Novapunch and KW included) and 3,2 GB of RAM used after the initial loading.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would like to upload the output_log, but at the moment I\u0027m just to stupid to find out how to upload it unto this post.

Other then that the part isn\u0027t mentioned anywhere else in the log. Searching for any \u0022memory\u0022 relations didn\u0027t work either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit2: Ok 3rd test revealed, that it seems to not be related to B9 (or at least not exclusively).
