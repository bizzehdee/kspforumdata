The pattern continues in such a way that I need to click the next button twice to get the tank to actually switch.  \n\nWhat is interesting is that when scrolling through the content settings on one of the tanks which was placed by the symmetry,  you still have to click the next button twice to get the tank to actually change contents, but the contents setting bar itself has two entries for every chemical. so, starting on the far left at liquid ammonia, clicking the next button, the tank stays on ammonia, and the selector bar moves over just a little bit to another NH3 entry. then, clicking next brings you to argon, same thing, two entries in the selector bar. On these secondary tanks(that were placed by symmetry) the tank contents always corresponds to what the selector bar says, unlike the one tank I place. in both cases, you have to click next twice to get to the next chemical actually in the tank.  \n\nI hope this description is enough to point you in the right direction and get this fixed."},{"CreatedByName":"FreeThinker","CreatedById":117389,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-29T21:52:19Z","Content":"## \nDownload version 3.6.10 \u003Csmall\u003Efor Kerbal Space Program 1.4.5 from \u003C/small\u003E[here](https://kerbal.curseforge.com/projects/interstellar-fuel-switch/files/2622290/download)\n\n\u003Csmall\u003EReleased on 2018-09-29\u003C/small\u003E\n\n- Added Liquid Hydrogen LqdFuorine mix to Dual Tank configurations\n- Added missing Cryostats\n- Removed empty files\n- Fixed loss of LqdArgon on Big Sphere Tank\n- Fixed issue of exploding tanks during first 20 seconds after using engines\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-10-03T14:04:12Z\u0022 title=\u002210/03/2018 02:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 3, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by FreeThinker**"},{"CreatedByName":"FreeThinker","CreatedById":117389,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-10-03T15:36:46Z","Content":"## \nDownload Version 3.6.11 \u003Csmall\u003Efor Kerbal Space Program 1.4.5 from \u003C/small\u003E[here](https://kerbal.curseforge.com/projects/interstellar-fuel-switch/files/2623882/download)\n\n\u003Csmall\u003EReleased on 2018-10-03\u003C/small\u003E\n\n- Compiled against KSP 1.4.5\n- Added Fields which display current resource conversion rate\n- Fixed instability Resource conversions\n- removed some empty files"},{"CreatedByName":"ss8913","CreatedById":94747,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-10-06T06:28:10Z","Content":"[@FreeThinker](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/117389-freethinker/) I\u0027m using 3.6.11... having some serious problems with the IFS Cryogenic tanks.. the CT-2503 in particular, may affect others(?)  \n\nAnyway, I have a test craft using lightbulb engines and diborane.
