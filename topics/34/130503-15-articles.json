I was going to use the thrust limiter (and eventually, have a mod like TCA do it automatically), but I noticed if I reduced the thrust limiter, the engine quickly overheated and shut down. After looking at the stats, I realized I was never going to be able to add enough heat sinks to overcome the lack of thrust venting for keeping the reactors cool, but now I\u0027m stuck. Is there some way to reduce the reactor heat output as you reduce the throttle limit? I tried lowering the power setting and it didn\u0027t seem to make any difference. I drop the throttle limit by just a couple percent and the engine does an over-heat shutdown.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs this designed to be an all or nothing design, or is there a way to get thrust limiting working?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: In thinking about this and the design of gas core reactors, it stands to reason the reactor runs at a certain temperature to get the efficiency needed. Thus, it requires a certain amount of exhaust to maintain that temperature without getting too hot. This implies if you want to lower the thrust, you also probably need to lower the core temperature in general, which means the engine runs less efficient.

I was going to use the thrust limiter (and eventually, have a mod like TCA do it automatically), but I noticed if I reduced the thrust limiter, the engine quickly overheated and shut down. After looking at the stats, I realized I was never going to be able to add enough heat sinks to overcome the lack of thrust venting for keeping the reactors cool, but now I\u0027m stuck. Is there some way to reduce the reactor heat output as you reduce the throttle limit? I tried lowering the power setting and it didn\u0027t seem to make any difference.

It looks like reactor power setting can be overridden in engine reactors by the vessel global throttle, so if you are running the vessel throttle at 100% but manually setting power to 50%, it\u0027ll still run the reactor at 100%. It doesn\u0027t take engine thrust limiting into account, which it should - running the vessel throttle at 100% with a thrust limiter of 70% going on should automatically give you a reactor power of 70%.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Temeter","CreatedById":58056,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-27T02:38:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHey, Nertea: Your 1.25m nuclear engines have bugged plumes (nerva patch, stubber, smaller trimodal engine), the internal plume trail is at 45 degree.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNoticed it ingame and then just checked everything in my clean install:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022rc8xNaB.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rc8xNaB.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso btw, those cryogenic plumes look awesome in movement!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nertea","CreatedById":83952,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-27T02:52:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222825387\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022130503\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221477535880\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002258056\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Temeter\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n14 minutes ago, Temeter said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHey, Nertea: Your 1.25m nuclear engines have bugged plumes (nerva patch, stubber, smaller trimodal engine), the internal plume trail is at 45 degree.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNoticed it ingame and then just checked everything in my clean install:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso btw, those cryogenic plumes look awesome in movement!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWeird, I\u0027ll ensure that\u0027s fixed in tomorrow\u0027s update.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nertea","CreatedById":83952,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-27T19:25:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUpdate 0.3.2 with many fixes\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul style=\u0022color:rgb(39,42,52);font-family:\u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:normal;letter-spacing:normal;line-height:22.4px;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nUpdated CRP to 6.0.1\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nFixed exceptions in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E when using a ZBO tank for holding only non-cryo fuels\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nFixed incorrect dry masses for ZBO tanks\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nImproved NFE compatibility for Emancipator engine\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nFixed plume offset for 1.25m engines\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AmpCat","CreatedById":168141,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-27T22:20:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/83952-nertea/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002283952\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/83952-nertea/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Nertea\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0I don\u0027t suppose this will address the thrust limit issue?

This means in normal rocket flight, once I\u0027ve got enough velocity to reach the altitude I want, I shut the engines off, then circularize the orbit. Only now, when I kill the throttle, the engine dies. This means to get thrust again I have to go full throttle, then go back and turn the reactor back on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s complicated further using reactors for power. The high heat causing the engine to shut down also shuts down reactors. You can\u0027t keep enough thermal management (without running exhaust) to turn the reactor back on, and your ship runs out of electricity, which means now you can\u0027t control the throttle if you\u0027re on drone control. This gets you into a catch-22 where you\u0027re dead in space.

I\u0027ve tried this with several of the KA engines, with similar results.

So you can set the reactor\u0027s throttle to 5% or something, then ramp up the ship throttle to 100% - that\u0027ll automatically set the reactor throttle to 100%. When you\u0027re done, you can kill throttle and the reactor throttle will automatically scale back to 5%.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can also increase the emergency shutdown temperature to give you more buffer. A reactor will only start taking damage once it\u0027s above the Critical Temperature, which is usually 5-15% higher than the nominal temperature (shown in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, for the emancipator it\u0027s 2000 K higher). You can safely increase the cutoff until that to give more flexibility (this will also net you a higher Isp)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdditionally, you\u0027re choosing probably the hardest reactor to work with :P. It has a heat generation of 1.12 GW! That means it heats up very fast (will probably address that in the next update, it should have more thermal inertia) and can\u0027t really be passively cooled by radiators. Even at 1% throttle you\u0027d need 3-4 of the largest HC radiators. The other engines are far more forgiving in their heating rate and capacity to be cooled by a radiator part.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re using reactors for power, there is a specific power setting that gets you max power with the engine. For the Nepture (1.25m) it\u0027s... 65 kW. So set the reactor throttle to something that gives you around 65 kW of heat (1-2% normally). That amount of heat is auto-handled by the built-in radiator. For the Poseidon\u00A0(2.5m) it\u0027s 800 kW, also handled by the radiator.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s good to have feedback though, this patch has always been pretty experimental.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AmpCat","CreatedById":168141,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-30T01:40:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the explanation. It seemed a bit odd that the engine was almost unusable. I figured I was doing something wrong. That being said, it\u0027s probably helpful if it worked \u0027out of the box\u0027 so to speak, without fiddling.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI ran a lot more testing today, starting with the lower temperature engines. It seems that if I just start out at launch setting the reactor to 0%, then firing up the engines, it performs perfectly fine. I can throttle the engine as I want, it quickly reaches operating temperature, I can shut it off and turn it back on with no issues with the reactor overheating.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem starts to come back, however, when you add another reactor in the mix. Adding something like the \u0027KerbPower\u0027 fission generator in, and if it\u0027s running, it will create enough heat to bump the Poseidon or whichever engine over the threshold, causing a shutdown. As you pointed out, bumping the shutdown threshold up a little seemed to help, and for some reason I can\u0027t explain, doing so didn\u0027t seem to cause the engine to actually run that hot on its own, at least with the reactor set to 0%. I think I noticed something saying \u0027Actual: 10%\u0027 in the KA control panel. So, not sure if there\u0027s some other temperature regulation going on there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also may not have been clear in my last post when referring to using reactors for power. I was adding a stand-alone reactor, like the KerbPower.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll this being said, a few points:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nWhat\u0027s the point of running at anything but 0% reactor power? Only seems to affect temperature if the thrust is set to 0, but as soon as thrust is applied, the engine warms up fast anyway.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWhile I love the neat modeling of engine dynamics, I\u0027m also a fan of \u0027It just works\u0027. I think some tweaking of standard settings is in order so that the engines work fine as is when installed and the rocket launches. I presume you\u0027re working on this for future patches, but I thought it worth noting.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI\u0027m still a little confused on how the temperature is working for these. Maybe I need to do some more testing, but it seemed to be that even though I set the reactor safeties at 6200K on the last run with the Emancipator, to try and get around the second reactor problem, the engine would still keep itself at 6000K, until I shut the throttle off. At that point it would slowly creep up a little as the \u003Cem\u003Eother \u003C/em\u003Ereactor was adding heat to the mix. It would only go down if I turned the other reactor off. This was while having 200kW\u00A0of active radiators mounted on the ship as well. Should have been more than enough for the little KerbPower.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI think if you ran multiple engines (my SSTOs are often quad Liberators.. soon to be Emancipators!) this thermal issue would get exacerbated. Not to mention to trickiness of managing the reactor online state of 4 reactors at once. Have to put it into an action group.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nEdit: Another quirk is that if you\u0027re at 100% thrust, reactor at 0%, there\u0027s a note that says \u0027Effective: 100%\u0027. I presume that means reactor output is tied to the throttle. So if I run out of fuel and flame out, reactor is still at 100%, so it shuts all the reactors on the vessel down\u00A0(including my power reactors) as it quickly overheats.

Maybe I need to do some more testing, but it seemed to be that even though I set the reactor safeties at 6200K on the last run with the Emancipator, to try and get around the second reactor problem, the engine would still keep itself at 6000K, until I shut the throttle off. At that point it would slowly creep up a little as the \u003Cem\u003Eother \u003C/em\u003Ereactor was adding heat to the mix. It would only go down if I turned the other reactor off. This was while having 200kW\u00A0of active radiators mounted on the ship as well.
