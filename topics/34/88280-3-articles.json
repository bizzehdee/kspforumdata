I agree. However, from their language they seem to assume that CC doesn\u0027t have any problems. This is simply not the case.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECC automatically assumes that all future versions of KSP are incompatible, and even after compatibility has been confirmed, the only (non-controversial) way to remove the incompatibility pop-up is to rebuild a new version. Some modders automatically rebuild for new KSP versions (including patch versions, like we had with 0.24), many others don\u0027t. I\u0027ve got a number of CC pop-ups in my 0.25 install right now, and one of them is from a mod where the author has said it\u0027s 0.25-compatible but doesn\u0027t want to put out a new release. (The rest are abandoned, where you could argue that the current behavior is what\u0027s desired, but it\u0027s still very annoying.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaking a fork of CC won\u0027t solve the false alarm problem because -- as ferram4 pointed out -- there is no \u0022standard\u0022 version that everybody uses, and no one responsible for maintaining it. Which means there\u0027s no way to encourage CC-using mods to incorporate patches. Which means they\u0027ll all produce false alarms, even if your particular mod with your particular fork of CC has fixed the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo give Katharr credit, they\u0027re trying to solve this problem in a way that doesn\u0027t require modders to change their code, albeit in a very ham-fisted manner. But calling it \u0022sabotage\u0022 is unfair. They\u0027re trying to fix a bug, and introducing a different bug in the process.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA better approach would be to use a more flexible, and actively maintained, compatibility checker. KSP-AVC (and mini-AVC, which I don\u0027t use myself but would probably appeal to the CC crowd) does this by checking an online file to decide whether you have compatibility. Updating compatibility information requires minimal effort on the modder\u0027s part: changing a few characters in one text file, with no new releases required. You can do it even if you don\u0027t have time to code. I haven\u0027t tried CKAN yet, but I assume it also lets modders declare which KSP versions are and are not compatible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETL;DR\u003C/strong\u003E While you may disagree with Katharr\u0027s approach (heck, the posts on this thread have convinced me that\u0027s it\u0027s not good), they \u003Cem\u003Eare\u003C/em\u003E trying to solve a real problem.
