There are various work arounds you can try but no perfect fix as of yet.\n\nWorkaround for reference:\n\n- Go to GameData\\Squad\\Contracts\\Contracts.cfg\n\n- Backup a copy of the file just in case\n\n- Under the \u0022Survey\u0022 contract type, find the following block of entries:\n\nTrivialHomeNearbyRange = 2000\n\nSignificantHomeNearbyRange = 4000\n\nExceptionalHomeNearbyRange = 6000\n\nYou can set these to almost anything you like. For KScale2 to stop crashing, they all need to be above at least 5000. When I played career, I set 5000, 6500 and 8000.\n\nThe result of this workaround is that all Survey contracts on Kerbin generate very far away from KSC - probably farther away than is practical for reaching with a plane, especially since the planet is now larger. This is unfortunate, but it\u0027s required. Any smaller numbers, and you might crash because the contract subsystem cannot find eligible land to place survey waypoints on (as absurd as it sounds).\n\nAnother fix, of course, is to delete (or comment out) the entire Survey contract, if you don\u0027t care for them in the first place. Or use a contract configuration mod (there are several that can do it) to specify that you don\u0027t want Survey contracts to generate.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E hey, I installed this mod and the rotational period for kerbin seems to be just under six hours, is this right?\n\nKerbin\u0027s day/night cycle is the same as stock: exactly 6 hours (sidereal may vary). This has the interesting side effect that the equator moves a lot faster than on stock Kerbin, and you get a lot more boost for launching eastward. The main result of this that it becomes a lot harder to launch in other directions, especially westwards into a retrograde orbit. You need a huge amount of extra dV for that. Somewhere between 800 and 1000 m/s more, beause equatorial speed is somewhere over 400 m/s. It\u0027s quite life-like, all told.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E One bug I\u0027ve noticed is that the distance from KSC is wrong when recovering vehicles. It is about 940 km, when just outside KSC.\n\nThat\u0027s an old bug that Kopernicus has already fixed, but KScale2 still ships a very old version of Kopernicus that still has it. You can try manually updating Kopernicus. It worked for me with a 0.2x version, but admittedly they\u0027re already at 0.3 now, so who knows.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-23T20:47:24Z\u0022 title=\u002208/23/2015 08:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind**"},{"CreatedByName":"Wercho","CreatedById":57663,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-23T22:37:22Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E That\u0027s an old bug that Kopernicus has already fixed, but KScale2 still ships a very old version of Kopernicus that still has it.
