A key problem with designing a real engine for use at high velocity through an atmosphere is that you need to slow-down the air coming through the intake so that it can actually be passed through a compressor/combustion chamber. If you had it going through at full speed it would easily damage the engine. The problem then is dissipating the kinetic energy of the air. Laws of thermodynamics do their annoying \u0022can\u0027t destroy energy\u0022 bit and by slowing down the air quickly (a lot of change in speed in a short time), it emits a lot of thermal energy. The effect is not dissimilar to reentry heating. Both are all about the compression of air, not friction (as some people erroneously may think).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you have the air slowed it\u0027s really hot, and needs to be cooled. That\u0027s where the precooler comes in. It\u0027s really just a super-effective heat exchanger, constantly pulling thermal energy out of the airflow to the engine itself. In KSPI, this means putting a precooler part (either the modified stock part or the two B9 engine bodies that are modified by KSPI to be precoolers) \u003Cstrong\u003Edirectly behind the air intake\u003C/strong\u003E. If they are anywhere else they won\u0027t work. Kinda an annoying mechanic, since sometimes (quite often in fact) it\u0027s far more preferable to be able to put precoolers in front of the engines themselves, for design purposes, like using smaller radial intakes. This won\u0027t work, unfortunately. You can see if precoolers are working in-flight by right clicking them. They will read as either active or inactive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically all it comes down to is always put a precooler right after the intake. If you don\u0027t, you\u0027ll get a fairly significant amount of overheating as you increase in speed. The reason that this causes engines to explode during reentry is because you\u0027re passing through the atmosphere are orbital or near-orbital velocities.
