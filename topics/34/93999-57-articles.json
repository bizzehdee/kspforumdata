This Neidon moon will have a thin atmosphere and will be based mostly on Triton.

If you ask me it is a superior mod and the developer of Karbonite is working on the new resource system to be released in version 1.0 for KSP so it may be more intuitive. However, if there is Karbonite added to the bodies, there is likely to be Kethane.
