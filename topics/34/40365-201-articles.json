I then did another test, launched KSP in 32-bit mode again, went into the settings and adjusted them rather massively downwards - specifically I adjusted the texture res down to the lowest level (1/8th), exited and relaunched 64-bit:cool: and suddenly - it loaded just fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suspect that means this is not a bug in your code at all - it just means that if you are running KSP on a 64-bit linux like I am you really should invest in more than 4Gb of RAM before running interstellar \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said - if anybody else runs into the same issue - the solution is to scale down texture resolution.
