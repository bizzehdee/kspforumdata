I\u0027m not going to include it in any form into this mod, but I can\u0027t (and won\u0027t) stop others from using it if they choose to. As a matter of fact, the reason I called waste water simply a water is to allow mining it using other mods. As for food, there is no standard definition of what food is, so after a lengthy discussion with BobCat we have chosen to have 1 unit of food being equal to one meal, which is 0.3 kg. Water has RL density of 1000 kg/m^3.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. The cornerstone for my mod is that it works at all times on all vessels, which to me is an absolute hard requirement for any LS mod. But apparently others have different opinion on subject. Adding per-kerbal resource consumption (instead of per-vessel) in ECLSS 2.0 is the next step towards increased fidelity. Right now in ECLSS 2.0 if I recover a kerbal that just had a meal and then immediately after launch him again, he won\u0027t magically become hungry, so that kerbal\u0027s status is carried over with him no matter what he does. There are some other small things that I\u0027d prefer not to reveal at this point. Hopefully these little things coupled together will provide for much deeper experience that any other LS mod ever could.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, all these things require ample amount of time for both development and testing, and I prefer to iron out as much bugs as possible before releasing it to the public - because I don\u0027t want their experience hurdled by many bugs. Of course no matter how hard will we try to test it, there will always be bugs that will make it to the public release, but I\u0027m doing my best to reduce their amount.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Camelotking524","CreatedById":58776,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-08T22:39:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022asmi\u0022 data-cite=\u0022asmi\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Esnip\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I, thank you for your work.
