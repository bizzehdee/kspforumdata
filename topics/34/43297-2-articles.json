This newest version contains a fix for IVA mode (in the cockpit). The right click context menu didn\u0027t work, since right click toggles mouse control in IVA. Now when in IVA, the context menu can be activated by a left click on the vessel name instead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also fixed the rename feature. Apparently the new name does not stick unless the vessel is currently loaded in game. This appears to be within a few km but if anyone has more specifics please let me know. With this update the option will be disabled if the vessel is not currently loaded, so to enable it just get close.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, as an added little bonus, I added a quick way to toggle multiple filter icons. Simply right click one icon, then left click another and it will affect all icons in between. Might take a bit to get the hang of and hopefully people don\u0027t do it by accident, but it can be really convenient.
