Remember that your velocity vector and magnitude (speed) remain constant in that version. The biggest hurdle to think about is how to alter the direction of your velocity vector. That\u0027s where the drop to the sun jump is nice. You can change your velocity very quickly in a predictable way by falling at the sun, the closer you are the faster it happens. Timing is critical though as you need to have the velocity vector direction and magnitude correct. So Jool is something like 4000 m/s around Kerbol, so you want your orbital velocity about 4000, and you want to be traveling in the same direction Jool is at that place in its orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf using the Angular Momentum version, the simplest way I\u0027ve found is to warp to your target planet and set your periapsis as low as you can, then keep warping back to that periapsis.

Apparently to move the ship the current vessel position is taken and then krakensbane is moved to a new position based on old vessel position and and a jump distance based on the warpdrive operation. If this is working in a kerbol relative coordinate system wouldn\u0027t it be enough to just add the speed (multiplied by physics step) of the object I currently orbit to the ps vector in line 314? I guess if I am within the SOI of a moon this would actually be needed to be applied recursive to apply the speed of the planet too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing I actually really like about this warp drive is the ability to make small precise course correction and directly see the new orbit (compared to the one from KSPI (last used version: KSPInterstellar-v0.11)), so enforcing a minimal throttle setting really does not sound appealing for me. Unfortunate without further guidance hints its very hard once the relative speed is low and the dirty old tricks like gravity adjusting extremely close to the sun and via extreme but precise (mechjeb landing guidline information) aerobrake maneuvers do no longer work because in both cases the ship is converted into a fiery ball of molten plasma :-), so precise control is more important than ever.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T17:51:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Donziboy2\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Donziboy2\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EForgive me Roverdude for I have sinned.......\u003Cp\u003EEL has some dissadvantages.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECash Drop pod...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1Eo3Zbg.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/1Eo3Zbg.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStaged ok..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lOW4GPi.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/lOW4GPi.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlmost died when it fell over...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7wZxg4L.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/7wZxg4L.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Sound of Cash Register\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Hz81pZP.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/Hz81pZP.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIm thinking the cost for the 0.625m Drive is a little high \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, that\u0027s more of an EL issue as it treats 1 ton of a fuel tank the same as 1 ton of highly specialized components.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Donziboy2","CreatedById":74984,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T18:31:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RoverDude\u0022 data-cite=\u0022RoverDude\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EUnfortunately, that\u0027s more of an EL issue as it treats 1 ton of a fuel tank the same as 1 ton of highly specialized components.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould it be possible to add the cost to Exotic matter and Reduce the cost of the drive itself, allow us to add EM in VAB but have EL treat it like most fuels that cannot be created from nothingness like Exotic Matter is treated ATM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr would some of that change need to be on EL\u0027s side?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-11T18:35:03Z\u0022 title=\u002206/11/2015 06:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Donziboy2\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"goldenpsp","CreatedById":113874,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T18:36:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Donziboy2\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Donziboy2\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWould it be possible to add the cost to Exotic matter and Reduce the cost of the drive itself, allow us to add EM in VAB but have EL treat it like most fuels that cannot be created from nothingness like Exotic Matter is treated ATM.\u003Cp\u003EOr would some of that change need to be on EL\u0027s side?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESide issue then is just launch empty and turn on exotic matter generation in space.
