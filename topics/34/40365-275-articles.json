You\u0027ll see that I named each of my impactors with a unique name. I only did this so that I would know which one to focus next, since they were spaced pretty closely together, but it could be that this is required. This is corroborated by another recent post, so we should explicitly test this. I won\u0027t be able to do it until this evening after work, but perhaps someone else would like to give it a try.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe easiest way to do it would be in a game where no impact events have been done on Kerbin. Make a little craft in the SPH with a seismic detector and launch it. Might want to give it wheels so that you can roll it off of the runway; we all know that the ISRU doesn\u0027t work if it\u0027s on top of a model such as the runway. Then make a craft in the VAB, which consists of the following parts, from top to bottom: probe core, solid booster, decoupler, probe core, solid booster. Set the staging so that the decoupler and the top booster fire first, so that you can launch this one half at a time. Launch the first one and crash it nearby, then copy the WarpPlugin.cfg for later inspection. Then launch the other half and do the same. We can now see whether the craft name is relevant; if the WarpPlugin.cfg has only one event then it\u0027s likely. If you repeat the experiment but rename the second half of the craft before crashing it and you get two events, then I\u0027d say it\u0027s nearly certain.
