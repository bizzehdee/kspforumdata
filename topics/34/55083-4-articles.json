Someday I\u0027ll be done with this and can finally play again. All I\u0027ve played since August is a little Skyrim and GTA5.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERAM-wise, KSP takes up a little over 2.8GB when I first load it up. After changing scenes and working with TreeEdit for a little while, RAM commit size is now 3.246 GB, with a working RAM set of 2.733 GB. HDD space is 3.24GB. I\u0027d say I\u0027m not at the point of deleting textures yet, but if I add any more big mods, like BobCat\u0027s historic rockets like I have been wanting to, I may have to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe texture reducer is a great mod, for sure. Since adding 16 more parts mods, my RAM footprint has been constant. Another thing to keep in mind, is that I have graphics all the way down, so it may run, but it definitely looks like schei\u00C3\u0192\u00C5\u00B8e.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is similar to what I had in mind. I was going see if taking all the parts off the tree, and making one big ModuleManager cfg file to place all the parts would help with rendering the tree in TreeLoader, because when I try to load the tree with only a few mods and no TreeEdit, like Xat was doing back when, connections between some nodes were being ignored, but when I loaded with all 38 mods and no TreeEdit, all connections were there. So I\u0027m thinking, if all nodes are empty, and ModuleManager is changing the requiredTech field for every part I have installed, TreeLoader will be able to include all connections, and fill in the parts according to their required tech, rather than what tree.cfg says.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis shouldn\u0027t be too hard, all I would have to do is delete everything from tree.cfg that isn\u0027t a part name, or the node name, and use Excel to concatenate those informations with @part() etc. Only after I get the next revision finished though, still working on a new structure to try and eliminate as many connection crossings as possible.. they bother me to no end, but I do not have a choice most times, I think.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck with your \u0022lessons\u0022, \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ackander","CreatedById":90879,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-10T15:36:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf anyone has any suggestions for science cost gradients, I\u0027d like to here them.

Hope to be able to make it clear enough, however. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn most \u0022strategy\u0022 games, the game designer puts some sort of \u0022elastic ribbon\u0022 mechanic, to allow players with different styles of play to use different strategies but without getting too far from the \u0022correct path\u0022 or the game may get to absurd values.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe same concept should be applied with KSP career mode. If it isn\u0027t there already, it is because Squad has not developed the mode enough to have to calibrate it correctly, therefore no such mechanic exists.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever you are going to fill this gap, so you need something. In general, any \u0022elastic ribbon\u0022 will be conceived so as to exchange one resources with another (both resources being needed to proceed). In KSP I can actually devise 3 basic \u0022resources\u0022: science (of course), time, and money (not yet really implemented). Using time and science, you could allow the tech tree to cost less with passing time. Very experienced players may be very good at researching new techs, and do so in a very short time: but then subsequent steps in the tech tree will cost more than usual. On the contrary, beginners may take more time, but the cost of each new tech will decrease thus allowing to get eventually to that without too much further effort. In case one gets stuck due to no more research available, eventually the tech tree will diminish in cost to the point that one new tech will become available without taking more science.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stone Blue","CreatedById":77721,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-10T17:09:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ackander\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Ackander\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ETo be honest, I mostly used mod popularity on SpacePort to determine what mods I sorted into the TechTree.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThats a problem right there, since Spaceport basically sux and there are lots of great new mods that people arent bothering to put on Spaceport....lol\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a list of just over 250 mods with forum/spaceport links if you want to take a look at it to see if there are any you want to add...Just PM me if you want it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the very least, it might make finding a mod someone requests, easier...Since it has the forum/Spaceport links you can just click once and you got it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-10T17:23:39Z\u0022 title=\u002212/10/2013 05:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 10, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Stone Blue\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ackander","CreatedById":90879,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-10T18:26:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Stone Blue\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Stone Blue\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThats a problem right there, since Spaceport basically sux and there are lots of great new mods that people arent bothering to put on Spaceport....lol\u003Cp\u003EI have a list of just over 250 mods with forum/spaceport links if you want to take a look at it to see if there are any you want to add...Just PM me if you want it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the very least, it might make finding a mod someone requests, easier...Since it has the forum/Spaceport links you can just click once and you got it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will just disagree about it sucking.
