Around this point, the vehicle begins to buffet around on the roll axis violently and seems more related to altitude than velocity. Around 18 km, the buffeting suddenly turns extremely violent and it gets kicked right out of its stable flight envelope almost every time (rolls over, sideslips, leaves a stable AoA and goes into a falling leaf spin)... Once that occurs, well, you know how that ends.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m unsure what the symptoms are telling me about the vehicle, so I\u0027m not certain what design changes I need to make.

Something that overlays semi-transparent shock cones over the vehicle or something when you check the box and run a static check. That way people can determine what parts are effected by sonic cones and take the measures needed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
