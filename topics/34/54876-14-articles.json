If the green bar gets down to 150/1100 and I turn on a 300EC battery then the green bar should jump to 450/1400 and the blue bar should change to 200/200. Also, it should work on a single stage craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.blade-edge.com/images/forums/ksp/ARPimg3.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.blade-edge.com/images/forums/ksp/t_ARPimg3.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022t_ARPimg3.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrent blue bar makes me do the math to figure out how much spare battery I have inactive (20EC).

When they are staged and have a separate blue bar, the values won\u0027t fit in correctly. Is there anything that can be done about this - could they be standardized when the text won\u0027t fit (as in 1,100,000 becomes 1.1M or 1100K)? Example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWasteHeat, stick 12 or so huge radiators on a ship from the Interstellar mod and the numbers are quickly in the hundred-millions. Something like \u00221.53M / 126.0M\u0022 to replace \u00221534225 / 126025000\u0022 would likely allow the text to fit, and for staged (green/blue split) resources too. When the bars are full, at higher values precision is less important to me, if I hit 125M / 126M I need to solve my heat issue, I won\u0027t gain anything for waiting to get to 125,999,999.9 \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously this is only my opinion, so see what others think, maybe have it as an option that can be turned on/off?
