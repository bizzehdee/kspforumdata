In order to separate the fairing halves/thirds rather than the base you need to locate those new icons in your staging setup. Stage those first before activating the fairing base\u0027s stage. For instance, the 3.75m fairing base has thirds so there should be a stack of 3 radial decoupler looking images in your staging setup that are at least in the stage before you activate the fairing base.

Model nodes require that parts be installed in the exact manner the modded intended.
