He\u0027s chosen that method of protesting Squad, not because of their choice of host, but because they decided to simply fold Spaceport completely rather than archive it. His point is that Squad might not see a downside to that route, but players do, and posts like yours prove that. There\u0027s also his point that if Squad took a wipe-and-reset approach with something as important as a mod archive, what\u0027s to keep them from doing the same with the forums? If you think about it, with the way the forums go down so much, you have to admit that at some point Squad might very well indeed decide to offload these forums to a third party in a similar manner.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow if he \u003Cem\u003Ehadn\u0027t\u003C/em\u003E chosen to pull his mods, posts like ours would never be made, and there\u0027d be that much less to prove to Squad that at least some players are willing to throw in the towel completely if all of their efforts for the love of the game are just flushed away like that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AntiMatter001","CreatedById":100129,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-28T15:42:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Deadweasel\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Deadweasel\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E*snip*\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eugh. your right. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebut then again if spaceport wasn\u0027t folded over it would eventaully just fade away. mods would be updated on curse and kerbalstuff and soon spaceport would be one of these things that it\u0027s nice to look at but can\u0027t do much else.

In SPH I see the same thrust for the engines (in MJ) as defined in the cfg files. But when I load a vessel, the engines output only half their rated thrust at full. So, 60kN for 120kN Pegasus, same (half of what its supposed to be) for the other engines. Does anyone know how to fix this? TT, if you see this, I am not asking for an updated version (though that would be lovely, obviously : ) but as a fellow, though much less skilled, modder, for tips on how to fix a set of parts that I love for myself. Having looked at the CFG\u0027s I think the problem is in TTPitchVector dll file, and since things seemed to work fine before .24 or maybe even .24.2, that its some recent change that broke the plugin, maybe the joystick support part (?) that resulted in engines having max thrust halved out of SPH/VAB.
