This is because all I\u0027m really going to be providing at this point are higher resolution height maps based off of satellite topography data and correctly scaled for each planet and the color and normal maps associated with them. As such, you should be able to just swap the file names in your RSS config file and they should be good to go. That being said, In the next round of the planets and moons, I\u0027m going to be working on the outer planets and their moons, which is going to be a lot more guesswork and a lot less application of data. That being said, I\u0027m still going to be making those height maps in higher resolutions to enhance the surface appearance. At some point, depending on when Nathan finishes his work on the generic PQS loader, I\u0027ll be going back and tweaking all of the procedural terrain and land classes to properly match what is shown in the color maps and I guess the clouds are going to be in there somewhere too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-25T05:25:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe work that goes into KSP modding is astounding... imagine someone was paying for all the software and man hours used...yikes!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpacedInvader","CreatedById":106018,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-25T05:44:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Aazard\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Aazard\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe work that goes into KSP modding is astounding... imagine someone was paying for all the software and man hours used...yikes!\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImagine getting paid to do all of this \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-25T06:24:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBeno\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00AEt: apologies for delay!
