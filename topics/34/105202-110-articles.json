Depending on how you\u0027ve designed your ships/ bases it could potentially cause issues in a save game.  It\u0027s easier if it\u0027s started with a new save.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I have one save game which has some issues because the legacy craft in there are sometimes using a older version of MKS / \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS - they have resources that aren\u0027t used anymore, and I just never de-orbited the ship / orbital station in question.  Which leads me to a question I\u0027ve been meaning to ask:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [@RoverDude](%7B___base_url___%7D/index.php?/profile/105198-roverdude/) - is MKS and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS mostly static now, in terms of mechanics, or are there likely to be additional changes?

You totally can still build bases in MKS using the similar inflatable parts you would use in MKS-L.  But yes maybe I should have clarified it may not play 100% the same but you can still build with the same kinds of parts."},{"CreatedByName":"panarchist","CreatedById":63336,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-27T20:36:54Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 8 minutes ago, goldenpsp said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Well same parts in terms of form factors.

Like you said, there\u0027s no upgrade path.  I think given that most of us probably over-engineer our supply chain, so unless you\u0027re min-maxing the system for efficiency, (and if you\u0027re doing that, you\u0027re probably already using full MKS) the only issue is that there may be a resource needed in MKS that isn\u0027t in LITE which might bring the chain to a halt with a particular base, or that base may not have storage for that resource."},{"CreatedByName":"Arglebargle","CreatedById":161545,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-30T16:38:23Z","Content":"Where can I edit the cost of the supplies resource?
