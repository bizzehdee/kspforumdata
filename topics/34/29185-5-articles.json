The system is modeled after reallife rocket propellants and thus the SABRE\u0027s (even tho they arent fully developed yet) wont run on other fuels.\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SABRE_%28rocket_engine%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SABRE_%28rocket_engine%29\u003C/a\u003E if you want to read more about it :-)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Btw. after reading \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_propellant\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_propellant\u003C/a\u003E it looks like the Monoprop (hydrazine) and Oxidizer (hydrogen peroxide) should be switched and a new fuel, Nitrogene tetroxide, should be added. The default LF\u002BOX combination could then be changed to Nitro(75%)\u002Bhydra(25%).\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemember that you need to specify mixtures as volume ratios in KSP, not as mass ratios! That has bit me in the ass a few times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually, I\u0027m pretty sure that the MonoPropellant resource in KSP is intended to be HAN (Hydroxylammonium Nitrate); the Isp is spot-on and the density is close. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy last set of experiments were towards making different monopropellants. Really, MonoPropellant (HAN), Oxidizer (hydrogen peroxide), and Hydrazine should all be useable as monopropellant, with MonoPropellant having an Isp of 260, Hydrazine 230, and Oxidizer 190. (if you want to get technical, Xenon should be useable to, with an Isp of around 70 or so since you\u0027re just farting decompressed gas out the nozzle). Unfortunately, I can\u0027t get ModuleRCS units to switch propellants in the editor, no matter what. The next time I see Mu or C7 I\u0027ll probably pester them about that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
