My point was to use the autopilot features of Mechjeb... to see exactly what it was doing. As in my sig... and then learn/practice doing it better. I will admit that I do use Mechjebs Aerobrake and landing prediction features. It calculates via drag where aerobraking / aerocapture will put you onto the ground / into orbit. The SMART A.S.S. in MJ also has a couple extra headings (in this case under the target tab) not in the base game that make things like docking 10x easier and more efficient with dV of RCS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, even without using any of the autopilot features, MJ has a lot more to offer than EngineerRedux. I really don\u0027t understand the stigma that Mechjeb has gotten. Hell, I\u0027m proud to say that I even use Mechjeb auto ascent for standard launches. After doing hundreds, or even thousands, of launches.. it helps end the monotony with simple stuff. Unfortunately, with the new atmospheric model (and because I don\u0027t build much to be aerodynamically stable in aerobraking/landing in atmo, and most of my craft are built with KSP-I which it can\u0027t handle the thrust calculations for) MJ doesn\u0027t work for landing anything but simple craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the end, I\u0027m an engineer. My main enjoyment is taken from building complex designs... not from flying. Well, besides space planes. MJ has never handled them perfectly / to my satisfaction... and I\u0027ve always enjoyed flying them anyways. Probably since I only do them about 1/50th as much. If that. No, my real joy is making my insanely complex, but simplified, warp tugs that handle all orbital/interplanetary maneuvers. Incredibly expensive, complex, do everything craft. I\u0027m quiet proud of them.. land and take off from anywhere.. including Eve and Tylo.

My point was to use the autopilot features of Mechjeb... to see exactly what it was doing. As in my sig... and then learn/practice doing it better. I will admit that I do use Mechjebs Aerobrake and landing prediction features. It calculates via drag where aerobraking / aerocapture will put you onto the ground / into orbit. The SMART A.S.S. in MJ also has a couple extra headings (in this case under the target tab) not in the base game that make things like docking 10x easier and more efficient with dV of RCS.\u003Cp\u003EBasically, even without using any of the autopilot features, MJ has a lot more to offer than EngineerRedux. I really don\u0027t understand the stigma that Mechjeb has gotten. Hell, I\u0027m proud to say that I even use Mechjeb auto ascent for standard launches. After doing hundreds, or even thousands, of launches.. it helps end the monotony with simple stuff. Unfortunately, with the new atmospheric model (and because I don\u0027t build much to be aerodynamically stable in aerobraking/landing in atmo, and most of my craft are built with KSP-I which it can\u0027t handle the thrust calculations for) MJ doesn\u0027t work for landing anything but simple craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the end, I\u0027m an engineer. My main enjoyment is taken from building complex designs... not from flying. Well, besides space planes. MJ has never handled them perfectly / to my satisfaction... and I\u0027ve always enjoyed flying them anyways. Probably since I only do them about 1/50th as much. If that.
