This is not quite possible for two reasons: First, the save data is being named by the name of the save file. So if your game is called \u0022Sandbox\u0022, the rotation data is going to be called \u0022PersistentRotation\\_Sandbox\\_1.cfg\u0022, \u0022PersistentRotation\\_Sandbox\\_2.cfg\u0022 and so on. So data from different save files can\u0027t be mixed up. Second, the vessels rotation data is being saved using the unique ID. It is highly unlikely that two vessels of different save files have the same ID, so even if the cfg\u0027s get mixed up, it would not mix up momentum and rotation data.\n\nThere is a simple reason why I keep all cfg\u0027s in the mod folder: I want the mod to be deletable without leaving a mess in the save files. I hope thats understandable.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-13T10:29:12Z\u0022 title=\u002212/13/2015 10:29  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MarkusA380**"},{"CreatedByName":"Psycho_zs","CreatedById":137644,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-13T18:18:37Z","Content":"Thanks, now I see.
