In the same release I introduced thenew resource I made it configurable for everyone who liked it the way it was before. We are planning on introducing another resource to work around the problem, that some parts are very heavy and cheap, while others are very light and expensive. On a complete rocket this problem does not exist that much, because the part distribution solves it. With a single resource it is very hard to balance, because you either make some parts extremly expensive or make others so cheap, that it feels like cheating. With this introduction the compatibility to EPL will be much harder to achieve. The easiest way for you might be, to write someMM configs that add the Workshop module to the Workshop Part of EPL and maybe add an additional converter, that creates MaterialKits out of Metal / MetallicOre. In that case you could use the same infrastructure and only need to provide some storage for the MaterialKits.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kowgan","CreatedById":116874,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-02T20:34:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EObi, do you know of any case that could turn the 3d printing lab from 2000L limit to 300L?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s what I did:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Deleted the MM config that adds the workshop module to the MPL.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Created a MM patch that raises the default 2000L limit into 18000L.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Landed a 3D lab on Minmus, just to notice that, while at the launchpad, it was 18000L.

When the limit is 18.000 on the first load that means it could not find any of the inventories and falls back to the configured value. When the limit is reduced to 300 that means the workshop was able to find the crew inventories, but not the one on the bottom. If you say, that the can and the workshop somehow where two different vessels, than this is the reason. The large container is below the can, so it is not part odf the lab vessel and all inventories available are the two 300l of the crew. I have an Idea why the initial check for available inventories fails, but I have absolutly no Idea about the second problem.
