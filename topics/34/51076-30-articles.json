Old install got so bugged that KSP had a frame rate of 1 fps... even if i switched to single player.\u003Cp\u003ESo - fresh install of ksp, fresh install of this mod. I can no longer get it to work.... here is what happens....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. I log in to a server as usual\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. I get to the usual \u0022map\u0022 screen with \u0022Syncing universe\u0022.. sometimes there is the player list window, sometimes there isn\u0027t - either way there are never any other players, ships debris... nothing, on ANY server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. It loads me in to the space center... still no player window (sometimes), still no other players or ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. I try to launch a ship and I get \u0022you have been logged out of the server\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat gives? This mod worked like 45 minutes ago... now I can\u0027t get anything no matter how many times I reinstall.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had the same issue when I tried it out, but oddly enough it resolved itself.. No idea if it was my line, some odd bug or if the servers just happened to malfunction at same time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Skamp_X","CreatedById":42790,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-06T03:48:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBeen trying this out last 2 days with mixed results.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhen playing yesterday on previous version , I was able to meet up with a ship in orbit, I was the only one on the server so no lag and no problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd i\u0027ll admit it felt pretty cool to rendeszvou with another ship that wasn\u0027t mine \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday , new version , I tried several servers , found one that\u0027s seems somewhat stable, and launched a station in to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaunched a smaller spacecraft to go up and meet with it , but when getting close, the speed was completely wrong (1000\u002B m/s)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eat this point the server was also lagging badly (like 8 or so ppl on (10max)).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith some persistence I did get closer , up to 200 meters and then suddenly the station warped away to like half a orbit away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did suggest others to go dock at it so it makes me wonder,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhat happens when more then one person try\u0027s to dock at the same station??\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eppl using different timewarps, the thing can\u0027t be at both locations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was thinking a solution would be something like a priority list, if a ship wants to dock , the person owning it gives permission , or when offline its granted when set to public\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eonce a person gets permission , the warp from the station will be the same as the person that wants to dock with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs someothers I noticed when I left the server and came back I could not select the station , but once I got something to orbit I could select the station from \u0027select as target/switch to\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe some system is possible to keep the station yours , a code you gotta enter , IP that gets remembered ....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have no idea to what degree my suggestions are possible, just trowing out ideas and feedback.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyhow, great mod , with potential to be truly awesome . thx for time invested and keeping an eye on this thread \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-06T03:56:54Z\u0022 title=\u002211/06/2013 03:56  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 6, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Skamp_X\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JonSpace_CEO","CreatedById":80518,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-06T04:18:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TehGimp666\u0022 data-cite=\u0022TehGimp666\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EVessels within 40km of the KSC will not be added to the universe due to the \u0022safety bubble\u0022 that prevents launch collisions.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, i know this, what i was saying is that you should probably say that there is the 40K safety bubble in the FAQ\u0027s in the main post so people don\u0027t have to go trawling through the comments to find out why they can\u0027t see each other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(looking back at my post i can see how you got confused)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Splode","CreatedById":57337,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-06T04:21:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EStill has some problems with ships being eaten unexpectedly, but it\u0027s certainly improving!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Avalant","CreatedById":36197,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-06T04:22:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUhhhgl........
