That way, you can manage LF and Ox separately, or together under LF/Ox. I am not sure how to handle the case where you want to manage LF/Ox together, but they are out of sync -- i.e. some tanks do not have the right ratio of LF to Ox.\u003Cp\u003EI\u0060d cover your bases and give the decision to the user. Maybe an option in settings (or per ship ideally so you don\u0060t have to keep resetting it) to stop when the first resource runs out (ratio perfect) or when the last resource runs out (max transfer) depending on if you want the destination to have the right ratios or be as full as possible. Balance would work as it does now and make the tanks weigh the same ignoring ratio of LF/Ox.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHmm, might need three settings, transfer perfect ratio (will transfer at 1:1.1 ignoring destination ratio), make destination ratio correct (forces destination ratio to be 1:1.1 with two way transfer) or max transfer (transfers as much as it can ignoring ratio)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr there could just be the ability to say \u0022Make the destination 55% full of LF and Ox\u0022 with a couple of sliders...\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tfm","CreatedById":60394,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-30T17:46:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAny update on this?
