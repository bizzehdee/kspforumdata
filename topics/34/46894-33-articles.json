Come .24 with the economic aspects, and you suddenly have an incentive to not always use the best possible parts - because they will cost more. And after people run out of cash for the first time because they built something unnecessarily over-engineered and then screwed up their launch a few times because the staging is wrong or they forgot to hit T, they\u0027ll gain a heightened awareness for previously underutilized parts. Suddenly that other engine with 10% less Isp starts looking great if it only costs half as much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs such, if mods require rebalancing, then I\u0027d wait until .24 if I were the author. You\u0027ll likely have to go over every single part then anyway in order to calibrate prices against stock parts, and the update will probably come at most a month after the ARM mission. I\u0027m fairly sure the somewhat arbitrary seeming price tags in the current stock game will change in many cases.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
