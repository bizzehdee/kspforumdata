It has a very low thrust, but is very lightweight and fuel efficient. It works just like a Liquid Engine does, and has its own, smaller, fuel source. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can use it as a final stage and finally give the Kermen hope of returning after reaching escape velocity, or use several in the last few stages to help aid with Orbit adjusting. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./?ucmdt9ta174m3gp\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EClick here to download.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo install this, simply copy the two folders into KSP/Parts.
