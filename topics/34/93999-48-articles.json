Then you can compare that to what your environment variables are when you\u0027re on the command line. The shell will generally read some config files (~/.bashrc, ~/.profile, /etc/bash.bashrc, depending on which shell you use) to determine the environment.

For instance, what shows up in the game log when there\u0027s an issue, for example, with case-sensitive file names? Or any other sort of indication of an issue loading the rings and other features?

Rings are done by kittopia, so just check the log for instances in which it shows up.
