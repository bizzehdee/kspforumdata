We decided to download a bunch of mods and for some reason the parts list just doesn\u0027t want to work with us. For example we can only load the Kethane drills and the 1.25 M drives (or usually just anything 1.25 M)from the interstellar mod. Is there any idea on how to fix this (we noticed that the parts names would sometimes have their _ replaced with a period but we managed to fix all these but it still doesn\u0027t work. Any ideas?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
