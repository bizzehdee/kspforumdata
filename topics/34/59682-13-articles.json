It might not make it for the next release, but it\u0027s definitely coming in future. Editing a text file and restarting the game is just too clunky. So far, the media player functions of the GUI are nearly done. It shows what tracks are in the current playlist, which one is playing, and has a playback bar that you can drag around to seek through the current track. It also has buttons for pausing, shuffling and skipping tracks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn IVA music player is a great idea! I\u0027ll add that to the future plans.
