After I hit board, nothing happened, I tried again and it said the capsule was full, I switched to the shuttle, and Val was inside. When I realized that Val had been cloned, I backed out to the space center and entered the tracking station (so I could try to terminate the duplicate), all the vessels were greyed out, so I quit and reloaded the save a couple of times until it let me click on the repli-Val, then when I tried to switch to her, I got an invalid part error and she went poof.\n\nI\u0027m pretty sure it\u0027s a KIS issue, because I\u0027ve usually had it happen where the item the Kerbal is equipped with disappears into the pod (along with the clone), and my \u0022original\u0022 kerbal outside the pod is now missing the KIS item... but who knows! \u003E\\_\u003E Glad to know it\u0027s not just me, tho.
