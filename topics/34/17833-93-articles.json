Line 41152 is where the simulation proper starts (the previous 150 lines are the setup for it). This shows that the dodgy engine is incorrectly marked as active and the other engine is activated because it is in the initial stage. So, it is simulating both engines burning at the same time and the top engine presumably burns all its fuel before the lower one. If you turn the thrust limiter on the top engine right down you should be able to slow it down enough that it will still have some fuel left when the lower one runs out and then some deltaV will appear in stage 0. The active flag is read from ModuleEngines.isOperational so I would expect all engines to have this set to false in the VAB and for it to be false during flight until the engine is activated (either by the staging or any other method).

Assuming a spherical atmosphere means it should be able to use Orbit.TrueAnomalyAtRadius and Orbit.GetUTforTrueAnomaly to work out the time of the encounter. Hopefully that will give the correct point (i.e. the next point you will hit) or some extra tweaks will be needed. Thankfully, due to how Keplerian orbits work, it should only need the true anomaly to be negated to get the other point (and possibly adding on an orbital period to make sure it ends up in the future).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot sure whether it should live in the orbital or surface sections...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sharpy\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sharpy\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf it wouldn\u0027t be too much of a bother - if a stage has fuel and only Vernor engines (RCS) and no fixed engines, would it be hard to include them in the displayed calculations as if they were normal engines? \u003Cp\u003EOn my very light probes/drones/helpers/modules that do require RCS and quite a bit of it, I often forfeit the main engine entirely in favor of Vernors and I\u0027d be very glad if I could get my dV readouts for these.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would like to calculate deltaV for vernor/rcs based craft but the main difficulty lies in either correctly deciding which stages it should be done in or in devising a nice UI for the user to be able to control it. It might still be reasonably useful if it only did it for the final stage, so once the simulation gets to the end it would work out if any RCS based thrust is possible and would calculate it then as an extra stage. The calculation is a bit involved as it needs to take into account the directions of the thrusters and their individual ISPs just as for normal engines.
