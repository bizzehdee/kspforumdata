To most players the parts aren\u0027t worth their weight in RAM without being able to be applied to a variety of applications. Additionally they feel out of place in a game about designing your own solutions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first problem is slowly being eased: by popular demand tools to reduce ram usage are getting better and better, from forceopengl to ATM to the optimization allowed by tweakscale, firespitter tank switcher, and even the hope that one day 64 bit windows will be stable, players\u0027 game data directories are slowly getting bigger. :all applaud:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second problem can be carefully addressed by this tech tree. Essentially what I\u0027m proposing is a short series of mid to upper tech nodes under the premise of a \u0022skunkworks\u0022. These nodes could contain parts included in build-a-craft type mods. The balance would come where the player, in unlocking a skunkworks node rather than another node, trades versatility in parts for mission optimization provided by the modders. The best example of a mod that would benefit from this integration is the KSO mod by helldiver, which I think is absolutely stunning and deserves more attention than it gets, yet simultaneously exclude from my career mode because of its awkwardness with respect to the part-pack sqo. I also am biased in that I am currently working on an Endurance for KSP mod that, without some high tier skunk-works nodes, I\u0027d be almost at a loss for tech tree placement.
