You just need to follow the instruction in the OP and experiment a bit. As a rule, if it\u0027s a part with multiple moving objects, or procedural elements, you\u0027ll probably need \u0022deepreplace = true\u0022; If the part has emissive objects or an emissive texture applied to it, you\u0027ll need to use \u0022EmissiveBumpSpec\u0022 instead of the regular \u0022BumpSpec\u0022 that most parts can use, and you\u0027ll likely have to specify the \u0022Specific = *\u0022 where you specify the main texture for the part being painted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd... if all else fails just use a basic texture painted all red, and you\u0027ll be able to paint the part with the primary color.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dead Pixel","CreatedById":64018,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-22T22:00:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://scontent-b-ord.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xap1/v/t1.0-9/1623688_776709392393538_4338936887381191411_n.jpg?oh=cfc97df6e3c468a4777dad57ee7b4f2d\u0026amp;oe=54C33FF2\u0022 alt=\u00221623688_776709392393538_4338936887381191411_n.jpg?oh=cfc97df6e3c468a4777dad57ee7b4f2d\u0026amp;oe=54C33FF2\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe he updated it last year...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr it was a typo...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOR HES A TIME TRAVELER!!!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-22T22:09:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ironitaly\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Ironitaly\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHey guys if you could make these 3 parts from this mod \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/69539-0-23-Stockalike-parts-for-useful-esthetics\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/69539-0-23-Stockalike-parts-for-useful-esthetics\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPaintable I would be ENTERNALY grateful.
