First, S-I disconnected and S-II ullage motors fired, igniting J-2 engines. About 10 seconds after that, the interstage was decoupled. I think that you should try to model that, it wouldn\u0027t be hard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Saturn V engine cutoff. On both S-I and S-II, the center engine was slightly different than the rest.
