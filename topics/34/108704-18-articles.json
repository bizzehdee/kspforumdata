Depending on your Science Relay settings (found in the stock difficulty settings panel) this can be limited to vessels with a relay antenna, a science lab, or a crewed science lab, and in all cases it requires that the vessel have a science container of some sort on-board.\n\u003E \n\nI\u0027m using your Orbital Science with the Lab with other types of Probes.\n\nThe Lab is crewed with a scientist and engineer, using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E and a bunch of other mods.\n\nIn addition, the \u0022Skylab\u0022 station has a Salamander pod but no other science collecting module other then the Lab.\n\nI\u0027ve collected some science already and moved it to the Lab manually.\n\nAlso, I have a Plant growth module running the science collection currently and a bunch of other science devices.\n\nFinally, across Kerbin, MUN and Minmus I have probes and relay satellites all of which do not have the relay option icoon visible either.\n\nI\u0027ve used your mod before on KSP 1.2.2 with no problems(I love using almost all of your mods).\n\nI do meet all your requirements as you stated above but with \u0022No Joy\u0022.\n\nIf you want to see my output log or any screenshots please let me know.\n\nThe only thing I haven\u0027t tried yet is to open a new career game and progress along enough to see if it\u0027s a \u0022New Game\u0022 issue.\n\nI\u0027m using virtually the same mods I used in KSP 1.2.2 all of which are updated and compatible with KSP 1.3.0.\n\n**\\*\\*\\*Updated\\*\\*\\* - 06/27/2017**\n\nI just went back into KSP and started a new career called \u0022Test\u0022.\n\nI created a simple Mk1 capsule with batteries and a DP-10 Antenna, gieger counter, camera, Goo, etc.. for running experiments.\n\nLeaving Jeb in the Capsule on the Launch pad I went into the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E and created the same vessel and launched Valentina onto the runway and fired up an experiment and *Voila !!!*\n\nThe Relay-science icon appears on both ships.\n\nNEXT:\n\nI exited out of my test career game and back into my normal career game and recreated the exact same ships both on the Launch pad and the Runway and ran the science experiments and there were no Relay-science icons visible.\n\nTherefore, is it possible that by installing Science Relay while using an existing saved game blocks the Relay-science from enabling itself inside the old saved game?\n\nPerhaps there is a cached file or something that is not updating itself to load RS mod into the pre-existing save...I\u0027m just guessing but lookinf for advice beside the obvious one which would be to restart a new Career game etc...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-06-27T14:16:49Z\u0022 title=\u002206/27/2017 02:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJune 27, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Tuko**"},{"CreatedByName":"Yemo","CreatedById":114412,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-08T21:37:04Z","Content":"Hello, is it possible to change the default stats in the \u0022Celestial Body Science Editor\u0022 config file using module manager patches?\n\nThat would be a great help.

Otherwise someone could save the current values from in-game (the \u0022Save to config\u0022 button shown in the first post) and it would then change the values for the config on disk, which would then be multiplied again. But if you use fixed values it will just overwrite whatever someone has set.
