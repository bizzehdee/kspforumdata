The Blok-D is larger and much older in design, and is LO2/kerosene based. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd just for completeness: The Fregat, which nobody has mentioned here, is a modified Luna descent stage, and is the smallest of the lot.

The Briz-KM, though, would theoretically give the Soyuz launcher a 4th stage that\u0027s significantly more powerful than the Fregat stage, so it might be worth adding to the Soviet Pack if Bobcat is so inclined...
