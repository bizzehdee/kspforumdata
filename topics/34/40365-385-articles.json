You see I think the strict application of inverse square law solar panels seems a little OP. Then again I don\u0027t really use KSPI other than to model waste heat from solar panels, and also to have a magnetometer to put on my space probes \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are a couple ways to address this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) In reality, solar panels will saturate at some point and further light intensity will not produce more power. I think if the inverse curve were modified such that there was an upper limit on the amount of power you get by distance (say 100x Kerbin\u0027s output or something) it would balance things out a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) The other idea I think would be cool to have is radiation damage affect solar panel output. This would also introduce a \u0022closer to the sun but less longevity\u0022 system where the closer you are to the sun (or say in a high radiation orbit) the faster your panels would degrade. You could adjust the radiation damage curve so that panel output would not go to zero, to prevent craft from being totally dead in orbit, but that one would at least need to consider spacecraft longevity when planning missions, or how close to park that mega solar factory to the sun in order to decrease radiation damage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI looked through the source code, it seems like all the infrastructure to actually implement both 1 and 2 are already in place. The radiation damage system is already all there, even with radiation belts around each planet from the ORS data. All one would need to do is to extend dose tracking to solar panels, and then provide some kind of \u0022output reduction\u0022 multiplier curve based on how much dosage the panel has received. If I interpret it correctly, it would even work to accumulate radiation damage for panels that are not on the active craft (so time warp would still realistically decay the panels). #1 could be a simple tweak to the formula used to generate the inverse power curve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve actually thought about trying to write a small mod that included stuff like solar panel radiation damage, RTG power decay, and battery capacity degradation as a function of spacecraft life and exposure. This way probes and spacecraft would have a finite lifetime in the Kerbal universe, or at least suffer a performance penalty for extended duration in orbit. Long duration mission planning would need to account for things like RTG decay, battery capacity loss, etc. Missions to Eeloo would need to factor in low solar flux at that distance, but equally so, missions to Moho would need to account for accelerated decay of panel output due to high radiation levels. The point is that in reality space is quite a harsh environment for spacecraft and I wanted to try to incorporate some of those factors in KSP so that you would need to consider some of these factors. Unfortunately while implementing RTG decay seems very straightforward (calculation based on mission time) and battery decay similar (could approximate usage-based wear with another decay based on total mission time... more advanced implementation would also be to try and incorporate temperature extremes into this somehow), the solar panel part was quite a bit more complex. Then I realized KSPI had all the radiation exposure modeling already done \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.

I\u0027m not sure if it is because the module was not fully implemented or if I am doing something wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, seems like FNModuleRTG Thermal Power of 0.000075 MW seems to be the correct value to get electric charge generation equivalent to the stock RTG\u0027s eC output... although that does not seem consistent with my math. If RTG converts heat to charge at 10% efficiency as you stated on page 500, then shouldn\u0027t it be 0.0075 MW = 07.5 kW * 10% efficiency = 0.75 kW = 0.75 eC/sec? Using 0.0075 as ThermalPower seems to make the RTG much too powerful. Maybe my unit conversions are off?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did not totally understand your formula of 2000 * ThermalPower for Pu238 amount. What exactly does this control? Changing this value only seems to affect RTG mass since it\u0027s the amount of Pu238, however, what is the purpose in adding/subtracting Pu238? Shouldn\u0027t the amount of Pu238 remain constant as it is not consumed persay, only thermal output decays? Does RTG life/power output go up or down if this is altered? I tested a little with 100,000x time warp and saw Pu238 amount slowly decrease, does this decay linearly to 0 (making the RTG more like a binary state battery and not an RTG with exponentially decaying output) and does vessel lose mass as Pu238 is consumed?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe RTG does not actually seem to produce electricCharge unless there is a ThermalPower resource present. The problem is, the RTG slowly generates ThermalPower with no outlet. When ThermalPower reaches maxAmount, the RTG shuts down and no further eC is generated. I think in a system with an attached electric generator, (which constantly consumes the thermalPower) it would work OK but I am installing this on a probe with no generator part (I want to use the internal thermocouple of the RTG). Given that the rate of ThermalPower generation is so low per above, I could just add a large sink of ThermalPower like 100000 or 1000000000 but that seems like a kludge. I tried adding a \u0022FNGenerator\u0022 module with 10% carnot efficiency to consume ThermalPower and simulate the 10% efficient thermocouples, but it said the generator was inoperable since KSPI does not \u0022see\u0022 a FNReactor on the vessel (the FNModuleRTG module must not count as one). This may just be incomplete implementation since I don\u0027t know how to get around this. The way I see it, the RTG part should be a totally self contained \u0022black box\u0022, running off an internal \u0022fuel\u0022 supply of Pu238 that degrades with time and simply outputting eC at some decaying rate. WasteHeat could also be included, however given that the RTG part already has fins on it, I would also think it reasonable to assume its radiating needs are already taken care of internally and no external radiators are required (I suppose one could just add an FNRadiator module onto the part too, and adjust the parameters so that it is just enough to dissipate its own heat, but this seems like unnecessary complexity).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is the ModuleManager cfg I made.
