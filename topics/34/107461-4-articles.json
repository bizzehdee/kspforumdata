Right now it is awkward to use if you have fairings on the payload because if you want to use the graphs on the last stage you need to put the part inside the fairing, which makes it so you can\u0027t activate it at the start of the launch.\n- An \u0022Advanced Data Sources\u0022 section that contains all meaningful data sources.\n- The ability to minimize all Graphotron windows, maybe by having a button on the top-right for Graphotron similar to what Kerbal Engineer has.\n- Have the time data be based off the actual time in the game. Right now if you do a time warp while plotting data it will get compressed and make the graphs look bad."}]}
