The boiling-point of other cryogenics you would want to store it alongside is much lower still (-182.96 C for LOX, for example).

You would need to implement some sort of active-heating module for Ammonia storage in order for using the temperature at -34 C to be realistic- and why would you ever do that when it would just be extra mass/complexity in order to reduce the density of a resource and increase its rate of boil-off?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf a convention doesn\u0027t make sense, abandon it.

It had a destiny of 1142 kg/m\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E at the temperatures and pressures it was stored on the Saturn V or Shuttle External Fuel Tank- as both vehicles stored it at significantly lower temperatures and higher pressures (pressure has almost no effect on density most of the time- but when it is used to effect a phase-transition... The thing about LOX is that it basically has a very gradual phase-transition: that is its thermodynamic behavior is significantly different at slightly lower temperatures or higher pressures than its boiling-point than right at it, leading to a large difference in density...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce again, I\u0027m not making this up.

You can check these figures for yourself. At 1 atm and -200 C you get a density of 1223 kg/m\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E. However at 1 atm and -183 C you get a density of 187.7 kg/m\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E. If you raise the pressure to 2 atm at -183 C you increase the density to 425.7 kg/m\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E (you can much more easily effect the same more complete phase-transition by cooling the Oxygen a few degrees), but this is because you are effecting a more complete phase-transition not because you are compressing the liquid with pressure. If you raise the pressure to 2 atm at -200 C the density remains entirely unchanged at 1223 kg/m\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E because the phase-transition is already complete.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EP.S.\u003C/strong\u003E I hope you won\u0027t interpret this as a re-visit of my faulty \u0022compressible liquids with pressure\u0022 argument from ages back. It\u0027s not. What I\u0027m referring to is effecting phase-transitions (or as the case may have it, more complete phase-transitions) to increase density- in the same manner you can drastically increase the density of a gas at room temperature if you pressurize it until it turns into a liquid. It\u0027s not that you\u0027re compressing the gas with pressure- it\u0027s that you\u0027re raising the boiling-point until the gas enters a liquid state (which is always much more dense than the gaseous state). The most mass-effective way to turn a gas into a liquid is always to cool rather than pressurize it...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-15T20:27:16Z\u0022 title=\u002203/15/2015 08:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-15T20:32:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENorthStar - with all due respect, we need to let this bit go.

That is because at -50 C you only have to cool/insulate the Ammonia by 10 degrees in LEO, but have to heat it 30 degrees in interplanetary space (or orbit of a planet further out from the Sun) in order to maintain it at this temperature. If you stored it at -40 C your heating-requirements in deep space would become substantially greater as you would have to maintain a 40-degree temperature differential from ambient (through heating and insulation) not a 30-degree one...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt a lower temperature, LqdAmmonia is going to be denser.
