They simply have too much grip, and will not slide no matter what. Since the KSP uses the stock unity wheel physics (which sucks), I realized the only way to change the grip values is to make my own wheel from scratch. I know a little bit about vehicle dynamics, and can design stuff in CAD, but have zero unity, modelling and texturing experience. It took me 2 days to learn blender and unity get the thing working and couple more days to tweak the friction curves which is just bonkers in unity. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese wheels will skid at full torque (great for doing donuts), they will slide when you push them over peak friction, so you will be able to counter steer drift around the launch pad like a pro.

What I\u0027ve changed:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBraketorque. These slide, so I see no reason not to put enough of this to lock the tires up. Changed it to 2500.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESteering lock. Because they slide, steering too much at speed will jsut result in under/over steer instead of a rollover. Plus I\u0027ve had a few spins that could have been easily corrected if I had more steering lock at that speed. So I turned this up across the board. Slow speed is up to 35 degrees, high speed is up to 25 degrees. I use a 360 pad to drive rovers so it isn\u0027t a problem for me to manually steer less than that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETorque. The initial value of 2500 is good, but I felt the value dropped off way too quickly. Mine stay at peak torque until 30m/s, then slowly taper off. At 50m/s they\u0027re still putting down 1250. This gives my rather light(Under 2 tons) medium sized space car a top speed of about 45m/s, which is perfect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I\u0027d like to change but cannot:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpring rate. My medium sized rovers are incredibly lightweight, and as a result there isn\u0027t much action from the suspension. These feel to me to be tuned for 4-6 ton rovers, not 1.5 ton rovers. I\u0027d turn the spring stiffness and dampening down quite a bit for them. Or maybe make a second \u0022Type R\u0022 version with the lighter tuning for lighter medium sized rovers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESizing. As mentioned before some gokart and truck sized versions with varying stats would be great as well. I could handle scaling them through part.cfg, but not changing the springs rates to suit the different types of vehicles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETraction. The sideways grip is about spot on I think, but forward bite leaves much to be desired. Even with my 360 pad every takeoff is full of wheelspin. That might just be because of how light my rover is, but I\u0027d still like more forward bite. Maybe another 20%. But leave the side bite alone, again, I feel that\u0027s spot on. It\u0027s still possible to traction roll but you really have to eff it up to do it, and that\u0027s about right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit 2: \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JgF57Oj.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022JgF57Oj.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPowerslidepowerslidepowerslidepowerslide\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Darren9\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Darren9\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ECertainly more fun than the stock ones \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Maybe you could add a slick and a knobbly variant, one with a slightly higher grip level than the other?

Also Kenobi do you get too much wheel spin no matter how much throttle? It should bite more if you reduce the torque. Too much torque will easily push past the peak friction and break loose.

It should bite more if you reduce the torque. Too much torque will easily push past the peak friction and break loose. It would be nice if there was some feedback like smoke or tire sound to let you know when you pushed it too much, but again that will require plugins.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI might tinker with the torque values a bit more. I\u0027m kinda in the mind to copy them and make a \u0027hotrod\u0027 variant with an absolutely bonkers torque setting that\u0027ll never hook up at all, which I\u0027ll use for hooning about the space center, and edit the one I have now for actual use with..maybe 1750 torque instead of 2500?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFor the models, I was thinking maybe one more bigger and wider wheel for more grip, and a smaller and narrower wheel with less, what do you guy think?
