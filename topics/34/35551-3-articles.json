Make an end burner instead of a core burner. In model rockets those are the two main styles of engines. Core burners have a molded in hole that goes almost all the way through the fuel. End burners don\u0027t, they light at the bottom and burn towards the top.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECore burners are used in booster stages for their powerful and fast burn. End burners are used for upper stages to gain altitude with their lower thrust and slower burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0027d be a problem with large end burning solid fuel rockets is the casing would have to withstand high temperatures for a longer time while the fuel burns. Not much of a problem with core burners because the unburned fuel shields the casing and once the fire reaches the casing it goes out. Another issue with large end burners would be the constantly changing balance as the fuel burns up the rocket. Having your center of gravity rapidly moving towards the nose as the fuel burns, then moving backwards at some point during the burn would cause some interesting issues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Course in KSP the CG changes with staging never seem to bother things.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ignamious","CreatedById":60779,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-29T03:02:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESorry for Wall of text. won\u0027t accept return carriages for some reason: ----------Just did some testing with stock install of game, found this mod to be something of GREAT value!I would like to see this mod updated soon with more features. I will be using it in place of stock for my SLV. I am seeing some odd behavior when doing symmetry in the VAB. But i haven\u0027t been able to isolate the cause to the KSP bug or this add-on. However your Original Post is daunting. To explain this better:Stock mod:adds 3 \u0022fuel\u0022 tanks, gimbaling nozzle and 2 nose cones (useful!!)You stack the Fuel tanks adding to the Thrust, there are 3 variants A, B, CA = 50 seconds of burn (constant)B = 100 seconds of burn (constant) C = \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0\u00CB\u202050 seconds of burn High thrust, then a reduction in thrust, then high again, The C is great for getting the Terminal Velocity, and with traditional LF engines, and a good TWR gets this second burst of thrust around gravity turn time!! great for making smaller LF stages.The nose cone as two. A and B.A will give a small thrust at 50 seconds from when the SRB\u0027s fire. The B is 100. This allows the Thrusters to \u0022Move away\u0022 from the core, sadly 5/8 times they crossed each others paths (50 second burn time) probably because of the decoupler used. i did manage get a constant slow separation by putting the decoupler in the DRY COM (of as close as i could) but they still tend to move toward the core without the decoupler. i thought about adding a fin the the outside to offset the mass, but didn\u0027t get to it. (This is a KSP thing mostly) the parachute deployment is the same as stock, however it\u0027s a different model (no transparencies) but as i don\u0027t plan on following them down its fine. This is good because this allows them to be \u0022recycled\u0022 and the KSP mission pack should be able to utilize this (add-on and hopefully stock!) but have not tested that as i did a vanilla test for this.There is also a different type of launch clamp that bolths the bottom of the SRB nozzel perfectly! ad just on of the stock ones to the top and you have a great looking \u0022Real life feel\u0022 now, to get them in 2.5 size with longer burn timesI recommend this mod as a goof Alpha SRB replacment. to the DEV of the mod;keep up the work, i would love to see it more procedural for the burn pattern, i know it\u0027s planned.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-29T17:35:41Z\u0022 title=\u002208/29/2013 05:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 29, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Ignamious\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EKeeps deleting return carages\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vagabond820","CreatedById":57995,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-30T01:57:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI keep having part clipping issues in 0.21.1.

Majiir\u0027s been doing a good job of reminding people about licenses but perhaps even can be proactive towards pushing them towards \u0027which\u0027 license. Obviously it\u0027s the developer\u0027s decision at the end of the day but, for example, given a choice of two similar mods I would be far more likely to choose the one that can\u0027t go into dev lock.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"astroadrian99","CreatedById":59060,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-02T23:41:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey I just wanted to suggest something you could add to this mod.
