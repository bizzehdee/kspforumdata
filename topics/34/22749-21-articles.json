I have found I can mitigate the problem using the RCS BUT that burns off Monopropellant like a mother. Is it maybe an issue relating the weak (5 IIRC) SAS torque of the docking ring ASAS to the stability of the rocket and the centre of mass being high once a decent amount of the fuel is depleted? In both the case of the Ares I and the Falcon 9 I\u0027m using they are 2.5m parts with a larger top section where all the persitant mass is. Gravitationally this isn\u0027t so stable, and if you start tipping it to one side once it\u0027s burnt off a good amount of fuel there isn\u0027t enough torque in the ASAS module to stop the over balance and keep it upright, and once the thrust from the base moves outside the gimbal range of the engine it all starts to go wrong fast.?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m only theorising.

It\u0027s very similar to what happens if you put a bunch of dumb struts at the top of a rocket stack then try and steer that using SAS. It\u0027s very hard!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas anyone tried flying it manually? I tried a *manual* flight using MechJeb\u0027s guide target in the navball and even that went wrong when I tried to turn, a tiny error that would normally be reversible and it started to pinwheel over and I couldn\u0027t pull it back with SAS alone.

The join between the J-2X and the 1st stage interface cone and also the joint between the stage 2 tanks both wobble badly even when not in flight. The staggering of these joints is also another contributing factor to the rocket tumbling over as they screw with the COM and the thrust direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo be honest your American Pack mod looks awesome and once in orbit the Orion steers, manoeuvres and docks fantastically.

The data log says the Mir Probe Core was destroyed ... It wasn\u0027t ... If I shut the engines down, quickly switch to the space center and then back to the ship it fixes it for a short time. Then it will happen again. ... Um .. WTF is happening? Help ... Using Mj 2.0.8, Docking Cam plug in, and the plugins that come with soviet pack. Have Chatterer, KSPX, Tac Fuel Balancer, Kethane, Quantum Struts and Fuel Transfer, American pack, ISS pack (Soviet parts removed because of duplicates), Aviation Lights, Fustek station parts, and soviet pack 1.8.4, Running Windows 8, 2.4ghz I3 6gb ddr3 ram Intel Graphics (laptop can\u0027t fix that) KSP 0.20.1 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help on this issue would be great. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote I did try launching these on both included launchers and stock built launchers and had the exact same thing happen. Something happens and the Camera drops to the next lowest stage then a few seconds later will do it again and I lose all control.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-29T23:58:04Z\u0022 title=\u002205/29/2013 11:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 29, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by HGGundamReviews\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"daver4470","CreatedById":57076,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-30T00:48:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Good_Apollo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Good_Apollo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EPerhaps this is the answer behind the mystey of the flipping Kliper and other stability issues I\u0027ve noticed since 2.0.8/.20\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, I had the flipping Kliper issue (flippklip?) too.

Something changed, with either MJ2 or Kliper itself.\u003Cp\u003EPre 0.20 I had no problems. I have the exact same .craft files for my Soyuz/Kliper, all that changed inbetween was 0.20/MJ2.0.8/Soviet Pack .20 version. The answer lies in what change is causing this new problem. I\u0027m starting to suspect Mechjeb is the issue here, I\u0027ve noticed several ASAS problems since the last upgrade. Ship stability is very wonky now, especially when docking. Used to be smooth as butter for me but now ships stutter and sway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[EDIT] Nope, the latest v56 build of 2.0.8 didn\u0027t do anything, still flipped. Interestingly when I decided to try a launch sans Kliper wings and control surfaces I got an immediate CTD with no message or log.
