As for myself, weird, I\u0027ve committed lots. I have things working pretty much spot on for 2-speed supercharger and for turbocharger piston engines; the problem is the R-2800, R-3350, and other latewar/postwar US engines with 2-stage *3* speed superchargers, but that just means I need to add a third boost mode. When I do that I\u0027ll also rework how intercooling/aftercooling works.

Needless to say in .25, they\u0027re about 80x more efficient (compared to 16x from before).\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can see why the first craft might not perform as well under real world circumstances/AJE as it does in stock KSP. However, I did everything I could to improve those factors in the second aircraft including using more frugal engines and adding a huge amount of fuel, yet the range only improved marginally. I have trouble believing that this is how real aircraft would perform, because it would pretty much mean that airliners would barely make it to the border of a small country \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo in general, everyone should pack more fuel into a fuselage.
