I tended to design around some mods anyways, but tweaking the stock parts gives a really, really nice curve with the few part mods I\u0027ve put into my game that feels right. Everything has a purpose, from the littlest engine that could to the lifting stages where it\u0027s a choice between size and weight. Sometimes large, light payloads just need less thrust to keep them from disintegrating which gives good purpose to smaller engines, whereas the heavy lifter stages even throttled down and tweaked still could put too much stress on it without careful monitoring of the throttle.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maccollo","CreatedById":72759,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-10T18:27:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust tried this with RSS.
