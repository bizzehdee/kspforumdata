The wheels are placed on I-beams attached to the ends of the two 1X1 panels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s my full test version of that rover; when I switch on unlimited fuel and RCS that thing can get in and out of atmospheres with no problem, and it\u0027s perfectly stable. I can hover with the main engines and use the RCS thrusters to scoot around. The side mounted parts are all attached to the rover body through an inverted cubic octagonal strut, that way I can separate them for pictures and not have any extra parts hanging off the sides. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor how quickly I made that rover it actually turned out really well.
