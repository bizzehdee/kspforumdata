If you really want Kerbin back as a standalone planet, then might i suggest going with other planet packs such as OPM and/or Trans-Keptunian.

How I usually test is by flinging stock planes through the atmospheres at high speeds and see whether I think the heating is too much. If a plane can take the might of aerobraking, then the sturdier rocket parts should be able to:wink:"},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T16:13:08Z","Content":"Actually I\u0027m not sure the rocket parts *are* sturdier... one of the recent patches specifically increased the heat tolerance of plane parts. \n\nThe MK2 \u002B MK3 parts for example are rated for 2500 degrees, while wings are at 2400. Meanwhile a MK1 fuel/oxidiser tank is only 2000, as are reaction wheels. Basic solar panels are only 1200, which explains why they were so determined to detonate... alas I don\u0027t have the tech to get the shielded ones :\u003C"},{"CreatedByName":"Tynrael","CreatedById":144990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T17:03:14Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Which reminds me, I need to go back to Serran with a different lander... I feel sure now that the error was in sandwiching those small SAS modules between two fuel tanks.\n\nEarlier you had wondered if there may be a problem with heating, this is definitely the case on 1.0.4 and small mass parts. If you experiment with the placement of small things like SAS/batteries/probe cores etc... you will find that the placement and even overuse of radiators will have no effect. At certain times these parts can seemingly out of nowhere explode, if you use the debug options and have a lucky quick-save you can see that they instantly jump to temperatures 4-5x greater than the hottest part on the craft and explode. Some people in the forums suggest lowering the conductivity factor for the heating until this is fixed. I have had this problem a few times but it is inconsistent, a save for a craft it happens on will have it always happen- but if I do a new launch that version may not experience the issue."},{"CreatedByName":"KillAshley","CreatedById":128696,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T17:08:38Z","Content":"Well then ill just switch it around then!

It was always the same two kinds of components that blew up though, and indeed they would do so instantly without any sort of heat bar. F3 always said \u0022overheated\u0022 anyway though :/"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T17:38:58Z","Content":"A plane entering the atmosphere at a high angle-of-attack will often have quite a lot of drag for its mass, plus some lift, so it\u0027s not necessarily the harshest test.
