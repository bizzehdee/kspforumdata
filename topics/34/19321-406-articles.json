I was hard-pressed to find anything jet-powered that approaches much more slowly. An F-16 comes in at around the same speed; even large commercial airliners tend to come in at around 130-150 kts. A standard glider plane approaches at maybe 70 kts (80 mph).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpoilers/flaps are very much required to bring you down from that speed at any reasonable distance. Spoilers are not so much for \u0022braking\u0022 per se; they\u0027re for killing lift so you can flare (pitch up without gaining height), which then slows you down due to increased drag. Flaps, on the other hand, alter your aerodynamics in a way that both drag and angle of attack increase, while stalling speed decreases; this means that you can flare much harder, thus slow down quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Modern, small jet planes like Learjet or F-16 typically have a glide ratio of about 16:1. This means with engines shutoff, such a plane manages to glide for 800 m from an approach height of 50 m without slowing down if not using spoilers or flaps. You can probably imagine what happens if you try to slow down solely by pitching up (without going into a climb) - you run out of runway pretty fast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s virtually no reason for the KSC runway being long enough to land a plane without spoilers with realistic aerodynamics.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Abdu","CreatedById":102145,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T19:34:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bakase\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Bakase\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAre you sure this is to do with FAR?

This seems about right for the rather bulbous fairing shape involved; a sleeker one will probably result in less instability. In any case, that\u0027s not really the point of fairings: the point of them is to protect the payload, not make the rocket more stable.
