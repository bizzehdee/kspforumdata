I recently started playing with getting a .25 install up and running with a bunch of mods, and AGX is high on my list. I\u0027ll detail the issue I\u0027m seeing, but first I\u0027ll say that I did test without any other mods installed to make sure what I\u0027m seeing isn\u0027t a result of tons of mods. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll be specific in case some detail helps: I have a joystick that I set up to trigger Custom action groups in addition to Alpha1-0. In .24 with AGX, I was able to do this without issue (I had many action groups triggered from either Alpha1-0 or a joystick button). I did not set this up through the AGX editor, instead, I set this up in KSP settings (which allow 2 keystrokes to trigger one event). When I set up KSP, I go through the usual process...for instance Custom Action 1 is triggered by Alpha1 and Joystick 1. When I enter the VAB/SPH, I set up my actions and all seems fine. Upon hitting launch, the only input which will trigger the action group is Alpha 1. The joystick control does not function; however, other joystick controls function just fine. For instance, I have a joystick button triggered to toggle RCS in addition to hitting \u0027R\u0027. As such, the behavior I\u0027m seeing is limited to action group assignments. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E When I was trouble shooting this, I also noticed that AGX was causing the action groups assignment keys (in KSP settings) to clear. In other words, if I set up groups 1-10 to trigger via Alpha1-0 in KSP\u0027s settings and then played the game, when I returned to settings the assignments were deleted. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I\u0027ve tried to do due diligence and uninstall/reinstall AGX. I\u0027ve also double checked to make sure I\u0027m using the hotfix and current version. Maybe I\u0027m doing something screwed up?
