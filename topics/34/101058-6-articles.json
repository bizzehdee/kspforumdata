The waterz are in a 60 degree cliff face...\n\nThe availability of resources is thus determined by the root of the whole base rather than the location of the drill on the base (may be a decent request for a Regolith change). The plus side is that so long as you\u0027re recycling water you don\u0027t actually need to grab new water so you can truck it in instead of KAS\u0027ing the drill platform to your base.\n\nEach civilian kerbal consumes 1kg of water per day. You need to match their consumption in recyclers/farms. Each newly born kerbal will expend 105kg worth of food.\n\nBasically to maintain a colony of 100 kerbals you\u0027ll need a minimum of 1 metric ton of water and food so long as recyclers are active. This works out to 2 of the biosphere farms or 2 of the biodome farms. The biodomes provide for a population of 60 each, so 2 farms are needed in this colony. \n\nIf you expect a colony to grow from a population of 50 to a population of 100 you\u0027ll need\n\n- Enough farms to supply the 100 population\n\n- an extra 5.25 tons of food (50 \\* .105) for each kerbal.\n\nA fully stocked biosphere farm (the large one) has if i recall 15 tons worth of food available (im at work so I don\u0027t have the configs in front of me).\n\nThe resource conversion path is a simple one: \n\nsubstrate to biomass\n\nbiomass to food\n\nfood to waste\n\nwaste to biomass\n\nWater is used during the substrate to biomass and biomass to food production and is consumed directly by the kerbals, producing waste water at each step. The water is not consumed when a new kerbal is born. I could have split up the mass between the two but I assume that some part of water is in the food to keep the system easy enough to understand.\n\nBasically while mining water is necessary at the start of base you\u0027ll rarely have to get new water once it\u0027s operational. You\u0027ll need substrate (the extractor is on the laser drill) to grow new biomass for food. Substrate is pretty much everywhere. That said you won\u0027t need much of it.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Yes - you\u0027re using that to sort out the DLL load order. Your issue was probably the bad reference because your DLL loaded before Regolith\n\nIt is cause KSP loads in alphabetical order and C comes before R so there\u0027s no regolith dll loaded at the time. I added the assembly thing and everything works fine. I\u0027m also going to track the version of my plugin with it as well in case anyone uses it as a dependency.\n\nDev news update: I\u0027ve been hard at work re-texturing the parts. I took a day off yesterday but i\u0027m back at it today. \n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/QMp6P)\n\nHere\u0027s what\u0027s new on the parts:\n\n- All of the biodome windows and the farm biospheres have vents on the side of what used to be blank parts. \n\n- New end caps on the biospheres, window parts, and on the university and flight school\n\n- University and flight school are completely retextured into cleaner models\n\n- The farm biodome is retextured. The orientation is now fixed too, so it starts out flat when you place the part in the VAB and that the \u0022radial\u0022 duplicate mode works.\n\n- Civilian landing pad 2 is retextured with vents and a better landing pad surface texture.\n\nAlmost all textures are tiled where possible. This lets me replace previously baked textures and save memory on the parts. The tiled bump maps will render better as well.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-20T03:37:13Z\u0022 title=\u002203/20/2015 03:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by michaelhester07**"},{"CreatedByName":"Helmut","CreatedById":139729,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-20T04:42:29Z","Content":"Construction Drone does not work.

The mission design I was thinking of for the construction drone was this though:\n\n1. Send a probe to scan for a site which is viable for a colony.\n\n2. Send the construction drone. The drone constructs the colony. Note that this construction may take a while, so a person or kerbal might run out of supplies and need to be constantly re-supplied during construction. \n\n3. Once the colony structure is built and basic supplies are being processed the first colonists can arrive on site.\n\nThe mission might need an engineer or two to oversee the process. This would require much fewer resources on the colony to begin with. I had envisioned that it would be possible at the timeframe that this mod targets (2050-2100) that full scale robotic construction would replace the need for human or kerbal engineers to be present on site. Even in the case of the Moon(Mun) it would be possible to oversee the construction from Earth (kerbin) as the round trip for a signal would only be 2 seconds."},{"CreatedByName":"DirtyFace83","CreatedById":131509,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-21T22:19:44Z","Content":"Gotcha, that makes sense.

This guide will help you build in situ biodomes of all kinds. If you plan to launch and land a biodome then you don\u0027t really need this. If you\u0027re building with Extraplanetary Launchpads on site then you\u0027ll want this.\n\nI design all of my biodome city parts in the spaceplane hangar. It\u0027s easier to move around in it and frankly i wouldn\u0027t mind launching everything out of it, including rockets that should have been in the VAB. \n\nThe Hangar Extender mod is recommended but not required to build biodome cities as the domes are 30 meters in diameter. \n\n![31egem3.png](http://i.imgur.com/31egem3.png)\n\nHere is one of the city parts I built for my mun city. I drew on this screenshot some important information to remember for later. Pay extra attention to the red and blue arrows. When we go to the construction rocket we\u0027ll have to survey the side where we build it. The other tips from above:\n\n1. Add landing legs and extend them. You can try launch clamps too.\n\n2. Keep the part count low to minimize lag. If you have my stanford torus mod the solar panels from that will also help reduce lag. The extending panels are collider expensive.\n\n3. Rotate the biodome in the SPH so that the base points down.\n\nNow to building it. For building with survey stakes Kerbal Attachment system is necessary so go get that. Your build ship must then have the following parts\n\n- Laser drill or other Ore drill.\n- Smelter\n- Rocket part workshop or CNC mill\n- If using the CNC mill, one construction drone module\n- At least one kerbal on board for surveying\n- Enough power to sustain the operation.\n\nLets go to the build site.\n\n![1lvpUB0.png](http://i.imgur.com/1lvpUB0.png)\n\nWhat I drew here is the survey stakes you\u0027ll need to place to build the biodome in situ with a survey station. My survey station was one of the MKS Colony control centers. Yours might be that or the EPL station. These tips will help you build any part with survey stakes and EPL, not just biodomes. Here we go:\n\n- You can place either direction or bounds stakes for X and Z.\n- Never place a Y stake. This will probably destroy your biodome. If you\u0027ve been placing them put the y- near the center of the bounds area or at the origin. I don\u0027t place it and my domes build fine.\n- Place the origin stake where you want the dome\u0027s origin to be. Keep a minimum of 20 meters space between the new dome and any existing structure so it doesn\u0027t spawn inside the other structure when you finalize.\n- Use a KAS pipe to attach it to the existing base once built.\n\nFind the survey site in the EPL menu and build! That\u0027s it.\n\n![pVZKRBy.png](http://i.imgur.com/pVZKRBy.png)\n\nNow its time for some long awaited playing time."},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-26T23:39:45Z","Content":"This is coming along very well ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"DirtyFace83","CreatedById":131509,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T08:17:28Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E This is coming along very well ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nI\u0027m loving it.
