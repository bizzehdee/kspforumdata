But I\u0027ve run into a few things on the tech tree that don\u0027t make sense to me. I realize that the tree is a work in progress, so please think of these as suggestions for possible improvements, and not as complaints. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing is having to unlock heavy rocket engines before getting small ones. I was trying to design a rover with small engines for Mun \u0026amp; Minmus landings, and couldn\u0027t figure out why I didn\u0027t have any small rockets, until I finally discovered them after the heavy engines. Goddard was making small engines long before anyone was making big ones. Actually, it would be nice to reorganize the rocket engines more on the basis of efficiency, rather than size. Make the early engines be ones with low ISP, and work up to the better engines as one goes along. Hmmm, having to earn one\u0027s way to the heavy boosters also makes sense, though. Maybe base it on both efficiency and size. Start with a small and medium rocket that are both fairly low ISP, then have tech nodes with progressively better engines. Maybe 3 branches for small, medium, and large engines with a few levels on each for increasing efficiency, or something like that. But small rockets should certainly be available early, since that\u0027s how rocketry started. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing is having to go through pretty much all of the solar panels in order to get to the first Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (RTG). In real life, we\u0027ve been making RTGs since the 1950s, about the same time as the first practical solar panels were available. Having to wait until one has reached the pinnacle of solar panel tech before starting the most basic nuke tech doesn\u0027t really feel right. I think nuclear energy should be a parallel branch to solar. To avoid having people get something futuristic like Nerva too early (yes, I know NASA was working on it in the late 60s, but we still haven\u0027t actually flown one), just make it have a much higher science cost. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t made it all the way through yet, so I\u0027m still trying to find some parts that I think I should have found already, like the basic PPD-10 Hitchhiker Storage Container. Since it\u0027s basically just a tube with some seats installed, I think it ought to show up earlier than the multi-crew command pods. Command pods are much more complex, with controls and instruments and whatnot. Right now if I want to complete a contract for a orbital station (or one on Mun or Minmus) I have to stick multiple command pods on it to get enough crew capacity. That seems like a pretty kludgy way to have to fulfill those contracts. Maybe one branch for passenger modules and one for command pods, with increasing capacity/capability on each branch?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, please accept the above as constructive suggestions, not as complaints. I think you\u0027ve made a great start with this mega-meta-mod, and I hope you\u0027ll keep working on it to make it better and better.

There were some things that i wanted to do with it before release (like moving more parts to the new crew compartment branch or adding some more descriptions) but i\u0027ll leave this for V16. Right now i\u0027m pretty happy with how the tree looks so the next update won\u0027t have any more major tree reworks.

Since the V15 update i think there are going to be some parts within that branch that just aren\u0027t supposed to be there and it\u0027s going to be really hard to find them all on my own with the amount of mods this tree currently supports.

It\u0027s worthless for anything else - the coordinates are totally wrong, part names are pasted with _ instead of . so the parts are unrecognized in the tech tree(that\u0027s techmanagers fault but you need it to load the tech tree) and every time you load a tech tree to the editor it loses node parents and coordinates (you can\u0027t save a tree correctly).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI found out how already but thanks for the reply.
