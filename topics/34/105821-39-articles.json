I looked through its code a little just now, and the one thing I see that might explain the problem is if the waypoints it adds do not cause the NavBall to update correctly.  RPM depends on the NavBall\u0027s transform to contain children named \u0022vectorsPivot\u0022 and \u0022NavWaypoint\u0022.  If those aren\u0027t present, or they\u0027re removed by Waypoint Manager, then there will be exceptions like you report.  RPM makes assumptions about what to expect based on stock behavior, and if a mod does something differently, RPM won\u0027t handle it.

Is there a commented page available?  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E (specifically, I\u0027d like to replace that section with a display for TARGETGROUNDDISTANCE, LATERALBRAKEDISTANCE and SUICIDEBURNSTARTSECS)\n\u003E \n\nYou\u0027re editing GameData/JSI/RPMPodPatches/BasicMFD/p1\\_landing40x20.txt, correct?  And line 20 of that file, specifically?  You need to be familiar with C# string formatters and some of the extensions that RPM uses for formatting as [documented on the wiki](https://github.com/Mihara/RasterPropMonitor/wiki/Writing-page-definition-files).  If you\u0027ve looked at that, and you\u0027re still having trouble, post your edited page definition file somewhere, and I\u0027ll take a look at it to see if I can spot what\u0027s going on."},{"CreatedByName":"dlrk","CreatedById":60033,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-21T19:16:22Z","Content":"I seem to have figured it out now, thanks."},{"CreatedByName":"dlrk","CreatedById":60033,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-21T19:46:04Z","Content":"I do have a quick question though, I\u0027m trying to have RPM display time to suicide burn like this, and display nothing if the burn time is NAN.  \n\n    SB Time:{0:METMM:ss.f;\u0022\u0022}s\n\nBut instead of displaying nothing if it is NAN, it displays NANs.

With a NaN number, you have to look at a second variable to determine if the first one is valid.  It\u0027s a nuisance, but with some variables it\u0027s the only way to convey that data, since the variable could legitimately by positive, negative, or zero.  In this variable\u0027s case, you\u0027d want to check if the orbit makes sense and the Pe \u003C 0 (either by using a CUSTOM\\_ variable to combine the conditions, or using a variable page text switcher to display a different page when the craft isn\u0027t suborbital."},{"CreatedByName":"Fenixs","CreatedById":131438,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-24T19:16:53Z","Content":"hi... i love de rasterpropmonitor mod and alcor capsule and iva flight.... but last i see my navball black... what i  must have in my JSI files to see the background on my navball ??     ....note: i have the capsule alcor but the chaka mod\n\nthx... and sorry my bad english"},{"CreatedByName":"MOARdV","CreatedById":60950,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-24T20:13:11Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 55 minutes ago, Fenixs said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E hi... i love de rasterpropmonitor mod and alcor capsule and iva flight.... but last i see my navball black... what i  must have in my JSI files to see the background on my navball ??     ....note: i have the capsule alcor but the chaka mod\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E thx... and sorry my bad english\n\u003E \n\nBlack navball in ALCOR IVA is a known problem with ALCOR.  A way to fix it is in [the ALCOR thread](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/50272-104alcorquotadvanced-landing-capsule-for-orbital-rendezvousquot-by-aset-21072015/\u0026page=67#comment-2377689).
