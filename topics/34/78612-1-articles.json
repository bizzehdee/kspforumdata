This seems to us to be a violation of several countries data collection policies (notably EU, Canada, and Mexico), and the manner of distribution (encouraging other software vendors to include the plugin in their bundle) is suspect, and reminiscent of spyware/crapware.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQ: I\u0027m convinced, how do I install?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA: Simply download the latest release .zip from the download link, and extract to your KSP folder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQ: How would you have implemented ModStatistics?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA: I\u0027ll summarize how I think ModStatistics should have been implemented (and maybe if Majiir had listened to the dissent leading up to the 0.24 release, would have implemented this way).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- ModStatistics should have not been bundled with other mods/plugins. This is the crux of the spyware/crapware allegation- the fact it\u0027s shoveled in with other software people do want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- ModStatistics should present an Interface (like blizzy\u0027s toolbarmanager interface), and provide an API in the form of a wrapper (again see blizzy\u0027s excellent toolbarwrapper) for plugins which use ModStatistics, to register themselves with ModStatistics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- ModStatistics should only collect hardware information after explicit consent of the user (see Steam Hardware Survey and their random sampling, opt-in protocol)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- ModStatistics should not generate a GUID for the install, or any other unique identifier for the installation- unless the user consents.
