It was caused by an incompatibility between SDHI, and realism overhaul. SDHI has a module manager config located at GameData/SDHI/Service Module System/Parts/MM_configs/SDHI_SMS_MMPatch_TACLifeSupport.cfg.

And the multiple antenna multiplier only applies to omni antennas, and not to dishes (right?) so you can\u0027t just strap a second Reflectron GX-128 on each ship to boost the range.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the max range you can communicate in this game is 800 million km. That\u0027s fine for everything in the inner system, and it\u0027s even fine for Jupiter, whose range from Earth ranges from 365 million km to 601 million km. Saturn, though, goes from 746 million km to 1.7 billion kilometers, so you clearly won\u0027t be able to communicate with anything on Saturn from Earth except for very the rare times it\u0027s within 800 million km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s only one thing I can think of to approach this problem: a relay around Jupiter to communicate between Earth and Saturn, but that won\u0027t work too well since the distance between Jupiter and Saturn varies from something like 537 million km 2.32 billion km, so I guess it would be able to communicate with Saturn some times Earth can\u0027t but... not very much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the problem just obviously gets even worse for Uranus or Pluto. The very closest I think it\u0027s even possible Uranus and Pluto come to each other is something like 1.4 billion km, so you can\u0027t even communicate between those two at their closest point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo is it intended that we just not be able to communicate with the outer planets except for at optimal times of orbits when certain planets are closer to each other? Are signal blackouts just something to be expected? And are the very furthest planets meant to not even be able to send data back, necessitating manned flights if we want any control whatsoever out there? I\u0027m fine with this being the case if these are indeed what was intended but I just don\u0027t know if I\u0027m missing something or if something wasn\u0027t thought all the way through or what\u0027s going on here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny thoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
