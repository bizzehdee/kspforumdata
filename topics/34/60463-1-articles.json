This plugin solves this issue by throttling some engines down a bit. Or a lot. Or shuts them down. But the amount of torque provided is so much that you can recover from almost any nosedive. It also becomes VERY easy to control a VTOL, as their engines are far apart, and thus providing a lot of torque.
