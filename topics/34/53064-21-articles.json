When you burn level to the surface, you\u0027re only ever so slightly raising your apogee, you\u0027re mostly raising your perigee. However, once your perigee is near your apogee, *then* burning horizontal will increase your apogee. Think about it in 2d terms. If you\u0027re traveling up, and you accelerate forward (parallel to the ground), you keep moving your landing point farther and farther away from you (your apogee won\u0027t change). Eventually you\u0027ll go so fast your landing point will no longer exist (orbit) at which point the faster you\u0027re going, the further *away* you go before gravity pulls you back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: in other words, once your perigee rises above the earth\u0027s surface, \u003Cem\u003Eit quickly becomes the apogee\u003C/em\u003E. The point in the orbit you\u0027ve been raising so far, you continue to raise; the names just switch because the point on the far side of the world is now a higher altitude than the point near you.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-12T05:45:44Z\u0022 title=\u002201/12/2014 05:45  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 12, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by NathanKell\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Agathorn","CreatedById":99662,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-12T17:48:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor completion, here is the launch vehicle that is capable of doing it for me.
