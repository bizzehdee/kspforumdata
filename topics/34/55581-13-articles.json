We needed something like this to make our rockets smoother. Second, I\u0027m having a bit of a problem. It seems that the 1m compartment will always open up by itself while in the VAB aswell as soon as I load up the rocket for launch. The 2m compartment will not open at all in any stage. I\u0027ve tried as the info says to open the 2m compartment and close the 1m compartment but no result. I don\u0027t even get an option upon right clicking the compartments. I use other mods such as KAS and Universal Storage. Is anyone having this same issue?
