The node never really disengages, just how the stock module works, which is why the stock grappler is built the way it is... if it wasn\u0027t inside of the big container\u00A0it\u0027ll just stick\u00A0to anything that gets close enough. So in the adapter you have to click \u0022Release\u0022 each time you disengage/engage the grappler. :/\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI thinkin it might be better the make the drone core welded onto an adaptor and make the whole thing 0.625 sized. retain the RCS thrust and the grappler so you can stick it anywhere that\u0027s convenient.\u00A0It\u0027s really the only way to manipulate heavy objects... you have to attach a bunch of RCS around the mass for somewhat balanced controls or you just end up spinning around the massive object when you try to translate it... no amount of MechJeb is going to help you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022AjzDxb9.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022750\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/AjzDxb9.jpg\u0022 width=\u0022855\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI might tweak the design a bit this was my first version. My idea was drone core (I use life support, I might make a manned version just for a single crew transfer option) with the docking port pusher in front so it could dock to my space station port, grabber unit mounted in reverse so I could pull heavy loads (seems to wobble less than pushing) \u00A0You can see I placed the two engines so the empty craft will have zero translation torque when empty but I realize this is a futile effort since It\u0027ll create a tremendous amount of torque once attached to a long heavy load. I\u0027m wondering if it would be possible to define some preset configs with action groups. I have a procedural test weight, I could figure out some common load sizes and maybe use a action group mod to set the RCS value based on a few common size ranges...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow I am using mechjeb but even with manual docking mode the ship was spazzing out and basically wobbling everywhere.

I\u0027m only suggesting this because if it\u0027s lower thrust and lower ISP I\u0027m not sure i\u0027d ever use it, but if it was say lower ISP but higher thrust as a tradeoff, and maybe generated more heat so you can\u0027t run it as much, maybe that would make it more appealing.

All SAS and RCS were on for the grabber arm and command pod, and there wasn\u0027t any nonstop jittering. Tried to move 5x largest stock 3m fuel tanks around, was pretty much impossible with only the tug. Now I\u0027m seriously thinking of some 0.625m RCS drones, single part with graber, remote, RCS and RTG with little bit of Mono. Something compact enough that you could stick 6 to 8 around a central stem inside a 1.25m volume.\u00A0That was my original method around orbit, except each drone was a dozen parts and it took a long time to dock 5 drones around a fuel tank before I can dock the thing to the main station in orbit, plus I have to add half a dozen docking port jrs on every piece\u00A0I add to the station.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI see what you\u0027re sayin about Mono fuel option.

I\u0027m probably wrong about that too. Since Mono is essentially LF/Ox in a single fuel, it\u0027d make sense to have it higher thrust but lower ISP than LF only.

To keep it light weight and small it pretty much has just enough electric charge to undock, rcs fly to the opposite end of the target, orientate (maybe the drone ring has a indicator light, along with the main tug, to help optically align both systems to make sure they\u0027re lined up) and attach to the opposite end of the payload. Once the payload, drone, and tug are docked they should share electric charge and monopropellant, this also means if the drone had sufficenctly powerful RCS it should balance out the load and work in unison with the tug, with only one part to dock and align vs trying to park lots of little drones in specific locations on the target ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs long the the drone could provide a large amount of RCS thrust, and be dialed down, you should be able to balance the torque.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know what you\u0027re saying, what about docking?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA few options:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) The drone RCS ring being only one piece and possibly fairly cheap, can actually have a docking grabber on both sides and actually act as a disposable permanent universal docking adapter.\u00A0\u00A0Maybe the station can carry a stack of spares but this is not ideal so that brings me to point 2...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) The payload is lined up with the target, the tug gets on an intercept course, everything is lined up and perfect and you\u0027re closing in at 1ms or so, you undock the drone ring, which being fairly light will either be pushed along or maybe even be pushed out of the way, if not you switch to it quickly, translate sideways a tiny bit to clear the payload,and switch back to the main tug to finish the docking, it shouldn\u0027t drift too much if you\u0027ve got everything going right.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) The Drone ring has two grabbers as in option 1, you fully dock the station -\u0026gt;drone -\u0026gt; Payload -\u0026gt; tug. Then you have a toggle to disable the tug drone grabber/undock it/make it inert, so it will detach from both station and payload, translate it sideways and maybe the docking ports will then kick in with their magnets and engage?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4) Variation on number 2. If there is a way to use the decoupler force, or solid rocket booster, or something that triggers when decoupled, that is re-usable. You\u0027ve got the ship line up, payload about to dock, but instead of manually switching to the drone ring and decoupling it and flying it out of the way, you can bind an action group or staging stack \u00A0that when activated will decouple the ring drone, and fire a sideways mounted thruster automatically. It doesn\u0027t burn very long, it\u0027s not very powerful, just enough to kick it sideways when it detaches and move it out of the way at the last second before docking. Since it\u0027s a weak short thrust, it won\u0027t have traveled far by the time you dock, so when you dock you switch vehicles and fly it home to the tug.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nedit: Services bays closed during the whole mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-19T16:37:25Z\u0022 title=\u002203/19/2016 04:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 19, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Buster Charlie\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
