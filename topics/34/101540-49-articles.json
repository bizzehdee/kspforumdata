Not that anything does not work, with current TweakScale and KSP 1.3.1 seems like all stuff that should work really does it. But the very set of landing gears in KSP troubles me - it\u0027s really hard to match nose gear and main gears if you make high-wing or low-wing aircraft. Even with TweakScale you\u0027ll end up with either huge main gear and tiny front gear, or vice versa. I know, some people install four- or even six-wheeled gears in front, and yes, this is very kerbal, but still looks ugly and such planes almost can\u0027t steer. So I thought what if I\u0027ll scale wheel transforms independently? Of course, landing gear is, I guess, most complex part in KSP and there\u0027s not much room to play, but some still is. I\u0027ve made a patch for it and if you\u0027ll find that it worth it, I\u0027ll make the PR. Here are some screenshots to demonstrate how it looks like.  \n\nSpoiler\n\nA high-wing aircraft with LY-60 main gear scaled up to 156%, default wheel size. Front gear is LY-35 downscaled to 80%, wheel size is also default. Wheels look rather disproportional.  \n  \n![aZTLriq.png](https://i.imgur.com/aZTLriq.png)\n\nThe same aircraft, but front wheel is 110% with gear being at the same 80% and main gear wheels scaled to 75% with the same 156% gear scale. Looks better to my taste.  \n  \n![eyq5JvS.png](https://i.imgur.com/eyq5JvS.png)\n\nSo far I\u0027m only scaling the transforms; the mass, brake force and anything else was not touched, but if the idea will be accepted, I can make it, along with wheel width, for instance.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-12-17T14:44:54Z\u0022 title=\u002212/17/2017 02:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 17, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by whale\\_2**\n  \nFixed typo"},{"CreatedByName":"Neil Kerman","CreatedById":180734,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-18T02:30:06Z","Content":"Tweakscale isn\u0027t working when I use  it with parts in the pods category, Please help!\n\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pGxcaPb5m-MuZGGiEKr3Py1CNEDWFi51/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pGxcaPb5m-MuZGGiEKr3Py1CNEDWFi51/view?usp=sharing)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-12-18T02:30:32Z\u0022 title=\u002212/18/2017 02:30  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 18, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Neil Kerman**"},{"CreatedByName":"phoneix_007","CreatedById":179487,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-19T20:10:26Z","Content":"How can I add Tweakscale to any unsupported mod?"},{"CreatedByName":"Tyko","CreatedById":164179,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-19T20:51:40Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 40 minutes ago, phoneix\\_007 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E How can I add Tweakscale to any unsupported mod?\n\u003E \n\nit\u0027s in the [TweakScale documentation](https://github.com/pellinor0/TweakScale/blob/master/GameData/TweakScale/documentation.txt).
