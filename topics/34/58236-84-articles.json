RealFuels has to try to replicate the dry masses and volume utilization of *all* real launch vehicles. That means replicating very early, low-tech high-dry-mass vehicles like the R-7, but also modern lightweight things like Falcon or old even-lighter-weight things like Titan I or II. Consider that Titan I\u0027s first stage massed 76.2t wet and only 4t dry, including almost a ton of engine and also the interstage parts. That\u0027s 2 tons of tank mass for 72.2 tons of propellant (ratio 2/74.2 = 0.027)--pretty incredible!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and cryogenic is the type of highly-insulate tank that debuted in the late 1970s for hydrolox; for kerolox, use Default. If you want something closer to R-7\u0027s dry mass fraction, try using Structural. Or do like we usually have to do with replicas: add some LeadBallast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for too much fuel--decrease the Utilization slider. That\u0027s what it\u0027s there for.

The ballast takes the fuel space and vice versa and it depends on the utilization slider meaning that you can not set the dry mass and then fill the tank and set the full mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I do not yet understand from all that is how is it even technically possible to build something sane out of tanks as light as you described above. Both here and in real life. In your example you take a first stage of a launcher that still has something comparably heavy on top of it to push. That means that the thrust to weight ratio will increase like three or four times from launch to burnout. But what if it happens on a top stage? What do they do with it in real life? I guess I am doing something wrong but in game for me it is a common occasion to have an increase in acceleration of more than twenty times while the fuel is consumed. No matter how small the fuel tank size is there is just an insane difference in mass with and without fuel. In this case it is obviously impossible to choose engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically that leads to situations where there is a tough limitation of the minimal size of the payload. In some cases that minimum limit defined by the near burnout acceleration is higher than the maximum limit defined by the overall lifting capability making such a rocket impossible at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd one more time regarding the symmetry bug.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile there is yet no fix for it ready is it possible to get around it somehow and have working procedural side tanks?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd thank you for your detailed answers!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-14T15:23:44Z\u0022 title=\u002203/14/2015 03:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kitspace\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-14T18:02:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKitspace: Structural is one of the tank types, like Default or Cryogenic.

Satellites are built to withstand quite a bit of just pure acceleration. No different than your cellphone being dropped from a 23 story window and hitting the pavement below. It can survive the acceleration alone. It\u0027s the impact damage, be it the atmosphere or another object (like the ground) that can wreck havoc on a satellite (or your phone). Now a human rated craft is different, a Gemini launch really was at ~7G on SECO, but regardless, what you are seeing is correct, it is real, accept it. It\u0027s obviously been done before, so start launching. Also think that such a small payload will increase the dV budget for a launcher. The difference between a Titan w/ Gemini (that barely could make orbit) and a 333kg payload is roughly ~3000m/s. Which means that a lot of performance of the launcher is wasted to achieve the same orbit.

Look up just how many Gs the final stage of Juno I was, for the Explorers. As Story Musgrave said, that\u0027s how it works. Most launchers most of the time launch the paylaods they\u0027re designed for, and their burnout TWRs are generally \u0026lt;10 (if your TWR goes from 0.5 to 14 with your \u003Cem\u003Erated\u003C/em\u003E payload, you need to turn that stage into two stages) but if you insist on putting a 5kg payload on something that\u0027s designed for 5 tons, it\u0027s going to be crazy.
