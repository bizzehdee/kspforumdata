Xfers are instant. No waiting. No sound. BTW, even in Realism mode you can set the duration. IIRC, I set that up to xfer instantly if the duration was set to 0... Currently, the default setting is 5 seconds for Xfers, and 2 seconds for Moves within the same part. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: the durations I mention above are for Crew, not resources.
