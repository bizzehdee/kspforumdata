I now installed the SETI mod, which rebalances a lot. Now I am searching for the Vostok 1 mission, to place my very first satellite into orbit but it never shows up.

Best way to avoid this issue is to do contracts you do not intend to complete together on there own. The contract themselves have no way to tell what vessel is what. So if you accept a contract to land on the mun. And you happen to already have a vessel on the mun that you go too, most likely the land part of the contract will go green. I have a few checks that stop this mainly only a vessel launched after Contract acceptance will be aloud to finish the contract. But sometimes I disable this to make the contract more friendly to people that like to reuse certain vessels over and over.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Blacks","CreatedById":145137,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T11:38:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello there i want to report a little bug:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eversion: 1.12.3 it was download from CKAN \u0026amp; kerbalstuff for duble check arhive\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[ERR 10:13:33.907] Texture \u0027MissionControllerEC/Parts/MCE-LanderResearch/MCE_Parts_Norm_NRM\u0027 not found!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[ERR 10:13:33.930] Texture \u0027MissionControllerEC/Parts/MCE-OrbitalResearch/MCE_Parts_Norm_NRM\u0027 not found!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[ERR 10:13:33.953] Texture \u0027MissionControllerEC/Parts/RepairPanel/MCE_Parts_Norm_NRM\u0027 not found!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eexemple \\MissionControllerEC\\Parts\\RepairPanel if u will just look in \u0026gt; mcerepairbox.mu on bottom of file u will find this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMCE_Parts_Spec.tga, MCE_Parts_Norm_NRM.tga, MCE_Parts_Emis.tga, what explain way this error aka when it was make conversion to new texture u was forget to ajust or clean rest of info\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehoupe it help \u0026amp; cya around\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Braincooler","CreatedById":89902,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T12:44:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would like to report a bug (or maybe I do it wrong)...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn contract \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003ETIROS 7\u003C/span\u003E, I\u0027ve equipped my rocket with \u0022Universal Storage Thermometer\u0022 AND \u00222HOT Thermometer\u0022, but it don\u0027t validate these parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for this mod anyway \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"malkuth","CreatedById":57414,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T22:54:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Blacks\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Blacks\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHello there i want to report a little bug:\u003Cp\u003Eversion: 1.12.3 it was download from CKAN \u0026amp; kerbalstuff for duble check arhive\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[ERR 10:13:33.907] Texture \u0027MissionControllerEC/Parts/MCE-LanderResearch/MCE_Parts_Norm_NRM\u0027 not found!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[ERR 10:13:33.930] Texture \u0027MissionControllerEC/Parts/MCE-OrbitalResearch/MCE_Parts_Norm_NRM\u0027 not found!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[ERR 10:13:33.953] Texture \u0027MissionControllerEC/Parts/RepairPanel/MCE_Parts_Norm_NRM\u0027 not found!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eexemple \\MissionControllerEC\\Parts\\RepairPanel if u will just look in \u0026gt; mcerepairbox.mu on bottom of file u will find this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMCE_Parts_Spec.tga, MCE_Parts_Norm_NRM.tga, MCE_Parts_Emis.tga, what explain way this error aka when it was make conversion to new texture u was forget to ajust or clean rest of info\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehoupe it help \u0026amp; cya around\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECkan Just needs to be updated for the newer version of Mission Controller.
