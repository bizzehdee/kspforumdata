Although I had the same problems as a lot of others, the solutions didn\u0027t fix the issues in my case. So I thought I would share my findings as I spent hours and hours working through the issues. I hope to save other people this time. As always, the solutions were very simple! *SELF FACE-PALM*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I had two issues. Firstly, I had the strange situation where Kerbin would be all white with swirling red patches. This turned out to be the lightening mod. For my rig, this is the only feature that I had to remove. Frankly, as much as I love the lightening, I am just pleased that I only have to part with one feature. If you have this feature installed and you see the swirling white/red Kerbin you need to delete the file \u00224 Astonomer\u0027s Lightning\u0022 located in: \u0022Gamedata\u0026gt;BoulderCo\u0026gt;Clouds\u0022 as well as the texture file \u0022lightning\u0022 in \u0022Gamedata\u0026gt;BoulderCo\u0026gt;Clouds\u0026gt;Textures\u0022. You should now see a normal Kerbin when you reload the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second issue was the pink clouds, which others have had. A few ways to fix this have been mentioned, but nothing worked for me. Although these pink clouds didn\u0027t look too terrible on Kerbin and Duna, they looked hideous on Eve and Jool. I managed to match up the pink cloud pattern with the \u0022detail1\u0022 file in \u0022Gamedata\u0026gt;BoulderCo\u0026gt;Clouds\u0026gt;Textures\u0022. All I did was replace this one file with the texture \u0022detail1\u0022 from Better Atmosphere\u0027s V5. That\u0027s it! It cured everything for me. It is noteworthy, however, that Interstellar leaves Kerbin sparse of clouds. I don\u0027t believe this to be an error, as some have suggested. So don\u0027t think anything is missing when you see less clouds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope this helps some of you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Azunai","CreatedById":104025,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-04T15:53:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey guys, im running this pack as the only mods with 32bit and opengl..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut somehow antialiasing seems to be very lazy now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt doesnt seem like it would change anything on any AA setting and it all looks like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone else experienced it? or knows some way to tweak it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-SBxhUTmsyoQ/VKlfTwSsWyI/AAAAAAAAAi0/ZvaXLqb-A2g/s0/2015-01-04_16-42-02.png\u0022 alt=\u00222015-01-04_16-42-02.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: changed it directly in nvidia settings -\u0026gt; all smooth and shiny now\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-04T16:07:32Z\u0022 title=\u002201/04/2015 04:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Azunai\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Akinesis","CreatedById":71042,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-04T16:05:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Azunai\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Azunai\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHey guys, im running this pack as the only mods with 32bit and opengl..\u003Cp\u003EBut somehow antialiasing seems to be very lazy now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt doesnt seem like it would change anything on any AA setting and it all looks like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone else experienced it? or knows some way to tweak it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-SBxhUTmsyoQ/VKlfTwSsWyI/AAAAAAAAAi0/ZvaXLqb-A2g/s0/2015-01-04_16-42-02.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-SBxhUTmsyoQ/VKlfTwSsWyI/AAAAAAAAAi0/ZvaXLqb-A2g/s0/2015-01-04_16-42-02.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnti-Aliasing isn\u0027t working in with OpenGL on 0.90.
