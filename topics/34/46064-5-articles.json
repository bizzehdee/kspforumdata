Basically even though I do not have \u0027using \u0026lt;mod dll name\u0026gt;\u0027 in the source, when I compile it the DLL I release has signatures embedded. When Fusebox starts, it checks if it can see other mods DLLs and if yes, it tries to use them but if the DLL is a slightly different version it stops working as you described. As an example, if I compiled with KAS 0.44 and 0.45 gets released, Fusebox says \u0027cool, KAS is available\u0027 but then dies because the version signatures don\u0027t match internally. I went to look at your log but it says access denied. I\u0027ll have to add version checking and probably add a window saying which mods it found, which were found but wrong version and which not found.\u003Cp\u003E landeTLS - see posts above.

The problem is that when fuzebox and rpm is loaded it causes the flightgui to freeze completly. To reproduce load the two plugins and a create any craft with a pod that has rpms and launch it. Unload fuzebox and the issue dissapears. Im also seeing intermittent gui issues(loss of camera control etc.) with only fuzebox loaded.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ratzap","CreatedById":75982,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-26T16:41:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the info, I\u0027m a bad man and I\u0027ve been enjoying the game recently \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E I\u0027ll get an update out soon\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"landeTLS","CreatedById":97925,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-26T16:46:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo rush man.
