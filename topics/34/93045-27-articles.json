I noticed a second indicator bar by the engine icon in the staging list, in red, showing \u0027Eng. Int\u0027, whatever that means. It seemed to me that whenever that graph went to zero, that was when controls locked up. It seemed to somewhat follow the throttle level.

I\u0027ve researched both \u0022Basic Capsules\u0022 and \u0022Improved Instrumentation\u0022 but \u0022Second-Gen Capsules\u0022 still says \u0022Technology has unresearched requirements\u0022. I figured it was because that tech node costs 100 research points and I\u0027ve only got the level 1 R\u0026amp;D Facility. I just figured I needed to upgrade my R\u0026amp;D facility (which is already in the works) so I wasn\u0027t worried. However, I\u0027ve got research points to spend and was looking at what nodes were available and came across \u0022Space Exploration\u0022 which only costs 90 research points. So what I find strange is the Gemini Cabin comes in the \u0022Second-Gen Capsules\u0022 node, and the Apollo Command and Service modules (plus the ascent and decent stages of the LEM) become available with \u0022Space Exploration\u0022 node. Meaning I can research the Apollo stuff faster then I can the Gemini stuff. And the Apollo stuff requires less research and fewer requirements. Wouldn\u0027t it make more sense to have the Apollo CSM and LEM become available with the \u0022Command Modules\u0022 node? Or at least have \u0022Second Gen Capsules\u0022 be a requirement for \u0022Space Exploration\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Not sure if this is the right thread for this but I noticed that the LR79-NA-13 (MB-3-3) has 831.8kN thrust and 292 Vac Isp in game. But according to the chart at \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.b14643.de/Spacerockets/Diverse/U.S._Rocket_engines/engines.htm\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.b14643.de/Spacerockets/Diverse/U.S._Rocket_engines/engines.htm\u003C/a\u003E, it should have 858.5kN thrust and 283.9 Vac Isp. The reduced thrust makes it more difficult to recreate the Thor Long Tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually, based on the chart I mentioned, all three MB-3 engines (LR19-NA-9, -11 \u0026amp; -13) are supposed to have the same 283.9 Vac Isp. Each just has more thrust. Was this done intentionally?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Still not sure if this is the right thread for this but there seems to be an issue with the \u0022Human Orbital (1/LEO)\u0022 contract. According to the contract information you\u0027re supposed to put a capsule with a single kerbal into orbit around earth. That orbit is supposed to be below 400km and above 150km. And you\u0027re supposed to hold that orbit for 9 hours. Well, the first 4 conditions seems to work just fine (orbit, earth, \u0026lt;400km, \u0026gt;150km) but the 9 hour condition doesn\u0027t seem to count. I\u0027ve run this contract a couple times now and every time, the \u0022Orbit\u0022 portion completes as soon as I get my apoapsis and periapsis right.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-14T21:38:24Z\u0022 title=\u002208/14/2015 09:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by chrisl\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerboineAddict","CreatedById":149777,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-15T05:40:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs there a way in RP-0 to unlock the more advanced engine configurations?
