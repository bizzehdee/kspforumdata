Four times the inline probe core weight and almost the same of the 2.5m inline probe core (0.5t) . I think it is already less attractive than for example the stayputnik or any other 0.625/1.2m probe cores due to its shape (one node only and rounded) and its weight even if it has more EC than the others (a 1.25 inline batterie is only 0.1t). The poor thing has enough drawback (I would decrease the weight to 0.3 in fact)\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDarn all of you and your sensible comments... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E lol\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve reverted the mass change back to 0. 4t.
