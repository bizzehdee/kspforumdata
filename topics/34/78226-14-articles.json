StageRecovery can handle recovering the core stage as long as it\u0027s dropped with a periapsis less than 20km, but as was mentioned it won\u0027t be flown back to KSC on its own. FMRS is better for that type of landing, as you can manually fly it down. SR is better suited for situations where you don\u0027t care much for manually landing things, like unpowered stages. I believe it also handles science recovery better, so science drop pods work better in SR.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rhu","CreatedById":136699,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-26T16:46:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWondering if someone can help me, it appears I\u0027m fairly clueless..am using a Mac and have downloaded the Stage Recovery mod.

If you\u0027ve also go the toolbar mod installed you\u0027ll need to make sure to make the button visible, but even without that you should be getting messages about successful/failed recoveries. You could send me a log file and I\u0027ll check if any of the debug messages are being displayed. It\u0027s possible that somehow the mod isn\u0027t being loaded correctly.
