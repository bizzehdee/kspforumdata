I do see two mods messing with RPM textures - although it looks like Texture Replacer is probably benign. However, Filter Extensions renames some textures. I\u0027d suggest removing Filter Extensions, and see if that fixes the problem; if not, remove Texture Replacer and see if that fixes it. If neither of those steps fix the problem, please post logs that include going into Flight (even if it\u0027s an RPM-enabled pod on the launch pad), so I can see what RPM is saying when it needs to configure the props for use.\n\nWill do.

It\u0027s throwing exceptions every frame. You\u0027re going to need to remove plugins to find which one is interfering - I don\u0027t have other people reporting the problem, so the issue is in the mods you\u0027ve got installed - if it\u0027s an outdated mod, I can\u0027t do anything about it.

It doesn\u0027t render on external parts, and you wouldn\u0027t be able to interact with those parts if it did.
