The female part is nothing but a ring that goes around the vessel that has a lip on it to catch the male arm. The male part is like the clamps seen above, but instead of simply clamping on, they use the multijoint framework to:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Move the arms from the resting position of closed (point straight upward, much like non engaged lander legs. The clamps protrude past the craft at rest by a bit) to 30-45 degrees.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Arms telescope out while still at the designated angle\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Arms close, aligning the vessel containing the female docking part. The spacing of the ends of the arms are not touching the other vessel, at most one leg touching due to, well, physics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Arms retract from their telescoped length, and on their way in will catch the lip of the female docking part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Arms stop retracting when they are at a designated length, finishing the process.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey undock by doing the same process but inversely. This is a tad more complex than the current methods, but it should be much safer. Might need to add a nose attachment to the two vessels to ensure no damage is attained IF they impact, but you could devise a method to better hold the lip, that is just a dumbed down version. Thanks to the telescoping, you can be in less suitable positions to dock and not have a problem.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"the_bT","CreatedById":3876,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-05T22:36:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Melfice\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Melfice\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs soon as you warp time beyond x2, the game goes on rails, effectively stabilizing the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Awaras\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Awaras\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd also switches off physics simulation, which means the two \\\u0027docked\\\u0027 parts will just drift apart...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously... but if you manage not to click on that little green arrow (I know its hard) then you can stay connected with something for a little while... with some tuning it might even be possible to push a sattelite on a different orbit or deorbit some junk or something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027m fully aware that you can\\\u0027t do the Apollo Moon Mission with this messy hack... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat will have to wait until real docking is implemented.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUntil then, if you\\\u0027re bored, maybe you try to put something in orbit around kerbin or mun and catch it with a second vessel?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\\\u0027s not easy ;P\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ultrasquid","CreatedById":10944,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-05T23:53:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like this docking claw idea and would like to see it developed further along something like sgtblazer\\\u0027s concept\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rustymcclintock","CreatedById":20487,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-06T00:11:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022the_bT\u0022 data-cite=\u0022the_bT\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis afternoon I came across a pretty neat idea (by some dude called rustymcclintock), \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat dude sounds like a BAMF 8)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBtw when i tried docking (like 20 mins after i suggested it on your post), it failed lol I couldn\\\u0027t line up because of the RCS bug.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bioman222","CreatedById":30364,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-03T04:09:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVery nice mod! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThough when you said it started spinning out of control, that made me think of (Here we go again!) a Gemini mission where Neil Armstrong ( and some other guy, not sure who...) were docking with another Gemini (again, not sure who) and they started spinning out of control when they docked.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"deker12","CreatedById":16613,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-03T16:39:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ecan\\\u0027t damned robotics make a bulky but useful docking port with claws?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vlad.
