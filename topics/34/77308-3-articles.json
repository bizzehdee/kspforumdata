When it actually goes past zero it even changes to \u0022maybe later\u0022 to communicate to the player the ship will still arrive but there is no idea when, in the hope the player decides to do something else for a while and check back later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NihilRex\u0022 data-cite=\u0022NihilRex\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWorks for me, delivering Rocketparts resupply to my orbital construction dock.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeans so much to hear that.

I would have to install the other mod make a bunch of missions again. It all sounds like a small amount of work, but you wouldn\u0027t believe how much time all this small stuff takes in practice. Therefore I rather aim for a versatile mod, which from a purely functional perspective can give the exact same options to the player.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough it falls short of the suggestion made by Disposeable, this mod already contains some hidden functionality to allow anyone with no programming skill whatsoever to create mission packs which can be used with this mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA brief tutorial for those interested:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E[B]How to create a mission pack for Routine Mission Manager:[/B]\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E[I]Preperation[/I]\u003Cbr\u003ECreate a new folder inside GameData but outside the RoutineMissionManager folder which will contain the missions of your \u0027mission pack\u0027. \u003Cbr\u003EIn the \u0022Missions\u0022 folder of this mod there is a file \u0022CommercialOfferingsPackMarkerFile\u0022. Place a copy of this file in your \u0027mission pack\u0027 folder.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E[I]Adding missions[/I]\u003Cbr\u003EStep 1 - Fly a mission you want your players to be able to order.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe mission is now saved in the \u0022Missions\u0022 folder. Since all mission are stored in folders named a random string of numbers, it might be difficult to find the folder of the mission you just flew.\u003Cbr\u003EUse the following steps to find your mission:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EStep 2 - In game open the GUI you normally use to order missions.\u003Cbr\u003EStep 3 - In the list of mission, click on the mission you want to add to your mission pack.\u003Cbr\u003EStep 4 - Press Alt-F2 to open the console.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EIn it you will see the entry \u0022\u0026lt;YourMissionName\u0026gt; in folder: \u0026lt;folder locations\u0026gt;\u0022. \u003Cbr\u003EWrite down the folder location. The mission you just clicked is saved in this folder.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EStep 5 - Copy the mission folder to the new folder which will contain your \u0027mission pack\u0027. You can optionally change the folder name.\u003Cbr\u003EStep 6 - After copying, open the info.txt file inside with your favorite text editor and change the \u0022CompanyName\u0022 entry to something else. \u003Cbr\u003EThis will make the mission available in every campaign and not just the one you flew the mission in. In addition it will display the company name in the dialog screen where you order the mission.\u003Cbr\u003EYou can optionally change some other variables like Price or MaxOrbitAltitude.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EStep 7 - Test the mission. This one is important. Check if everything is like it you want it to be.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ERepeat step 1 through 7 for all the other missions you want to add.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EZip the mission pack folder so you can distribute it to your players and instruct your players to place it in \u0022GameData\u0022 along with installing this mod. If you use non-stock parts you should of course instruct your player which part packs to install as well.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EPlayers will now be able to fly your missions in their games. \u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: do take into consideration this mod still has some bugs which make it unusable for an unknown portion of players.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFair enough.
