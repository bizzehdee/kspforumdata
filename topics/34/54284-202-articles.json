I seem to have a bit of a problem. Craft called Icarus IV 0.41b EL seems to have zero productivity. For the life of me I cannot see or understand why. I have in the same game a little test rover called Jack I. Now that does have a productivity. Not fantastic I admit, but it was rather to prove to myself that this mod does work in this install.

X and Z bounds stakes can help, too (right click on the stake when EVAed and relatively near).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, with care (particularly when surveying), there is no craft that EL cannot build (in theory, some mods do cause problems by throwing exceptions during their startup).

The survey system was initially a solution to another design goal I have yet to realize, but in the process of getting it working, I realized that with adequate control over the survey site (which the stakes do provide), the survey system was an excellent solution to the problem of building on uneven terrain. I even made it so you can use launch clamps on builds (check the title page of EL\u0027s manual: that\u0027s actually a screen shot of a Mun base with Kerbin in the sky; you can see a clamp in the lower left and one just above the kerbal\u0027s head).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[fyi, screen shot converted using Inkscape\u0027s Path -\u0026gt; Trace Bitmap]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Apaseall","CreatedById":176515,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-26T17:32:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/57176-taniwha/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002257176\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/57176-taniwha/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@taniwha\u003C/a\u003EThanks for the reply.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is good to know that there is no good reason for something I pick not to be built.
