Basically, on average, every day\u00A0(the period is also random, can be more or less) the mod checks chances that a kerbal gets sick, cures the sickness or loses immunity, depending on their current state. The chances are determined by the sliders: e.g., the Avg. Untreated Sickness Duration slider set to 10 days means that, every day, there is a 10% chance of the sickness being healed. TBH, it\u0027s not really an accurate estimate based on the theory of probabilities (the actual average sickness duration is a bit shorter than that), but it\u0027s easier for the player and for me. So, TL;DR: there is no min or max duration of sickness, depending on your luck it can heal in a day or go on for months.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, wile1411 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003EVery minor suggestions (ignore any and all if no good):\u003C/u\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nCould the sickness value (-HP while sick) be a selectable range to add a bit of variety?\u00A0The idea would be so sick Kerbals are given a value between those values for when they get sick.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExample: I might set the sickness difficulty range set to -1\u00A0to -10.

It doesn\u0027t depend on the actual location on the part, so it\u0027s somewhat abstracted.

It means that 50% of radiation (both cosmic and artificial) will reach the kerbal inside. A shielding rating of 7 will bring this value to about 1% (because 2^-7=0.0078125). But a 2-seat vessel will require a shielding rating of 11 to achieve the same exposure. These figures are shown in the Health Report window in the Editor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAmount or even presence of ablator is insignificant, only the shield base is important. It is both easier to code and perhaps more realistic (real-life ablators are low-Z materials that have bad radiation shielding capabilities).

If it would be too difficult to calculate that per tick, you could just do a rough average distance between all the living spaces and all the reactors or something. It\u0027s just that having the nuclear engines at the end of a long truss, away from the living spaces of a ship, is a pretty common trope in SF and it would be great to have a reason to build something like that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve thought about it, but it\u0027s harder than it may sound. First, AFAIK, there is no simple way to get the distance between parts in one vessel. I\u0027d have to calculate it myself, and it would require lots of coding (you\u0027d have to pass the ship\u0027s part tree, find\u00A0the distance between connected nodes, take parts orientation into consideration,\u00A0etc.) for a rather small benefit. For the vast majority of vessels, cosmic radiation will still be a much bigger threat than their reactors. And it can also cause massive lag, at least until I do the optimization pass I mention above.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI could find a simpler approach: e.g.\u00A0require that radioactive parts didn\u0027t touch crew parts directly;\u00A0calculate the number of parts, not the linear distance, between the crew module and the nuclear reactor/engine; or give trusses a special property of shielding against vessel radiation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cyberKerb","CreatedById":28891,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-26T11:15:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nis there are part equivilant function like the function that gets the distance between two crafts?
