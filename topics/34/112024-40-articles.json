Typically, it\u0027s profile is the most suited to Duna transfer and to make things easier almost all Duna purposed craft are stacked on an MLS booster. \n\n**2)** Each Duna class lander has everything it needs to go from launch pad to Duna surface in one box. Pay attention to the minimum altitudes, park a few in orbit, and send them on a transfer burn as a group at the appropriate interval. It is also recommended that either by staggering their trajectory or burn time that you space out the arrival at Duna of each lander by about a day, so that it\u0027s easier to keep track of them when you arrive. Duna orbit insertion can be accomplished by direct burn to circle, with gravity assist options available to reduce transit time depending on your orbital mechanics skill level. Some craft have the capability for direct atmospheric braking for transfer, if your orbital planning skills are on point. Be sure to deploy the inflatable heat shield before interacting with Duna!\n\n**3)** The various MTV or Monkey Transfer Vehicle configurations are all very similar and provide different load outs and delta V capabilities, feel free to choose the one you like best. Each of these systems is a payload only. The upper stage included is for initial orbit. You must add at least one MTV Drive section, and can also add MTV drop tanks to spec. Typically, a complete Duna mission can be done with one drive section and one drop tank, with Jool class missions needing an additional drop tank. For your convenience, the XLS - MTV Drive and Drop tank provides both in one package.\n\n**3A)** After your chosen MTV payload is in orbit, remove it\u0027s upper stage to expose the massive docking plate. Your Drive Sections and Drop Tanks will dock directly there.\n\n**4)** MLS M-Rover is brand new and doesn\u0027t have a product information card yet. The rover functions exactly the same as previous rover versions from a flight planning point of view. Transit to Duna, go in heat shield first, power up the throttle at about 10,000 meters, stage the heat shield (which will activate retro motors) and burn the terminal engine down to a few hundred meters per second. Then separate the terminal retro engine before interacting with the surface, and use the final stage rover engines to land. **\\*** Be sure to disable torque on both rover base and ALCOR pod before attempting to drive. For parking, deploy landing legs.\n\n**5)** Your choice! Send everything un manned, perhaps a rover to scout for a good base site. Choose the landers that work for you and cluster them on the flattest place you can find. Send up your favorite transfer vehicle, and dock it with the needed drive section and drop tank, then send kerbals up to it on an Orion pod, then transfer everybody to Duna.\n\n**5A)** Most MTV payloads have a ready made Duna lander attached. For transfer of extra crew to the surface, stage a few Duna Return To Orbit craft near the MTV in Duna orbit, and shuttle them down 3 at a time. This will also give you surplus return to orbit capacity on the surface.\n\n![q454.jpg](https://image.ibb.co/kj7iSk/q454.jpg)\n\n![q66j.jpg](https://image.ibb.co/m4N07k/q66j.jpg)\n\n![q5565.jpg](https://image.ibb.co/ed03Sk/q5565.jpg)\n\n![q67667.jpg](https://image.ibb.co/bBhYSk/q67667.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-06-30T21:33:10Z\u0022 title=\u002206/30/2017 09:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJune 30, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by YANFRET**"},{"CreatedByName":"YANFRET","CreatedById":90547,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-02T03:10:36Z","Content":"**SLS - Orion Max**\n\nThe Orion System you always wanted, but were afraid to ask for.\n\n![S333.jpg](https://image.ibb.co/bAueKa/S333.jpg)\n\n![5555.jpg](https://image.ibb.co/fi5KKa/5555.jpg)\n\n![33g.jpg](https://image.ibb.co/m07N5F/33g.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-07-02T16:17:44Z\u0022 title=\u002207/02/2017 04:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 2, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by YANFRET**"},{"CreatedByName":"obijan999","CreatedById":179537,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-06T17:32:44Z","Content":"Is it possible (or planned) to make your parts combatible with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E LS ?"},{"CreatedByName":"rextable","CreatedById":119784,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-06T19:36:37Z","Content":"Chaps\n\nLove this mod!!!

Certain parts if you touch them too much you will go blind. Also remember when you scale something in 3 dimensions, you must scale the fuel supply in 3 dimensions as well: [http://study.com/academy/lesson/applying-scale-factors-to-perimeter-area-and-volume-of-similar-figures.html](http://study.com/academy/lesson/applying-scale-factors-to-perimeter-area-and-volume-of-similar-figures.html) \n\n*MODEL{  model = CMES/Hab/MonkeyPod\\_Lander/model  scale = **1.4, 0.9, 1.4**}    rescaleFactor = 1.0    scale = 1*\n\n    *node\\_stack\\_bottom = 0.0, **-0.855**, 0.0, 0.0, -1.0, 0.0, 3    node\\_stack\\_top = 0.0, **0.855**, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 3    node\\_attach = 0.0, **-0.8**, 0.0, 0.0, -1.0, 0.0, 3*\n\nHowever, the included craft are bespoke and comprised of many many different model styles, and the tolerances between the parts fitment is extremely narrow.\n\nThe pack uses a rule that 3.75 meter systems in KSP represent 5 meter systems IRL. So the frame of reference between Chaka and the rest of KSP is the 3.75 meter hardware. When you step up to the larger SLS / MLS components, that\u0027s what size they would really be if you were translating the 3.75 meter rockets to being replicas of 5 meter ones. So in order to have any compatibility at all and also realistically depict the SLS / MLS systems, the pack must be 75% scale. \n\nChaka does not want to be a widely comparable parts pack, rather means to an end to depict the systems shown in within a normal scale KSP game as realistically as possible.\n\nIt is what it is, but most of all...\n\n**Thank you for your kind words and continued support!
