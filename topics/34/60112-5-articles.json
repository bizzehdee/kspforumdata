In playing with them, I\u0027ve come across a few bugs:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. If you select one of the sub-menu in the SmartASS window (tested on OBT and TGT), the ESC button brings you back to the Plugin selection menu instead of back to the main SmartASS menu. Selecting SmartASS again will return you to the sub-menu you had previously selected. At this point it will be effectively impossible to return to the main SmartASS menu on that monitor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. On the TRGT -\u0026gt; TARGT screen, in the upper right-hand corner of the screen, the word \u0022GPS\u0022 is still there, and is obscuring the new \u0022PLGN\u0022 label.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. The words \u0022Radar altitude\u0022 are obscured by TRGT and PLGN in the upper right-hand corner of the INFO -\u0026gt; ALT screen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. When on either of the other two INFO screens, pressing 3 will not take you to the INFO -\u0026gt; ALT screen as 1 and 2 do for their corresponding screens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. This may or may not be a bug but, on the ScanSAT screen, 0 is labeled \u0022SWAP\u0022 but does nothing. Meanwhile, 9 swaps between color and grayscale displays. It seems like you intended for this functionality to be tied to 0 instead of 9. It would make more sense to me, anyways.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully you find this info helpful. It\u0027s possible that some of these may originate with RPM but I figure if any of them do, it would be fairly easy for you to identify them and maybe pass the info on to Mihara.

First off, the hotfix is sort of a rude one. You\u0027ll need to remove your old Hyomoto folder, even if you used 1.1c. All the Linux bugs should be gone, and there shouldn\u0027t be any more interface issues. This also opens it up for easier skinning support, which is my olive branch for being annoying and making stupid mistakes. Check out the black interface skin based on WaRi\u0027s work, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/fes6y44etptxrtm/KSI_MFD_1_1d.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKSI MFD 1_1d\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/0rwn5usg1pfusb0/KSI_MFD_Skin_Black.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EBlack Interface Skin\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I should talk about KSO. I need to sit down and see exactly what it does and what it needs. Helldiver has my blessing for using my MFD so I\u0027d like to make it as easy as possible to use a custom model, so for my next update I hope to work with him and other developers who want to do the same thing and see if we can\u0027t find an easy way to use a new model with the same files. This shouldn\u0027t just benefit me and those mod users, but anyone later on who creates a custom display for RPM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m trying to see about getting these types of features. I spoke briefly with ferram to see if we can\u0027t get a prop control for things like flaps or toggling his flight assists on and off. I\u0027m also working on modeling a few components for this purpose as well, but as an amateur that is a ways off.
