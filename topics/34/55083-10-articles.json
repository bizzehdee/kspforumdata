The thing I\u0027m considering (and I\u0027m only just trying stuff out, haven\u0027t had time to really get into writing it, been a while since I coded anything), is actually rather different but would work quite well together with your part-detector script. I mean, I\u0027m writing mine in c# too, so that could possibly become a join project.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy idea was to have an application that is somewhat disconnected to KSP (don\u0027t know how to deal with KSP GUI stuff yet, nor do I think I have the time for it) but that can parse and write to the tree.cfg file (either using KSPs parser which I already know how to use or I would write my own, pretty easy stuff) and has a simple GUI with a checkbox style list of all the mods the tree supports. Then the user can simple check which mods they have, hit \u0022Save\u0022 and the tree.cfg would adjust the tree accordingly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just wanted something simple to start with, but if could to the whole process automatically, with your part-detecting code, it would remove the user input all together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS. Does your code find all the part.cfg files or does it actually find all the individual PARTs? Because there are mods that have multiple parts in one part.cfg file.

I\u0027m from a php, python, pascal, c/c\u002B\u002B, basic background so the logic is all there, it\u0027s just getting used to how c# does things which feels almost alien to everything I\u0027ve done before!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe we should compare notes?!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy KSPTreeUtil was just reading the part files until I realised the other week (like you) that some mods don\u0027t call theirs part.cfg or have multiple parts in one file.

(It\u0027s a good job I like RegEx\u0027s!!!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, because of this, I started thinking that I need essentially 3 lists: 1 to show all the available parts, 1 to show parts that were already connected in the tree.cfg, and 1 to show unconnected parts that didn\u0027t appear in the tree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt some point down the line I would like to do something similar to ROFLCopter64bit\u0027s prog and show some kind of preview of the tree (if only to make the pos parameter make a little more sense to the average user!).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe I should stick this on github?
