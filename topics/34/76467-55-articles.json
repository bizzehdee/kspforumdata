Well...first you aren\u0027t using the decoupler that is designed between the Mercury spacecraft and the Atlas rocket. Second...that\u0027s scaling. Is it perfect, no. Because FASA \u003Cem\u003Eis not replica\u003C/em\u003E, which means that some artistic license was taken to conform to KSP\u0027s stock dimensions. HOWEVER, if you look at real pictures of Mercury - Atlas launchers the skirt between the capsule and the Atlas rocket was much longer AND also shrank because...guess what...the top of the Atlas Tank was smaller diameter than the Mercury capsule. Because of the way things were modeled the skirt is part of the decoupler and because the retrorocket is only so tall, the decoupler can only be so tall, which shortens the skirt in KSP even with RO. What I have done, while not completely accurate, is make a specific Mercury - Atlas decoupler part that is taller and by setting nodes within the decoupler, sinks the top of the Atlas tank within it, which decreases the visual discrepancy between the two. I can take a screen of the proper way to build it later this afternoon. A small change to this adapter and many more changes will appear shortly once I\u0027ve made a pass though FASA configs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lilienthal","CreatedById":119423,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-17T21:56:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022FreeThinker\u0022 data-cite=\u0022FreeThinker\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOk, exact what versions are you using?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.4.0 RT2 \u0026amp; RO 6a12\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Novasry","CreatedById":118501,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-18T10:26:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m having some trouble with delta V values from mechjeb.
