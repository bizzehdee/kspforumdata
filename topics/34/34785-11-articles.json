To correct the problem, set the time to a point after the launch of the current flight. If your MET clock is going backwards (I think it\u0027s actually just failing to show the negative sign), then you need to go... back to the future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is something I think HyperEdit should present a lot better, and I\u0027ll add it to my list.
