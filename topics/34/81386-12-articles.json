What are peoples thoughts on the way stock splits up fuel tanks and engines into separate research nodes later on in the tree? The Resistojet\u002BArcjet will remain bimodal though with the Xenon tanks in the same node so at least I know the player will have access to those.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hate the practice though I would consider it acceptable if they at least gave one of each first before branching off. fortunately the two mingle in the early stages of the tree where most of the rla parts have traditionally been. alternately with the ability to mod the tech tree giving some rla parts thei own branches and nodes might be an option to consider when not wanting to over crowd a stock node because its the only place the parts thematically fit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
