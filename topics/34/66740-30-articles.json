The gear wobble randomly kicks in, often without any control input, and way below the 100m/s\u002B that you\u0027ll need for takeoff. That\u0027s without going for a crazy excess of wing area or engine thrust. You also need most of the length of the (too short, really) runway, and it\u0027s rare for the plane to reliably stay on the centre line for that length of takeoff run, without some gentle corrective input. The problem hits with pretty much any gear setup, tricycle, quad, 16 main wheels plus nose gear, etc. The planes in question take off, ascend, reach orbit, descend, cruise, generally fly around, and land without issue, on the approx 1 in 10 occasion where the wheels don\u0027t dance around and cause a crash or abort on the takeoff run. Control surfaces are appropriately setup for yaw, pitch, and roll.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not a plane design issue, it\u0027s either a generic Unity wheels issue, or a need for some adjustment to the part parameters, or a bit of both. I do firmly believe that quite a lot of the problem comes from the way that Unity does wheels, but my gut tells me that there should be some way to sufficiently stiffen the connection of the wheel module to the craft body or wing (without a seriously crazy number of struts per wheel), or that there may be some gain from adjusting the wheel friction numbers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nsomnia","CreatedById":77129,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-26T04:30:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIve read there is alot of problems with wheels in Unity (hell Unity in general we are already pushing this game engine to the extreme).
