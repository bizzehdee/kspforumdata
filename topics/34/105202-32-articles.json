My idea was to have a smal white box with the NUMS Logo on it and on the site a QR-Code to the USILS forum site, with some other informations, like the ones on the tanks. In the box will be two 200ml (7oz) bags. Like the bags you maybe know from kids food which you can squeez, only a little bit bigger. One will be with water and the other with a kind of liquid food. Like a soup. I thought it should be a green soup because of Kerbal reasons. The bags will be both transparent plastic or for the water transparent plastic and for the soup aluminum foil. I\u0027m not sure about that now. Maybe I could put some cookies in it too in welded vacuum bags. First I only want to take cookies in it but I think it would be cooler and more spacey if you have all in sucking bags, even if I know that real astronauts haven\u0027t everythink in sucking bags. ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nI\u0027d like to hear your thoughts and a ideas for the soup and/or in general. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nI keep you up to date."},{"CreatedByName":"Grumman","CreatedById":76014,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-01T09:00:57Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Grumpy = tourist.
