Actually I\u0027ve read about the tiles a couple of times but I\u0027m just trying to convince myself that it\u0027s still not extremely unrealistic. same look on top and bottom is just so convenient in every way, also, I was getting so tired of painting those heat shields which took actually longer than painting a white top.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat you said temperatures on Kerbin reentry is also what I\u0027ve been thinking about, and apart from that, the Mk2 parts ultimately are designed for small to medium crafts, much lighter than a space shuttle would be, so I see them more as resembling a skylon style spaceplane than a shuttle, and skylon, because its so light is expected to only heat up to 1100K on reentry, almost half of what the Shuttle experienced.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen Reentry is finally introduced to the vanilla game one day, I could envision that the parts would have a certain heat resistance on their own, like a light 360\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 coating, which would be enough for very gentle reentry. Also however, I\u0027d love an option to upgrade the heat protection by \u0027painting\u0027 stronger heat tiles like decals on the plane by hand, or assigning them automatically by projecting them against a specific direction the player has to choose. So these tiles could be added anywhere, to the bottom of parts, or sides of say fuselages that are rotated to the side, or even cover the whole plane if the player wants it. They would add some weight to the parts tho, depending on the percentage of their surface that\u0027s covered, so the player would be encouraged to think carefully in which locations they are really necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not an expert but I\u0027m pretty sure it would be in the realm of possibilities to implement a feature like this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022drtedastro\u0022 data-cite=\u0022drtedastro\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENew, bigger, different, etc Landing gear is really, really needed.\u003Cp\u003EI have had to resort to using the B9 gear and \u0027tweakscaling\u0027 them to get all sizes that I need / want...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edouble bogey (axle), triple bogey, etc would be awesome....... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EH\u0027mmm, is that too much of a hint???????\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELoL..\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s say, what if someone was going to not only make smaller and bigger landing gear versions, but also planned to make a new model for the current landing gear, what changes would you like to see about it?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-03T17:31:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Porkjet\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Porkjet\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ELet\u0027s say, what if someone was going to not only make smaller and bigger landing gear versions, but also planned to make a new model for the current landing gear, what changes would you like to see about it?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy wishlist:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Retraction flush with the fuselage or wing to which it is mounted.

I use the main gear from KAX, however, for me it is more akin to a regional airliner setup (but still very usefull). In my opinion I believe we need a reworking of the stock gear which for me is suited for small aircraft.
