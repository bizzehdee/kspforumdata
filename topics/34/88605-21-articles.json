Back before part categories, the mod reduced part count by providing the ability to reconfigure the modules in flight. That functionality has been carried over into Pathfinder and expanded upon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo make the mod work with MKS you\u0027d pretty much have to start over with the templates because as I recall, there have been a bunch of changes in MKS. Last I looked there were a bunch of efficiency parts that might not fit the MBU, for instance. Further, MCM\u0027s plugins are not up to date with KSP 1.0 so you will need the plugins from Pathfinder. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo basically you\u0027d need to do a lot of work to update the mod, and it would be simpler to just use MKS if that is what you\u0027re looking for. MCM\u0027s license is permissive enough to do a re-skin as long as you credit my work. Of course, I\u0027m reconditioning the art assets for Pathfinder, so nearly all those cargobay friendly parts have a home in my new mod. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-31T18:36:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESide note as well.. if the concern is a cargo bay friendly form factor, keep your eyes open as I\u0027m knee deep in a total model rework and there will be some interesting changes \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"loppnessmonsta","CreatedById":58525,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-01T14:04:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI see.
