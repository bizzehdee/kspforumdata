I like the idea of having to manage those decisions, like which engine to use, from which \u0022company\u0022, and with which fuels to use.

I checked Wikipedia and Encyclopedia Astronautica mostly for my specifics. The fuel/oxidizer ratios are based on what was already in the XLS to begin with as a standard, actual engine ratios, or a list of fuel/oxidizer combinations with their ideal ratio listed (then edited in line with other engines).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor which mods get put into which category, I just picked them based on what I thought was a best fit. So, KOSMOS is a Russian-type, AIES is an ESA-type, HGR is a Chinese-type, etc. SXT is kind of in the middle, since it does both NASA-type parts and Russian-type parts. I dropped that in the Russian category because FASA has most of the space race era covered for NASA, and I was leaning toward variety.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only glaring problem is that I can\u0027t find a mod to fit the \u0022UK\u0022-style of non-toxic only fuels.

I really wanted to include as many fuel types as possible (which is partially why I added a Methane/LOX mixture to the \u0022SpaceX\u0022 category), so not using Kerosene/HTP is bugging me, even if it is/was rarely used. I would have used some MON* oxidizers as well, but I didn\u0027t find any solid data about its use and Astronautica apparently just calls it N2O4 anyway (ref: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSLV\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSLV\u003C/a\u003E vs \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.astronautix.com/engines/pslv4.htm\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.astronautix.com/engines/pslv4.htm\u003C/a\u003E ).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll that said, please do leave any comments/suggestions you might have about this.
