Question... When you revert to VAB does that gap persist? And you have to grab the stage and reset it under the interstage fairing? Then you go to fly and it pops off again? I solved this by using the stock launch clamps and more importantly I remade a new interstage fairing. Make sure that fairing also isn\u0027t clipping too harshly into the rocket. Make sure that with the \u0022y\u0022 key iirc that the sides of the fairing are just touching the next stage and not cutting into it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn top of all that.. make sure each part there is connected to the proper node. Sometimes you won\u0027t even realise that the IS fairing is attatched to a node somewhere farther up the rocket, but LOOKS as if its okay. Same with the engines and fuel tanks. Some top and bottom nodes are so close together on decouplers that mistake can easily be made. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would remake the entire problem area there.

The 2nd vehicle where you\u0027re putting a tiny part in between two larger parts will cause issues for you since breakForces are partly based on the size of the part in KJR, and putting a much smaller part there will encourage more breakage.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe small reaction wheel was a one-off experiment to see how it would play out, and was not part of the actual design. But nevermind that, I think I found the problem: excess struts between the boosters and the inline, as well as between each other. The latter struts in question werent even touching either of the problem parts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Motokid600\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Motokid600\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENice rocket btw. \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E100 tons to LKO in RSS, baby!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AbeS","CreatedById":80644,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-04T00:42:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E100 tons to LKO.
