Fairings (not to diminish the work done here, because this mod is awesome) are actually very easy, because they don\u0027t vary much in terms of texture or general shape. The shape is much more easily defined by math and logic than an engine would be. It makes sense to define them not in hard-coded terms but in mathematical ones. To define an engine like that, you\u0027d likely find that to get an engine that actually looked the part nicely would take-up just as many resources. Though engine bells might be an easier target, who knows. It\u0027s kinda like art though. Vector graphics (which are defined mathematically) are great, until what you actually want is a high-detail photograph. Then raster data wins out. And I\u0027m rambling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, engines that maintain their unique models but are tweakable in size (and adjust their thrust and fuel consumption accordingly), that\u0027s quite doable.
