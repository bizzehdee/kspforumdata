Start the game. Using your existing base setup, you can now build containers and place one wherever pipes will be needed. Just put it on wheels and drive it off the launchpad if you use them, deliver one by rocket if you don\u0027t. Disconnect and reel in all winches everywhere, dispose of craft that rely on winches being winches as appropriate. Once that is done, exit.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ERemove all part modules from 0.3 parts, adding a copy KasModuleGrab from a grabbable part like electromagnet instead where one isn\u0027t present. Now they don\u0027t work as winches and connectors, but you can detach them from the craft. Load the game and get rid of every winch, connector and connector port you have. The bases are inoperative at this point, but you have empty containers in place already.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EDelete 0.3 (including the container parts you have edited) and install 0.4, (which will include the container parts in their original form) start the game. If you left any connectors lying around as debris, they will now vanish, as will anything that you forgot to remove a connector from. Switch to every craft that contains a container and open it for a good measure to check if they\u0027re okay. That will make containers operable, they are now empty. Build a vessel that is just a container full of pipe endpoints and junctions, launch it and exit the game. Now you can edit the save file to fill containers with as many pipe endpoints as you need to restore everything, and you can look at the container you just launched in the savefile to see how to edit your containers that are at your remote bases to match. Look for \u0022CONTENT\u0022 section for the contents of the container, the format is trivial. You can edit in more pipe endpoints than the container would otherwise be able to hold, by the way.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ELoad again and reconnect the bases with pipes taken from your containers, you\u0027re done.
