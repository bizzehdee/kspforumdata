They must be mounted onto some other structural material (although due to their insulation value, temperature resistance is no longer a concern for said structural material), and they must be mounted as small individual tiles to allow for flexure of the underlying structure without shattering \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_thermal_protection_system#Detailed_description\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E(ref)\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe currently-under-development \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.reactionengines.co.uk/space_skylon_tech.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESkylon spaceplane\u003C/a\u003E is supposed to use carbon-fiber reinforced plastic structural members and aluminum propellant tankage, with a lightweight, insulating fiber-reinforced ceramic aeroshell to keep heat away from the very heat-sensitive internal structure.
