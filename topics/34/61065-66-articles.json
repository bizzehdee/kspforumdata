But originally I had new ribbons in mind. If we use the same ribbons twice, maybe it\u0027s doable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECloning the ribbons is not possible without changing the ribbon codes which introduces a very difficult problem later on. All ribbon codes must be unique; changing this would make a complete redesign neccessary that cost weeks of work with questionable success. But different ribbon codes for different gender are not a good idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGender specialized ribbon codes are not that easy to implement, because we just cannot clone them. Alternatively a second list for checking if a ribbon is already awarded is an option (a list for males and another for females); but then the check is done outside the achievement ribbon code and we can\u0027t change the wording by just changing the text. Ok, we can change the wording if we change the achievement class to generate the text for each kerbal. So wee need a class to generate the text and another to manage the two lists and the is-first-checks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd suddenly the simple idea turns into two evenings of work. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-12T07:42:11Z\u0022 title=\u002205/12/2015 07:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Nereid\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jpkerman","CreatedById":14965,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T12:31:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOrange suits could be for mission commanders and linked to the mission commander ribbons. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIMO, separate ribbons for male and female Kerbals would BE sexist.
