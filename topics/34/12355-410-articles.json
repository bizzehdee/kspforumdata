Try uninstalling it and seeing if you get the wiggle blasting off straight with just SAS turned on or even without SAS turned on. I haven\u0027t tried it without the dll loaded, but other than that it seems to be there no matter what I do. Once you\u0027ve significantly deviated then AoA limiting will cause the initial angle on liftoff to remain fairly large and then once speed builds up you\u0027re sunk. Fins on your rocket are also AoA limiters which is what causes the problem once you get moving fast -- you want that in order to avoid flipping, but as a result you have to watch how aggressive your gravity turns start. Also if your initial turn starts at zero and is simply too sharp then the same problem occurs. You want to start the gravity turn soon, but not too aggressively. I\u0027ve been using a start altitude of 0, end altitude of 55, final angle of 10 and turn shape of 66 fairly successfully (although I just about flipped on my last launch a few minutes ago when I forgot fins, so that profile can probably be better and then likely fins can be smaller).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, TL;DR i think there\u0027s a bug in the unmodded game causing the initial wiggle, and the rest of the issues are all due to the new aero model not MJ.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cicatrix","CreatedById":120831,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T07:16:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u002B1 to the Ascent guidance problem\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstalled v. 2.5.1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHad the following parameters: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETurn start alt: 8 km\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETurn shape 50%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELimit AoA 7%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMJ started the turn as soon as it get off the launch pad and flipped over the rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETried several times both with \u0027Limit AoA\u0027 option and without it.
