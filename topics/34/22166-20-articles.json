The thing about Scott Manley\u0027s series, is he is creating a narrative, by story telling and editing of footage, and does not necessarily portray things accurately, at least in that series. However I do remember him using some plugin, which enabled him to increased the range of physics calculations, by up to a 100 km I think, which would enable you to switch to vessels much farther away, before they get put on rails.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HGGundamReviews","CreatedById":57099,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-02T00:13:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt was the Docking Cam. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/lazor-docking-cam/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/lazor-docking-cam/\u003C/a\u003E However .. this mod has some odd interactions with the game and can and does sometimes cause things to explode.
