I found that Caterpillar tracks and Rollcage wheels refused to function, and even stock landing gear didn\u0027t work. I was also unable to adjust the ballast control without it resetting itself to zero.

Just one time I actually got the airborne carrier deck to fly off into the ocean, anchor it, and was able to land a few test craft on it easily. However, after that NOTHING worked. Some kind of data is clogged somewhere that basically freezes my crafts when using more than one hecto. It basically locks up, goes up 1m/s but never comes down, and refuses to acknowledge that engines are firing no matter where I put them on the model....carrier parts or balloons?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter launch boats usually go to the water.
