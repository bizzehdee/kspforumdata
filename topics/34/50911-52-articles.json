I had some serious part clipping going on with those 4Ks, but not the MK2s in the cargo bay.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-14T02:32:05Z\u0022 title=\u002201/14/2015 02:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by helaeon\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ferram4","CreatedById":21328,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-14T02:40:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry out the current dev build on the github repo, I think I may have fixed it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
