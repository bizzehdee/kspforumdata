Since .OBJ was an accepted file type to work with, and since it worked in Windows, I assumed it would work in Mac OS X. Unfortunately, I was wrong! :-X\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter starting KSP in Max OS X with my parts installed, it never loaded. I kept getting that \u0027KeyNotFoundException...\u0027 error. I decided to test your file type theory by exporting one of my parts as a .DAE file to see if that had anything to do with the error... It did. Now that I\\\u0027ve figured out how to fix the problem, I\\\u0027ll be working to convert all of my parts into .DAE format. The only problem is that 3ds Max doesn\\\u0027t want to cooperate when it comes to .DAE exports (Trust me, I\\\u0027ve tried everything!). I need to import my .OBJ exports into Blender and export the .DAE from there. I\\\u0027m hoping it won\\\u0027t be too time consuming...
