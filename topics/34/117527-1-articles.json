The emphasis is on surface exploration, particularly with large rockets and large landers.\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTES:**\n\n- This is still considered a \u0022work in progress\u0022 and \u0022wide alpha\u0022, meaning that ship-breaking changes can still happen. I\u0027ll try to minimize this, of course. The highest likelihood of this happening is in removing or redesigning parts, in a way that makes your vehicle either not function as originally planned, or the vehicle can be \u0022deleted\u0022 if the part is missing or unloadable.\n- The pods don\u0027t currently have custom IVAs. This will come later.\n\n**This pack includes:** (as of 0.2)\n\n- 3-Man Lander Can\n- 4-Man Capsule\n- Several sets of large landing legs (the \u0022medium\u0022 set will handle Mainsails, and the \u0022large\u0022 works with Mammoths).\n- Large radial and stackable parachutes\n- Long static ladders\n- Very long deployable ladders\n- Service bays / rover garages.\n\n**Part of the NecroBones suite of mods, that work nicely together:**\n\n- [Modular Rocket Systems](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/93067) (stock-alike parts pack, NASA-like alternatives, and filling the gaps)\n- [SpaceY Heavy Lifters Parts Pack](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100408) (stock-balanced large rocket parts, 5m parts, large SRBs)\n- [Color Coded Canisters](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/104660) (replacement models/textures for stock fuel tanks: prettier, cleaner, and diameter color-coding for the tank end-caps)\n- [Fuel Tanks Plus](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/108238) (collection of large stock-like tanks with Color Coded Canister style)\n- [ColorFuel Lines](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/128042) (color-selctable fuel lines)\n- [Lithobrake Exploration Technologies](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/130517) (lander parts, large chutes/legs/ladders/etc)\n\n**Images:**\n\n\u003Ciframe frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Download From:**\n\n[SpaceDock](http://spacedock.info/mod/93/Lithobrake%20Exploration%20Technologies)\n\n*-or-*\n\n[ksp.necrobones.com](http://ksp.necrobones.com/files/LETech/LETech-0.4.zip)\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n![88x31.png](https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-sa/4.0/88x31.png)\n\nCreative Commons 4.0 Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike\n\nCC BY-NC-SA\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Change History:**\n\n    0.4 (2016-10-12) - KSP 1.2 Update.\n     - Updated categories for many parts.\n     - Added KSP 1.2 sound effects and additional variables for landing legs.\n     - Added transmitter modules to command pods.\n    \n    0.3.6 (2016-07-12) - Tweaks.\n     - Added an optional experimental config for RealChute integration (for the radial chute only). \n        - To enable, rename \u0022GameData/LETech/Patches/LETech_RealChute.txt\u0022 to have \u0022cfg\u0022 instead of \u0022txt\u0022.\n     - Removed references to \u0022drogue\u0022 in the parachute tags.\n     - Added parachute deployment sound effects, as per KSP 1.1.3.\n    \n    0.3.5 (2016-04-22) - Transparency fix.\n     - Fixed the \u0022always transparent\u0022 problem for bays in the VAB.\n     - Adjusted the \u0022expanded\u0022 2.5m bay to use transparency only on the doors.\n    \n    0.3.4 (2016-04-17) - Tweaks.\n     - Tweaked leg settings.\n     - Moved leg wheel colliders to allow for more accurate aerodynamic occlusion.\n     - Legs reduced in mass quite a bit.\n    \n    0.3.3 (2016-04-01) - KSP 1.1 Hotfix\n     - Landing leg suspension systems working again.

I can certainly do that, it\u0027s just that it\u0027s hard to guess a good deployment height that will work well for most people. Which is why the springy landing-leg telescoping idea came to mind.

So, trying to store a rover that isn\u0027t a miniature in a cargo bay results with the wheels protruding through the cargo bay because a stable rover is supposed to be wider than a cargo bay. As a result, deploying rovers is a challenge. The ability to retract wheels, like the landing gear and landing legs do, however, would make rovers easy to store.\n\nAlso, square fuel tanks or structural parts, so it doesn\u0027t feel weird to put wheels on cylindrical tanks when making a rover that doubles as a lander."},{"CreatedByName":"l_d_johnson","CreatedById":148354,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T03:54:03Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Such questions belong in the CKAN thread.\n\nMy apologies, sir.
