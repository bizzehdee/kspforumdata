But I\u0027d like you to do what I asked first, since I have a feeling there is another mod causing issues.\n\nEdit 2:  IMPORTANT - Before you do the run for the logs, please do the following:\n\n1. Remove Deep Freeze, start the game and get to the MainMenu\n2. Alt-F12 to bring up the System popup\n3. Click on Debugging, and then select the line which says \u0022**Immediately Flush Log File to Disk**\u0022\n4.
