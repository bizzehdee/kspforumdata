I loaded up one craft and flipped it off the pad then launched another and when the one on the ground unloaded the exception detector didn\u0027t come up, and the KSP output log isn\u0027t reporting any issues. This is using a KSP install with only ShipEffects and Exception Detector installed.\n\nEDIT: Second attempt at replicating the NRE spam... Launched a ship into a 75km orbit, launched a second ship to rendezvous with the first ship, once rendezvoused I even made the ships lightly tap each other to make sure I was close enough, then raised one ships orbit so that it would leave range of the other ship... Once the other ship unloaded (Tested while warping and with real time through the unload) it still failed to produce and NRE spam in exception detector or the output log. I\u0027m going to attempt one last time by docking 2 ships in orbit and undocking then awaiting the unload, if this doesn\u0027t cause the NRE spam then I\u0027m dismissing it and playing with the mod anyways.\n\nEDIT: FOUND IT! I sent up one ship and then another to dock with it, but while attempting the rendezvous I accidentally rendezvoused with one of the ships from my second attempt at causing the NRE spam, so I went to thrust away from the ship I had rendezvoused with and all of a sudden Exception Detector starts spewing out NRE\u0027s at about 70 throws per second... **ShipEffects.SEMaster.SoundFX** : Now that I know the issue ***maybe*** I can apply my limited knowledge and fix it.\n\n    NullReferenceException  at (wrapper managed-to-native) UnityEngine.AudioSource:get_isPlaying ()  at ShipEffects.SEMaster.SoundFX (.FXGroup fx, Single volume, Single volCtrl, Single spread, Boolean play) [0x00000] in :0   at ShipEffects.SEMaster.SoundFX (.FXGroup fx, Boolean play) [0x00000] in :0   at ShipEffects.SEMaster.Update () [0x00000] in :0 (Filename:  Line: -1)\n\nI\u0027m still unsure about the exact conditions that I met in order to get the NRE to be thrown, but I\u0027ll do my best to figure out and test a fix.\n\nEDIT: I\u0027m having a really hard time replicating the NRE, making it very hard to troubleshoot the exact cause of the problem. \u003E\\_\u003C Though once I figure it out, I\u0027m fairly confident that I can come up with a solution.\n\nEDIT: Hey everyone I have some very good news! I have managed to finally replicate the NullReferenceException consistently which allowed me to very quickly pinpoint the exact cause of it and come up with a solution, on which note I now have a modified version of the ShipEffects .dll that appears to work flawlessly with KSP 1.0.4. I just want to do a little bit more testing and then I will go ahead and post it.\n\nEDIT:\n\n[**ShipEffects Sound Mod: Dynamic Sound Effects (Maintenance)**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/132289-1-0-4-ShipEffects-Sound-Mod-Dynamic-Sound-Effects-%28Maintenance%29-v1-0-0)\n\nI\u0027ve updated the mod to be compatible with KSP 1.0.4 and started a maintenance thread.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-23T05:30:56Z\u0022 title=\u002208/23/2015 05:30  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by CoriW**"}]}
