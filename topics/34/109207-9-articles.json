How does this differ from the scansat mod?\n\u003E \n\nNot a dumb question.\n\nOSP is lighter and more basic. No new parts, it simply hijacks the stock resource overlay system and changes the way the M700 works. It also adds a biome overlay toggle.\n\nSCANsat adds a plethora of features like different kinds of scans and parts to go along with them (altimetry, biome, anomaly detection, etc.), cool map projections, more complex scanning mechanics (optimal distance for different scanners, fields of view, etc.), and probably other stuff I\u0027m forgetting or don\u0027t know about. I believe it\u0027s more loosely coupled with the stock insta-scan system and can either co-exist with it or suppress it."},{"CreatedByName":"jpinard","CreatedById":89401,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-07T01:35:36Z","Content":"cool thanks for explaining that!"},{"CreatedByName":"Wheffle","CreatedById":74893,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-14T06:30:38Z","Content":"Finally got around to running some quick tests with 1.8.1, everything seems to be working as expected.

If one of those things is true and you still don\u0027t see it, then it may be a bug and let me know.\n\n**Edit:** Also make sure you have the planet focused in the map view, not the ship. I chose to have OSP follow the same rules as the stock overlay buttons, in that they won\u0027t show up unless you focus the actual planet.\n\nAlso, I believe I have only tested OSP up to 1.8, so there is a small chance that any newer versions of KSP have introduced a bug. It\u0027s probably about time for me to test in newer versions, I\u0027ve just been hanging around in 1.8 for my own current playthrough so I haven\u0027t gotten around to it.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-10-09T18:01:58Z\u0022 title=\u002210/09/2020 06:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 9, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Wheffle**"},{"CreatedByName":"Spricigo","CreatedById":166502,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-12-09T04:06:56Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 10/9/2020 at 3:00 PM, Wheffle said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I try to check this thread periodically, although I guess it took me a month to notice your comment.

OSP isn\u0027t on that list, the most similar mod on the list is SCANsat which has notes mentioning custom Kerbalism configs are required for compatibility.
