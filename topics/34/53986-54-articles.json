The main issue is with the masses - there is no way to add the mass to the interstage part, because presumably people will be using procedural fairings or similar for that part (the interstage depends on the choice of second stage/payload). I could theoretically take that approach if I were to make new parts for all of the possible options, but that would be well beyond just a MM config then. And seeing as how there is already a very nice looking \u0022true\u0022 SLS mod in the works, I think that\u0027d be pretty redundant - my goal right now is just to get the stock parts to be accurate for what they were intended to be in the first place, adapted to RSS/RO and a few other tweaks to existing engines when there are multiple models already available for that engine. I have left the \u0022tank mass\u0022 portion out entirely though, letting it be calculated by RealFuels created tanks, or the default tanks included in the config, while setting the part mass (with basemass=-1) to be the \u0022dry\u0022 mass of the entire stage minus the engine block (since it IS a separate part already). End result is basically - you\u0027ll have flexibility in your tankage and the mass for it will be accurate, but if you choose to use the core stage as JUST a tank for something else, you\u0027ll have a different mass value for doing so than if you just made a procedural of the same size.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@ThorBeorn: If you are not doing rescaling in individual dimensions separately, it is much easier to rescale purely using rescaleFactor = X and setting your scale within the MODEL{} section to be (original scale/X). (In most cases \u0022original scale\u0022 will be 1, and I believe that is the case with all of sumghai\u0027s parts, but double check them to be sure).

There is more talk about the \u0022packaged density\u0022 that food should be over in the TAC thread as well. Also, bear in mind that the caloric expenditure of astronauts during a mission is historically much higher than any of the \u0022recommended daily values\u0022 given for general civilian use dirtside, and with very different nutrition requirements. Same issues when looking at MRE specs - they are 1200 calories each (on average) but still intended to have 3 consumed per day, minimum, for a soldier in the field in any situation where they would be eating MREs in the first place, because their expected caloric intake needs are much higher than the \u0022average\u0022 civilian at home reading ingredient labels. Coming up with these \u0022standards\u0022 here for realism isn\u0027t a bad idea - but they should be based on a TAC-supplied baseline value for mass AND volume, and it currently does almost nothing to provide the latter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, if the TAC update ends up being pushed off too far, or someone really wants something to use \u0022right now\u0022 - you can always take the stock containers supplied in the mod (use those for a baseline reference on stats, not any of the other containers supplied by different authors), figure out how much usable space a ServiceModule tank of the same size would have, and divide that volume by the number of TAC units the equivalent container provides - that would give you a good working volume per TAC unit, which can then be converted to liters via the utilization option in the tank definition. It\u0027s clumsy, but it has worked for me in the past (I created a completely new tank type rather than using ServiceModule though, with the new resource values in the definition, and then just applied it to appropriate parts as necessary). Since the recent changes to TAC I\u0027ve not updated it though, because of the good possibility that it is going to swap to using liters for units soon anyway - that\u0027s actually what got me to put my large-scale colonization efforts (fully developed self-sufficient bases on every solid planet with service stations in orbit around all, and full com/gps/mapping satellites for the entire Kerbol system was the eventual goal) in stock-Kerbin scale on hold and switch back to RSS for a while, though currently without using any life support addon \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-25T23:28:04Z\u0022 title=\u002204/25/2014 11:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 25, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by RaccoonTOF\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-26T00:29:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEasy enough to change the numbers to 3x MRE meals equivalent per day...
