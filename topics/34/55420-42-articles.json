Right now, every plugin author has to implement button behaviour themselves. Also, there is no consistent button style between different plugins\u0027 buttons.\u003Cp\u003EI have written a plugin that is targeted towards those plugins. Specifically, it provides an API for third-party plugins to provide GUI buttons to a toolbar. Those buttons then can invoke an arbitrary action specified by the plugin\u0027s author, such as opening a new window. The ultimate goal of this plugin is the separation of specifying a button\u0027s contents (such as text or image) and its action from the actual display style and position of the button. The player should be free to position buttons anywhere they please.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObject not found!
