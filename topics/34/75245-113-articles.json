It\u0027s a flight computer where you can run scripts. You can have one built for scheduling your burns, I found that very useful when building my initial RT constellation, among other fun things. For example, I like to have a script that runs at boot time and powers up antennas and solar panels when higher than X meters. While still fully compatible with Remote Tech, it doesn\u0027t matter if you have an active connection or not, as long as you fire the command when the connection is up and don\u0027t run out of power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a nodeexec script somewhere on their wiki, or I can lend you mine (although it\u0027s still rough).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENasa/JPL is experimenting with laser from low orbit.
