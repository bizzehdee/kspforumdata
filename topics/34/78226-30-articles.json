To paraphrase an excellent movie villain - \u0022if all biomes are equal, no one is\u0022. You\u0027d basically be introducing a reduced amount on recovery for all parts at all times. Not to mention that to get to say, the grasslands, the abstracted recovery team may have to cross mountains/water/desert etc which should count towards this reduction. So the entry in the changelog would be \u0027reduced recovery rate because I realised it would be harder to get to equivalent places in real life and recover/refurbish parts from these places\u0027. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI mean, IRL, this would likely cost more than just making a new stage from scratch - the only things on a spacecraft I know of that were jettisoned, recovered and re-used successfully were the Shuttle SRBs. Roughly $23M was spent on maintenance between flights and, depending on the source, $12 million to $70 million for fuel. Also of note, the SRBs weren\u0027t just polished and filled with propellant again, they were dismantled and some components were used to make new ones which means that they were pretty much breaking even on cost of recovery vs newly built. The point I\u0027m trying to make isn\u0027t that StageRecovery isn\u0027t realistic, but that if you take into account recovery logistics and refurbishment costs (continuing the real life theme of biomes affecting recovery cost), you\u0027ll end up reducing the refunds to pretty much to 0.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI mean, if you\u0027re cool with that, fair enough, but I just don\u0027t see it making sense, bearing in mind it\u0027s possible in KSP to circumnavigate Kerbin 3 times in a plane without refuelling, and that the different biomes are just different coloured grass and that deserts/ice don\u0027t hinder vessel performance or stats at all and kerbals don\u0027t breathe or get tired which means mountains aren\u0027t the challenge they are IRL etc etc..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt just depends what level of abstraction you\u0027re willing to take, in the end.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003EAlso, I may not have explained this too well because I may or may not be slightly inebriated. \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-28T22:44:18Z\u0022 title=\u002210/28/2015 10:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ObsessedWithKSP\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magico13","CreatedById":73338,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-28T23:07:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t want to give penalties to every biome, but even if I did they would be different amounts for each biome and it would be customizable for each one. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s easy to fly over some mountains, but finding a vessel stuck in the mountains, then landing near it, and then trying to get it into a plane/land vehicle, is much harder, more costly, and more time consuming than the same thing in flat grasslands.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd no matter what the default settings are, you can always modify them \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DiamondExcavater","CreatedById":72325,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-28T23:19:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was going to edit but there are responses, so basically I turned mod toolbar off and it works\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhats the ignore list and whats with potato?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere is the list which tell you every part ever recovered?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magico13","CreatedById":73338,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-28T23:23:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf a vessel is made entirely out of parts in the ignore list, it won\u0027t be recovered and you won\u0027t see any messages regarding it.

If you apply one, why not apply another? Desert means sand, water means water damage, ice caps/mountains means hard to get to, highlands implies hard to get to, grasslands/lowlands could mean hard to get to (depending on where on Kerbin these grass/lowlands are), the closest way to the badlands are by water.. Overall, there would be a net decrease in recovery amount (\u0022reduced recovery rate because I realised it would be harder to get to equivalent places in real life and recover/refurbish parts from these places\u0022).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I mean, grasslands on the opposite side of Kerbin to the KSC would be the same as grasslands right next to the KSC. Yes, distance would affect refunds, I know, but ignore that, it\u0027s the idea behind it. The far-away grasslands has no biome penalty, same as the grasslands next to the KSC, even though it\u0027s on the other side of the world. Forget distance for a minute, imagine that wasn\u0027t a contributing factor - if it was biome based, grasslands 180 degrees away from each other would have the same recovery rate even though one would have to travel via mountains/water/desert/any other negative biomes. Yes, I know, distance would mean that the far-away recovery means 0 recovery value, but that\u0027s because of distance, not biome. There would be no additional penalty on top of the distance, because it landed in the same biome as the one next to the KSC, when in actual fact, there would be a massive penalty due to the adverse conditions the abstracted recovery team had to go through.
