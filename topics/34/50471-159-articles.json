Honestly, it\u0027s more simple and easy to just do full RO and learn the right way, then to try and ease out of stock gradually into real life, that is if real world is what the end goal is. It\u0027s easy to read up on real launchers that exist, build something similar and go. Otherwise you have more trial and error, and when you do go full RO, there is even more shock to the system.

You\u0027re using FAR/NEAR, and a very tall skinny rocket, which makes the terminal velocity a lot higher, and the atmospheric delta-v loss a lot lower than with the stock atmosphere. Try taking off stock Eve or Jool with FAR, there\u0027s a huge difference.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as terrain height, I think there\u0027s just an altitude offset. Venus\u0027s \u0022sea level\u0022 altitude corresponds to about 4-5 km KSP altitude. Venus\u0027s lowest point is probably set as the 0 m altitude marker in KSP. KSP doesn\u0027t work well with negative altitude numbers, so that makes more sense than using an arbitrary \u0022sea level\u0022 definition (same with Mars too). The atmosphere is actually set so that the 0 m altitude marker in KSP corresponds to the 0 km altitude in Venus atmosphere tables like the one you linked. But I\u0027m not sure what altitude that represents (and I haven\u0027t found any data going below 0 km). In any case, it shouldn\u0027t make much of a difference since the scale height is very high near the surface, which means the atmosphere doesn\u0027t change much as you go higher or lower in altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-03T16:44:47Z\u0022 title=\u002209/03/2014 04:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 3, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by metaphor\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kitspace","CreatedById":109786,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-04T19:31:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat might be a stupid question but how to change launch sites in the latest version?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-04T20:03:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs I mentioned \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55145-0-24-2-Real-Solar-System-v7-2-8-14-14?p=1389838\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1389838\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E the latest Module Manager broke it.
