Set the value of the startMuted key to either true or false to use feature.\n\n**Installation**\n\nYou can easily install this addon by unzipping the contents of the supplied GameData folder into the GameData folder that is inside your KSP installation directory.\n\nThis is usually *\u0022C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\SteamApps\\common\\Kerbal Space Program\\GameData\u0022*.\n\n**Source code**\n\nYou\u0027ll find the source code of this addon in the \u0022Source\u0022 folder.\n\n*I hope someone in this universe, other than me, will find this useful. By the way, I really hate all this licensing stuff.*\n\n*Oh, and I\u0027m open to criticism and all that good stuff.* *This is my first add-on for KSP, so please be gentle*. *Actually I don\u0027t think I have to ask, since you are all such nice people around here* ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n*What are you still doing here!
