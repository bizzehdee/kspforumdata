Basically after clearing about 15-20km I\u0027d drop the nose to 5 degrees above the horizon and just burn like hell. I needed to throttle the jets back as it climbed to avoid a flameout, but by keeping on as much power as I could with the nose just up a little bit it would accelerate to about 2,200m/s, at which point the jets would stop producing thrust (their exhaust velocity now matching the airspeed). They were each producing newtons of thrust, not kN any more when I lit the ion engine.
