More sizes, more shapes, everything. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Also, I think it was pretty darn creative to give the option of having a fixed wing, or switching the texture to leave a cutout for the Squad Stock control surfaces to slot right in. Brilliant. Genius! A few critiques about that particular feature, and the wings in general: I\u0027d like to see the thickness of the wings match the thickness of the stock parts more exactly, as it is the elevons are just slightly thicker than your parts. Doesn\u0027t compromise function, it\u0027s just a visual thing, barely noticeable, but noticeable nonetheless. In addition, I really do feel that you could and should create LARGER control surfaces, and the wings/fins to accommodate them, because I\u0027ve found that, with some of my larger spaceplane designs at least, having just that one tiny little elevon at the rear of a wing or fin just really doesn\u0027t give much control authority for wrangling a large (I\u0027m talking 100 ton plus) spaceplane around the sky. How about this, create \u0027all-flying\u0027 versions of all of the existing parts, that would give HUGE control authority! \u0027All-Flying\u0027 means that the entire control surface pivots on a base part, instead of most of it being fixed with just a small elevon at the rear. For reference, see... well, just about all modern fighter aircraft designed in the last 30 years, actually. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E I\u0027m thinking of the F-22 Raptor, the F-35 Lightning II, the F-18, F-16, F-15, F-14, the list goes on and on. All of those planes have at least one \u0027all-flying\u0027 tail control surface. Anyway, I think you get the idea. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, some things (new parts, or additional versions of existing parts) that I\u0027ve found myself in need of lately as I\u0027ve been building various designs: Of course there\u0027s the \u0027K\u0027 cargo ramp, I know that\u0027s being worked on, just reiterating that request again. I also feel the need for \u0027half-length\u0027 versions of a few parts in this pack; \u0027J\u0027 and \u0027K\u0027 fuel tanks and cargo bays both are primarily where I\u0027m going with this request. Also, I find myself looking for \u0027J\u0027 and \u0027K\u0027 sized reaction wheel modules, the only parts in this pack that have reaction wheels are the cockpits, and that\u0027s usually not enough torque for a really big spaceplane. Maybe you could combine several features into a \u0027service module\u0027 part the way the MK4 mod has done, meaning that there could be a thin part that has reaction wheels, monopropellant, and several thousand units of electricity combined. I don\u0027t know, just an idea. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, also, how about a version of the new \u0027Valkyrie\u0027-cockpit-to-\u0027K\u0027-\u003Cstrong\u003EADAPTOR\u003C/strong\u003E part that does NOT have air intakes? Not that I dislike the part now, but sometimes I want to use other types of air intake designs, or no air-breathing engines at all, so I don\u0027t always need the built-in intakes on the adaptor part. That way, that huge part can carry a variety of things, like more fuel, passengers, you could do a version with an integral docking port as with the \u0027J\u0027 part, there\u0027s lots of things that it could be used for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, well, it\u0027s getting late here, or rather, early, and I\u0027m tired, so I\u0027ve probably forgotten a few other things I wanted to mention.

I think you have a great mod on your hands (aka a bright future in the 3d modelling industry). If you need any help, I would be MORE than happy to help.
