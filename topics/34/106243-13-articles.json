Is that actually needed for just the DLL to work? If the dependency check for that is failing, that might explain why it\u0027s no longer indexed.\n\u003E \n\nYou are correct. For the core version, there should not be any dependencies"},{"CreatedByName":"gonzo98x","CreatedById":102583,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-02T00:09:15Z","Content":"[@FreeThinker](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/117389-freethinker/) I posted this in the FuelTanks\u002B Forum and was asked to reach out to you. This is a cut and paste of that post.\n\nHere\u0027s a fun little trick\n\nStep 1) Take the MK1-2 Command Pod (Or any pod. I just happened to pick this one)\n\nStep 2) Attach the **Kerbodyne S3-10800-FTP** tank or the **S3-1800-FTP** or the **S3-21600-FTP** and tweakscale the size down to 2.5m.\n\nStep 3) Now remove all but leave the least amount of fuel and oxidizer in the tank. (This step is important) \n\nStep 4) ???\n\nStep 5) Watch the craft slowly float upwards. I saw this bug/feature lift my 38 ton MAV off the launchpad. \n\nNow this wouldn\u0027t be such a huge problem except that when the part floats up about 10 meters it then stays there and can\u0027t go any higher. Firing engines with a TWR of 2.00 doesn\u0027t move the craft an inch. It is stuck at the height and can\u0027t go any higher.\n\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\u0022font-weight:bold;\u0022\u003EThat\u0027s a tweakscall problem not FuelTanks\u002B\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\n\nI tested this using the stock 3.75 m **S3-3600** tank and did not have the same result. (Re-sized and removed fuel)  Also, if I take a smaller FTP tank and size it UP this doesn\u0027t happen. Likewise, if I use a 2.5 meter tank this does not happen. Only when I downsize the 3.75m tank and remove most of the fuel.\n\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong style=\u0022font-weight:bold;\u0022\u003EOK. Then that\u0027s a Interstellaer Fuel Switch issue\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\n\nThat might be the case. Though, Since I can only recreate the issue using a FTP tank (and only a certain sized tank) I figured i would mention it here. I did read how IFS put out a patch that was designed to fix some phantom force issue. Maybe that\u0027s what this is. Either way, I hope this helps.\n\nP.S. All mods have been update to their 1.1.2 version\n\nTweakscale 2.2.9\n\nInterstellar Fuel Switch 1.28\n\nFuel Tanks Plus 1.8.3\n\nAfter a bit of testing with Kerbal Engineer it seem that the craft has a constant vertical acceleration of 192 mm/s. And the craft will actually not level off but continue upwards *very* slowly. The previous point stands though that even if I fire my engines the craft will not move any faster\n\n\\*\\* A bit more testing - If while in flight drifting upwards at a breakneck speed of 192 mm/s I transfer fuel from another tank into the affected tank, the phantom force will disappear and the craft will plummet back down to Kerbin. If I then remove the fuel, the effect return to take me to the heavens. Painfully slowly.\n\n\\*\\*\\* Moar testing - If I add fuel to the affected tank to remove the phantom force, I can then fire my engines as normal and the rocket lifts up. Great! If I then remove the fuel and shut off my engines my craft will continue flying upwards at the current speed the craft was traveling at. (In this case it was 35 m/s) \n\nFor reference the dry mass of the tank is .33333 -This is when the force exists.\n\nIf I add fuel to the tank (I don\u0027t need to add oxidizer. It just needs more mass), once the mass goes above .8t the phantom force disappears.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-02T00:19:05Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2016 12:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by gonzo98x**"},{"CreatedByName":"StevieC","CreatedById":146665,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-02T00:22:58Z","Content":"CKAN pull, *s\u0027il-vous-plait*?"}]}
