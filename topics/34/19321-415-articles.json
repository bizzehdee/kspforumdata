True airspeed and indicated airspeed can easily be confusing. In simple terms, true airspeed is the speed of an object through an airmass. INDICATED airspeed is a measure of the differential between the total pressure and static pressure of an object moving through that airmass. At sea level on a standard day, true airspeed will equal indicated airspeed. As altitude increases, air density decreases, so there are less air molecules exerting pressure relative to the static pressure, thus indicated airspeed will diverge from true airspeed. In this scenario, a constant INDICATED airspeed will yield an INCREASE in TRUE airspeed. Bear in mind, the molecules of air are still travelling at TRUE airspeed regardless of the INDICATED airspeed, so for a given air density, MACH speed is dependent on TRUE airspeed (as is thermal heating due to friction).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn relation to the discussion on terminal velocity, terminal velocity is the speed at which the downward potential of gravity and the drag caused by the parcel of air acting on it are in equilibrium and no further acceleration is possible. In atmospheric flight, as an object falls into denser air, it will actually decelerate as there are more air molecules acting against the object falling. True airspeed will decrease, indicated airspeed will increase to a point. On a standard day, those two numbers would theoretically equal each other at sea level.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"psunavy03","CreatedById":135063,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T01:34:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOK, I just tried the new release to see if it would fix a bug I\u0027ve noted recently, but no joy.

I will launch a rocket just fine, and then create a maneuver node to Hohmann transfer to the Mun. Once this happens, pitch control goes all wonky. Specifically, I can hold down the \u0022S\u0022 key, and the raw pitch inputs will oscillate between full up and full down. Roll and yaw work normally. I deleted all mods except for Mechjeb and KW Rocketry, because if I deleted them, the game would kill my spacecraft due to incompatible parts. No joy. But deleting FAR cleans it right up again, no pitch control issues at all. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther things I notice: With SAS inputs, the spacecraft will damp out any oscillations in pitch. On disengaging SAS, Jeb inexplicably commands full pitch-down without any input from me, and then alternates banging the stick off the stops in the up and down directions, with no roll or yaw input. Again, this is not only seen in the behavior of the spacecraft; you can see the raw pitch inputs changing in the lower left.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne last weird thing . . .
