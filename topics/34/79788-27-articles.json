The satellite objective not completing is likely because you did not launch a new satellite for the company. You can\u0027t repurpose old satellites for these contracts. You have to launch a new one. That same objective also makes sure that your craft has power, an antenna, and is unmanned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is no interference between DMagic\u0027s Orbital Science, my mod, or Mission Controller 2. You can mix and match contract mods freely. Granted, when I patch, I reset your contract board, which also refreshes their contracts, but I am changing this with the next patch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConfiguration is shaping up nicely. I have about 200 settings saving to the configuration file and loading from it, and sanitizing the variables properly as they load.

One of the settings I am adding is a simple boolean that I will set to true when I patch. This boolean will force a reset of your contract board, but I am going to change the reset function to only target my contract templates, so it will no longer interfere with stock or other mods. Setting it as a boolean also gives you the user a chance to opt out of this refresh by forcing it to false after patching.

When I accept the contract, I can see the waypoints (in this case, on the Mun) and I\u0027m able to pilot my vessel to the region. I\u0027m then able, in map view, to select a waypoint and see the notification that a given waypoint has bee selected. I do see that the navball updates with a little wheel icon which steers me in the right direction. Once I reach the waypoint, the contract notification widget shows a checkbox next to the waypoint. Neat! So I jump back to map view to select the next waypoint, but find to my dismay, that the waypoints have disappeared from the map.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis seems to be more of a misunderstanding than a problem. The rover contract can actually complete without going to all of the waypoints. If it does this, the contract will turn green, but you won\u0027t see checkboxes on all of the objectives, and all of the waypoints will disappear. There is a text notification in the top left when this happens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rover mission isn\u0027t like the aerial mission, where you have to go to every single point. In the rover mission, there are a lot of points scattered in a small area, and all but one of them is a red herring. You have to find the correct point, so it\u0027s more like hide and seek. It looks like you might have just found the right point real quick. You get compensated for each waypoint you have to look through, so the longer the mission takes, the better, actually.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-23T22:38:39Z\u0022 title=\u002208/23/2014 10:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 23, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Arsonide\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Raven.","CreatedById":99340,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-24T01:32:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk, something is seriously not right with the satellite deployment contracts since upgrading to 0.57b.
