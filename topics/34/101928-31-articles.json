I\u0027ve got attached solar panels that I\u0027m trying to put back in my inventory so I can EVA around and put them on another ship.\n\nAre the Panels too large for inventory, e.g., greater than 300L, if there are other things in it?\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I believe the process would be that you need an Engineer Kerbal with an equipped tool (electric screwdriver or wrench), hold X to be using the tool, click over the solar panel to detach, then drop into inventory (may need to click and hold). I know that what you\u0027re explaining is possible with KIS.\n\nYou do not need to be an Engineer to put stuff into inventory. However, ONLY Engineers can attach/detach items to surfaces. And, as mentioned above, don\u0027t hold the X key to store."},{"CreatedByName":"Szara","CreatedById":142976,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T22:51:00Z","Content":"**Dimenus**\n\nHold G (or whatever you set your KIS grab key to) to change to the grab interface, leftclick *and* hold on the solar panel, drag to your inventory without releasing the mouse button until it is in your inventory. X is not required for this, but a screwdriver (or wrench if the panel is small enough) is. If the panel is too large you may need multiple Kerbals there, but the extras do not need tools, they just need to be close.\n\nOnce you have it in hand (mouse) it will be an icon, if the icon vanishes then you didn\u0027t hold leftclick and it has gone into drop/attach mode. You can then drop it, attach it, or cancel with escape and try again."},{"CreatedByName":"ACCount","CreatedById":20833,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T23:39:55Z","Content":"How can i attach a non-radial engine (\u0022Ant\u0022) to capsule\u0027s bottom node?

My suggestion: allow me to just release the part without requiring that I point at a nearby surface.\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhen I move items to and from inventory (left-hold mouse and drag), the Kerbal responds to the mouse as well by rotating, etc. Can KIS be modified to turn-off the Kerbal\u0027s behaviour? Or, is it something we just have to live with.
