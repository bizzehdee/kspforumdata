The problem is that it\u0027s also an entirely reasonable and fairly obvious application for the negative-mass exotic matter once it exists and you\u0027re able to generate it. Maybe it could be a post-Alcubierre drive tech, lumped together with the upgrade for the Alcubierre drives, if that would offset the insane utility even a little.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is a reasonable and obvious application. But in reality, it probably wouldn\u0027t actually work that way. The A/W Drive directly affects the curvature and distribution of space in a local area. It\u0027s not simply about adjusting the effective mass of the vessel. Neutralizing the mass of the vessel as you suggest would require even more tight localization of the effect, meaning there would likely be catastrophic effects if even a microparticle were to cross that threshold. And it wouldn\u0027t really neutralize the mass of the vessel anyway, it would merely counteract the distorting effect any matter has on the curvature of space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA more practical adaptation might be to say that the same exotic matter might be utilized by a different type of device targeting the Higgs Field instead, directly impacting the vessel\u0027s effective mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegardless, the primary reason for restricting the scope of that effect, rather than just letting the device completely neutralize it, is power. Odds are, such a device might work, but require as much or more power than the A/W Drive itself. Neutralization would require more than just the power to directly offset the vessel\u0027s mass. Like turning west instead of east when launching, you\u0027d have to double up to actually fully cancel it out. No, I have no scientific basis for that, because obviously no one can study it yet. Call me a visionary...it makes sense when put in with the rest of the workings of the universe. I could be hopelessly wrong though...c\u0027est la vie.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, 1/2 mass-capable drives of that type would take as much power as an A/W drive for a vessel of similar original mass capable of effectively hitting exactly lightspeed. Perfectly reasonable limitation on their capabilities, and prevents game-breaking. The only other option would be to write the device off entirely and never include it. Then again, I highly doubt by now that Fractal\u0027s even really thinking about it, anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022doom3607\u0022 data-cite=\u0022doom3607\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI would also like to note that you would still have to expend a great deal of delta vee even with mass-reduction tech in place, you would just have a great deal more of it and a far higher TWR.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re correct...but if the mass of the vessel were somehow effectively neutralized, it would carry zero (or nearly so) inertia. A single RCS thruster would be like having a dozen upgraded DT Vistas, because it\u0027s pushing on essentially nothing. And the crew would feel almost no acceleration, even if the ship went from \u0022zero\u0022 to near lightspeed within a fraction of a second. The various equations that factor in mass would still have measurable values in the end, but they\u0027d drop radically low when M becomes zero, or at least negligible.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tharios","CreatedById":84309,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-19T12:28:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ogamaga\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Ogamaga\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWill the KSPI tree be the same as the stock tree aside from the extensions?
