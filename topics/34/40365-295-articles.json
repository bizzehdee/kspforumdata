Talk about opening up a whole new side to the game. I usually avoid new parts packs as they often seem totally unbalanced or unnecessary but I\u0027m really glad I finally tried this. It took me a whole day of just having ships on the launchpad to work out most of what was going on - and I haven\u0027t even started on mining/refining yet.\u003Cp\u003EThe Alcubierre drive initially sounds very over powered - it generates fuel easily and basically for free and you can skip around all over the system in seconds but actually it\u0027s NOT by any means OP. The fact that you still maintain your velocity and direction relative to Kerbol after you jump means some potentially huge Delta-V burns. As you begin to understand how to utilize this you can begin to use it more effectively and by altering your position then using Kerbols gravity to slow down or speed up you can begin to do some very low delta-v transfers = but at the cost of it often taking almost as long as a Hohmann. Anyway, a well thought out non game breaking addition either way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThree things I would like to see however!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Get rid of the god-awful massive power button on the right hand side! Consider making it a lot smaller and movable like so many others do (Alarm Clock, VOID, Protractor etc) or better yet integrate into the Toolbar API.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Would it be possible to integrate scanning for resources into Kethane - I think it has an API for doing so if I remember rightly. It currently has a superb scanning system!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Can we have a slower warp speed? The slowest is still way too fast for maneuvers around smaller bodies (Kerbin even!) An option for a 10th or even better a 100th of the currently slowest would be superb and would actually allow for precision jumps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eblizzy integration is expected to ready in the next update I think.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can already map resources, thorium and uranium right now.

If you do please tell me how. I dont have a GameData folder inside of another GameData folder and I looked at the instructions of how to install it. Didn\u0027t work. I have been looking all over for how to install it or Q\u0026amp;As but i have found nothing that helped. Please if you know the reason why please tell me how to fix it.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is only one gamedata folder for the game. You download the mod zipfile, find the things inside the mod\u0027s gamedata folder and copy them to your install\u0027s gamedata folder. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr simply drag the gamedata folder from the mod into the ksp directory and the two folders will merge. So you should not have a gamedata folder inside of the gamedata folder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll ofcourse need to know where the ksp directory is on your computer. I don\u0027t know enough about macs to tell you where the OS installs stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WaveFunctionP","CreatedById":104784,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-09T00:53:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022mharkan\u0022 data-cite=\u0022mharkan\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThank you for your help, Warpfunction. I have my refinery floating in the ocean. I even moved it offshore a bit to make sure it was in the ocean biome. I can electrolyze water and aluminia and run the other functions as long as I have the resources, but not extract anything but thorium and uranium. Centrifuges work fine too. I did your modification and now I can extract lithium from the surface now at least. I\u0027m a bit hesitant to send my lander to Laythe or Eve still though in case my problem still exists there.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe land based lithium and water extraction only works on kerbin, because of those files I made.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure what you are attempting to do, but I know that laythe has ammonia in the oceans. I just returned from there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"teohoch","CreatedById":44862,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-09T01:04:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI clicked the tanks one by one, they appear enabled, but when y go to the VAB I can\u0027t use them\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
