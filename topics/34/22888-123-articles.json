Specifically, if I rotate it 45 degrees counterclockwise compared to its initial position, so that the BPC hatch lines up with the CM hatch, when I place it, it sort of \u0022sinks\u0022 into the CM and then can\u0027t be dealt with in any way, shape, or form except by deleting the entire command module and starting over. Can\u0027t even select it with a right-click or in action groups, much less remove it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, my tip of the day, for those who both use MechJeb and want to try to have a more realistic/difficult experience with the Saturns. The Saturn Instrument Unit that guided the vehicle during ascent used \u0022closed-loop\u0022 guidance during first stage burn (S-I, S-IB, and S-IC), then switched over to \u0022open-loop\u0022 guidance after staging and second stage ignition. Basically, this meant that during the first stage burn, the vehicle was flying a completely preplanned guidance program with no regard to outside input except for what the IMU was saying about heading and deck angle (angle relative to the ground); once the second stage was running, it switched to guidance that would actively fly the booster to follow the preplanned optimum trajectory rather than just following preprogrammed guidance commands. This can be simulated by turning OFF MechJeb\u0027s \u0022Corrective steering\u0022 option in the Ascent Autopilot before launch, and then turning it ON again after second stage ignition. This results in a more realistic flightpath (no hard pitchover to start the turn, then pitching back once it\u0027s going), and it also provides a bit more difficulty in that it\u0027s slightly less efficient in terms of delta-V. (Something in the 200m/s range for the S-IB with an Apollo CSM, in my experience.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis can also be applied, for realism, to the earlier boosters--I know that Redstone and Atlas used entirely closed-loop guidance, and I\u0027m not sure about the Titan II, but I wouldn\u0027t be shocked if all the Titans used closed-loop guidance for at least the first stage...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-31T14:50:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EApollo LES is underwhelming, to say the least.
