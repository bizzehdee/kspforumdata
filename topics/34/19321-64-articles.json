I would suspect that the strange air intake problems are due to the angle of the model transform being used for the \u0022intake forward\u0022 direction. Try angling the DSIs off by the amount that the plane yawed off axis and see if that \u0022fixes\u0022 the problem.

My reasoning for having the thrust maxed at 0 airspeed was that in that situation the engines would be running at Maximum Static Thrust, and that after take off they should naturally back off to Normal Rated / Maximum Continuous / Maximum Climb Thrust for the rest of the flight. I also know that engines do lose some thrust once they start gaining speed, but I guess that once you get into supersonic flight the numbers can change a lot (I haven\u0027t found any numbers for this stuff, really). If you happen to know of a better curve to use, point me towards it and I\u0027ll make the change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suppose the best way to explain \u0022assembly-based\u0022 is to start off with FAR\u0027s current \u0022part-centric\u0022 modelling. FAR currently attempts to figure out the aerodynamics of each part individually, with some simple changes for wings that are near each other, parts that are connected to each other, and known cargo bays / payload fairings. What this ends up meaning is that the drag of a part isn\u0027t affected by where it is in a stack, what\u0027s ahead of it / behind it. It also means that wings aren\u0027t modeled as one aggregate piece, but as a bunch of arbitrarily-shaped lifting chunks. Calculating induced velocities is almost impossible (so FAR doesn\u0027t bother currently) and each part needs to to run its own aerodynamic calculations. This is not only computationally wasteful, but the physics are (technically) wrong, even though they follow general trends and come close to being correct in most cases. In other cases (such as people using structural panels to build stock fairings) FAR simply fails completely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0022assembly-based\u0022 approach is to group the parts into collection of fuselage / nacelle shapes and wings; each of these fuselage and wing assemblies can then be analyzed to figure out the proper aerodynamics (and with probably no more than ~10 assemblies per craft, this means fewer calculations to run) and they can then apply the proper forces to each part. For a fuselage, if you surround an ugly assembly of parts with structural panels to make a fairing, it will act as a fairing under this scheme. If you build a hollow cargo bay, as long as it is closed it should naturally shield the cargo inside from the incoming airflow. Depending on how things go, I should be able to add support for induced velocities, some area ruling and some amount of multithreading, further reducing the computational load. So better performance and better aerodynamics, ideally.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, right now I\u0027m sitting here trying to work out an algorithm to get the cross-sectional area of a group of meshes on a particular plane that intersects some of those meshes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-09T04:21:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eferram, I am drooling beyond belief at that smorgasbord of update features!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taverius","CreatedById":11815,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-09T05:08:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E@tiron:\u003C/strong\u003E When you have engines in symmetry one will always flame out first - that\u0027s just a KSP bug.
