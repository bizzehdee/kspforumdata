Also thanks for the art work, very elegant! I know what you mean re the bio-hazard vs bio-num-num. I\u0027ll keep your idea in mind next time I\u0027m tweaking things, I\u0027d be inclined to see how the deco font in the OP looked though.\n\nRe \u0027plants in space\u0027 I think they have a lot of problems in zero-G or under gravity:\n\n- Zero-g and plant growth, I\u0027m sure they use gravity to set their/up down. So centrifuges for part of the lifecycle.\n- High plant density and ventilation work against each other\n- The \u0027root ball\u0027 would have to grow into some medium, which would have to be a recycle-able medium\n- The ideal CO2, O2, \u0026 humidity for plants is not what humans like =\u003E two life support regimes\n- There is significant \u0027wasted space\u0027 around the leaves to ensure light access and \u0027agri worker\u0027 access\n- Large proportion of plants are not edible =\u003E has to be recycled\n- So far it all looks very labor intensive\n\nThats why I like \u0027liquid medium micro-biomes\u0027 for space - algae, plankton, bacteria, sea monkeys, etc. It\u0027s all industrial and pumped around, any-g (just different plumbing), there is no need for a human to operate in the biome so it can be optimal (you like methane eaters or some sulfur eating hydrothermal vent native - no problem), and the lower down the food chain you eat the more efficient it is."},{"CreatedByName":"Cdr_Zeta","CreatedById":59015,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-24T19:35:33Z","Content":"Hello,\n\nBorroqed the Koylent Maker idea from BIOMASS !?\n\nBIOMASS also as an Algae Greenhouse, and in my opinion, for space survival, and reading what algae is best suited for in space, creating oxygen, not food !\n\nBIOMASS algae greenhouse does this; altho I have not looked at the resource rates, the idea is already there.\n\nBIOMASS idea for \u0027koylent\u0027 uses BIOMASS as a product to make food.\n\nI have not looked at the idea of making food out of algae; does sound interesting tho and algae could have a double use here; maybe a secondary food source.\n\nI also look at cryogenic storage of food; right now my long term food storage is MRE\u0027s; freeze-dried food.\n\nI dont know the shelf life of freeze-dried (?) algae food.\n\nHmm I reread the post; methane-eating bacteria for high protein pellets for salmon food ?! I will take this idea of yours (I also think I read it some where as well I just forgot about it. Growing fish for food; I didnt think if this; DUH ! Maybe Kerbals eat goldfish !

(Just ideas, for discussion.)\n\nWhile you can of course just duplicate the greenhouses, I think it\u0027d be more interesting to have a different set of trade-offs.  So I have a couple ideas for roles these panels could play in that system.  (And I don\u0027t know how hard they might be to do, so tell me if I\u0027m suggesting to much work.)\n\nFirst off would be a very high materials efficiency greenhouse (nearly 100% closed loop - a little water or minerals or both inputs if any, but no fertilizer), but have it increase homesickness slightly faster.  Basically, it supplies food much more effectively than the \u0027normal\u0027 cycle, but your Kerbals can tell it\u0027s not \u0027real\u0027 food, and they miss having real food.\n\nThe other idea would be that you could switch from \u0027food mode\u0027 to \u0027fertilizer mode\u0027 - so you could use these to produce fertilizer which you could then put into a more normal greenhouse to output real food.  (Which doesn\u0027t have the homesickness penalties.)\n\nOf course you could combine the two.  ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022;)\u0022)"}]}
