I was afraid something like that might happen at some point if people removed mods and still had craft in the list/storage. The fix is relatively simple if you\u0027ve done anything in the save file before. Just find where the craft is in the SPH storage (ie, it\u0027s the 3rd item in the list). This is referred to as SPHWH# (where # is the position in the list, with a zero index, so # = 2 in this example). Just delete the entire SPHWH# section and rename all the later ones (SPHWH3 becomes SPHWH2, SPHWH4 becomes SPHWH3, etc). You\u0027d also need to remove the whole Item {} section from the SPHWarehouse section.\u003Cp\u003EIf you get me the log file I can probably just write a quick patch to let you scrap it normally (and get what parts still exist back in your inventory).\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah, I thought to check out save file and just try to remove any references to it, pretty much without knowing what I\u0027m doing. But I didn\u0027t found it, so I\u0027ve checked on the backup and there it was, loading the game successfully So I\u0027m guessing KCT just erased it somehow, maybe trying to scrap or unsuccessful edit. (this happened before the vessel was complete)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn another note, I really don\u0027t think you need to check for full recovery of vessel so they go straight into the hangar. The way it is, is already cool. Instead I was thinking of leaving the plane sort or parked somewhere on the KSC, recover the naut, have some sort of refueling station( pretty cool if you have KAS). All that is needed is to spawn kerbals directly without a vessel or build time, and maybe reset sci experiments too. I don\u0027t know which would easier or best to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn yet another note, Does anyone play this along with remotetech?

Ones in orbit around Kerbin aren\u0027t too bad if you make sure to open the omnidirectionals in the VAB, but you can\u0027t target dishes directly in the VAB. In the advanced simulation configuration there is a button called \u0022Delay move to orbit\u0022. Activating that will give you three seconds on the launchpad before moving to orbit, which may give you enough time to target the dish somewhere useful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;edit\u0026gt; RT used to have a feature where if you turned on one of the debug menu settings (infinite EVA fuel I think) you would always have communications. That feature would be ridiculously useful during simulations if it still worked, but last I checked it didn\u0027t. Does RT have it\u0027s own debug menu? \u0026lt;/edit\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@NathanKell, I will give you a more elaborate response after I get to work. In short, the only procedural parts that are taken into consideration are tweakscaled parts. Everything else counts as one part (since they\u0027re stored by part name).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;edit\u0026gt; I haven\u0027t given much thought to procedural parts since the only ones I\u0027ve ever used up until now have been Procedural Fairings, which I generally don\u0027t recover (except the bases). It\u0027s still fair to me to have the reductions in time due to the part tracker (repeated uses) since they\u0027re still fairings, but I can see where the inventory might be a bit weird. Procedural fuel tanks and wings is a bit more questionable, but in general I tend to prefer simplicity and gameplay over strict realism. Since I don\u0027t want to have individual tracked items for tanks that are 1.5 meters long, 1.55 meters long, ... cluttering up lists and occupying massive amounts of the save file (if I saved the whole confignode), I\u0027m personally in the favor of not treating them too differently. At the moment you still have to pay for them at full price and you still have to build them (maximum reductions in build times are only around 1/10 for ships built entirely from the inventory. When you mix parts it suddenly takes much, much longer than that because newer parts are far more heavily weighted). Tweakscale was an exception because the parts suddenly start varying wildly from their stock versions, but for the most part are in discrete sizes. I personally don\u0027t like tweakscale and never use it except for mods that require it, like Infernal Robotics. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for multiple launch sites, I\u0027ve added an issue on \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/magico13/KCT/issues/16\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EGitHub\u003C/a\u003E for it and will try to get it in the next release.

I\u0027m gonna do my best to not break existing saves, but there is a slight chance. The good news is that the new system will make more sense and that the actual ships will be saved with the rest of their data (currently, ships in lists are saved in a different section of the save file from their KCT specific data and are linked to each other based on their order of appearance. The new system will save the ships as a subset of their KCT specific data, which makes a lot more sense). In order to allow a transition from the old system to the new one, I\u0027ll have to load the old data from the save, add it to the default KSC, delete all the old data, then save it the new way.

They\u0027re so convinced that time could never become a meaningful resource in a game with timewarp, so they very clearly have never played with KCT or watched KSP-TV on Mondays with OverloadUT (who has posted multiple times in this thread). I feel sorry for them in some respects and sometimes question the direction KSP is headed. I haven\u0027t been particularly impressed with the past few updates\u0027 \u0022major\u0022 features, but I\u0027m giving them the benefit of the doubt and am hoping things work out well in the end. It seems a bit of a shame that some of the best new features are done by mod developers and not Squad themselves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the things more directly related to KCT in your post \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E The BuildList\u002B window as I internally refer to it as isn\u0027t available in the editor because most of the functions aren\u0027t applicable there or will break things there and I figured going to the space center was easy enough. That might change in 1.1/1.2. It depends on how crazy I get with the GUI overhaul. Duplicating a ship in the VAB is as easy as loading the saved one and pressing the build button, so it didn\u0027t seem necessary to make the duplicate functionality available there. You\u0027re really not supposed to use the build list in the editor at all, but it was requested enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not positive about the last launched ship being saved as the autosaved ship, so take that with a grain of salt. There is a way to get a useful ship out of that though. The last launched ship is saved as a file called temp.craft in the save folder (go into the ships folder and you should see it next to the VAB and SPH folders). Just copy/move that and rename it and you \u003Cem\u003Eshould\u003C/em\u003E have a valid craft file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m getting excited about how I am planning on doing upgrades, but don\u0027t have enough to go into detail about it and it won\u0027t be for a little while. The basic premise will be a progression web (a tech tree in some regards) with a single unlocked starting node and several branches going off in varying directions (current model has 5 branches: VAB, SPH, R\u0026amp;D, Recovery, Simulations). You can unlock nodes down a branch to get more features (more assembly lines, discounted time on brand new parts, etc for the VAB/SPH) but will also be able to upgrade certain unlocked nodes (for instance, to increase build rates for an assembly line). Some nodes will have alternative ways of unlocking them (i.e. simulation bodies can be unlocked by purchasing them or by transmitting science from them). What have typically been considered core features will need to be unlocked (specifically the part inventory system and parachute based recovery of parts) and can be enhanced beyond their current capabilities (somehow \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis opens up a lot of freedom in my mind. If you don\u0027t care about recovering and reusing parts, then you can purchase upgrades to reduce build times for vessels using non-inventory parts. If on the other hand you recover everything (including fairings...) then you can spend some cash on upgrades that enhance that. You could simulate your important Jool mission by sending a small science probe around the system or just unlock the corresponding nodes with funds/science. Additionally, I\u0027ll be moving away from the point based system in science and career modes (but possibly using it, or a derivative, for Sandbox mode). I hope it will prove to be a straightforward system for users that enables a lot of choice, but it\u0027s probably going to suck on the back end. I am not that great at making GUIs so it likely won\u0027t be that pretty at first. I would gladly accept artwork to use for the nodes and background, assuming I can figure out how to display them, but I don\u0027t yet have anything to show to start from. I REALLY want to start working on it but I can\u0027t yet with school (in fact, I have a test I should be studying for...) but come Thanksgiving break I likely won\u0027t be moving from my computer for a few days \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JeffreyCor","CreatedById":93167,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-13T04:04:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOhh sounds like a lot of fun stuff coming down the path \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hyomoto","CreatedById":64780,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-13T04:50:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYour mod is good.
