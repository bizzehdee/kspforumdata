I know that EVE and TR work together fine as long as you don\u0027t install conflicting textures under each mod, such as EVE kerbin textures (under BoulderCo) and then conflicting kerbin textures under TR. Check that first to make sure you don\u0027t have multiple maps for each planet nested in the mod folder trees.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t used OPM, so I don\u0027t know where it would cause an issue, unless it\u0027s messing with stock planet textures.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chimer4","CreatedById":58864,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-16T18:14:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETurns out there were 2 copies of the city lights in the boulderco folder.

Glad you got the city lights working properly again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs the other stuff still all messy (Pinkish Laythe, sunflare issue, OPM not showing?) for you? If OPM is not showing up, be sure you have all the required OPM stuff. I think CaptRobau recently updated (1.5.2 is current I believe) OPM and when he did it, changed the mods that OPM relies on. It used to be reliant on RSS but now he\u0027s using KopernicusTech (a mashup of KittopiaTech and Kopernicus) for adding planets, etc... Be SURE you have the proper requirements for OPM or they will not show.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know OPM works with TR and EVE because everything is stable on my install. I do run the 32bit application and not 64 however...so that may have something to do with it if you\u0027re using x64.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chimer4","CreatedById":58864,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-16T18:51:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELaythe is no longer completely pink, although it does have a pinkish glow to it.

You can keep RSS (for the KSPRC portion, which is just the gradient of the sky to the horizon (usually fades to white in STOCK, Proot made it Blue and it looks a LOT better IMHO). You will, however, need to add the KopernicusTech stuff from the OPM download. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, if you\u0027re using CKAN, OPM does NOT install properly, you need to do it manually.
