Keep in mind that all my scans were taking place as 100x. I\u0027ll use Vall as an example, but it gets more dramatic the larger the object is. At 100km, the ship was moving too fast for it to scan correctly, so it ended up with large horizontal gaps. I then went up to 250, which made it a lot better. The best was around 300, which was relatively quick and very high res (it doesn\u0027t have any dots/lines in the in-game GUI, even at max zoom). I haven\u0027t mapped Tylo perfectly yet, but even at 300km it\u0027s moving very quickly, resulting in horizontal lines.
