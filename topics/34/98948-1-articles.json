Now every Kerbal boarded in a ship adds its mass to it. It\u0027s time to rework your tightly balanced space planes again! ;-) To help you with that a slider has be added to the part context menu in the editor. With this you can easily preview how your center of mass changes when transfering Kerbals to other parts, EVAing or boarding. You can also alter the Kerbal\u0027s mass in the settings file if you don\u0027t like the default. This also affects the mass of an EVAed Kerbal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBe warned!
