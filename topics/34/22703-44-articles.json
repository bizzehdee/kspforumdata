They updated the screen because it had not had any changes to it (except to add the spaceplane hangar and runway) since the tutorial version was released over a year and a half ago and they thought everyone would like it(I like the day-night cycle, that is helpful). Also one of the main things the new asas does is it makes it a TON easier to fly planes(I landed like 4 out of 6 tries on the runway! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E ) but not so great for rockets. the new way the thing works with the control wheels is a great improvement in realism. However, it does not run better on all machines as planned. It runs better in-flight on mine but the 10-20 second black screens get annoying. Overall this update could have been planned better, but it was going to happen some time in the terms of improving the quality and realism of the game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@Devo: I love your mods! you do such a great job on them. I really like the animations, and the fact that they typically don\u0027t bug out. I can\u0027t wait for you to update them(especially the WT-51), but I understand your problems and frustrations with the new update.
