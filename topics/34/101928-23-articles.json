Transmitting the data via the built-in antenna doesn\u0027t clear the experiments properly and results in experiment data duplication once the backpack is dropped from the inventory. Duplication also happens when a kerbal enters a command pod with data ending up both in the pod and the backpack (the pack falls off the kerbal though).\n\nIs there anything I can do to alleviate this issue?\n\nUpdate:\n\nAfter some more testing I can conclude that:\n\nWith ModuleKISItem.carriable = true, experiment data duplication occurs when dropping the item after transmitting data or entering a command capsule (and the item doesn\u0027t end up in the kerbal\u0027s inventory)\n\nWith ModuleKISItem.equipable = true, experiment data duplication occurs only when dropping the equipped item - unequipping and reequipping updates the science container though, and entering a command pod transfers the experiments (and the item itself) correctly\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-01T14:54:01Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2015 02:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Zorbaq**"},{"CreatedByName":"DerpyFirework","CreatedById":140209,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T10:31:04Z","Content":"It would appear as though the bug fixed in 1.0.2 (Resource mass added to dry mass) has returned in 1.1.
