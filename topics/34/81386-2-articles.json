You do have to be careful with those electric engines, they will utterly eat your Xenon/Monopropellant if you use them in denser atmospheres. And yes the RV-50 is now basically the same as the Linear 7, the reasoning is that when the parts used to have mass the linear was the same as the RCS block, and that didn\u0027t seem right. Since the balancing scheme now has RCS blocks being massless for some silly reason, the RV-50 is mostly just a cosmetic item. While on this train of thought, there\u0027s a number of parts that may seem flat out better or worse than stock parts because the stock parts just plain aren\u0027t balanced. So in order to have parts that have interesting variation in order to make the player think about what he wants to do, I had to ignore some stock parts when balancing. The best example of this is the 48-7S, which is an utterly ridiculous engine that is so overpowered as to be boring, there is no thought put into deciding if you want it or not.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E You could have the RV-50 distinguish itself by retexturing it to be a linear resistojet RCS the stock multifuel RCS module at least works for linear thrusters.\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022hoojiwana\u0022 data-cite=\u0022hoojiwana\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe costs for 0.625m parts are one of those things I\u0027m having to figure out by myself, the stock price scheme for those seems a little strange.

They follow a simple formula: \u0022LF price \u002B OX price = 23% overall price\u0022. This is true for Rockomax and Kerbodyne, almost true for LF-T (some deviations there), and not true for two \u0022unique\u0022 tanks - Oscar-B and Round-8. Regarding them and LV-1s, Squad might had the same balancing idea that I got when I did price patch for NovaPunch - \u0022unique\u0022 parts for advanced designs (tiny tanks and engines, or, in case of NP, low-profile engines) cost more than \u0022standard\u0022 parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERLA-s balancing seems alright with heavy Monoprop engines (they balanced against KW\u0027s SPS, as it seems) and RCS blocks. LF engines and fuel tanks looks too cheap for me (but that\u0027s me), monoprop tanks is totally off-balance (200 units in FL-R50 cost more than 750 units in FL-R1?). As for monoprop\\xenon engines - I don\u0027t know.

They\u0027re meant to compete with LFO engines, but you cannot do a straight ISP comparison to the LFO engines due to differences in wet/dry tank masses. The design intent was to create a family of engines that are basically on-par with the low-TWR/high ISP LFO engines, but with their own pros and cons. Generally speaking the MP engines are all pretty bad in atmosphere and are fairly lengthy, but with the MP tanks come out at lower mass (and thrust) for around the same d/v. The player has to make a decision if he wants to stick to more versatile, slightly higher TWR LFO engines or go with the overall lighter MP engines that are more focused on OMS-style duties. Turns out sticking an MPR-5 or a couple of -5R\u0027s on a capsule as back-up thrusters is pretty useful with the command-pod MP stores as well!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-14T02:56:51Z\u0022 title=\u002208/14/2014 02:56  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 14, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by hoojiwana\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jaxx","CreatedById":95312,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-14T02:07:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI for one I\u0027m glad the new MP engines actually have any use whatsoever, as they were the only part I never bothered using in the original implementation.

They do have an alternate tree, but treeloader is barely maintained, and they don\u0027t want to put any engines before ion propulsion cause that\u0027s the most primitive kind of engine they got.
