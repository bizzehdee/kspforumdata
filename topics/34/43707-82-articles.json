When floats, doubles, integers, and long integers are all called just \u0022Number\u0022 by the code, in an attempt to make things \u0022easier\u0022 for the user, that attempt backfires and makes things harder when a user sees a message claiming you can\u0027t add a \u0022number\u0022 to a \u0022number\u0022, or can\u0027t compare a \u0022number\u0022 to a \u0022number\u0022, and the user goes \u0022WTF are you talking about? Of COURSE I can add numbers to numbers. I do it all the time.\u0022 What the code was actually doing was complaining about two different types (say, Float and Integer for example), but then masking their type names when displaying them to the user, so they both got called just \u0022number\u0022, which leads to that ridiculous looking error message.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s been a lot of pull requests about trying to fix this with getting all things in the system to return the same type: Double, but I can\u0027t help but wonder if the right solution isn\u0027t to tackle this root problem:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Why on earth can\u0027t KOS cast between integers, floats, and doubles in the first place, as need be?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fact that something returns integer instead of double shouldn\u0027t BE a problem in the first place. There\u0027s plenty of very well defined type promotion rules for how to handle mixed number types in expressions. If you add an integer to a double, you promote the integer into a double first, then do the operation and return a double.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is exactly what happens using low-level primitives in C:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eint a = 5;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edouble x = 6.0123;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edouble y = x \u002B a; // works just fine because the expression temporarily makes a double version of \u0027a\u0027 to add it to x.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI find it really odd that this behavior gets lost when using objects like Integer and Double rather than primitives like int and double.
