I don\u0027t know what was happening there.\n\u003E \n\nI know it was one of the buttons on the right hand side of the screens maybe one of the bottom 2 I was literally just running the mouse around the frame of the screen in the middle in the mk1 mod and clicking like I had just mixed acid with speed, I haven\u0027t tried it again but I can test it to see. Maybe it was the red or green buttons on the right of the screen I\u0027m not sure it\u0027s kinda dark in space heheh.  \n\nI was shocked myself, (and a tiny bit annoyed I was going for a splashdown over 100km from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E and why I always play with quicksaves even if I\u0027m not recovering crashed ships phew) when suddenly I got the black loading screen and it just recovered jeb and his rocket and all of his science, as if he had been sitting on the surface. It left me just looking at the recovery screen at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E going \u0022Wh.. whai... wait what?\u0022. I went to the tracking station and checked it to see if there was some weird loading error and nope the only thing there was the launch stage at the top of the suborbital arc. Is it possible stage recovery is interfering with it? That can recover vessels on a sub orbital trajectory and I was in IVA focus not normal focus and the clicking may have been a coincidence. Though I imagine it would take a long ass time for stage recovery to pick it up and it hasn\u0027t happened since nor did it pick up the stage I released or give me a stage recovered message, and I haven\u0027t been clicking like nut just in case. I have no problem testing though. Maybe I\u0027m just guessing out of my kass now.  \n\nAs for the tourists I have just reinstalled the mod after borking my game and having to delete and reinstall KSP so I might have been using a slightly older version before I broke ksp, but it was definitely a 1.2 version when the tourists could escape. I haven\u0027t actually tested it on this install as I haven\u0027t gotten to the touristy bit. I don\u0027t feel it\u0027s worth it til you have the orbit missions so I will test tourist escapes soon. I love this mod by the way  \n\nI did my first IVA plane flight the other week and it was such a rush. Thanks for the mod. Now I want to mix this with a headset and a flight stick for maximum fun.  \n\nIs the \u0022stop pressing buttons [Insert tourists name here]\u0022 message a stock thing or a raster prop thing?  \n\nHere\u0027s some pics for the helping of the clicks.  \n![omfGdUv.png](http://i.imgur.com/omfGdUv.png)![64CJqZD.png](http://i.imgur.com/64CJqZD.png)![jvlYQrM.png](http://i.imgur.com/jvlYQrM.png)![knOttQD.png](http://i.imgur.com/knOttQD.png)  \n![J2LXQzT.png](http://i.imgur.com/J2LXQzT.png)![Vad1B6y.png](http://i.imgur.com/Vad1B6y.png)  \n![dGSmbJS.png](http://i.imgur.com/dGSmbJS.png)![uWpmUOs.png](http://i.imgur.com/uWpmUOs.png)  \n![oOKiPn9.png](http://i.imgur.com/oOKiPn9.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-11-01T13:17:50Z\u0022 title=\u002211/01/2016 01:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 1, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by ThatHomelessGuy**"}]}
