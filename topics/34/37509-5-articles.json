My preference is for the HUD to appear for vehicles close to the surface of the body, but not for vehicles in deep space (unless I really need it). Now I have to manually switch the HUD on/off (shortcut key would be great). I would like if your mod was able to automatically make the HUD appear based on altitude: if greater than a proper amount (like say, 20% of the radius of the principal body) it does not make the HUD appear unless switched on by the user, if less than the above set altitude, HUD appears (but can always be switched off/on).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Trueborn","CreatedById":65830,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-07T13:43:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause the decision of when to have the HUD on or off is pretty personal, I\u0027ll probably just stick with a keyboard shortcut.

The period clock has been replaced by a counter that displays the time until Ap/Pe or Ascending/Descending node (if applicable). The HUD\u0027s Periapsis readout uses the same option toggle to display negative values if desired.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe HUD\u0027s orbital mode should display when periapsis is \u0026gt; 500m and above atmosphere (if applicable) instead of occasionally turning off around apoapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe maneuver node\u0027s calculations have been improved a little bit, but are still not recommended for burns over 1000 m/s or so.
