There are right-click menu options to toggle it on/off, and to switch it so it\u0027ll target debris.  There are also quite a few configuration options (look at the GitHub for full details).  It\u0027s handy when flying rendezvous missions, since it\u0027ll target a craft automatically when you\u0027re in range.  And, if you\u0027ve configured it to target docking ports, it\u0027ll even select an available docking port when you get close enough (although it only selects the closest one it finds, so it can be tricky if you\u0027ve got a complex space station with lots of empty ports).  The FASA Gemini nosecone / docking port in the \u0027FASA Gemini IVA update\u0027 in my sig contains an example fully configured.\n\nOne other benefit of it: you don\u0027t need to be in IVA to use it - you can control it from outside the craft.  But an IVA maker can make props control it, as well (the FASA IVA has a \u0027Radar\u0027 switch, for instance)."},{"CreatedByName":"nukeboyt","CreatedById":68397,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-05T14:03:36Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 21 hours ago, MOARdV said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The simplest thing to do would be to make a MM patch to add it to a docking port (ideally, one on the nose of your ship).\n\u003E \n\nThanks.

Trying to position another pod\u0027s IVA correctly while in IVA is not trivial - Mihara spent quite a bit of time on it, IIRC, and he never got it to work satisfactorily.
