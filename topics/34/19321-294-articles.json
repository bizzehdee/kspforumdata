If it\u0027s at 100%, and the control surface (undeflected) would be at 5 degrees, then the control surface will deflect 5 degrees against the flow, and you\u0027d end up with 10 degrees of deflection; this is good for adding some automatic additional stability even though you don\u0027t quite have the wing area / tail area needed for it. If it\u0027s at -100% it will deflect with the flow and effectively maintain 0 degrees AoA; this is very good for having wing area \u0022magically\u0022 appear when you reach high enough AoAs, because the surface will stop being able to deflect and start producing lift. It\u0027s very good for hypersonic designs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, what you\u0027ve got going on there with the Cm (yellow) line is that once the plane stalls it becomes unstable. This is very, very bad, but not unexpected. The trick is to force the forward lifting surface to stall before the rearward lifting surface, which results in the plane becoming more stable once it stalls and helping to pull it out of the stall. So, how do we do that? Increasing the aspect ratio (span / chord or span^2 / wing area; compare a U2 [high AR] against an F-104 [low AR] to see the difference) or decreasing sweep angle of the forward-most surface. That will force that surface to stall sooner, making the plane much more stable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the Firehound is part Su-27, part F-18. The front is very Su-27-ish, the back is more F-18-ish, with the wings themselves being their own kinda thing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Behemoth1702","CreatedById":111620,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-26T00:25:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you for your helpful reply!

I kind of want to understand this more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Do wings in FAR have \u0022multiple areas\u0022? A front, back, middle? Or are they counted as ONE part.
