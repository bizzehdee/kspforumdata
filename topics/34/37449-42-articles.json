If the mod is too overpowered (and making food by adding a single part that only weighs a few tons qualifies) then it kinda negates why folks install TAC-LS - i.e. to add in both realism and the real logistical challenges of keeping Kerbals alive for long journeys (I\u0027ve been reading tons of papers on food generation for NASA mars missions, and it\u0027s an interesting problem space). As an example, a part I had modded to do the Waste/CO2 to Food/Oxygen conversion came in at about 10 tons per Kerbal - so it was pretty non-trivial and you had a high breakeven point vs. just sending food.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other, for those making bases, is (in my opinion) to have some kind of path to a closed system, so that there\u0027s an end game where you can just set it and forget it. this is what MKS does, it just makes it REALLY expensive to do so, so in a lot of cases, it makes more sense to just send in the supplies unless you\u0027re making a permanent base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust my $0.02\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-22T13:53:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd more a question for Taranis - is there a current plan to revise TAC numbers / mass / etc. (I know there are some community patches, etc. out there) as part of the official package?
