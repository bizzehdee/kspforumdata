The method used at the moment is not very sophisticated and is set up to give good results for launch performance of most common rocket designs but this causes a number of issues such as this one. In this case the simulation decides that the parts that are decoupled when stage 0 is fired do not include any engines or fuel so it activates stage 0 immediately as this will improve the deltaV. This is why the deltaV shows in stage 1 when the payload is detached but switches to stage 0 when it is attached.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have plans (and some beginnings of code) for a new staging mechanism that includes a UI to allow some control over the staging decisions but it is complex and I don\u0027t often get long enough chunks of spare time to get stuck into it. As a workaround, to see the deltaV with the payload attached you could try changing the root of your vessel to the top-most part on the payload.
