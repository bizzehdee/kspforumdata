When I activate and de-activate the landing legs, the plugin scans for parts about 20-30 times in a second. It made my game lock up.

The 4th button in the top-left corner (looks like music shuffle icon) is supposed to toggle the setting to keep showing the message in its original location on-screen.\n\n Occasionally it does show the messages, but a bit delayed, but most messages will not show.  I want to use One Window as an archive in case I\u0027m not looking when messages appear for a few seconds, so I can look back at what happened and when.  But I do not want to keep the window open to see messages. \n\nSo this mod is broken on 1.12.5\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-03-22T21:32:37Z\u0022 title=\u002203/22/2024 09:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Mar 22\u0022\u003EMarch 22\u003C/time\u003E by Ker Ball One**"},{"CreatedByName":"The Minmus Derp","CreatedById":187595,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-05-26T03:36:02Z","Content":"Would it be possible to make EVA struts work with the regular strut part?"}]}
