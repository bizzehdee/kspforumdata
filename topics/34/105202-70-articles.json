Similarly, hab multiplier(s) (cupola) will enhance the effectiveness of your hab space (hitchhiker cans).\n\nOn a different topic...\n\nI was posting a USI-LS config for KPBS on that mod\u0027s thread, and [@Kowgan](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/116874-kowgan/) pointed out that my configs were at risk of conflicting with the catch-all config included with USI-LS. There is some uncertainty as to the exact order in which ModuleManager applies patches. Consider [this example of a custom config](https://github.com/LouisB3/UKS-KPBS_Compatibility/blob/master/UKS-KPBS_Cupola.cfg) and its interaction with [LSModule.cfg](https://github.com/BobPalmer/USI-LS/blob/master/FOR_RELEASE/GameData/UmbraSpaceIndustries/LifeSupport/LSModule.cfg)...\n\n1. If the custom config runs first then LSModule, MM filters out the part when LSModule runs, because it already has USI\\_ModuleLifeSupport, so everything is fine.\n2. If LSModule is applied first, then we end up with two different USI\\_ModuleLifeSupport and USI\\_ModuleFieldRepair modules on the same part, along with competing quantities for ReplacementParts - not good.\n\nThen I considered adding the !MODULE[ModuleLifeSupport] filter to the custom config as well, which would prevent the duplication... but instead, if LSModule is applied before the custom config, the part ends up with completely generic modules and ReplacementParts quantities instead of the hand-chosen hab space/hab multiplier/recycler values. \n\nSo instead I am playing around with the edit-or-create function (\u0022%\u0022) in ModuleManager. As I\u0027ve never used it before, this is just an experimental first pass - but [here is a generic template](https://github.com/LouisB3/USILS-Patches/blob/master/USILS%20Compatibility%20Template.cfg). This *should* create the relevant bits if it happens to be applied before LSModule; if LSModule goes first, it overrides the generic values instead - no interference or duplication, and nothing missed.\n\nI guess the question now is - what\u0027s the best way to test it to confirm everything is working correctly?

The value passed to BEFORE or AFTER is the name of the mod, defined as the name of the directory directly under GameData?
