I tried it in sandbox mode, put a satellite in a 250km 0degree orbit, ran the timewarp as high as it would go and watched. It ran without problems with the vessel loaded for about 5 years. Then I returned to KSC and ran time forward and within 10 days got the SOI warning for the vessel and when I checked it, it was on its way to Jool.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I put in a new satellite and tried again from the tracking station, First with the vessel selected, no problems. Unselected vessel, and within a few orbits I see the orbit shift around the Mun and it crashes after about 10 days.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I then had a little brainfart and put 2 sattelites in orbit, one as active vessel, the other as it\u0027s target and both stay in their orbits in high timewarp. Unselect the target at 100000X timewarp and Titanus, here we come !!!!\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I don\u0027t suppose this little testing session will help a whole lot, I guess you would have tested the hell out of this bug yourself by now.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Mostly it stops me from doing contracts around the mun that require any orbital work. It\u0027s not a hoge hit but there are some very profitable StationScience contracts I have to pass on. And it stops me from doing a refueling operation on the mun.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I checked the forum posts and there seem to be no more reports of this issue coming in the last few months, so are there any other people still seeing this happening?\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Modlist:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E -New Horizons                 -KW rocketry\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E -KSP Interstellar E           -Infernal robotics\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E -KCT                                -tweakscale\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E -KAS/KIS                         -KAC\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E -TAC LS/FB                     -Station science\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E -Orbital science               -Mechjeb\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E -Scansat                         -and a lot of dependencies coming with these mods\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Anyhow, I absolutely love this mod and the challenges it adds, so KillAshley keep up the good work and thanks for still staying on this project.

I use CKAN so all of them should be compatible. I\u0027m also a sucker for planet mods... That\u0027s probably the issue I guess.\n\u003E \n\nAll the planet packs I can see are:\n\n- Asclepius\n- Extrasolar Planet: Beyond Kerbol - Stock\n- Kerbol Plus Remade\n- Kronkus Planet Pack\n- Other Worlds Star Pack\n- Outer Planets Mod\n- Saru Planet Pack\n- Spud - Adds a moon to Dres but Dres is already a moon of Jool in NH\n\nGreen are compatible packs, orange are unknown and red are incompatible. I\u0027m still working on the planet packs conflicts for CKAN, but it\u0027s takes A LOT of time.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-04T10:29:38Z\u0022 title=\u002203/04/2016 10:29  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 4, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Olympic1**"},{"CreatedByName":"AlexTheNotSoGreat","CreatedById":144772,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-04T21:58:56Z","Content":"Is there any chance that you could make more stock-alike textures for the added planets in this mod.

Unfortunately NH has undergone so many alterations due to the introduction of Kopernicus i still view this pack as \u0022held together by tape\u0022 pretty much. Actually this might be a good time to rectify that (after i finish my work with RSS)...let me type up a post for everyone to give their opinion on."},{"CreatedByName":"KillAshley","CreatedById":128696,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-05T06:45:54Z","Content":"*\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAttention\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E*!\n\nNew Horizons has been an active pack for (almost) a year now. HOWEVER many issues cause it to be held in contempt by myself. These issues drain my motivation to work on it and leave me with a general hate for the pack these days. I\u0027d like your opinion on how best to deal with these issues. There are a couple options, and ill go over them below.\n\n**\u003Cu\u003EOption 1\u003C/u\u003E**\n\n*Leave the pack how it stands now. Although this is the pack you all know and love, it frustrates me a lot and my motivation to improve it is at an all-time low. Don\u0027t get me wrong though, support is still there, and planets are pretty much scope-complete.*\n\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOption 2\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\n\n*Rework the bodies visuals to be better in line with stock \u0026 my other packs. If you have a look at my other packs, such as [UL](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/120111-105kopernicus-uncharted-lands-v03-13feb16-beta-than-ever/), or [KASE](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/132008-105kopernicus-kase-v01-13feb16-tentative-alpha/) you can see how much detail i can get onto these planets while staying in the realms of stock (compared to the hyper-realism NH has). Bringing in these changes will take time certainly, however they will add a better visual to the pack, and fit in better with my other packs and also other people\u0027s packs too. With this option i would also throw a lot of better changes to the planets, such as terrain variation, improved surface textures, lighting, etc.*\n\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOption 3\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\n\n*Rework EVERYTHING. There\u0027s plenty about the terrain that annoys me also, however the pack has been going on for so long that I\u0027m extremely hesitant to touch it as it can be game-breaking. This would involve remaking everything from the ground up, so theres no guarantee how it would turn out or how long it would take.*\n\nPlease feel free to voice your opinions here, as I\u0027d love to hear them, just please don\u0027t argue with each other about the outcome/their opinions. Everyone\u0027s voice is relevant at this point, so don\u0027t discourage other people from contributing. I\u0027ll leave this open for a while, as I\u0027m in the middle of another project atm, so this would happen (hopefully) once it\u0027s complete."},{"CreatedByName":"komodo","CreatedById":102065,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-05T10:04:11Z","Content":"First, thank you for making this pack: I have a blast playing it in 64x career mode.\n\nI would say either 2 or 3 would be good choices; in anything, intentionally building hate and contempt seems daft, especially so here in a recreational activity of all places. The pack as it exists will still continue to if someone is neck deep in a career, but I don\u0027t see why progress shouldn\u0027t be made, with special note that I think you should do what gives you the best feeling: It\u0027s your pack after all, we\u0027re just lucky enough to tag along for the ride! Timewise, again, the existing pack would continue to exist, so if an overhaul, major or minor, took some time, I\u0027d be fine with that.\n\nIn light of 1.1 as well, it might be the perfect time to ponder art assets, as a funny feeling tells me kopernicus won\u0027t be ready on launch day.
