So if you have a craft in Duna orbit pointed at Kerbin, it will link with anything in the Kerbin system that is also pointed at Duna. But within a system, you have to manually configure the network. I remember setting up a Munar network by putting an omni and three dishes on each satellite, and putting three around Kerbin and three around the Mun. Then each Mun satellite had a dish link to each Kerbin satellite, and omni links to each other, so there was always at least one path available.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BadManiac","CreatedById":5194,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-05T22:13:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022forsaken1111\u0022 data-cite=\u0022forsaken1111\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EUnfortunately RT2 doesn\u0027t do the kind of automatic routing you\u0027re trying to do.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EI really should.
