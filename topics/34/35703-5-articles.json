Both translational and angular.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe translational part alignement would help in building \u0022proper\u0022 geometry, especially when it affects craft\u0027s CoT vector (look for RCSBuildAid, it really helps debug CoM/CoL/CoT issues). I often in SPH try to add two parts that have perfectly matched main axis (front/rear) coordinate. So far, i can only visually check if parts have same position, which is with \u0022jittery\u0022 mouse control a tad hard, more on that later).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#DAA520;\u0022\u003EWorkflow\u003C/span\u003E (admittedly this is for SPH, in VAB it would work quite different, maybe polar coordinates ?) :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- add part A, to be used as alignement target\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- add part B, to be aligned\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- add part C, attachment target for part B\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- set part A as translational alignement target, also set which axis (main, transverse, vertical)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- select and move part B to part C, when part B is \u0022close\u0022 enough (at some predefined \u0022snapping\u0022 distance) it would \u0022snap\u0022 to same axis position as part A, if part C to which part B is attached part ALLOWS it, otherwise it could break editor (i was able to break it several times on complex geometry, had to exit to space center and go back)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- set part B in position as per usual workflow\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample for above workflow would be adding multiple docking ports (normal size) to fuel tank, all aligned to same position on main axis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe angular alignement would work pretty same as translational, but it should allow user to add part to any parent part as long as parent allows this (again, trying to avoid breaking the editor). This also has consequence that it must \u0022enforce\u0022 angle snap settings, ie if user has currently 15 deg snap and alignement target is 16 deg rotated, it must switch to 1 deg mode while alignement operation is active.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother problem is how to define a alignement root for manipulated part ? When part is in normal position (when selected from building icons) it can be attached to rotated parent and it will rotate too. So if this is not a big programming issue for you, user can be given option to either respect aligement of attached-to part center, root part center or even SPH center (same as freshly placed command part). This issue affects both translational and rotational alignement because of centering (user may not notice it for translational since rotational would probably be default).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother idea : user should be able to align part to be added to parent part as well. Example : add radial attachment to center of large grider instead of manually targeting (which causes part to rotate on flat surface). Also a choice to align to one or more parent part axes, maybe under a defined angle (maintain a 30 deg angle anywhere on parent surface).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERequest 2 : Editable camera rotation radius and position (partially implemented, yes).\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think i\u0027m not the only one annoyed when i need to look at certain part at close zoom level during construction and having to do lots of rotate/move/rotate/move/... just to manipulate or look at target part from different angle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#DAA520;\u0022\u003EWorkflow\u003C/span\u003E :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- add part A, used as manipulation target\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- define part A as camera target\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- rotate around part A at close zoom level\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- unlink part A from camera target (effectively return camera control to normal behaviour)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, when user need to quickly do something somewhere else, there should be option to temporarily \u0022bookmark\u0022 a part so camera could jump back to target part after user returns attention to edited part. Also, there should be an option to switch camera to part\u0027s \u0022symmetrical twin\u0022 (or to next instance of it if \u0026gt;2x symmetry).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne more : Add keyboard control of camera. This by itself is useless, even most of times won\u0027t have visible effect. BUT. I noticed when making changes to \u0026gt;500\u002B part vehicle, editor often \u0022stalls\u0022 then resumes operation (yes, even 0.22 suffered from this despite user complaints back in 0.22), and it still records all mouse movement and clicks during \u0022stall\u0022 causing camera to \u0022jump\u0022 unpredictably. This more a bug of editor, but if keyboard control to camera translation is added, this issue could be circumvented for the time being.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERequest 3 : Part manipulation while attached to construction.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did not know how to call it \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Idea is to edit part position and/or angle AFTER it is attached to parent part.
