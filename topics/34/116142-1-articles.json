{"TopicId":116142,"ForumId":34,"TopicTitle":"[1.3](Jun08/17) ModActions: Control your vessel (including other mods) via ActionGroups.","CreatedByName":"Diazo","CreatedById":81549,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-17T03:39:44Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"Diazo","CreatedById":81549,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-17T03:39:44Z","Content":"**ModActions**\n\nThis mod is designed to allow you to control your vessel entirely via action groups, no more having to right-click on parts and control things through the part menu.\n\nThis allows you to do such things as change the thrust limiter on all engines on your vessel via a single action group command.\n\nIn addition to many stock actions, you can also control several mods via action groups in this fashion.\n\n[Download Version 1.6 here. (Github)](https://github.com/SirDiazo/ModActions/releases/tag/1.6)\n\nVersion 1.6: KSP 1.3 update.\n\nThis is licensed under the GPL 3 license.\n\nModule Manager is a required dependancy and must be present, Version 2.5.13 or later is required.\n\nTerminology note: If an action uses the \u0022Set\u0022 keyword, that is directly setting the associated value. If the \u0022Change\u0022 keyword is uses, that action modifies the associated value. (Use negative numbers to decrease the value.)\n\n**Supported actions:**\n\nVertical Velocity Control\n\nLanding Aid\n\nGPOSpeedFuelPump\n\nFerram Aerospace Research\n\nControl Surface Deflection/Axis control in stock.\n\nWheel control (steering/brake/traction/friction/etc) in stock.\n\nSaturable Reaction Wheels Momentum Dump\n\n(Planned)TAC Fuel Balancer\n\n(Planned) MechJeb\n\n![smTmovf.png](http://i.imgur.com/smTmovf.png)\n\nTo use:\n\n1) Go to the Action Editor mode in the Editor and click the Mod Acts button (will appear on the toolbar mod if installed, otherwise on the stock toolbar). Note that this mod will not show except on the actions editor screen in the editor and that in both the editor and in flight, the mod is hidden by default and will not show until the ModActs button is clicked.\n\n2) Select your part to edit actions on.\n\n- Directly click the part in the 3D editor game space.\n\nOr, if you are not sure which parts can be controlled by which mod, make sure no parts are selected and select a mod to see all parts that can be edited for that mod. The selected mod\u0027s button with turn green and all parts that mod can control will be indicated by the purple circles. Click on the desired part in the 3D editor game space to select a part.\n\n3) An unassigned action will have a \u0022Click to select\u0022 button. When in this state, the action is hidden from the action group editor and if you somehow manage to activate it, it will do nothing.\n\nClick the \u0022Click to select\u0022 button to view a list of mods that can be controlled from this part and select the desired one. The \u0022Clear Action\u0022 button is always present and when selected deletes the action and returns it to the \u0022Click to select\u0022 state. When a mod is selected, the first action in that mod will be chosen to fill the fields in this action in. At this point, the action will become visible in the action selector to add it to an action group.\n\n4) Keep narrowing down your selection in the third and fourth columns (Thrust Limit and Thrust Limit#![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif). While each column only has a single selection at the moment, once larger mods are implemented they will be grouped and filtered by these columns.\n\n5) Enter the desired percentage for the thrust limiter in the right-most column. The value is in percent, so a value of 50 will set the engine thrust limiter to 50%.\n\n6) Enter an appropriate description in the left-most field. This is a free-text field that you can use as you desire to remember what the action does. The text that shows here will be the text visible as the action name when adding the action to an action group. Note that this field resets any time the fourth column changes because that means the action in this slot has changed and so your old description is no longer valid.\n\n7) Click the Mod Acts button again to hide this window and go to the action group editor to assign your Thrust Limiting actions to an action group to be usable in flight.\n\n**Note:** This mod adds new actions to a part\u0027s available actions list. You must still select the action and assign it to an action group as you do with any other action.\n\n**Copying Actions:**\n\nIf you enable the \u0022Copy\u0022 options in the top right (turns red when enabled), when you click on another part to select it, the actions on your current part will attempt to be copied to the new part. (All actions on the target part will be deleted before hand.) Only actions usable by the target part will be copied.\n\nCopying actions is still experimental, engines will quite possibly have issues as there are multiple different types.\n\nD.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nSupported Stock Actions:\n\n**Set/Change Main Throttle** (Found on the Command button)\n\nDirectly set, or change, the main throttle percentage. (Use a negative number to reduce the throttle.)\n\n**Set/Change Engine Thrust Limit**\n\nDirectly Set or Change an engine\u0027s Thrust Limiter.\n\n**Set/Change \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E Thrust Limit and toggle control directions (Roll/Pitch/Yaw/X/Y/Z axis)**\n\nDirectly Set or Change an engine\u0027s Thrust Limiter.\n\n**Control From Here in right-click menu** (ModuleDockingNode, ModuleCommand)\n\n-Control From Here: This will shift vessel control to the part this action lives on, the same as right-clicking the part and selecting Control From Here from the right-click menu in flight.\n\n**Lock/Unlock control directions on wings** (ModuleControlSurface for default, FARControllableSurface if \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E is installed)\n\n-Toggle Pitch: Does this wing attempt to control in the named direction?\n\n-Enable Pitch\n\n-Disable Pitch\n\n-Toggle Yaw\n\n-Enable Yaw\n\n-Disable Yaw\n\n-Toggle Roll\n\n-Enable Roll\n\n-Disable Roll\n\n**Go on Eva** (part CrewCapacity \u003E= 1)\n\n-Go on EVA: Each part with a crew capacity will have this action available. When activated, it sends the first Kerbal in the pod on EVA. Each time it is activated it will send the next kerbal in the pod out. When there are no kerbals left it will print a message to the screen saying so. It will not search other parts on the vessel, it will only send kerbals in the part with the action on EVA.\n\n**Crossfeed** (all parts in your GameData folder, including mods)\n\n-Toggle Crossfeed: See caution below about Resources Lock and Crossfeeding.\n\n-Enable Crossfeed\n\n-Disable Crossfeed\n\n**Lock Resource level on Part** (all parts with resources)\n\n-Toggle Resource: See caution below about Resources Lock and Crossfeeding.\n\n-Allow Resource\n\n-Lock Resource\n\n**Lock Electricity level on Part** (all parts with electricity)\n\n-Toggle Electricity: See caution below about Resources Lock and Crossfeeding.\n\n-Allow Electricity\n\n-Lock Electricity\n\n**Add/Remove brakes from braking action (B key)** (ModuleWheel)\n\n-Add/Rem Brakes: These actions add or remove the wheel the action is attached to from the Brakes action group. (B key by default.) It does not actually activate/deactivate the brakes itself.\n\n-Add Brakes\n\n-Remove Brakes\n\n**New Wheel System**\n\n-Control Steering/Differential Steering/Motor/Brakes direction/force/enable and such for the new KSP 1.1 wheel system.\n\n**Crossfeed and Resource Lock Caution**\n\nCrossfeeding and Resource Locking have a couple of particulars you need to know about.\n\nElectric Charge is a resource and follows the rules for Resource Locking, but as it is a special case I gave it it\u0027s own set of actions separate from the general Resource Actions. (Enabling the Resource Lock will not Lock Electric Charge.)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-06-09T02:43:58Z\u0022 title=\u002206/09/2017 02:43  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJune 9, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Diazo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Nori","CreatedById":41334,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-17T17:11:41Z","Content":"Looks amazing!

That should put the .dll file at KSP\\GameData\\Diazo\\ModActions\\ModActions.dll\n\nYou will not lose any configured actions by doing this.\n\nThe crossfeed thing might also be another mod, there was a \u0022Crossfeed Enabler\u0022 mod that did that and I think one of the big resource mods (KSP Interstellar?) add crossfeed control also.\n\nIf reinstalling the mod does not fix this I will ask for a copy of your KSP\\KSP\\_data\\output\\_log.txt file so I can see any errors being thrown.\n\nAs for the 30 actions thing, that is necessary. With how KSP handles actions, actions must exist at boot time for them to work correctly. As this mod allows you to configure actions in the editor after boot time, I make 30 placeholder actions so they are handled correctly, then once in the editor I only actually show the ones the player is using.\n\nThat means this mod has a hard limit of 30 assigned actions per part, but I went that high because I can\u0027t imagine a player actually using 30 actions where-as I could imagine 20 actions being used, even if that would be highly unlikely.\n\nD.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-08T02:58:01Z\u0022 title=\u002202/08/2016 02:58  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 8, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Diazo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Elthy","CreatedById":63317,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-13T12:36:19Z","Content":"Sadly is still have those 2 buttons in the toolbar.

Suggestion, which might be on your list already: add similar thrust adjustments to RCS blocks/nozzles. I also noticed the copy feature (which is nice) didn\u0027t work work on all my engines; it worked on two stock engines, a modded engine, but not another modded engine.\n\nSome other feedback:\n\n- I can\u0027t help compare it to AGExt, your other mod, which I have used a ton, and it suffers in comparison. Simply put: it\u0027s not as feature rich. Granted, they fill different, but complementary roles, but I was a little disappointed on first blush. Granted, what it *does* provide (i.e. node alignment hotkey and thrust hotkeys) have earned it a spot in my library alone, but I have all these other mods that have exposed all these tweakable settings and I\u0027m dying to fiddle with them more (and make moar hotkeys!). Glancing over the thread briefly, it looks like time has been an issue lately, which is understandable, and comparing the two mods probably isn\u0027t entirely fair either.\n\n- Something I came across with AGExt, but more relevant here: I find myself making the same commands over and over again, namely setting Thrust to specific intervals. The copying feature is nice, but if there were some way to make it global (apply to all craft) or act as a preloaded/preset that I could configure, that would be neato. Maybe there is a config file somewhere or...?\n\nAnyway, so far, I\u0027m a fan.

I\u0027ll add them to the list of things to add to this mod, but if they are mods themselves, you could ask that mod author to add the actions as well. It\u0027s quite simple code-wise and feel free to send them my way if they ask any questions.\n\nAt the moment, there is no way of settings defaults. I simply use the default values of the code object behind the scenes when I make it. While not a huge deal to add it would be a question of how. I could make it so there was a default value when a part was placed, but that way you\u0027d have to cycle all the parts multiple times. (Set default value, add actions A, set other value, add all actions B) The other possibility would be to set by name, so all actions with the same name could be set to a value. I don\u0027t want to simply set all actions of a type, if you added multiple thrust limiters all that would do is set them all to the same value.

However, I use code in my mod that can only exist once so when the second copy of the mod loads, KSP tries to jam them together into one mod and just breaks everything.\n\nThis also explains the loading failure. In the second log file ModActions is still present at KSP\\GameData\\ModActions but it is looking for all its files at KSP\\GameData\\Diazo\\ModActions which doesn\u0027t exist because you\u0027ve deleted that folder.\n\nThis causes the mod to never finish loading and get stuck, so when you load a vessel and KSP tries to load the ModActions data associated with that craft, ModActions doesn\u0027t reply to KSP and so KSP stops the load process leading to the behaviour you see.\n\nIf you make sure both the KSP\\GameData\\ModActions and KSP\\GameData\\Diazo\\ModActions folders are deleted you should be good to go. To make sure you can search for the ModActions.dll file and delete all copies of it you find.\n\nI will also note this means the mod has probably never actually worked correctly for you.

Or more specifically, the other mod has, but it recently got an update (an unofficial one) to get it working with 1.0.5. It works fine, but Mod Actions doesn\u0027t quite work with it (everything works - setting up hotkeys and such, but when you go to pull the trigger, nothing happens). It\u0027s a bit of an unusual situation, I\u0027ll admit, but I thought you might know what the issue is.\n\nIf you have a moment, here are the links to the release thread, and the git repo of the unofficial release (courtesy of hab136):  \n\nCheers.\n\nSpoiler\n\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/106448-gpospeedfuelpump-ksp-v102/\u0026do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n[https://github.com/henrybauer/GPOSpeedPump/releases/tag/v1.6](https://github.com/henrybauer/GPOSpeedPump/releases/tag/v1.6)"}]}
