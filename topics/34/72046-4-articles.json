(I presume so especially because TAC-LS\u0027s own recyclers, which I based my code on, don\u0027t do this either.) Here\u0027s the thing:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeing parts, the greenhouses (and the recyclers) are only executed when the ship they\u0027re attached to is unpacked and doing physics (which is to say, being flown or within 2.3 km of the ship that is being flown); that\u0027s the only time their code gets to run. They simulate running continuously by a catch-up mechanism: every time they run, the compute how much time it\u0027s been since they last ran, and do that much LS work, so the first tick after they load, they\u0027re basically catching up on all the work they couldn\u0027t do while the ship was unloaded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe TAC-LS monitoring window, on the other hand, runs all the time, but it doesn\u0027t have access to any of the detailed vessel info since they\u0027re (mostly) not loaded. What TAC-LS does is save notes on how much electricity/oxygen/water/food and how many crew members non-unpacked ships have, and do estimated depletion calculations based on those notes to give you the numbers you see. But it doesn\u0027t know anything about how parts might be affecting any of that (whether they are things like greenhouses/recyclers making depletion slower, or things like fuel cells using up oxygen and making it happen \u003Cem\u003Efaster\u003C/em\u003E), so...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of which is to say: fixing this probably requires a deep rewrite of the internals of TAC-LS to let it figure out (or be told, which would also require all the parts touching LS resources to be edited) how the current ship\u0027s parts are affecting the depletion rate, so it can save that in its notes and work that into its estimates. I... well, for the moment, at least, working up a patch to do that is well above my pay grade in complexity terms.
