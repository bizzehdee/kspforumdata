I tried putting a bottom-facing camera on my lander and when I activated it I couldn\u0027t get back out of the all-black mode to pilot the craft, and thus crashed. It occurred to me that going to the space center and back might force the game to reload the craft and fix the problem, and it did, but by the time I realized that I\u0027d have to do that I\u0027d already dropped to low to recover in time.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve a similar bug I suspect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe debug window has \u0022Look rotation viewing vector is zero\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;strike\u0026gt;Upon removing 0.40.

I suspect there is a bug with cycling in this case that causes some of the active flags to get inconsistent, cause things get wonky after that happens. Anyhow, How do you feel about a config option to stay on the camera if you activate it and it is already active. My desire is that the 1 key always switches to a certain camera, no matter what, and so on. With main camera enabled it is a reasonable toggle, but with main camera disabled, things get crazy.
