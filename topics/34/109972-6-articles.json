Looks right to me, and it is disabled by default.   However, I did note a behavior that I believe is causing confusion.\n\n1.  If you now have an option button and a window that appears showing options, then you have the correct dll. See following image for correct new display.\n\n![Q42SikH.png](http://i.imgur.com/Q42SikH.png)\n\n2.  If you are in the editor and you right click on a part that is passable in CLS (by previous config by author or config files), then you can now modify that passability.  Maybe I need to disable this behavior as well?\n\nSo, enabling Custom parts causes the rmb display for parts on the left of the editor window to show CLS attributes even if the part is not passable.  You will be able to enable/disable, and alter passability parameter via the tweakable.\n\nLet me know your thoughts, as this behavior differs from what I\u0027d been saying previously.  Previously, I\u0027d been saying that CLS would behave exactly the same as before when the option is disabled.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-03T01:56:31Z\u0022 title=\u002212/03/2015 01:56  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Papa\\_Joe**"},{"CreatedByName":"Papa_Joe","CreatedById":10788,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-03T01:58:18Z","Content":"On second thought, I\u0027m thinking the tweakable feature should be disabled as well by default...

In-line batteries, octostruts and the like are not!\n\u003E \n\nWhen Custom CLS parts is on, and you have restarted the game, many parts in the inventory to the left of the editor will now show CLS settings, even though they will not be passable.   By selecting the part and adding it to your ship, you can then right click and select passable from the tweakable.  \n\nSo, in reference to softweir\u0027s comment above, a battery pack could potentially be passable, if it is at least 1.5 m in diameter, an in-line part, and this feature is on...\n\nNote that struts, engines fuel tanks and many other \u0022obvious\u0022 parts are never passable.\n\nHowever, for what I consider as parts that could potentially be passable, the basis of thought is this:\n\n1.  Parts are generally in-line parts and have at least a top and bottom node.  \n\n2.  Parts must be at least 1.5 m in diameter for obvious reasons.   \u0022Can\u0027t get my head thru...\u0022  \n\n3.  nose cones and such are excluded.\n\nEarlier in the thread, a lengthy discussion about the filter I chose exists.  I suggest you read that discussion and you will gain much more understanding of how this feature is to work.\n\nIdeally, this feature is never needed, as all mod authors would create their own configs for their parts.   CLS also comes with many configs \u0022out of the box\u0022.  This feature is for those situations where you are using parts that may not have a config and desire to use it in a way that CLS would generally not permit.   This violates realism, so, I have it off by default, but if you desire you can \u0022cheat\u0022.\n\nAs I always say, it is your game so play it the way you want.  I only try to give you the tools to do so.\n\nHope that helps!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-06T18:40:59Z\u0022 title=\u002212/06/2015 06:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Papa\\_Joe**"},{"CreatedByName":"Gryphon","CreatedById":58513,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-08T04:56:00Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 12/6/2015, 2:31:25, crash087 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Any one have any ideas why I cant transfer people from the command pod to anything else?

Oo, new Ship Manifest? Will have to try that when it\u0027s out. The current version has simplified my crew and fuel transfers considerably. The intuitive LF/O autobalancing in fuel transfer - as well as the ability to tell SM to \u0022refuel that docked vessel\u0022 - helps a lot. The stock crew transfer mostly refuses to work for me, so having an independent implementation of crew transfer in SM is useful. Support for CLS in SM is icing on the cake.\n\n(No idea if it\u0027s an issue with KSP specifically on Linux, but in the stock game, the second click to select the target module for the crew transfer very rarely registers at all. This occurs at least on KSP 1.0.4 and 1.0.5. The only possibility is to cancel by hitting esc, and EVA the Kerbals over. I\u0027ve seen people occasionally complain about this on the forum, but I\u0027m under the impression that for most people the stock mechanism works fine. The issue seems to get worse with large craft, where the framerate is low. Using SM instead, I\u0027ve had no problems transferring crew.)\n\nIn SM, the only thing I\u0027m missing is a \u0022vessels\u0022 switch for the parts control panel (like in the resource transfer window), so that you could switch on/off the lights (or solar panels, or stuff) on just one docked vessel. (Would be useful for switching off the lights on a lander or a shuttle after docking to a mothership - I almost always forget to hit the lights key just before the docking is complete.)\n\nBut back on topic: noticed two more things in CLS when playing last night:\n\n- The Mk1 crew cabin (MK1CrewCabin) that was added in stock KSP 1.0.5 is not marked as passable. Tested with the \u0022freedom\u0022 CLSStock.cfg. (EDIT: Oops, WildLynx already reported this.)\n- When using the editor tweakables to make optional parts passable, the connectivity of the living space updates only after saving the ship, exiting and re-entering the editor. (Should be reproducible by adding a KAX heavy structural fuselage, radially attaching radial attachment points, and to those, stock structural fuselages (axially, making them stick outward from the larger fuselage, [like near the front of this craft](http://imgur.com/a/Odfhk)). Then tweak the KAX fuselage, selecting radial attachments as passable.)\n\nAbout the earlier things I reported, it seems the button spawning issue does not occur 100% of the time. I entered the VAB several times during the session, and got only one extra button. But earlier, in another gaming session, I eventually ended up with [the toolbar looking like this](http://imgur.com/a/KjV6q) after lots of flight reverts and tweaks to the craft I was making. I\u0027m running a fairly heavily modded install, though, so at the moment I\u0027m not sure if CLS on its own does this, or if it\u0027s an interaction issue (although for a toolbar button the latter seems unlikely). Maybe I could catch a log just after the issue occurs, if that might help in tracking it down?\n\nAlso, I confirm that (pretty much as expected) this MM patch:\n\n    @PART[KIS_Container2]:HAS[!MODULE[ModuleConnectedLivingSpace]] \n    {\n      MODULE\n        {\n            name = ModuleConnectedLivingSpace\n            passable = true\n        }\n    }\n    @PART[KIS_Container3]:HAS[!MODULE[ModuleConnectedLivingSpace]] \n    {\n      MODULE\n        {\n            name = ModuleConnectedLivingSpace\n            passable = true\n        }\n    }\n\nfixes the issue with the large KIS containers.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-20T11:20:00Z\u0022 title=\u002201/20/2016 11:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 20, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Technologicat**\n  \nOops, duplicate bug report"},{"CreatedByName":"codepoet","CreatedById":73449,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-20T18:29:05Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Quote\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E - The Mk1 crew cabin (MK1CrewCabin) that was added in stock KSP 1.0.5 is not marked as passable.

The updated plane parts are one, but also notable is the thermodynamics system overhaul (much fewer rapid unplanned exothermic oxidation events). The improved time integrator (explicit RK2 / Heun, as was mentioned on [Devnote Tuesday a while back](https://kerbaldevteam.tumblr.com/post/132955673519/devnote-tuesday-post-release-progression)) also seems to have stabilized things. In 1.0.5, physics warp is stable enough to be used during launches (even with 200\u002B part craft, at least if using KJR; [example](http://imgur.com/a/Odfhk)). Makes me suspect 1.0.4 and earlier may have used explicit Euler, which is simple, but notorious for its instability ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\nAnyway, concerning CLS, I read through the original dev thread. Impressive work. The Unix-style \u0022do one thing and do it well\u0022 approach works well here.\n\nFor the most part I agree with the discussion in that thread. Generally speaking, punching holes at random locations on meticulously designed spacecraft components does not make much sense (even if it would shorten Jeb\u0027s trip to the snack storage). The exception are things such as structural fuselages, where the inside consists of pretty much empty space. For such corner cases, the on-the-fly customizability is nice.\n\nAs for the bugs, I played around in the VAB last night and this time couldn\u0027t reproduce them. No unplanned duplication of toolbar buttons, or failing to register changes to the tweakables without exiting the VAB. (Closing and reopening the CLS window was enough.) So, it seems these either occur randomly, or require a more complex set of conditions to trigger... I can keep an eye out in case they happen again, and grab a log if so, but can\u0027t promise a timeframe on testing.\n\nYeah, how to update the mod is indeed up to PapaJoe.

Overall the quality of CLS configs was very high, but I found a few stragglers that need their configs fixed. Results below.\n\n**Part mods that supply their own CLS configs**\n\nThis is just for information. Naturally, a list of this nature can never be exhaustive; here are the ones out of those I have installed.\n\n- *Kerbal Planetary Base Systems* by Nils277\n- *Mark IV Spaceplane System* by Nertea\n- *Mk2 Stock-a-like Expansion* by SuicidalInsanity\n\n**Parts that should be passable (axially) but are not**\n\nSince stock and KIS configs are provided by CLS, I think the most logical option is to fix them here.\n\n*Stock*:\n\n- Mk3 Cockpit (mk3Cockpit\\_Shuttle)\n- Mk3 Passenger Module (mk3CrewCabin)\n- Mk1 Crew Cabin (MK1CrewCabin), new in KSP 1.0.5\n\n*KIS*:\n\n- ILC-18k Container (KIS\\_Container2)\n- ISC-6K Container (KIS\\_Container3)\n\n*Mark IV Spaceplane System*:\n\n- Mk4 \u0027Thunderhawk\u0027 Cockpit (mk4cockpit-1). Visible hatches front and back. The back hatch is located near the top, offset upward from the center, but the other Mk4 crewed parts have matching offsets. The impassability of this cockpit seems to be caused by an incorrect part name in MarkIVSystem/Patches/MkIVCLS.cfg (*mk4cockpit* instead of *mk4cockpit-1*), so I suppose I should bring this one to Nertea\u0027s attention.\n\n**Docking port and decoupler inconsistencies**\n\n- *stock*: Clamp-O-Tron Shielded Docking Port (dockingPort1), passable axially but not as surface-attached, although the regular Clamp-O-Tron Docking Port (dockingPort2) is. Is there a reason or is this just an oversight?\n- *Near Future Construction*: Grip-O-Tron Large Docking Connector (docking-25), no CLS config, maybe should be passable for consistency with stock Clamp-O-Tron Sr. (dockingPortLarge)? The Grip-O-Tron is a hollow construction with a sealed outer rim, having geometry similar to stock decouplers that are considered passable (e.g. the Rockomax 2.5m).\n- *MRS*: MRS Decoupler, 2.5m Stack, Slimline (NBdecouplerSlim2m), no CLS config, maybe should be passable for consistency with stock Rockomax decoupler.\n\n**Cargo bays**\n\nThere are inconsistencies in the handling of cargo bays: some are marked passable, while some are missing a CLS config. (Personally, I\u0027d prefer impassable, since cargo bays open to space and are thus not necessarily pressurized, but either way is fine as long as it\u0027s consistent - for preference, there are always local overrides.)\n\n*Stock*:\n\n- Mk2 Cargo Bay CRG-04 (mk2CargoBayS), passable\n- Mk2 Cargo Bay CRG-08 (mk2CargoBayL), passable\n- Mk3 Cargo Bay CRG-25 (mk3CargoBayS), config missing\n- Mk3 Cargo Bay CRG-50 (mk3CargoBayM), config missing\n- Mk3 Cargo Bay CRG-100 (mk3CargoBayL), config missing\n- Mk3 Cargo Ramp (mk3CargoRamp), config missing\n\n*Mark IV Spaceplane System* (all passable, using Mark IV Spaceplane System\u0027s own CLS config):\n\n- CRG-60 Mk4 Cargo Bay (mk4cargo-3)\n- CRG-120 Mk4 Cargo Bay (mk4cargo-2)\n- CRG-240 Mk4 Cargo Bay (mk4cargo-1)\n- DRP-60 Mk4 Ventral Cargo Bay (mk4cargo-drop-3)\n- DRP-120 Mk4 Ventral Cargo Bay (mk4cargo-drop-2)\n- DRP-240 Mk4 Ventral Cargo Bay (mk4cargo-drop-1)\n- Mk4 Tail Cargo Bay (mk4cargotail-1)\n\n*Modular Rocket Systems* (all config missing):\n\n- MRS Rocket Payload Bay, 1.25m (NBcargoBay1m1)\n- MRS Rocket Payload Bay, 2.5m Long (NBcargoBay2m1)\n- MRS Rocket Payload Bay, 2.5m Short (NBcargoBay2m0)\n\n*Axial Aerospace Cargo Bays* mini mod (recent mod featured on Modding Monday a while back, not yet configured for CLS):\n\n- 1.25M Cargo Bay (125cbsimple)\n- 2.5M Cargo Bay (25cbsimple)\n\n**Buffalo**\n\nThe Buffalo MSEV by Angel-125 does not currently support CLS. This is more complicated to get working correctly than the others above.\n\nPassable parts:\n\n- Buffalo Command Cab (WBI\\_BuffaloCab). This is a cupola-ish \u0022truck cabin\u0022. It should have the door at its back passable, all other nodes impassable.\n- Buffalo Crew Cabin (WBI\\_CrewCab). Four visible hatches: front, back, left, right.\n- Buffalo Adapter (WBI\\_BuffaloAdapter). Non-crewable part with hatches, should be passable. Connects between Buffalo and 1.25m form factors.\n- Tundra 200 (WBI\\_Tundra200). Configurable container, meant to be used either as KIS storage accessible from inside the craft, or as a fuel tank. Uses WBIResource Switcher.\n- Tundra 400 (WBI\\_Tundra400). Larger version of the above.\n- Wagon (WBI\\_Wagon2u). Configurable inflatable storage module providing either internally accessible KIS storage or a resource tank. Uses WBIResource Switcher. Similar to the above, but with the additional requirement that the module must be in the inflated state to be used. When not inflated, the internal space is taken up by the inflatable shell.\n\nDepending on whether the Tundras and the Wagon are meant to always have a crew tube (or if the full volume is taken up by fuel when used as a fuel tank), one may need to switch CLS configs on the fly depending on the container configuration selected. I suppose this means that WBIResource Switcher may need to call into the CLS API. Fortunately it\u0027s by the same author as Buffalo itself. In any case, I think that if we would like CLS support for Buffalo, we need to talk with Angel-125, ask for his opinion, and then determine the best course of action."},{"CreatedByName":"Papa_Joe","CreatedById":10788,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-24T08:11:14Z","Content":"Thanks for this!\n\nIf you have the gumption, you can create a pull request iwth the changes/additions.
