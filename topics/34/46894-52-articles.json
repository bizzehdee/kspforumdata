It has been already mentioned multiple times in the past 40 posts that this is a known KSP issue and it happens only when the shrinking tank is the root part of your craft. Either don\u0027t use such parts as root or wait for a fix, as Winston and Kick already mentioned.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWait, do you refer to the resizing issue, or the game breaking issue with parts becoming invisible/unplayable/ship slewing away from the camera and the ground disappearing? I read through this thread, and I cannot see any KW modders stating these issues are linked.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-22T20:07:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI love the new update. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Some ideas you might find handy:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.75m dual-nozzle engine.
