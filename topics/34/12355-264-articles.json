If the inclination difference is big, more than a say 5-10 degrees, then burn prograde at one of the nodes and bring the apoapsis around the orbit of the asteroid. You then add a second node and fix the inclination with it, now you can change the time of the first one so that you have a relatively close approach (same side of the planet basically) and tune it from there. It should be easy because at such an elliptical orbit, tiny changes in the apoapsis will severely affect your closest approach.
