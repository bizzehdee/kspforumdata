Big ship on was affected immediately after SOI, and after every load or switch over, unless you switch from other ship, and not from Tracking Station. ![:confused:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif)\n\u003E \n\nFirst: Really nice ship you got there!\n\nSecond, regarding IR and docking ports: I don\u0027t know if this applies to you, but I tested a tanker rover meant to refuel my Laythe SSTO, it has two docking ports of different sizes at the end of an IR arm.\n\nWhen I docked with my SSTO, and undocked, control switched to the SSTO. I changed to the tanker and everything was messed up (IR parts oriented the wrong way, controls not working right).\n\nThen I found a procedure that works: I docked the to craft, quicksaved. Then I rightclicked on the Rover Control Pod, and selected \u0022Control from here\u0022, and undocked. Control stayed with the rover (I did not need to switch vessels). I quicksaved again, IR parts were looking fine so far. I tried the IR controls, and everything went bonkers (parts disconnected after jumping to a different position). So i reloaded my quicksave from after I undocked, but before I tried to move the IR parts (beware that both ships immediatly redocked upon loading, so I had to redo the control switch part, and drove the rover away **witchout touching the IR controls**. That seems to be important). When the docking ports were distanced enough so they would not redock, I quicksaved again. IR parts looked fine. I loaded my quicksave, and the controls worked fine, the IR parts were oriented the right way, and everything seemed to work. I don\u0027t know if that was pure luck, but the important bits seem to be: **Remaining in control of the Vessel with IR parts upon undock, quicksaving and reloading, and only then trying to move the IR parts.** \n\nI hope that helps, maybe someone else can try to verify this.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-03T14:41:27Z\u0022 title=\u002212/03/2015 02:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Xeiki**"},{"CreatedByName":"Engineering101","CreatedById":154659,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-08T02:59:21Z","Content":"There seems to be a bug with \u0022Closed Powered Hinge\u0022.\n\nWhen I try to place the hinge on planes etc with \u0022mirror\u0022 symmetry mode, for some reason, the hinge is place as if it were in \u0022radial\u0022 mode (upside down).

For example, docking ports on some pistons/hinges can be used for safe satellite deploy/recovery from plane cargo bay. However, avoid to assembly big space station with docking ports attached directly to IR parts.\n\nDocking port bug mostly occur if you dock, for example two identical crafts to each other, left them docked and switch scene to KSC or tracking station. For rendezvous/resupply missions, you might have better luck with KAS.\n\nI didn\u0027t have issues with space probes attached to dock ports on IR parts. I left such craft in space, switched scene, reloaded game, redocked probe and recovered successfully up to landing on runway. However, use it on your own risk, avoid complex crafts and don\u0027t use such combination if you plan to leave craft unattended for a while in space.\n\nFact that I didn\u0027t have problems with it does not mean that bug does not exist.
