I want to use it on every bloody craft I make, but I just.. can\u0027t. I can\u0027t bring myself to include so much extra weight. I play with a mk1-2 pod that has been slightly reduced in weight so that it is just barely below the mk1 pod\u0027s weight times 3, the idea being that increasing the volume of an object actually only increases its surface area by a lesser proportion and that the larger pod should have a more efficient crew/pod mass ratio than the smaller one.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSwitching to the propulsive landing equipment (from simple parachutes, typically 4 radial ones) increases the weight of the craft by a whopping 57 percent! I\u0027ve been trying to think of a way I could modify the numbers to allow me to reasonably justify using this over parachutes (aside from the simple cool factor, which is considerable), but I just can\u0027t come up with a way.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nLooking over what I could find for the superdraco\u0027s real world specs, you seem to have matched them fairly well. The thrust is a wee bit lower in the real world, and the burn time is about half as long (at full thrust). No clue on propellant flow rates or the mass of the engine itself, but the mass of the entire craft isn\u0027t too terribly far off from reality using KSP\u0027s stock numbers (the real one is a good half ton or so lighter). The delta-v is around 600-630 m/s, which seems to be fairly similar to reality (real one stops in ~3 seconds from terminal at full thrust, which is about half the total burn time it can manage). So.. it all looks \u0022real\u0022.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe problem, so far as I can figure.. is that KSP just isn\u0027t real. In the stock game, things are 1/10th scale.. so it takes far less delta-v to get places, so rockets are far smaller. Normally that is true all around, so it doesn\u0027t matter at all in the end. This isn\u0027t true of a propulsive landing system though. Because terminal velocity is nearly the same (or possibly even higher I think) on Kerbin as it is on Earth, it\u0027s going to take the same delta-v to land in the 1/10th scale KSP as it does in reality. Thus, you\u0027re going to be lugging around a propulsive landing system that is roughly 10 times \u0022more\u0022 than it really should be if it scaled at an equal level to the rest of the rocket.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo.. what can be done to make this work \u0022equally\u0022 to how it does in reality? I could make them ultra-efficient so that they use less fuel, then make the fuel pod carry far less fuel so that the overall mass of the system is more representative of the ratio of superdraco system mass / falcon 9 mass.. but then they\u0027d be massively overpowered with other tanks. Stick a couple of these on a stock fuel tank and you\u0027re going god mode. I suppose I could make them have a super high atmospheric isp so that they\u0027re only ultra efficient during the landing phase, which I\u0027d be a bit less likely to.. er, abuse.. but then they\u0027d be useless on non-atmospheric bodies. Red Dragon would be.. fail. I honestly just can\u0027t come up with a way to make them able to pump out enough delta-v to land on while also significantly lowering the weight to make them more \u0022stockish\u0022 without making them utterly overpowered in all other aspects.

The landing velocities don\u0027t scale appropriately, else Kerbin would have super low gravity and the game wouldn\u0027t work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027d be interesting to try this in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E, as it\u0027d probably work perfectly there since it\u0027s already so close to reality. Never really cared for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E though, so I wish I could just find a way to make this a viable alternative to parachutes. Maybe dropping the mass of the engines down to match the stock radials (.09 instead of .25), increase their \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E, but drop the fuel in the tank down and lower their thrust to something more similar to the stock radials (20-30 each). That\u0027d lower the overall mass of the system significantly, without altering the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E of the vessel too much.. I\u0027d just be wary of making them better than something like the LV-909 efficiency wise, though I don\u0027t want them to be miles behind either or I\u0027ll never use them.

In reality you do it to keep that corrosive salt water from touching your spacecraft and also to avoid landing out in the desert somewhere. The Crew Dragon will have\u00A0parachutes for emergencies as well.\u00A0KSP doesn\u0027t care about the water and you can land close to the space center even with parachutes. It\u0027s really for style and to give an additional challenge. If that\u0027s not your thing then you can just use parachutes instead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
