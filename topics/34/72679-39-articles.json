I prefer making autonomous probes i.e. they have full engine systems onboard for final orbital insertions or later changes. Because of this, I try to make sure they are balanced to prevent torque during burns. I have a decent number of mods (Near Future set, B9, several USI sets, RemoteTech, OPT, DMOrbitSci, UniStorage, etc.), so trying to balance satellites with different scanners while making sure they look decent AND fit within certain design restrictions gets tedious. (For that last part, I mess with spaceplane designs a lot, so much of my design goals have to fit within the various cargo bays sizes, preferably without clipping \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_happy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022^_^\u0022\u003E).
