The days of old where every polygon counted are gone. Now it\u0027s draw calls that are the big frame rate killer (how many times the rendering engine has to process the same mesh). This is effected by things like the number of textures, complexity of the shader, light sources, shadow casting and other effects added to the objects. Next to that is physics and collision detection, as far as killing frame rate goes and those meshes are 100 times simpler than the visible mesh.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo sum up:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes the extra cuts to the mesh effect the speed at which they can be rendered.

Are you interested in including custom particles for the engines? It requires no plugins, and can give really impressive results. Nazari made some for Component Space Shuttle, and as a result the SSME exhaust looks just like launch footage. It\u0027d be really great to see something like that in FASA. While SRBs can\u0027t really be made look good with that due to problems with making smoke (there\u0027s a plugin in the works for that, though), and small engines are more or less fine, the large engines could really use some diversity.
