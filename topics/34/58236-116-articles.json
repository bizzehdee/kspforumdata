Often when I launch a rocket (using KCT in career mode) it wobbles (Saturn 1 size or larger) when KJR is loading. That prompts the mission to start (clock in top left).

Timewarping in the main screen to the appropriate time, then launching again. But with KCT adding scene changes (mem leaks) I\u0026#39;d like to find another option that requires less scene changes. Will probably just use the MM patch for now, but would rather find a fix like upping the pump throughput if possible so I can use RF as intended. =)\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-17T04:34:18Z\u0022 title=\u002211/17/2015 04:34  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by BevoLJ\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fallout2077","CreatedById":131638,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-17T15:26:50Z","Content":"\n[quote name=\u0027Starwaster\u0027]Eh it was more of a time sink than anything else[/QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThat\u0026#39;s too bad that no good came from all of the trouble.
