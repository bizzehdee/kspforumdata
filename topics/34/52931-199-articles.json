Engine was cutoff as soon as the drogues where activated. Full drogue deploy occurred at an altitude of 2500m. Main engine ignited at an altitude of 500m to prepare for the final landing.

I guess?\u00A0 And since \u0022Automatically arm parachutes on staging\u0022 is a option in the toolbar button on the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E scene,

something that is typically found in a context menu in a place that is not obvious and doesn\u0027t follow conventions at all.\u00A0 Literally every part in the stock game is configured in the

every mod, most if not all of the ones I have used (which is a lot) follow this convention, except RealChutes.\u00A0 If a mod has configuration options that would overwhelm that context menu, there is typically a button on the context menu that you click, and then a new menu opens with the configuration options you need.\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf including the

a button with a parachute on it in an obvious place that doesn\u0027t require you to switch out of build mode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe action groups menu is a menu that many people playing a career mode have no reason to even click on until well beyond the point that they need\u00A0parachutes, because unless they choose the option to make action groups always available they have to unlock that functionality, and there\u0027s little to do in there before that point.\u00A0 \u00A0And it\u0027s just not where you go, in any other context, to do configuration of parts.\u00A0 You configure the parts in the regular \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E build view, and then you go into the action groups menu to assign those parts to hotkeys.\u00A0 Unless you use RealChutes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat the place to configure Realchutes isn\u0027t immediately obvious would be a minor problem if it just added separate chutes that rely on this system and left the stock system alone, but it\u0027s compounded by the fact that RealChutes completely takes over all parachutes.\u00A0 There is no more stock behavior, only RealChutes.\u00A0 \u00A0Sometimes that\u0027s nice to have, like for drag chutes, or dialing in parachutes to work on Eve.\u00A0 But sometimes you just want an Mk16 to behave like a stock Mk16 without all the extra steps.\u00A0 It would be great if RealChutes were RealChutes and stock chutes were stock chutes.\u00A0 And if that\u0027s not possible for technical reasons, then it would be good if the mod tried to emulate default stock behavior on the changed stock parts as closely as possible.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe most obvious example of this is that the default behavior of parachutes with RealChutes is installed is to not\u00A0deploy \u0022when safe\u0022 like the stock system.\u00A0 \u00A0Which in effect means that any parachute in the game that you didn\u0027t configure through the aforementioned unconventional method will be ripped off by aero forces if you arm it before entering atmosphere, unless you fiddle with the settings in flight.\u00A0 From a user experience standpoint it has been an endless source of frustration.\u00A0 It just makes way more sense to just have RealChutes default to stock-like behavior,\u00A0 at least on the \u0027stock\u0027 parachutes if the mod is going to take over every parachute in the game.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve been using this mod off and on since 1.2.2 or something like that, and I still forget to go into the action groups menu and configure my parachutes, because this mod is the only mod that makes you go in there to configure it.\u00A0 \u00A0I forget, and then I arm the Mk16 on a returning science probe before it hits atmosphere because because the antenna could rip off on re-entry, only to watch the parachutes deploy super early and get ripped off by aero forces and all my science go to waste because the Mk16 no longer performs like a stock Mk16.\u00A0 \u00A0That\u0027s fine if I\u0027m playing a game with reverts and quicksaves, but I\u0027ve had it happen in a hard mode save more than once.\u00A0 \u00A0I can\u0027t be the only one.\u00A0 \u00A0To call it frustrating would be an understatement, especially when I realize why I forgot.\u00A0 Because the parachute looks stock, but instead of behaving like stock, it\u0027s different.\u00A0 To configure it to behave like stock, I have to go to the configuration menu that has decided for whatever reason to throw out over 10 years of established convention and hide in the action groups menu.\u00A0 It doesn\u0027t feel like I made a mistake, it feels like I\u0027m being punished for using this mod and not remembering to jump through its odd and counter-intuitive hoops.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u003Cabbr title=\u00221.
