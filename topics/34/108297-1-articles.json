{"TopicId":108297,"ForumId":34,"TopicTitle":"[1.3.0] Closed Loop Life Support","CreatedByName":"-MM-","CreatedById":138839,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T23:14:06Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"-MM-","CreatedById":138839,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T23:14:06Z","Content":"**C**losed **L**oop **L**ife **S**upport (CLLS) is a simple life support mod which aims at simulating a small, self-contained system for keeping Kerbals alive during long voyages through space. It adds a new resource \u0022LifeSupport\u0022 which is consumed by Kerbals at a rate of one unit per day. If your crew runs out of life support they will die. To prevent this dire fate, this mod adds new life support containers to increase the maximum mission time as well as life support generators, which will allow you to create self sufficient ships and stations, provided you have enough electricity.\n\n![dpBAMBW.png](http://i.imgur.com/dpBAMBW.png)\n\n**Download**\n\n- 1.3 (for KSP 1.3.x): [https://github.com/mmoench/CLLS/archive/1.3.zip](https://github.com/mmoench/CLLS/archive/1.3.zip)\n- 1.1 (for KSP 1.2.1): [https://github.com/mmoench/CLLS/archive/1.1.zip](https://github.com/mmoench/CLLS/archive/1.1.zip)\n\n**Features**\n\n- Kerbals will require life support to stay alive (1 unit per 6 hour day).\n- All parts with crew capacity will hold a small amount of life support (3 units per crew-slot).\n- Kerbals on EVA will take 1 unit of life support from the ship and put it back once they return, giving you a maximum EVA duration of 1 day.\n- Kerbals which have run out of life support will die.\n- Life support can be extended with life support storage containers.\n- For longer missions life support generators can be used to generate life support. This allows the creation of fully self-sufficient interplanetary ships and bases.\n- The production-rate and thus the energy consumption of life support generators can be tweaked to avoid wasting resources.\n- The life support usage and production is tracked for all ships, even in the background and during time warp.\n\n**Technical Details**\n\nThis mod keeps track of the life support values of all vessels, even those which are not currently active. This is done by caching their last known consumption / production levels as well as their remaining resources. When an event is triggered that changes the game-world (like launching a ship, modifying an (inactive) vessel, saving the game or running out of life support), all vessels are updated. This should make it compatible with other mods which manipulate inactive vessels (like [KSTS](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/148071-120-kerbal-space-transport-system/)) while consuming only very little system resources.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-06-28T18:26:32Z\u0022 title=\u002206/28/2017 06:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJune 28, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by -MM-**"},{"CreatedByName":"MatterBeam","CreatedById":133334,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T00:07:43Z","Content":"How is this different or better than the popular USI Life Support and Thunder Aerospace Life Support mods?"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwaster","CreatedById":71262,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T00:09:39Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E How is this different or better than the popular USI Life Support and Thunder Aerospace Life Support mods?\n\nWhat is Ioncross then, chopped liver?\n\n![:kiss:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_kiss.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-09T00:13:03Z\u0022 title=\u002205/09/2015 12:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Starwaster**\n  \ninsert smiley to lighten the tone"},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T00:15:20Z","Content":"HEHE to funny Starwaster kerbal got to have there iron hehe."},{"CreatedByName":"-MM-","CreatedById":138839,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T00:32:55Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E How is this different or better than the popular USI Life Support and Thunder Aerospace Life Support mods?\n\nHello Krakenfour, compared to TAC Life Support this is a lot simpler and less complex (less components and resources required).

During higher time-warp factors the consumption per physics-tick will now be capped at 25% of your vessel\u0027s battery capacity. This way you should not immediately drop to zero electricity at time warp 1000x but if you don\u0027t have a high enough production-value via solar power or RTGs, your lights still will go out.\n\nAnd regarding the points made by tjt: I agree, the consumption-rate of the generator seems a little high at first, but keep in mind that you can adjust the production-rate and thus the consumption during your flight. Additionally if you were to build a base on the mun which is in the dark for much longer or, even better, if you were to mount an expedition to the outer planets, relying on solar power and batteries won\u0027t cut it. In situations like these you\u0027d probably have to build vessels and bases which include nuclear reactors (like provided by \u0022Near Future Electrical\u0022) to provide a reliable amount of electricity. And to be honest, I kinda like the idea of more massive, nuclear powered interplanetary vessels ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"linuxgurugamer","CreatedById":129964,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-04T18:41:47Z","Content":"I maintain a thread: \n\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/97470-life-support-discussion-and-comparison-updated-892016/\u0026do=embed\u0026comment=1672268\u0026embedComment=1672268\u0026embedDo=findComment#comment-1672268\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nand was just made aware of this mod.\n\nI\u0027m going to add this soon"},{"CreatedByName":"linuxgurugamer","CreatedById":129964,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-04T19:32:47Z","Content":"Does this mod use the Community Resource Pack?"},{"CreatedByName":"JadeOfMaar","CreatedById":167617,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-04T19:39:35Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 53 minutes ago, linuxgurugamer said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Does this mod use the Community Resource Pack?\n\u003E \n\nNo it doesn\u0027t.
