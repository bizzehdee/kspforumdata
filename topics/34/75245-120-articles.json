The combination is heading towards an 18 km pericenter above Duna, so the plan is to release the lander, raise the orbiter and perform the insertion burn. First, when I separate the two, I can only give commands (e.g. hold prograde) to the lander, not the orbiter. I\u0027ve tried changing it up with the \u0022Control from here\u0022 option, but that doesn\u0027t seem to work. Secondly, once the two have decoupled and after the separation has increased to 3000 m, the lander loses connection, even though the orbiter and lander each have a Communotron 32. So what I want is for the orbiter to also act as a relay satellite, similar to the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. I tried having my DSN probe target Duna instead of the orbiter (which has the dishes), as explained in the guide, but that doesn\u0027t make any difference.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/u7QUopE.png\u0022 alt=\u0022u7QUopE.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T21:08:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAny tips for landing unmanned probe on Eve?

If so, and presuming you are set on the altitude of 2000km of your satellite network constellation, you could include DTS-M1 dishes on your sats with their dishes pointed towards Eve and a DP-10 on your lander. The root range model gives your lander a 2800km range when paired with the DTS-M1, which should be sufficient if my quick geometry calcs are correct.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESigma88 also has a great point in that if you use KOS to set your landing profile you can have your Communotron 16 deploy after atmospheric entry when it is safe to do so.
