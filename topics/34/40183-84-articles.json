I reviewed the thread in the Add-On Development subforum. I see that additional contracts, such as MCE, must create contracts in a compiled .DLL file. One poster mentioned it would have been preferred if contracts could have been defined in a text file. If only Squad had looked at MCE vers 1.0 to see how you\u0027re SUPPOSED to accomplish this task. But, Squad has \u0022Not Invented Here\u0022 arrogance; so, it went its own way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne poster (m4v) in that thread even stated \u0022Learn some C# for Christ sake\u0022. What an arrogant a$$. As a developer for over 40 years and having written at least 500,000 lines of code in a variety of languages (assembler, C, C\u002B\u002B, C#, and many others), I found the stupidity of his statement to be beyond comprehension. C\u002B\u002B, and C# are daunting for even for programmers who are unfamiliar with object-oriented methodologies and algorithms. To suggest that a neophyte, or even non-programmer, just slap together a C# program is asinine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, C# requires purchasing of MS Visual Studio, which is a lot to lay out just to make missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(/rant)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving ranted above, is there way for you to \u0022recreate\u0022 your MCE 1.0 contract structure and semi-integrate it into the PoS that is KSP\u0027s Contract system? By this, I mean, parse a textual MPKG file and create contracts from it. If the MPKG contracts cannot be displayed within the Mission Controller building (as was done in MCE 1.0), then I\u0027m okay with that. I acknowledge that you have a lot of free time and devote 100% of your life to this mod, so this ought not be difficult to accomplish LOL.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBottom line: Malkuth, you did MCE contracts the right way, Squad didn\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUh... no. I wanted to reply line-by line to this, but there is so much misinformation and uninformed tripe here that my mind is absolutely boggled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is no practical way to \u0027define contracts in a text file\u0027, and any such implementation would be woefully inferior to the way Squad has implemented contracts. The old MCE contract system was decent, but again, inferior to this system. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA text-file system would need a predefined set of objectives and rewards, and any contract defined thusly could only choose between those objectives. Squad implemented an API for programmatically defining these objectives and rewards. The downside to this is that you need to define them programmatically, but the increase in flexibility is well worth this trade. Adding new objectives to MCE would require more code, just like adding new \u0027objectives\u0027 to Squad contracts requires more code. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurthermore, the two approaches are not mutually exclusive. Case in point - I\u0027m currently working on a \u0027contract type\u0027 which CAN be defined in a text file, that comes packaged with a small list of possible objectives as a proof of concept implementation of legacy MCE-style contracts. I\u0027m hoping to simply turn this into an API for others to use (or maybe donate it to MCE if Malkuth wants it, and it is up to snuff). The point here is that MCE-style contracts can be defined in the Squad system, but Squad-style contract flexibility would have been at least as difficult to implement inside MCE.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext - C# is basically the easiest \u0027real\u0027 language for the neophyte programmer to start with, full stop. It is an oversimplification to call it \u0027microsoft java\u0027, but you don\u0027t have to worry about memory management, pointers, blah blah blah blah. Calling for people complaining about not being able to define contracts in a text file to learn a little C# isn\u0027t arrogance, it is common sense. It is \u003Cstrong\u003EPERFECTLY\u003C/strong\u003E reasonable for a \u0027neophyte\u0027 to \u0027slap together\u0027 a C# KSP plugin over the course of a weekend - MANY have done it. All you need is a little initiative and the willingness to learn things. The \u0027arrogant a$$\u0027 I see in this situation are the people who think that the contract system should be dumbed-down to the level where text-based configurations are the go-to standard, and that they should be able to implement relatively complex mods without actually learning something. (Also, WTF mate? Bringing up C\u002B\u002B is a non sequitur, as C\u002B\u002B has nothing to do with KSP plugin development unless you want to write some native libraries for some reason (I\u0027m reasonably sure that the only mods that actually do this are the programmable CPU emulators and that N-body physics integrator WIP))\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly - You \u003Cstrong\u003EDO NOT\u003C/strong\u003E need to buy Visual Studio to make KSP Plugins.
