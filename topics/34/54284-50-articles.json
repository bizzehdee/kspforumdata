In an effort to come up with a more stock a like solution for personal use, I waded through the config files for the docking port sr. and original orbital dock provided with your mod, and converted a copy of the docking port sr. into what a best guess told me was correct. Ha! The only real difference I saw was the mounting nodes, some stuff after the model, and the additional module on the orbital dock. At worst I thought whatever I built would appear away from the docking port sr because the part is shorter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI then took two full rocket part containers stacked on top of eachother, added a large remote guidence unit on top of that, and then added the modifed docking port sr. on top of that. Then I think I just grabbed the mechjeb eyeball pod and saved it as a test. Easiest thing I could quickly think of, as it\u0027s pretty much an all inclusive probe...doesn\u0027t need anything added, so I wouldn\u0027t need to build a whole ship. Went to the launch pad, and when I built the mechjeb pod the entire structure went shooting up and the mechjeb pod appeared below it on it\u0027s side. Then everything came crashing back down on top of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs near as I can tell, from my extensive kerbal explosion experience, is that the part was pod appeared below or inside the modified docking port. That\u0027s my best guess, because it behaved as if a part was cliping through another part on two seperate ships.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"taniwha","CreatedById":57176,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-02T11:37:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh, right, I forgot one thing about the docking port sr: it has no reference node for where to place the vessel (worse, if you\u0027ve specified one via SpawnTransform, EL won\u0027t find it and bad things will happen), so EL uses the part\u0027s local orgin... which is \u003Cem\u003Einside\u003C/em\u003E the sr.
