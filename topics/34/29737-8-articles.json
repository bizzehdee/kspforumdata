For all i know the ablating layer takes away most of the heat and the rest of the shield is a thermal buffer between the plasma and the rest of the craft. It does heat up during ablation, but only the top layer becomes hot enough to \u0027burn\u0027 and the material is chosen to withstand high temperatures and typically has a high thermal resistance/good thermal insulation (cork was used at some point). So i don\u0027t see why the remainder of a shield would weaken so much after being exposed to heat, to the point where it starts to ablate much faster when it has already cooled down significantly. The main factor there seems to be how much (how little) of it is left.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ialdabaoth","CreatedById":57270,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-01T22:15:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KhaosCorp\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KhaosCorp\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ehad issues with it in the past, not really wanting to mess with it\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhat version? and what were teh issues?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"aquilux","CreatedById":23859,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-01T23:28:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022astocky\u0022 data-cite=\u0022astocky\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAs for the skylon proposal - i believe it has huge surface area compared to its mass and kind of \u0027cheats\u0027 the reentry corridor to be much wider. \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, if you want to call it cheating, though it perfectly illustrates what I\u0027m talking about:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skylon_(spacecraft)\u0022 data-cite=\u0022http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skylon_(spacecraft)\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u0022a vehicle that is both large and light has an advantage during \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_reentry\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eatmospheric reentry\u003C/a\u003E compared to other vehicles due to a low \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistic_coefficient\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eballistic coefficient\u003C/a\u003E.\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skylon_(spacecraft)#cite_note-41\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E[41]\u003C/a\u003E \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EBecause of the low ballistic coefficient, Skylon would be slowed at higher altitudes where the air is thinner.

I remember that the inflatable heat shield did that to increase it\u0027s drag when inflated, though I\u0027m not sure if they properly moved it\u0027s center of lift to keep it stable. As for how to set up some the heat shield in terms of lift? Make a \u0022cone\u0022 of wing parts imbedded into the actual shield structure (maybe as sub-parts?), that sit at a small angle to the direction of motion. When the pod is angled, one side tilts to face the wind at a \u0022flatter\u0022 angle, and the other side gets closer to 45 degrees to the wind, causing a lateral \u0022push\u0022 away from that side of the pod. We could either use the pod\u0027s \u0022magic\u0022 torque to push it temporarily into the proper angle, allowing it to right itself when we don\u0027t want any more lift effects, or we could use detachable counterweights set 180 degrees apart to stay true to life, dumping only one to throw off our center of gravity and \u0022permanently tilting\u0022 the pod during reentry.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ialdabaoth","CreatedById":57270,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-02T01:17:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUpdate!
