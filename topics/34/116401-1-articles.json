After RSS changed its engine it doesn\u0027t work anymore, so I decided to take on it by myself. While being loosely based on the original config, it has several changes.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- All bodies size reduced to 1/10th\n- Atmosphere have been reduced only for Earth (stock one instead), they are real life sized for other planets (watch out on Jupiter ^^). This makes ascents a bit longer, descents easier then in stock KSP. But it\u0027s more on realism. Delta-v usage isn\u0027t that much more compared to stock game so no need for any engine changes.\n- Earth rotates roughly at Kerbin scale, so a year has ~470 days, a day is 6 hours.\n- Orbits are reduced to 10% scale by range. If i would have scaled them by time factor (how long is a day) transfer delta-v\u0027s would increase a lot and it wouldn\u0027t be playable with stock engines. But that means that earth won\u0027t be on the same position every year.\n- TerrainHeight: Reduced to 25% mostly.\n- Phobos \u0026 Deimos: Because of issues with even more reduced size, those tiny moons of mars are real world sized with reduced orbit around mars.\n- Rotation Periods have been scaled down by time scale earth vs. kerbin time (therefore tidally locked moons have a longer period in days as kerbin has a longer year)\n- Stock warp times\n\nInstallation:\n\n1. [Install RSS **TEXTURES**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55145)\n2. Grab the mod here [\u003EDOWNLOAD\u003C](http://kerbal.curseforge.com/projects/s-3-smallsolarsystem)\n3. Put the folder \u0022SmallSolarSystem\u0022 in GameData\n4. (optional) If you want to use RT, install RSS config\n5. Don\u0027t forget to install [KSC Switcher](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117893) for different starting locations!\n6. The mod is now CKAN for easy installations!\n\n[Showcase](http://imgur.com/a/PecjG)(send your photos ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif))\n\nLicense: MIT License"},{"CreatedByName":"Yukon0009","CreatedById":109376,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T13:33:43Z","Content":"Great, I was planning on something like this as well.

When using a downscaled RSS, you will aditionally have to tweak the body names in those .cfgs - also some cloud layers might not fit with their planets (eve-venus, titan-laythe)."},{"CreatedByName":"E.Nygma","CreatedById":104703,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-04T17:49:40Z","Content":"Thanks Tellion,\n\nalready tried RVE, it glitches and framerate drops to unplayable levels, plus the fading etc. is assuming a larger planet\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6.Well, I\u0027m currently trying to tweak KSPRC...\n\nThanks again!"},{"CreatedByName":"Niemand303","CreatedById":119422,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T12:35:53Z","Content":"Sounds like a good continuation of the mod for me!
