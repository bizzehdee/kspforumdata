I have a 3770k i7 OC\u0027d to 4.5 Ghz desktop CPU with a 7970 Radeon card, and in Windows Opengl, it runs decent. But in Linux, it\u0027s unbearable. Moving the camera drops the framerate drastically, instability issues everywhere and overall average framerates are lower than I see on Windows despite the powerful CPU. I suspect it also has something to do with the Unity Engine in Linux, but judging by how I see Nvidia users not noticing FPS problems in Linux and so many unhappy AMD GPU users you can\u0027t say that the GPU doesn\u0027t matter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI personally tried KSP on Ubuntu 14 with my Radeon rig and it was painful, despite the uncapped memory potential.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a reddit thread about the current state of using AMD gpu\u0027s for KSP in linux: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/2uzj9h/psa_users_of_linux_version_of_ksp_with_amd/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/2uzj9h/psa_users_of_linux_version_of_ksp_with_amd/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut you are right in that the physics engine also needs a total revamp.

RO has lots of them, so just open them up and try to understand what they are doing (best have KSP running next to it and compare the actual ingame stats of the specific parts). Once you understand why a part has the stats it has coming from the config, you\u0027ll have gained a great deal of understanding. Do that a couple times more, then start to do your own tests by writing your own small config files.
