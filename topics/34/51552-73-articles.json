I wanted them to be on a circular orbit 700km above Kerbin. And here is where the science comes in - how to get them spaced equally apart ? With a little calculation, I came up with an orbit - apoapsis of course 700km (and above Space Center to provide connection) and periapsis 246.25km. The first satellite, after launching in apoapsis and circularizing its orbit to 700km, goes 3/4 of its orbit when the stack of other satellites reaches its apoapsis again to launch another satellite. So after a few passes, there are 4 satellites on circular orbit spaced equally apart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd for those who don\u0027t want/know how to do the math you can use my spreadsheet. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0An8NcugzRlWpdFBsNHd6N21qdUZVUGpyYmlDRjRyb3c\u0026amp;usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0An8NcugzRlWpdFBsNHd6N21qdUZVUGpyYmlDRjRyb3c\u0026amp;usp=sharing\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll just need to make a copy to edit it (file menu)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ascension Islander","CreatedById":92338,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-31T00:59:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, Sarbian, just wanna say that the new flight computer is AMAZING.
