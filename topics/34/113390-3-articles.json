I suppose my main concerns here are:\n\n1. It\u0027s been \u0022just\u0022 three months since tg626\u0027s last post in this thread - should we keep waiting for a short while more to see if tg626 reacts (now that we have posted about the unavailability of the download), or just go ahead with an upload?\n2. How to upload the mod in a manner such that tg626 can take over the administration of the download page when/if he returns? Or so that someone else can take over?\n\nSome temporary location wouldn\u0027t be a problem (could be removed once an official download is available again), but on SpaceDock, there will likely be future confusion between a \u0022DockingSoundsTempRedistribution\u0022 and a later official \u0022DockingSounds\u0022, if both are available at some point. The URL of the future official version (if any) does not exist at the point of time when the temporary distribution is made, so the .version file cannot be made to automatically track official updates.\n\nI suppose this is possible to work around - once an official version becomes available again - by updating the temporary redistribution at that point with a dummy release that just changes the version file to point users to the official download, but that requires maintenance. My gaming patterns are too erratic to guarantee that I\u0027ll be around to update the temporary distribution possibly much later."},{"CreatedByName":"Roxette","CreatedById":84963,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-25T14:22:22Z","Content":"It appears from his activity on here and twitter that tg626 is now only online for a few days around the start of each month.
