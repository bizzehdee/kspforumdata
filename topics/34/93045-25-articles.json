However, you can still stage. And that\u0027s all they did with those early sounding rockets (they don\u0027t even have any means of steering - no reaction wheels, no gimbals, no control surfaces).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that in RP-0, you always need an avionics package to control the ship; even having a pilot does not seem to be enough if you don\u0027t bring one of the avionics parts with you.

I\u0027ve yet to get a satellite up to do a fly by of the Moon, let alone breaking out of Earth\u0027s gravity well, but I see I have a contract to put a satellite into a stationary orbit of Pluto.
