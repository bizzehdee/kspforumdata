I\u0027m on Val, with plenty of power and space for liquidfuel, and at 1x time warp each refinery (I have two) produces 26.6mT/day, 2x 13.3mT/day, 5x 5.3mT/day, etc. I think you added an extra 1/delta-t term there. It makes it effectively useless - trying to refuel 3000 LiquedFuel at -0.12 would take 7 hours of real time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA question about waste heat: why does increased levels of waste heat not change the radiator temperature? And what does waste heat even mean? Is it the temperature of the coolant?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be neat (although it might be too computationally inefficient) to model waste heat being radiated back to the ship from radiators. As it is, you can put a radiator in the middle of a cluster of fuel tanks and it still works to cool the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn nuclear reactor manual shutdowns, can you add an EVA tooltip for when the reactor is still in the decay heating phase? It was more than a little confusing when I shut down the reactor and it stopped displaying a context menu entirely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan you add a version of a nuclear reactor (or a part that surface attaches to a nuclear reactor?) that allows you to shut it down and restart it without requiring a kerbal?
