First of all, I\u0027m using this completely for my own personal use, but if you\u0027re interested Fractal I could PM you all the tidbits and whatnot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, from what I found, science via laboratories was an amazing idea. I felt that the stock sandbox lost a lot on not being to do more science. 0.22 appears to be addressing this, and I absolutely \u003Cem\u003Ecannot\u003C/em\u003E wait for that - which is the main reason why I did this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, turns out, Kethane has some really neat modular API with its resource managing. By stock-Kethane, grids around every planet would randomly generate with the Kethane resource. The API allows you to add your own resource, complete with the ability to detect it, mine it and convert it. It\u0027s all very configurable, including changing min/max resource values and the amount of deposits per body specifically. One thing I can\u0027t figure out is to make the deposit areas into just ONE tile. If anyone could help with that, it\u0027d be great. (Also setting the color, too.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, here\u0027s where the magic happens for me. I added a KethaneResource called Samples, which is really just synonymous for \u0022Interesting Dug-Up Scientific Crap\u0022. The mod magically generates its own deposits, complete with a separate hex maps that you can cycle through in the map.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow once you\u0027ve detected a \u0022Samples\u0022 deposit, you can land a rover and deploy your drill on that site. At the moment the deposits have a min/max of 1-5. Each unit of samples converts to 2000 science for interstellar. You can do this with some sort of part (currently the RTG model) that holds science and converts science, but does not transmit. The reason for such a large ratio stems from my idea against \u0022grinding\u0022. If the player wants a faster, riskier method of gaining more science - it\u0027d be fair to make it a high-payout, but rare, occurrence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m very excited to play with this now. I have more motive to plan missions to gain science faster and with more interaction from myself as a player.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I would really like is integration to Fractal\u0027s dreams. It\u0027d be best if the rover itself could have a part that converts the samples to science (which is the only way now), but with some sort of a large loss. Furthermore it\u0027s also given the ability to transmit, but yet again at a high loss. One other method is to drive it to a science lab for analysis (or fly it up to orbit) for a lesser loss. This\u0027d be even better considering there\u0027s the whole Kerbal Stupidity added in (love that btw, Fractal).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem with having a lab grounded is the deposit would pretty much run out immediately. No one really likes driving a rover 5000km to another site and back, etc. I might experiment with the idea of creating one tile deposits of Samples, and then adding a lot of them. Dunno.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you think Fractal? Like or otherwise, it\u0027s all great - in the end I just wanted to show my appreciation for your mod.

The vacuum also has some energy associated with it and therefore some mass associated with that energy, so the quantum vacuum plasma thruster, instead of carrying a plasma propellant, it treats the quantum vacuum itself as a plasma and exerts forces against it in order to propel the spacecraft. A spacecraft with this type of engine doesn\u0027t need any internal propellant, all it needs is some fuel to power a large electric generator because the amount of thrust you get from doing this is really tiny.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou know what? I actually came up with an idea of how the universe exists and all that crap. You have the vacuum, which scientists say is empty, right? Well, what was there before the big bang? A whole lot of nothing. Literally. The universe is spreading, but you cna\u0027t say that the universe spreads by the atoms that grow apart. Truly there has to be something out there than jsut nothing. So, I thought of the vacuum as a vast ocean, and the way that radio waves travel isn\u0027t jsut through nothing, but through that ocean, like acting as ripples that we manipulate.

The great thing about having one tile deposits (and low sample size) is that the landing will be very challenging (without mechjeb at least), presenting risk and challenge. Transporting it back and forth also plays a part in this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow all we need is Fractal to add more upgrades so Science is even more in demand. I really hope he never does a \u0027universal\u0027 upgrade where you just need to upgrade a part once. The way it is now allows much replayability without too much grinding, which is perfect.
