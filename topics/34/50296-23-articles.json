We could each provide default values for our separate versions to help avoid additional confusion amongst players, and also evaluate any modifications to the existing code base solely on its merits for our chosen playstyle.

What you need to look at in FAR\u0027s panel is the Frac SL Density (the current atmospheric density) and, once you open the flight details, the current Cd (coefficient of drag) and reference area (multiply the two for a sense of how much drag you\u0027re getting).\u003Cp\u003ESo your terminal velocity at sea level should be ~400m/s, and probably closer to mach 2-3 some km up.

KSP already straddles the line between simulator and game, and there\u0027s also a high degree of uncertainty as to where it\u0027s going in the future. Is Squad really going to implement a different aerodynamic model at some point? Reentry? Life support? I\u0027ve seen mention of such around the forums, but who really knows? They call the current builds \u0022sandbox complete\u0022 which says to me that the core mechanics are set and won\u0027t be changing, but I also see a lot of mentions they\u0027re still working on them which contradict that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, where to set the realism bar is a rather big question mark if I want to retain a vanilla feel to BTSM, as I\u0027m not even sure if Squad knows where it\u0027s going to wind up \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do know however, that in terms of KSP being a game (as opposed to a simulator), that people\u0027s perception of realism is often more important than actual realism. I\u0027ll give an example of what I mean by that:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout 20 years ago Jane\u0027s Simulations put out a game called Longbow 2. Both the press and players went wild over how it was the most realistic depiction of a helicopter ever found in a PC game. At one point, PC Gamer magazine brought in an actual Apache pilot, and after sitting him down in front of the game for awhile asked \u0022so how close is it to the real thing?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe response was: \u0022Not at all\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a good laugh when I read that, the lesson I learned from it that really stuck with me was what I said above: that it\u0027s people\u0027s perceptions of how reality behaves that will determine how realistic they view a game to be. Thus whether something \u0022feels\u0022 right became way more important to me as a designer than whether or not it accurately reflects how reality actually works \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou mention how vanilla KSP trains us to think things should work a certain way, and I wouldn\u0027t argue otherwise.
