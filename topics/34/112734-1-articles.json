Did Jeb wear out your cargo bays? Is Bill demanding somewhere to sit back and relax?**\n\nWell thanks to Jeb\u0027s clumsiness some cargo bays have turned up at the VAB with broken hinges. Fortunately, Verner Von Kerman took these broken parts and created the hollow hull section!\n\n![PCSle45.png](http://i.imgur.com/PCSle45.png)\n\nLet\u0027s face it, it\u0027s just an inoperable cargo bay. \n\nBut who doesn\u0027t love to have a place to fill with explosives for... \u0022science-y stuff\u0022. \n\n**Features:**\n\n- Mk2 Cargo Hull Sections (Small and Large)\n\n- Mk3 Cargo Hull Sections (Short, Medium and Long)\n\nService Hull Sections (1.25m and 2.5m) removed for new release. \n\nIf you still want them install this release over the previous one. \n\n**Changelog:** \n\n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003E v1.15 (24/06/15)\n\u003E \n\u003E - Tweaked the part files to work properly with update 1.0.3\n\u003E \n\u003E - Added override cubes from Mk3 Cargo Bay\n\u003E \n\u003E - Specified new breaking forces for parts\n\u003E \n\u003E \u003E v1.13 (14/06/15)\n\u003E \n\u003E - New Textures for the Mk3 and Mk2 hull sections\n\u003E \n\u003E \u003E v1.12 (13/06/15)\n\u003E \n\u003E - New Textures\n\u003E \n\u003E \u003E v1.0 (12/06/15)\n\u003E \n\u003E  - Initial Release\n\u003E \n\u003E  - 3 basic parts with various sizes\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n**To be developed:** \n\n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E  - Better textures\n\u003E \n\u003E - Custom models (if someone wants to collab and make these that\u0027d be great as I suck with models atm)\n\u003E \n\u003E  - (Possibly) longer 1.25m/2.5m/3.75m versions, however I would need custom models which I don\u0027t have experience with making. \n\u003E \n\u003E  - Thus, custom models and rethought part files for the Mk2/Mk3 parts would also be a possibility. \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n**Known Issues:** \n\n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E  - Mk3 closing animation plays on launch \n\u003E \n\u003E  - 1.25m and 2.5m Service Hulls start open and cannot be closed (Removed for v1.15)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nThis mod includes modified versions of stock part files and textures, as well as stock models.\n\nThanks to PorkJet, RoverDude and Squad for the originals. \n\nNote: This mod is in no way affiliated with Alskari\u0027s Hollow Structures \u0026 Hulls mod. \n\n*Please delete your CargoHullExperimental folder in your GameData before installing a new version.*\n\n**Download:** v1.15 [Dropbox](https://dl.orangedox.com/usnisvy3Q6mBMT8Nhg/Stock_Hull_Sections_v1.15.rar) for 1.0.4\n\n**Legacy:** \n\n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E - v1.13 - [Dropbox](https://dl.orangedox.com/TH5r1tC5CImwRRkYmG/Stock_Hull_Sections_v1.13.rar)\n\u003E \n\u003E - v1.12 - [Dropbox](https://dl.orangedox.com/xyF0NDCjCGsBEyV3ZX/Stock_Hull_Sections_v1.12.rar)\n\u003E \n\u003E - v1.0 - [Dropbox](https://dl.orangedox.com/j6p2AiHGiuT0RcAFAN/Stock_Hull_Sections_v1.0.rar)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nIf you would prefer the old Mk3 Cargo Hull texture (more similar to the stock texture), copy the CargoHullExperimental folder under \u0027Alternate Textures\u0027 into your GameData after you have installed the mod. \n\n**Installation:**\n\n1.

I could put stuff such as batteries and small fuel tanks inside the section and cover the exterior with solar panels. If there\u0027s a better fix for the general problem of mounting stuff on these doors it would be better. The Space Shuttle had heat radiator panels on the inside of the payload-bay doors.\n\nSince it\u0027s possible to put multi-resource storage\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20ACbatteries. fuel. monopropellant\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20ACinto a fuel-tank section (\u0022Fuel Switch\u0022 comes to mind) that might be a better answer to that particular case. Start from the smallest-size stackable tank.\n\nIt wouldn\u0027t be hard. And, looking at the stock parts, once you have a stackable battery it seems almost superfluous. But a battery/monopropellant unit at 1.25m diameter might be a handy option, something like an FL-R25 RCS Fuel Tank with half the fuel and the battery capacity of a Z-1k Rechargeable Battery.\n\nI can imagine Valentina, in the VAB, with a screwdriver, making something like this.\n\n manufacturer = Valentina\u0027s Too Obvious For Boys Parts Emporium\n\n description = One night Valentina slipped into the VAB with a screwdriver and a large hammer, and put some batteries into a fuel tank for Monopropellant.

If you have any ideas for how the parts should look, please express those thoughts. I will make some slight changes considering textures for the next update.\n\nThe part.cfg seems pretty simple, though there might be balance issues with cost and tech-tree position\n\nFL-R25 tank:\n\nDry Mass = 0.15 Mg\n\nFuel capacity 250 units = 1.00 Mg\n\nCost = 600\n\nZ-1k rechargeable battery\n\nMass = 0.1 Mg\n\nBattery Capacity = 1000 units\n\nCost = 880\n\nSince the Z-1k is half the height of the tank the combination could be:\n\nMass = 0.25 Mg\n\nFuel Capacity = 125 units = 0.5 Mg\n\nBattery Capacity = 1000 units\n\nCost = 1380\n\nI think that\u0027s a good starting point for game balance. Cover something that size with solar panels and you have something that allows a long-duration mission. The battery capacity might be too big, but it has the physical plausibility.\n\nTexturing I shall have to think about. Just half-battery, half-RCS, seems a little unimaginative. Maybe more on the theme of the service bay and the universal storage mod. That is, black-and-white panels, a hint of vertical corrugation, and maybe some warning symbol.\n\nAnyway, I just ran a test, merely a changed part.cfg, and it works and looks OK with the default texture for the fuel tank. It goes well with the K2 capsule Mod, which is a vaguely Gemini-like two-kerbal capsule in 1.25m size.\n\nAnd now lunch. Should I add some capacity for Snacks..."},{"CreatedByName":"Inqie","CreatedById":142191,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T23:05:34Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Since the Z-1k is half the height of the tank the combination could be:\n\u003E Mass = 0.25 Mg\n\u003E \n\u003E Fuel Capacity = 125 units = 0.5 Mg\n\u003E \n\u003E Battery Capacity = 1000 units\n\u003E \n\u003E Cost = 1380\n\nIf the hybrid part is the same size as the original fuel tank, I would suggest cutting the mass to something more like 2.1Mg, the battery capacity to around 700ec and the cost down to about 1250. If it isn\u0027t the same size as the original, then that makes things harder.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nStock Hull Sections version 1.12 is out, with slightly different textures so you can tell them apart from the cargo bays. \n\nRemember to give Jeb his sandwich back, and enjoy."},{"CreatedByName":"daniel l.","CreatedById":57763,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-13T05:17:37Z","Content":"Thank you for making this ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Inqie","CreatedById":142191,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T04:57:44Z","Content":"New version - Stock Hull Sections v1.13 released, in this release I have made a more \u0027unique\u0027 Mk3 Hull texture look.
