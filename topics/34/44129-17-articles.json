Then click down -10 or -1 a couple times to circularize.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re talking crazy orbit-matching circularization where you\u0027re doing radial, prograde, and maybe even normal burns at the same time that\u0027s some of the fun of the game IMO, and I learned so much (and continue to learn) about saving fuel by doing them manually I\u0027d never dream of handing that over to the computer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I use PreciseNode far more often to plan interplanetary encounters.
