Tell me if they can coexist (if so, is it worth to keep both simultaneasly)?\n\nI totally understand. At some point I replaced RT2 with AntennaRange also. I have been tending towards simpler mods that let me tune my KSP experience rather than large mods that add a ton of parts or overhaul/replace systems.\n\nHere\u0027s my basic rundown of OSP vs ScanSat:\n\nOSP\n\n- No extra parts, only modifies the M700 Orbital Surveyor to remove the insta-scan. In ordered to scan a planet, the M700 requires at least one full orbit while deployed and uses electric charge while it\u0027s scanning (the number of orbits required for a full scan is editable). Scanning progresses while the vessel is unfocused as well.\n- Also adds the ability to view the biome overlay of a planet after it has been surveyed by the M700.\n- Does NOT reveal a planet little-by-little. It simply makes the stock orbital survey take time and electric charge to complete. There are no partial scans.\n- Simple mod with few moving parts that a 5 year old could probably put together.\n\nScanSat (as far as I understand the current version, v12)\n\n- Adds several scanning parts that allow you to make different types of detailed scans of planets.\n- Maps are revealed little-by-little as your satellites pass over the planet and scan them. Scanning progresses while the vessel is unfocused.\n- Adds a module to the M700 that allows it to scan for resources using ScanSat\u0027s system.\n- Does NOT replace the stock system. You can scan planets using the ScanSat scanners and use the insta-survey on the M700 concurrently. There are a few options that try to keep the surface scanner and narrow band scanner relevant in ScanSat\u0027s scope, but otherwise there is very little interaction.\n- ScanSat map overlays (similar to the stock ore overlay) are not available in the current version, but it looks like DMagic is working on it and it will be available in the next version.\n- Super complex mod and DMagic is a ninja.\n\nConcurrent Use\n\nI\u0027m *pretty sure* OSP and ScanSat can work concurrently, especially since the current version of ScanSat is quite detached from stock resource scanning system. However, I imagine you\u0027ll either want to use ScanSat as a replacement for the stock system (where you\u0027ll need to just use self-control not to hit the insta-scan button) or slightly extend the stock system with OSP, in which case you probably wouldn\u0027t have both.\n\nIdeally I\u0027d love to extend the stock system to support partial scanning and get rid of the silly polar inclination requirement, but my modding prowess isn\u0027t quite there yet. Maybe some day.\n\nAnyway, I hope that helps.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-22T05:30:43Z\u0022 title=\u002206/22/2015 05:30  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Wheffle**"},{"CreatedByName":"DMagic","CreatedById":57416,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T06:25:58Z","Content":"Version 13 of SCANsat more or less offers a total replacement for surface resource scanning (it doesn\u0027t do anything with the other types, liquid, asteroid, etc...).
