The structural fairing adapter is going from a 5 meter diameter to 3.75. The fuel adapter is going from 3.75 to 2.5. Both are a 1.25 meter diameter drop.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think I may have figured out their use anyhow (pseudo-fairing adapter...used in place of the actual fairing adapters) and I more reasonably understand what you\u0027re meaning; the taper between the two is affecting the fuel adapter more due to the overall length of the taper (combined) and slowed airflow from from the fairing adapter causing more friction (and drag) on the fuel adapter. Unless I\u0027m completely off-base, which is entirely possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason behind that design is that its payload was wide but not particularly heavy. Four Probe lander/return craft were crammed inside. I used a 3.75 fairing and was trying to keep my TWR / DV budget somewhat reasonable. I didn\u0027t want a 4\u002B TWR upper stage motor with 3-4k DV ripping my rocket apart when its getting dumped at AP anyway. (Wasn\u0027t using that motor and the payload was just so it had something.
