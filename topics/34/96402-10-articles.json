And while this is a definitely a step in the right direction, I\u0027m going to argue that it\u0027s not quite enough. The fact that there was a \u002B60% increase in the latest update implies that some if not all of what I\u0027m about to say, have already occurred to you, but I\u0027m going to say it anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPrior to the new aerodynamic model the drag of a part was directly proportionate to it\u0027s mass. This had the effect of making it so that the density of the part did not effect its aerodynamic properties, and that the overall center of drag would normally be exactly at the same place as center of mass. So storing liquid fuel and oxidizer in separate tanks was never something I fancied myself doing. There was simply no practical benefit to it. However, none of these is the case anymore.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow it is possible to shift stuff around to move the center of mass relative to the center of drag (or external geometry in general), and the density of parts plays a big role in this. There are now reasons to put the more dense oxidizer either on top or bottom of the liquid fuel tank depending on what you are trying to do. But currently player is getting an approximate 15% density penalty for storing liquid fuel and oxidizer in separate tanks compared to storing them in a mixed tank. And according to my calculations in a lot of situations that penalty will be more than enough negate the benefits gained. I have come to think that 15% density penalty is non-trivial, un-justified and un-realistic. Not to mention that gameplay wise it needlessly limits the engineering optimizations available to the player.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI understand that the liquid fuel tanks need to be balanced against the stock liquid fuel tanks, at least approximately. But the oxidizer is not subject to any such constraints. And if anything, the lack of stock oxidizer only containers explicitly implies that within the game world physics, oxidizer is denser than how it\u0027s currently being modeled by Procedural Parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo my, hopefully well argued, suggestion is that the capacity of oxidizer tanks be further increased to a level where storing it in a separate tanks would not result in an unreasonable increase in the container volume. Approx 50% further increase to oxidizer capacity compared to current values, would completely eliminate the disparity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t agree? I would love to hear arguments against.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
