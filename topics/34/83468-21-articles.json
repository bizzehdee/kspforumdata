I want to end up in that 4th picture, I effectively want to connect a winch to a connector without having to go EVA. Ideally I\u0027d get the winch port right up to the connector port, and they would connect once sufficiently aligned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can do a very similar thing with a magnet, but the magnet can attach anywhere. I\u0027d love a more precise alignment. I can also do a similar thing with two docking ports, but I don\u0027t want the two vessels docked (to be merged into one vessel). I\u0027m willing to edit .cfg files and/or create new parts to get this behaviour, is this doable with any of the KAS* modules? I want to create a pair of parts like the end-effector (on the arm) and grapple-fixture (on the vessel) of the Canadarm. Thinking about it, it is very like a stock docking port behaviour, without the actual vessel-merging.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the answer is no: the winch and the connector/port parts in KAS are EVA-oriented.
