The volumetric cloud looks really great. It must use too much resources to put them all over the place but if they decrease in volume depending on distance, it could be feasible couldn\u0027t it? I\u0027m really impatient to see this. It would really add to the environment and immersion to go through the clouds while flying a plane or a rocket and know from that moment that you\u0027re heading off to space. Also, does someone know if anyone worked on turbulence? In earlier versions of the game, rockets would tend to sway and sometimes snap at a certain altitude. Establishing that for the below cloud level and make it especially intense while going through the clouds would make the mission that much more exciting.
