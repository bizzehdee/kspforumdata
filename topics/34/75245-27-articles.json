Won\u0027t the interference cause problems if the vector of the communication points at the sun, even if the sun is behind the target? This would mean that you\u0027re more likely to want geosync satellites, as you can position two of them so that they\u0027re always visible from KSC, so if the sun is behind one of them, you can relay through the other. Using lower altitude constellations would mean accepting a communications blackout whenever there\u0027s only one satellite visible from KSC and the sun is right behind it, which would probably happen quite often.\u003Cp\u003EAs I understand it, the most accurate way to represent this would be to reduce the range of any communications that would be coming from a vector with a retrograde that points at or near the sun, with the effect becoming less pronounced as the retrograde vector moves away from the sun, simulating the fact that the transmitting antenna\u0027s signal is getting lost in the background noise. If it\u0027s closer, it could still overpower the background noise. Which isn\u0027t to say that we need that accurate of a model for this to be an interesting mechanic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: On second thought, this might not cause problems with lower altitude constellations, since those are usually based on omnidirectional antennas, which are already dealing with the solar interference.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour proposal is quite accurate, as it correctly considers some of the factors that involve noise in communications. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, please let me also show what I consider a plausible system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe amount of background noise, in reality, can be computed just with the same equation that gives the received signal power (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friis_transmission_equation\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EFriis equation\u003C/a\u003E). In a different form, that equation provides the actual range of a communication system. Please note RemoteTech currently computes range in a very different way, still some viable mechanic can be introduced to simulate background noise accounting for the following:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- the \u003Cstrong\u003Ebeamwidth\u003C/strong\u003E of the receiving antenna (or, its gain, as the two are closely tied);\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- the \u003Cstrong\u003Eangular difference\u003C/strong\u003E between the transmitter and the noise source, as seen by the receiving antenna;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- the \u003Cstrong\u003Erelative distances \u003C/strong\u003Eof the transmitter-receiver link and noisesource-receiver link, to the power of 2;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- the relative power of the trasmitter and the noisesource (currently unknown), multiplied by the respective gain;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- the bandwidth, or selectivity, of the receiver (currently not defined in RemoteTech2).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe last two factors are not factored in RemoteTech2 currently, so an acceptable value has to be chosen that makes for an acceptable mechanic in game, without introducing further difficulties to players.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany other factors would be considered in reality (carrier frequency, polarization, losses, antenna impedance...) but would only overcomplicate things, so am leaving them out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKnowing the relative amount of signal and noise power provides the \u003Cstrong\u003ES/N ratio\u003C/strong\u003E, which is one of the most important factors to determine range in reality.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut also, S/N ratio is very important to determine the datarate, or the \u003Cstrong\u003Echannel capacity\u003C/strong\u003E of the communication link (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon%E2%80%93Hartley_theorem\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EShannon-Hartley theorem\u003C/a\u003E). A low S/N ratio limits the channel capacity, and that should bear to a smaller PacketSize (or longer PacketInterval) with the antenna (possibly to be simulated by coding a variable speed of transmission in RT2).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope the above is of interest; I already have parts of the math behind real communication systems covered, so could help in case developers wanted to consider it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mecki","CreatedById":116929,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-31T10:46:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have a question that may sound stupid but I couldn\u0027t find a definitive answer in the tutorial:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs it sufficient for a relay satellite to have just one omnidirectional antenna or do I need to have one per connection (one to connect to KSC, the other one to connect to probe / ship / other COMSat\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"veryinky","CreatedById":71372,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-31T10:49:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022mecki\u0022 data-cite=\u0022mecki\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIs it sufficient for a relay satellite to have just one omnidirectional antenna\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly need one omni antenna per satellite, connects to everything within range.
