For instance, I was using KW Rocketry, NovaPunch Remix, and B9 Aerospace, all of which have many parts. These would work fine, but ISA MapSat takes up a lot of extra memory, and the game itself can only use up to ~3.3GB of RAM. Anything over that will crash the game. I managed to go through and prune off a lot of the extra parts I never use, and am actually able to run the game fine now, although memory usage still climbs even when not using ISA MapSat.
