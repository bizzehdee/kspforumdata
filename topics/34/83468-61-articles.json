I like to add the KAS strut to specific locations on the space station modules. Then when I dock them together I go EVA and have my kerbal connect the struts on the docked modules. It gives it a cool well built look, plus it might ad a bit more stability (maybe?). Well I brought up another pod and docked with my previously built parts. I docked and then EVA\u0027d to connect the struts as usual. Well on this particular occasion I left my capsule docked while i connected the struts. On the previous occasions I would dock and detach my launch capsule, then connect the struts. Anyway after connecting all the new struts I detached the launch capusle. well every single struts i spent time connecting via EVA was no longer connected. Needless to say I was kind of pissed. Is it supposed to do this? I was under the impression that these struts would stay connected unless I disconnected two parts that were connected and had struts on them, not lose all struts all over the station when i undocked my launch capsule from the station. Am I using the wrong part? Should I be using the pipe connectors for this purpose instead of the strut? I\u0027ve used pipes on base modules after docking them but only to make sure they had a cross feed. Will all the pipes disappear if I undock something too? I was just wondering. I love this mod and wanted to make sure this was reported if it was a bug. Oh this happened on KSP 1.0.2 and KAS 5.1.
