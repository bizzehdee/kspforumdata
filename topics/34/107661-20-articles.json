I kept getting people complain about the occasional exception that would be thrown up.  Most often it would be when exiting KSP.  Like almost the last line in the logfile.  It seemed to me that if the last [x] Science! update took too long then its coroutine just got killed because Unity didn\u0027t want to wait for it any longer.\n\nNow that we have the Here\u0026Now window it seems to me that it is a good thing that we aren\u0027t on a separate thread because otherwise we could zoom through loads of biomes before we get a chance to stop time-warping.  However I think that although [x] Science is pretty efficient all the extra stuff it does now is becoming a bit more of a burden.\n\nI have an idea that maybe we could add new update types for loaded and unloaded vessels.  So KSP has all vessels in its save file.  It makes them live when they are within a couple of kilometres of the camera - loads them into RAM in a different format.  [x] Science! works by being as dumb as bricks.  If it ever goes wrong it fixes its self next update.  It is really uncomplicated like that and it means it is not to difficult to maintain.  Essentially,  it just brute-forces that save file every update.\n\nHowever things \\_are\\_ getting stretched and I\u0027d like to speed things up if I can.  If I walk the save file for all vessels and stash the results then most of the time I ought to be able to just zoom through the loaded vessels and add the science total to the unloaded ones.  Most changes should happen on the tiny number of loaded vessels, so those updates will be faster.  Should be easy!  No Problem!  Small matter of programming!\n\nI think the real issue will be if I can hook enough events to be sure nothing has happened to an unloaded vessel.  That and also the issue of loaded and unloaded vessels swapping places as they go in and out of range.   All comes down to managing lists.\n\nIn the mean time - get a faster box.  Actually managing your total launched part count will help.  Not having masses of science instruments that you don\u0027t use.  Ditching Kopernicus mods you don\u0027t really need.  That kinda thing will help.\n\nI like having my space junk in orbit.  It makes me launch better, but that stuff can really add up.  Try going through your debris and pruning that stuff.  There is a [x] Science! setting to discount debris but just deleting the stuff is even better.\n\nMy personal priorities for [x] Science! are to add some stats to the tracking station scene and to try and change the way [x] Science! handles completed experiments.  At the moment completion of experiments is in-lined all over the place and so having a setting to say an experiment goes green at 90% collected or at 99% collected or at \u003C1MIT remaining is just not feasible.  Not something I\u0027m interested in really but like the single button/2 button thing people are asking for it.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-06-29T12:37:47Z\u0022 title=\u002206/29/2017 12:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJune 29, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Z-Key Aerospace**\n  \nSpelling mistake"},{"CreatedByName":"Wyzard","CreatedById":162363,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-29T14:13:29Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 18 minutes ago, Z-Key Aerospace said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Essentially,  it just brute-forces that save file every update.\n\u003E \n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 18 minutes ago, Z-Key Aerospace said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E If I walk the save file for all vessels and stash the results then most of the time I ought to be able to just zoom through the loaded vessels and add the science total to the unloaded ones.  Most changes should happen on the tiny number of loaded vessels, so those updates will be faster.\n\u003E \n\nI\u0027m surprised that unloaded vessels are considered at all; I didn\u0027t think [x] Science looked at anything besides the current active vessel.  An unloaded vessel isn\u0027t going to perform any experiments, and AFAIK its motion doesn\u0027t trigger the \u0022here and now\u0022 thing, so I don\u0027t see what\u0027d need to be checked or updated on it every frame.\n\nI haven\u0027t looked at the code so I don\u0027t know how it\u0027s structured, but it seems to me like there are several separate tasks that can probably be done at different times, in response to different events:\n\n- Building the big science list, figuring out which experiments are available and the completion level for each.  Only needs to be done when the player loads a save, performs an experiment, or unlocks a new science part in the tech tree.  The rest of the time, this information is constant and can be cached.  It\u0027s also the same for all vessels, so it can be shared between them.\n- Filtering the big science list to figure out which experiments are relevant to the active vessel, for \u0022here and now\u0022 purposes and for the \u0022available on this vessel\u0022 option in the science list window.  Only needs to be done when the player switches to a new vessel or when the active vessel\u0027s part count changes; the rest of the time, it can be cached.\n- Checking the active vessel\u0027s situation against available experiments, for \u0022here and now\u0022 and the \u0022available right now\u0022 option in the science list.  Needs to be done every frame, but this should be pretty quick since the available experiment info is cached.\n\nAgain, I haven\u0027t looked at the code; maybe you have things split up this way already.  But if you\u0027re re-doing all the above work in every frame, you might be able to get some big savings by splitting things up and caching the information that only changes in response to certain events.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 18 minutes ago, Z-Key Aerospace said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E At the moment completion of experiments is in-lined all over the place and so having a setting to say an experiment goes green at 90% collected or at 99% collected or at \u003C1MIT remaining is just not feasible.\n\u003E \n\nBack when I first tried this mod in 1.2, I uninstalled it because the science list showed a bunch of Mun surface experiments (IIRC) at 99% but not quite finished, because, presumably, it was still possible to get a tiny amount of science from each.  I wasn\u0027t going to spend hours (and funds) doing another Mun landing in every biome just to get that last 0.1 science (or whatever it was), so those 99% experiments were basically permanent clutter in the list, and it seemed likely that I\u0027d accumulate more of them from other planets/moons for the same reason.\n\nI don\u0027t know if things have changed since then, and I haven\u0027t done any Mun landings in 1.3 yet (haven\u0027t played much in the past few weeks).  I\u0027ve found that the \u0022here and now\u0022 feature is useful enough that I\u0027ll keep using this mod even if the science list window is full of 99% clutter.  But, yeah, it\u0027d be helpful to have a configurable threshold for when an experiment is considered \u0022done\u0022."},{"CreatedByName":"Z-Key Aerospace","CreatedById":138926,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-30T21:12:27Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 29/06/2017 at 3:13 PM, Wyzard said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m surprised that unloaded vessels are considered at all; I didn\u0027t think [x] Science looked at anything besides the current active vessel.
