Made a NERV powered space-craft that has left over Oxidizer from Launch from Kerbin? Set up a refining vessel and realize that you produced more Oxidizer than you need? Wish you had a way to get rid of this heavy Oxidizer to increase your Delta-V?\n\nThen the Oxidizer Flameanator is for you, my friend! Slap this part on your craft and never have to worry about carrying the weight of unusable/unwanted Oxidizer. This part burns Oxidizer quickly and inefficiently converting it to ElectricCharge. The Flameanator will continue to burn Oxidizer even when your vessel\u0027s batteries are fully charged. \n\n![qttTRCBl.png](http://i.imgur.com/qttTRCBl.png)\n\nThis part used Stock assets, it doesn\u0027t add any extra textures or models to the game, so memory impact is very low.\n\nI give Squad full credit for model design for the part I use to make my mod.\n\nKerbal Stuff Link: [https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/826/Oxidizer%20Flameanator](https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/826/Oxidizer%20Flameanator)\n\nLicense: GPLv3\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-21T04:09:41Z\u0022 title=\u002205/21/2015 04:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Haze-Zero**"},{"CreatedByName":"hieywiey","CreatedById":99098,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T01:20:55Z","Content":"I\u0027m not a moderator, but I think you need a license.
