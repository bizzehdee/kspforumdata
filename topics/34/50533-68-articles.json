This includes zeroing stock aerodynamic properties and adding on FARs own custom drag and lift model etc. ModuleManager doesn\u0027t come with any patches, it\u0027s up to mod authors (and you, if you\u0027re feeling brave) to write some. Rest assured though - if anything is written incorrectly in these, nothing bad will happen, just that the intended patch will not occur. Any mod that makes use of ModuleManager to apply patches will also include ModuleManager itself as well (such as FAR). The only trouble comes when you have multiple copies of it - if you do, you can delete all but that highest version numbered one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for installation, you don\u0027t need both copies of the ModuleManager dll, just one is fine and it can be anywhere in Gamedata - either in a folder by itself or not. KSP will see it and load it all the same. Same with the patches themselves (they\u0027re always .cfg files) - they can be anywhere, but sarbian recommends you put personal patches in a personal folder of your own in Gamedata to keep track of them easily.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the coding (I presume you mean the text in the .cfg file), that\u0027s just telling ModuleManager what patches to apply to parts.

I\u0027ve opened and loaded the game several times, then during loading of the spaceport it just randomly started crashing. Yes I know 64bit is unstable but am wondering if its something simple that can be fixed. I have several mods installed and have determined its MM through a painful process of elimination.
