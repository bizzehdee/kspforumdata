My bad.\u003Cp\u003ESee, I have seen the Reccomended Mods list.

Very few rocket engines were developed after 1990, and most of the ones used today actually have their roots even earlier, in the 1960s moon race. The engines in the Soviet Pack are mostly from the 80s and are actually among the most modern engines you can get.

Now I\u0027d continue to help you out, but apparently I may or may not be stalking you. I\u0027m not sure I haven\u0027t figured it out yet. But I\u0027ll take a chance. \u003Cp\u003EMost part mods that RO uses and reconfigures contain engines that are indeed still in active use, engines that aren\u0027t and my favorite... Concept engines that never flew. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor instance FASA has the F1 engines that aren\u0027t in use anymore and the RL-10 which are in use.The Soviet pack has the RD180 which is still in use ( though it may be called RD170 in the soviet pack I forget ) Then there\u0027s the NK-33 upon which again I can\u0027t recal if the soviet pack has that or not. I know you can get the modern AJ36 version from the AerojetKerbodyne mod. ( The ones that just exploded the Antares months ago Iirc ) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI imagine you could pluck the space shuttle main engines out of the component space shuttle mod as well. There not in active use, but they will be soon. Anything beyond that, well it\u0027s actually a good bit of work to go through each mod and say exactly what engines and variants of those engines are still in use. I recommend installing a mod pack. Then go through and see what engines you like and dont like. Simply remove the ones you don\u0027t want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow someone please correct me if I\u0027m wrong, but most rockets today use soviet engines or variants of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELol, don\u0027t worry about the stalking warning.

And the RS-25s from Component Space Shuttle... you sir, are a genius after all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yeah, Soviet technology has made wonders in modern extraerrestrial propulsion.
