Back in .22, whenever you had the VAB deltaV window open, the staging interface would do weird things. Now in .23 with mechjeb \u003Cem\u003Eattached\u003C/em\u003E to a spacecraft you cannot manipulate the lower two stages above the \u0022reset\u0022 button. I\u0027ve tried dragging things down there, but they stop or get frozen. Take off mechjeb and the problem disappears. \u003Cp\u003ESounds like an invisible window bug. Anyone else having this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had the same problem earlier. Moved one of the engine icons and it got \u0027stuck\u0027 behind another stage icon and I couldn\u0027t select it.
