If you\u0027re making a longer, more smoothed out fairing, especially one that isn\u0027t significantly wider than the vehicle, then you won\u0027t get more drag. If your fairing\u0027s radius is twice that of the rest of the rocket (read: you made the stock fairing as wide as you could), you\u0027re talking about taking up 4x the area of the rest of the rocket cross-section, which should be a sign that your fairing design is silly and will produce a lot of drag at transonic and supersonic speeds.\u003Cp\u003EFinally, stability is not a sign that the fairing is poor at it\u0027s job. Its job is to reduce drag and to protect the payload; the engines have enough control authority to keep the rocket on course with thrust vectoring. Extra stability is nice, but a properly designed fairing will probably produce more body lift than the payload will and make the rocket less stable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess I\u0027ll have to add some extra code to make unstreamlined payloads really come apart at high speeds then just to make things absolutely sure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPictures are helpful.
