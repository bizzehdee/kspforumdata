I raged quit the game for awhile due to the low FPS i was getting and never really searched out why it happened, lol. I knew it wasnt a problem with tac life back then tho.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomeone else said \u0022I believe this issue is caused by missing part plugins. If a part calls for a module that does not exist (ie a plugin is missing or failed to load) it does the expandingaroo thingy...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIm suposed to be packing up for going camping for the next 4 days, but being a professional procrastinator, i have yet started and i think were leaving in the morning, lol.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope that helps both of ya. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like the idea of the green house not being easy. Hopefully ill have time to try it if i stop adding mods in and play for once!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Holyvision","CreatedById":100532,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-22T16:27:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am excited to see where this mod could go over time -- especially with some awesome models.

Adaptive texturing sounds like a great idea - I will look into how to do that! Modeling is further out - I have a little experience with Maya, but it\u0027s very time consuming and I still want to have some time to actually play KSP! :-)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Parokki","CreatedById":39644,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-31T00:09:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESorry to be that guy, but I\u0027ve never used GitHub before and am utterly unable to find a download link.
