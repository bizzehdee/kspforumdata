The whole point of a budget is to not drop below 0. When you do you start having penalties.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow that I think about the budget screen the penalties are not included in the actual budget window. Because the budget thinks you got paid say 200,000 for a mission.. But with a reduction to payout it might of been say only 75,000 payout. which explains the discrepancies. MCE is not perfect in all respects in cases like these and most the time people tend to control their budgets enough for things like this to happen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith .24 somewhere on horizon fixing this issue would be pointless at this time.

If your in debt for 50,000 then your loan loan is for 50,000. When you do a mission and get a payout of say 75,000 you pay interest out of that payout for the loan for 50% of payout meaning you only actually get paid 37500. So your dept now becomes 12500. Now your loan is 12500. And your payment is reduced for mission payout next time to 25%. until you get out of debt. Getting hit with the 75% part of interest is tough indeed. But was added to make people rethink about just launching a vessel for 500,000 when you only have 50,000. Of course this does not include the actual ship cost. usually when you go into dept with MCE its pretty unforgiving.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-15T17:13:33Z\u0022 title=\u002205/15/2014 05:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 15, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by malkuth\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"malkuth","CreatedById":57414,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-15T17:01:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022magico13\u0022 data-cite=\u0022magico13\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou\u0027re using a version of RealChute after v1.1 right?
