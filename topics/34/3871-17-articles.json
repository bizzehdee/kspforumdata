Pushing yourself through them might not be such a problem if you detach your spacecraft from the fairing base after you detach the shrouds. Then you can use the base, which is wider than your main craft, to push the shrouds away and then detach. Alternatively, you can go into the .craft file and change the decoupler force to something a tad more powerful.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NovaSilisko","CreatedById":3897,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-02-21T00:28:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tiberion\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Tiberion\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERoger that, Kurt.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWas playing around a bit with some new texture images, and decided to test some stuff on something I dug up:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;image was here\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDunno who might recognize this still (aside from Nova) but this is the original SIDR pod, from 1.0 and lower, which was replaced by the most excellent current bootleg pod.
