Once we have Kerbin (earth) and the mun (moon) rounded out with a 6 to 10 realistic missions each we will have \u0022lots to do\u0022 while we await further out missions to Mars and Venus to be thought up.

This would not only make the missions upto lunar landings easier to manage, it would also be easier on budgets at game start, also it would remove the need for \u0022sub-standard\u0022 400-600GM GEO comms sats that would need near immediate replacement (a moderate issue unless one throws the lions share of science points to comms/solar tech, which impacts node progression heavily). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am unsure if the game files can be edited to preexisting structures but a pair of launch clamp (with their releases disabled) holding a stayputnik mk1 with a communitron 32 \u0026amp; Comms DTS-m1 (set locked to active vessel or if possible have the probe stats edited to have the desired omni range to lunar surface \u0022built-in\u0022) should work work as a static always on \u0022comms tower\u0022, as long as they form a \u0022line of sight\u0022 network.

Compare that with how long some of the apollo missions spent before departing. Hypothetically (maybe not) you could make one experiment take a very long time (months/years) to justify the need for orbital labs and space stations.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYup, that sounds about right.
