When you need to attach something on surface you likely need to make new holes on that surface, its sounds reasonable to have a mechanical tool for that. And when you attach to a node (a pre-designed place to attach something) there are bolts and nuts only, and a simple wrench is enough. I\u0027d actually swap the limitation.\n\u003E \n\nAh. Thanks.

A couple of minor notes about the release on github:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1. The release links are called \u0022Source code.zip\u0022 or whatever, which is unusual. Usually the source code is a separate download, and the release only contains the files necessary to run the mod. Both are included with that download zip, so it\u0027s fine; just confusing.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 2. There are two \\*.version files in the downloads: one in the root directory for the mod, and one in the /Plugins directory. (This is true for KAS as well.) This creates duplicate entries on the KVC. Not a big deal, but an easy fix. They\u0027re identical, so I deleted the one on the /Plugins directory.\n\u003E \n\n1. We discussed it with KospY and agreed that Github should not be used for \u0022real\u0022 releases. \u0022Real release\u0022 is a package that one can simply unzip into \u0060GameData\u0060 folder and get a working mod. Such files are stored on Curseforge. It\u0027s a long story to explain why this approach is convenient but trust me, it really is ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022) That said, releases on Github are nothing more but source code snapshots. They are not intended for installation by an end user, they are for developers.\n2. The files structure is not ideal and, yeah, there are duplicated version files. Since releases are handled by a script it\u0027s not a problem. One day I\u0027ll refactor the whole structure.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 4 hours ago, googbo said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E when i had this installed i couldn\u0027t take crew reports or eva reports i deleted it but i still can\u0027t can someone please help me.\n\u003E \n\nAnything related to the context menus (that show up on right mouse click) are handled by the modules that provide the component. E.g. if you have troubles with crew in pod \u0022ABC\u0022 then it\u0027s a problem in the code of the ABC mod. Your best bet is uninstalling all the mods and then trying them one by one. I\u0027m almost certain KIS has nothing to do here.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 4 hours ago, curiousepic said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Has anyone shared pre-packed KIS containers as subassemblies yet (and/or is there a method to make packing less tedious)?\n\u003E \n\nWhat is \u0022pre-packed\u0022? Do you mean saving a container with some items inside as a subassembly? If yes then it works just fine.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, DigitalProeliator said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Having the odd Kerbal cloning bug when getting into a pod and wondering if anyone has had it on the new build. I do have several mods installed so there is a chance its a conflict but it disappears so far only when I uninstall KIS. KAS is just fine if left installed but of course has no functionality. The newly created Kerbal is destroyed when going back to the space center screen because it is labeled as connected to an \u0022unknown part\u0022 and deleted.
