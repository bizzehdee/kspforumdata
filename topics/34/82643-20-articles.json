I\u0027d have to have DasPenguin get me exact numbers but I\u0027m pretty sure the battery module has a lower poly count than several other parts in our mod. My experience has been that draw calls count for a lot more than straight up poly count. The battery module is a single model and therefore only one material so it should be only one draw call. Now it does have an emissive but so do several other parts so if the other parts are fine then I\u0027m still left scratching my head. I\u0027ve downloaded BoxSat from both Curse and KerbalStuff, built ships with 100 racks, filled them with 400 batteries (this was not fun), and I didn\u0027t see any hesitation from the game at any point. The 400th battery performed just as well as the first. So this is why I\u0027m not sure that this is strictly a problem with the battery module itself and I\u0027m trying to see if there are any common threads with other people having problems with the battery module. It will also let me attempt to build a similar KSP setup and see if I can reproduce the problem. Are there any other parts from any other mods causing similar hesitation?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-13T20:07:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMight help if you guys and girls that are having problems also post a log file or at lease what OS you are running and any mods or added *.DLL files.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Armarnis","CreatedById":134739,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-15T16:30:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewould it be possible to add an attachmentpoint to the bottom of the new engines? i dont use any craft that use a corgobay or something like that so i usually put the sat on top of my command pod and detach it with a decoupler but this always leads to have the engine on top causing to have all indicatores turned around in the wrong way and stuff.... which is very kerbal but not very handy so maybe, you could consider this? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E thanks ^^ also, would help a big deal as the subassembly window always buggers me when an engine is on the \u0022underside\u0022 i couldnt save it because it has no attachment point\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-15T17:35:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Armarnis\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Armarnis\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ewould it be possible to add an attachmentpoint to the bottom of the new engines? i dont use any craft that use a corgobay or something like that so i usually put the sat on top of my command pod and detach it with a decoupler but this always leads to have the engine on top causing to have all indicatores turned around in the wrong way and stuff.... which is very kerbal but not very handy so maybe, you could consider this? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E thanks ^^ also, would help a big deal as the subassembly window always buggers me when an engine is on the \u0022underside\u0022 i couldnt save it because it has no attachment point\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can try this \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/91616-0-90-BoxSat-vA-02d-Updated-01-13-2015?p=1675941\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1675941\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/91616-0-90-BoxSat-vA-02d-Updated-01-13-2015?p=1675941\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1675941\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
