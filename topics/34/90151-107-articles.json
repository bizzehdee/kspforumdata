It\u0027s moved on to certain docking ports, and a number of seemingly random items from all over the tech tree (the docking port that has the issue is the non-nasa \u0022in-line\u0022 docking port that has an opening hatch that opens in order to dock. Sometimes after a ship or something similar has been built and I attempt to attach one of these it reacts like it will attach to the node, then it grays out sort of like it\u0027s not selected, but then when i attempt to throw the part to the trash it\u0027s like it has become the new root part and anything I tried attaching it to follows with it. Sometimes I\u0027m able to trash these items, but sometimes I have to start an entirely new project from scratch (or load a save, hopefully one made during the creation of whatever I\u0027m working on). I have no idea what could be causing the issue, as it has some very strange results, and any mod-conflicts that may seem obvious (like node resizer or something similar) don\u0027t do a thing to help. I have logs disabled at the moment to help the game run more smoothly, but next time I run the game I\u0027ll turn on logs and recreate the bug, and hopefully NathanKell or someone familiar with KSP modding can help diagnose the issue.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELatest Output Log: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/vmajg41r7kg89hp/output_log.txt?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/vmajg41r7kg89hp/output_log.txt?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E (File was way too big for a pastebin) I don\u0027t know a thing about Unity or else I would have tried deciphering some of this myself.

I\u0027m starting to run out of options here and since I don\u0027t have a non-sandbox earlier career to determine when this issue occured (or if it was there from the start) it is incredibly difficult to pinpoint this specific issue. I noticed that most (didn\u0027t check if all of them had it), but most of the parts giving me this issue show whether the part is structural or a fuselage on the basic description of the item (directly to the right of where you would find an engine\u0027s thrust or a fuel tank\u0027s size). Oddly enough, the regular docking ports that work don\u0027t show this, but the inline NASA docking port shows the \u0022fuselage\u0022 status in the basic description (by basic I mean mouse-over). If removing Goodspeed and Planetshine does not fix the issue I plan on re-installing Realism Overhaul and Real Fuels and hope that this fixes this issue.
