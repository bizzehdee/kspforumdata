However, when adding the part in game, both bays always start with only the habitation module, despite being set for different indices.\n\u003E \n\nSomething that may not be immediately apparent is that every SwapOption you add to a part config becomes available to every bay on that part. So when that part is loaded, USITools does a couple things:\n\n- Creates an array containing each SwapOption. SwapOptions are just recipes that can be loaded into a converter.\n- Creates an array containing each USI\\_Converter (or USI\\_Harvester).\n\nSwapOptions and Converters are added to their respective arrays in the order they appear in the part config. The **moduleIndex** field on the SwappableBay corresponds to the array index of the converter it\u0027s responsible for. There is another field on the SwappableBay called **currentLoadout** that corresponds to the array index of the recipe/SwapOption that it\u0027s currently setup to use. This always defaults to 0 (i.e. the first recipe/SwapOption) until the player manually selects another recipe via the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Part Action Window\u0022\u003EPAW\u003C/abbr\u003E. That\u0027s why you\u0027re seeing 2 bays with the Hab module. This also usually isn\u0027t specified in the part config because the fact that it defaults to 0 is usually the desired behavior on multi-bay parts.\n\nI suspect what you\u0027re trying to accomplish is to \u0022lock\u0022 the first converter into the Hab configuration and the second converter in the Recycler configuration. If that\u0027s the case, there is a way to do that:\n\n    MODULE\n    {name = USI_SwappableBaybayName = Bay 1moduleIndex = 0hasPermanentLoadout = truecurrentLoadout = 0\n    }\n    MODULE\n    {name = USI_SwappableBaybayName = Bay 2moduleIndex = 1hasPermanentLoadout = truecurrentLoadout = 1\n    }\n\nThe **hasPermanentLoadout** field \u0022locks\u0022 the recipe/SwapOption that\u0027s used on that bay and won\u0027t allow the player to change it in game. If you set **hasPermanentLoadout** to true, then you also need to specify which recipe/SwapOption to use with the **currentLoadout** field.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 5/6/2019 at 10:03 PM, Gribbleshnibit8 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m trying to avoid having to delete the existing modules and add them myself for future compatibility and my own updating, but if that\u0027s what it takes then that\u0027s what it takes.\n\u003E \n\nThe arrangement in the part config doesn\u0027t matter. We only group each of the module types together for the sake of organization. It\u0027s a lot easier to see at a glance how many bays and swap options there are when they are grouped together.
