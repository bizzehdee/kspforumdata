This means that the propellant mass is about 90% of the equivalent stock LFO tank, but that seems fair since in reality, Liquid Hydrogen tanks have more mass overhead anyway, and also the mass ratio is pretty close to some of the aircraft parts, if not a hair better in some cases. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E0.9 (2015-05-19) - Balance tweaks, Nuclear tanks\u003Cbr\u003E - Re-balanced the Oscar-like tanks to correspond to the Oscar-B changes.\u003Cbr\u003E - Adjusted Interstellar Fuel Switch config to not load if CryoEngines is installed (so Cryo can do the right thing).\u003Cbr\u003E - Added LF-only tanks (1.25m and 2.5m) for use with nuclear engines.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Blastard","CreatedById":142019,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T17:19:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey, apparently the fuel in tank doesn\u0027t correspond to the correct fuel type (using InterstellarFuelSwitch) after the latest update:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMonoprop. instead of Oxidizer\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cORdZFG.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022cORdZFG.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EElectric instead of LFOx\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7KhboC4.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00227KhboC4.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NecroBones","CreatedById":105424,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T18:02:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Blastard\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Blastard\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHey, apparently the fuel in tank doesn\u0027t correspond to the correct fuel type (using InterstellarFuelSwitch) after the latest update:\u003Cp\u003EMonoprop. instead of Oxidizer\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cORdZFG.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/cORdZFG.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EElectric instead of LFOx\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7KhboC4.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/7KhboC4.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOK cool.

Right now the mod is set up to be free of any dependencies on other mods. Also, the texture sharing method I\u0027m using to keep the memory footprint low might not work with other solutions. It would require switching out the model, not the texture.

Bac9 implemented such a method in his B9 Aerospace mod. Granted, it does use some external dll for the switching, maybe it was TextureSwitcher. His implementation changes texture based on fuel type though, which is something really cool that Necro could probably do as a big leap towards clutter optimisation.\u003Cp\u003EFor example all of the different colored tanks could be consolidated within one part entry with texture switching capability. All of the radial tanks could be consolidated in 1 entry with fuel switch, triggering a texture switch in turn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Black-Talon\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Black-Talon\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI know I would also enjoy this.
