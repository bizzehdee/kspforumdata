I INTRODUCE YOU THE **** \n\u003E **SEASys** (ShipEffects Alarm System)\n\u003E \n\u003E So i\u0027ve been thinking about how the Alarm System will work this morning and I started fiddling around. I got this, its not yet complete. the other indicators dont work yet except for the HIGHG one. And it does make alarm sounds.\n\u003E \n\u003E I have a vague idea how Master Alarm Works so what are your thoughts on this? How will I make this behave? \u0022going to add TAC support as well once I now exactly How this thing works\u0022. I had the idea of when you click it they will mute, but will still Light Up.\n\nThis looks great! And that\u0027s how Master Alarm and Caution and Warnings System worked on Apollo - you would press Master Alarm button to mute the alarm, but light remained lit on the C\u0026W System board, pointing out what\u0027s wrong with the spacecraft. I think that we don\u0027t need separate Master Alarm button and your system will work well enough.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-12T07:26:38Z\u0022 title=\u002204/12/2015 07:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Walker**"},{"CreatedByName":"ensou04","CreatedById":140256,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T11:01:52Z","Content":"Guess what!

Still WE HAVE DOCKING SOUNDS!\n\nAlarm Systems on the other hand will be a separate(ish) Part Module mod. but will still be inside the main plugin.
