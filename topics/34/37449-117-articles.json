This gives me 144 days of 02, and if I time warp with X open it will last for 144 days. However if I go to back to the space center to warp or warp with a different vessel loaded, when I reload X all my kerbals will be dead from oxygen deprivation (still trying to determine exactly how long they last while warping without the vessel loaded). Are the resource converters simply not designed to work with time warp when the vessel is not loaded? This sort of breaks the resource converters, as they only seem to supply their resources when the vessel is open.

As I really see our mods going hand in hand for a full game experience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a pretty small change, basically TAC LS just has to recognize when a kerbal gets frozen and remove them from it\u0027s internal list.

Also, make sure that you do not have an old version of the KSPAPIExtensions dll. I saw something that seemed to indicate that an old version could cause problems, and that is bundled with a lot of mods, including MFT.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pinchy\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Pinchy\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHi - Been through this whole thread and also the FAQ on github, and the installation instructions and I cannot find the answer. I don\u0027t have any logfiles available as I am in work, but I installed this Mod at the weekend and I am in career mode - all of the available containers are showing in the VAB, and the Kerbals are now showing as having resources (Oxygen, Food, Water, CO2, Waste etc) - but they are not consuming anything. \u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;snip\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan I get a log file?

You can also find the link in my signature.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI need more information before I can help figure out what is going on. One question though: are you using Tarsier Space Technology? If so, get the latest version. An old version caused symptoms similar to what you describe. The original author has not been around for a little bit, and it was picked up by someone else, so make sure that you get that version.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pinchy","CreatedById":143038,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T14:40:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi Taranis - Yes I have TST installed - let me check and remove the version temporarily and see if that fixes it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes - Yes _ Yes Taranis...
