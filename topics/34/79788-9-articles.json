The height values kind of go crazy near the poles due to how the planet rendering is set up, that\u0027s why you find weird \u0022easter eggs\u0022 at the poles frequently. Could be related, but I haven\u0027t experienced it personally. Thanks for the report, I\u0027ll look at it, but it\u0027ll have to be in the next patch. This patch should help a little bit though because I\u0027m going to weight the latitude of points towards the equator to offset the current \u0022preference\u0022 to picking the poles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason it picks poles more often than not is because the longitude are closer together up there, giving the generator more opportunities.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Javster","CreatedById":74613,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-02T11:30:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf I uninstall the mod with contracts accepted, will it break the game?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: it didn\u0027t have any side effects except a slight lag and graphical glitch when I opened contracts, it fixed itself.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-02T11:34:51Z\u0022 title=\u002208/02/2014 11:34  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 2, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Javster\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
