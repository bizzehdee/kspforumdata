IT LOADED! I CAN SEE THE SPACE CENTER! Everyone\u0027s alive and well (minus a few test pilots, but that\u0027s what they\u0027re there for). However, when I go to the tracking station and try to fly one of my ships, it crashes again. Checked the output_log, says something under stack trace about\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStackIcon:DoMove () \u002B 0x55 (000000002F3AFF70 000000002F3AFFCF) [00000000035C4D48 - Unity Root Domain] \u002B 0x0(0x000000002F3AFB1F) (Mono JIT code): (filename not available): StageGroup:Sort () \u002B 0xdcf (000000002F3AED50 000000002F3AFD94) [00000000035C4D48 - Unity Root Domain] \u002B 0x0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(0x000000002F3AE3A2) (Mono JIT code): (filename not available): Staging:sortIcons () \u002B 0x1202 (000000002F3AD1A0 000000002F3AE944) [00000000035C4D48 - Unity Root Domain] \u002B 0x0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso saw somewhere higher in the log something about looking for Kerbal Alarm Clock, which isn\u0027t currently installed...so I reinstalled it, tried again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAttempt #3: Crashed in the same place, trying to go to my vehicle from the tracking station. This time stacktrace says something about raster prop monitor. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAttempt #4: Froze up when I entered the tracking station.

I tried accessing a different vessel from the tracking station first, it worked. Tried switching from that vessel to the problem vessel from map view, it worked. Went back and forth, still worked. Everything appears to be working now.
