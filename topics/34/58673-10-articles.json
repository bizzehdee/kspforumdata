Anything public is being moved over/renamed to ORSX_ (ORS Extensions) vs ORS, which should stop any conflicts cold, and as noted, pretty much the last bits I use from core ORS are the mapping functionality (though I intend on rolling in/bundling Cyrik\u0027s amazing map overlay because it\u0027s just too cool not to).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEventually ORSX will deprecate most of the default ORS part modules anyway in favor of ones without any of the ties to KSPI (like megajoules, etc.), and better compatibility to my other modules and converters that operate on rails (hence why I had to create an alternate extraction module). Possibly some other deprecations as well, but all of these are pretty much a moot point ORS wise, as they will have no impact, and folks will be able to happily play with both without any issues - which will be nice, as right now I\u0027m still in damage control / train wreck mode WRT ORS and KSPI, and it\u0027s not a fun place to be (nor one I intend on returning to).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am currently testing all of this for 0.25 compatibility as that will be the point in which I push a release. I\u0027ll also check and make sure there are no weird conflicts with ORS 0.1.4, KSPI-L, and KSPI.
