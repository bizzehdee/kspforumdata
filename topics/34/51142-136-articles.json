I confirmed that 9-2 was failing to load but it is irrelevant as you have moved on. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ex64-Release loads without errors in the debug log. I now see where you are going with this. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI got some really beautiful scenes, wonderful and exciting work!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also got the other, shall we say \u0022WIP results\u0022, such as the opaque blue effect and the unfinished lighting. A _Visibility value in the range as already reported (i.e. ~0.00000005) allows viewing underneath the atmosphere overlay with it still turned on and I had no problem at all using alt-e to enable and disable the atmosphere and/or various terrain effects. I do find the terrain materials can in some scenes produce a rather bland result (see the comparison made in the last two screenshots); but it is after-all a WIP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/eX69f\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

There should be some textures for the grass/rock etc, but I feel it lacks some of the original colour depth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso rbray have you got around to adding terrain manager support for the other planets? As far as I can see, other than earth/kerbin, they all use the stock terrain and hence the atmospheric shader doesn\u0027t work with them either.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Megalodon 720","CreatedById":108146,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-24T11:55:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think it\u0027s great.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CR3vzyG.png\u0022 alt=\u0022CR3vzyG.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pingopete","CreatedById":74168,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-24T13:20:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Megalodon 720\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Megalodon 720\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI think it\u0027s great.\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CR3vzyG.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/CR3vzyG.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs that an updated version of the atmo shader?
