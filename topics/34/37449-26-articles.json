Adding a whole other line of radial parts adds variety but no real functionality and makes balancing the parts that much more difficult. That said, the small tanks will be grabable with KAS letting you reconfigure life support capacity after launch or even transfer resources between crafts without docking ports or KAS hardware. The larger tanks look silly when strapped to a Kerbal\u0027s back, but I might make those grab-able as it opens up some neat playability. (e.g., parachuting in a resupply module to Duna, picking up the tanks with a rover and bringing them back to base.) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll have more time to work on these Friday night (UT -6) and should have at least the radial tanks ready for testing later this weekend.
