The result is, you get only about 170 Mj (170,000 EC) from a procedural cap that is roughly the size of a 3.5 Fusion reactor. Now, 170 Mj is not much in this mod, and shows quite a discrepancy of energy densities between stock and Interstellar parts. Now I realize that batteries rely on an electrochemical reaction whereas capacitors store charge between plates. If any of you can determine a value that would be more inline with Interstellar\u0027s needs, I would be very open to suggestion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/piprod/documents/Session_D_Miller_rev.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHere\u0027s a PowerPoint from 2010\u003C/a\u003E that discusses some applications of large capacitor banks.
