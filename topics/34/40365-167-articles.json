A simple test ship of a 1.25m thermal nozzle, 1.25m fusion reactor, 1.25m generator, small LOF tank, and a 1-crew pod. This actually works for me now at max time warp. Fusion reactor stays on and I get the expected behavior I\u0027ve come to know and love from the fission reactors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy issue arises when I replace the crew pod with a 1.25m probe core and a comm dish (remote tech). At 10,000x time warp, MJ dips down a bit, then stabilizes at around 60% of max MJ amount. At 100,000x time warp, all power gets drained from the ship. I can\u0027t tell if this is because the reactor shuts down and the probe core and comm dish suck all the power or another issue. The speed at which I lose power might suggest that the reactor is consuming the 7MW it needs to stay turned on, but for some reason isn\u0027t generating power, so it just drains stored MJ until the reactor dies, then the generator consumes the last bit of thermal power for a little MJ with powers the probe core and comm dish for a brief period. At that point, the ship is then completely power dead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a sneaky feeling this might be related to RemoteTech. Maybe briefly losing communications with Mission Control is turning off the fusion reactor? Anyone else that plays with RemoteTech2 able to duplicate my situation? I have another install without RemoteTech. I\u0027ll give it a try and see if I get the same issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENope. Still having this issue without RemoteTech. Used an identical probe ship as above, minus a comm dish. At 1,000x speed, MJ flickered a bit then capped out. At 10,000x time warp, MJ drained down to exactly 3,000/5,000. When I accelerated to 100,000x time warp, MJ dropped down to zero, then all power died as the game ramped up to 100,000x speed. I\u0027d say around 80,000x speed or so is when the ship died.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think what might be happening is that the time step change is too much for the resource manager. Even with just the probe core and a single fusion reactor I think I run out of MJ before the resource manager realizes what\u0027s going on and is able to stabilize the power situation. I\u0027m thinking that if this is the problem, larger ships with more MJ storage capacity probably won\u0027t have this problem as they will have enough MJ left over after the time stamp scaling up to 100,000x to keep the fusion reactors online.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-06T14:08:57Z\u0022 title=\u002212/06/2013 02:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 6, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Eadrom\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lightwarrior","CreatedById":93585,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-06T14:08:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is those problem with EC at high timewarp which was discussed above.

It\u0027s been reported many times since this mod got started, and it can even happen with just stock parts. Fractal_UK has tried several ways of fixing it, and it is better than it used to be. I will try to explain why it happens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImagine a craft with a single small stock solar panel on it which is producing 2 electric charge per second. The game divides this rate up by your frame rate, and adds that much to your electric charge per frame. So if you are running at 30fps, then it adds .06666 charge to your batteries every frame. Likewise, if you have some device that requires power, such as a command pod, it divides the power usage rate by your frame rate, and deducts that much from your batteries every frame. For the sake of explanation, let\u0027s assume the command pod requires 2 electric charge per second. This means that every frame the solar panel adds .0666 ec and the pod deducts .0666 ec, and the total stays exactly the same.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow you want to time accelerate. The game still adds and deducts once per frame, but each frame represents a longer period of time. At 10x, each frame represents not one thirtieth of a second but one third of a second, and the game must add and subtract 0.666 charge each frame. At 100x it must deal with units of 6.666 charge, at 1000x 66.666 charge and so on. At some point the amount deducted each frame goes above the amount you can store, and the pod shuts off because it doesn\u0027t have enough power; you don\u0027t really notice this because you cannot control your craft in time warp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fusion reactor, on the other hand, must consume 7 megawatts per second in order to produce any power. At some point the amount deducted per frame will be more than you have stored, and the reactor will produce no power that frame; it couldn\u0027t run the lasers that compress the fuel pellets. At 100,000x it needs to deduct 23,333 megajoules per frame (at 30 fps, it\u0027s higher if the fps is lower), and you don\u0027t have that much available.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think Fractal_UK has ever said so explicitly, but I suspect that the reason reactors come with a free 1000 megajoules of storage is so that you can timewarp at the lower levels.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fractal_UK","CreatedById":61595,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-06T16:47:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Lightwarrior\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Lightwarrior\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis is those problem with EC at high timewarp which was discussed above. It seems to happen only when some equipment on ship consumes more EC than is generated by something other than MJ-\u0026gt;EC conversion.
