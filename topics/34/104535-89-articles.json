Legacy parts are not possible to fix due to lack of source files to edit and fix them. New parts from ZodiousInfuser are still in beta stage of development, so those were not included either. Just core plugin that allow those parts to move as desired/UI and other common thing for any IR a like part that use this plugin.\n\nSo, you have to download use parts from previous releases of IR.
