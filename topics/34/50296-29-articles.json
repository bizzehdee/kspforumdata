Which config settings will make them overheat less easily?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps, the main issue I\u0027m having is that I don\u0027t have FAR installed, so I can\u0027t use my heat shield to generate lift like a previous poster suggested. But I don\u0027t think that BTSM is really compatible with FAR, so for now, until I finish the BTSM career, I really need to change some settings so that it\u0027s possible to use heat shields realistically.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW, before someone b*tches at me, I cannot search the thread for \u0022Eve\u0022.

I have an interesting but largely unwanted thing with crafts landed on planets with atmosphere. When I get close (about 100 meters or something) to such a ship (inactive one, just standing there), it explodes. Maybe because at this point the game applies physics to that ship, and considers it moving through the atmosphere at the speed of planetary rotation, I\u0027m not sure. Oddly enough, if said ship is my target, it does not explode (and if there are several crafts, only one can be set as target, so all other ones explode anyway). It may be a mod conflict (FAR, KJR, RT and Interstellar come to mind, all other are mostly part mods), but that seems unlikely.
