First of all, performance isn\u0027t always identical (although in this case the Poodle has better thrust/mass, Isp, etc). Essentially aside from very simple cases like fuel tanks where there are very limited performance numbers (capacity, dry mass) it would require a human to consider the price for every resized part in every size. A computed increase like you propose would either be small enough to leave some rescaled parts still too-good for their price or large enough to leave some so expensive as to be useless.\n\nFurthermore the stock parts aren\u0027t very balanced - I\u0027m looking at you, Vector - and (especially since not everyone plays career) you\u0027ll find it hard to get two players to agree if being late in the tech tree or coming with a large pricetag really balances out a part having superior performance.\n\nIt\u0027s only harmful to gameplay if you let it be - I know that sounds like a bit of a platitude, but the point is that Tweakscale is a very powerful tool with a wide range of application, and needs a bit of thought about what you\u0027re going to use it for. For example, I wouldn\u0027t Tweakscale an engine into a size-and-role clone of a stock engine; I use Tweakscale to create parts that wouldn\u0027t exist otherwise."},{"CreatedByName":"ultraviolet150","CreatedById":60268,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-06T15:03:04Z","Content":"I have a question.
