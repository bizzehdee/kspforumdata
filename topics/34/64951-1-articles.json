The launch clamps don\u0027t hold it very well.

I can see about getting the workflow packed up in a zip. I am not sure it will be small enough that I will be able to host it. Maybe I can host the image files on Imgur and just zip up the .blend and the .unity files. I left plenty of room for more geometry to be unwrapped on the texture sheet for the doors. You guys can have a go with whatever you would like to try. It\u0027s not intended to be anything more than a giant space garage. Making an external texture on such a large surface look half decent is not easy. Trust me, even tiles does not look flattering on such a large boxy ship. That is why I went with the offset tiles. It breaks up the lines a bit and keeps it from looking like a steam room. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-06T00:53:36Z\u0022 title=\u002203/06/2014 12:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 6, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Payload\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Payload","CreatedById":4540,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-06T11:19:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI took some time to play test it a bit.
