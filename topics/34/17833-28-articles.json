Is there any way to see what delta-V you could get out of a stage using RCS thrusters?

The gravity is light enough that either ought to work, but I was having a hard time figuring out which propulsion option would give my probe a better delta-v budget. I wanted to use the engineer to figure this out, but it doesn\u0027t seem to be aware of the thrust potential of RCS - it says that any stage with only RCS thrusters has no delta-v.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf this isn\u0027t possible, perhaps you might want to consider it for a future version?

I know all about the locking issue, it is because KSP changed the way in which the GUI in the editor is locked with the last update.
