The total mass of your spacecraft will be much higher than an equivalent craft with hydrolox, so it will be much harder to lift with your lower stages.

Hydrolox stages usually have low sea-level Isp and high vacuum Isp, so the effective \u0022at the moment\u0022 delta-v could very well rise as you climb up. It\u0027s best to have something that can show you the vacuum delta-v and sea-level delta-v separately. Mechjeb does that, don\u0027t know about other mods. Generally in RSS you need about 9500 m/s of vacuum delta-v to make it to the low earth orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"aristurtle","CreatedById":108264,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-29T18:02:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m about halfway through making a Real Fuels config for KSOS.
