I only created that to ensure that all crewed parts would have Ioncross support and a small reserve of O2. By default everything is assumed by that file to be something small like a command pod. Some parts like the station parts need more than the amount per crew that things like command pods get. The hitchhiker\u0027s pod is an example. The large science lab should be in that category too.

It starts to become harmful at ~10%. By 20% you are in serious trouble. In the current config files, the assumption is that if you look at the O2 supply quantity, 10% of that is the maximum amount of CO2 buildup that can be tolerated. There is a certain sense to that rationale but it fails because not all of the O2 in a capsule truly represents the capsule\u0027s internal volume. Additionally, the amount of O2 and CO2 being consumed/generated don\u0027t really match up to sensible values if you look at what a person or Kerbal would consume.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, the amount of CO2 that a crewed part can contain WILL be increased again, but so will the rate of production of CO2.

In practice you wont ever see that because of scrubbers, but those will require electricity and so if your power goes out then you have a problem. Again, it\u0027s not the most realistic solution, that would be to allow CO2 to exceed 10% but the way things are now, the system can\u0027t say, ok the capsule has 1000 liters of space for this Kerbal so 100 liters is 10%.

It just uses O2 and CO2 and nothing else to worry about. The parts are really nice modeled and go well with stock stuff. I am use TAC at the moment until this mod comes back alive. I hope it gets add to Universal Storage too once Ioncross fully resurrected. When its all and done, you should call it ICS Resurrected or ICS Phoenix, because it pretty much came out of the ashes, I really thought it was dead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah I understand the idea of doing a general config to add O2 based on number of crew a object can have, but size of the volume of a object is something different. Even though a capsule of 1 crew can hold like 20 O2, a space station part much larger that holds 1 crew might have more O2, base on the amount of volume that it can hold. That always bothered me with LS mods, that a larger object holds about the same O2 as a smaller one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI see you are doing some nice things with the CO2, you are taking this mod in a nice direction. I\u0027m probably going to wait until future releases once the mod matures and stabilizes to a nice place. Seems like you still have some work ahead to still do.

So if you\u0027ve got it set to Kerbin time where 1 day equals 15 minutes then that\u0027s what\u0027s used in the display. If it\u0027s set to real life Earth days then that is used.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EContract System: NOT functional. It\u0027s about 90% finished but I disabled it in the release because finishing it was holding things up. Enabled, it generates contracts to resupply science stations. If the science station doesn\u0027t exist around the target planet then one is spawned in orbit. That part actually would be working if I flipped the switch to enable it in the mod. Works the same as those rescue Kerbal contracts. It even makes sure that the orbit is outside any planetary atmospheres so that\u0027s kinda cool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EResources were reworked extensively based on the liter for storage. Most command pods don\u0027t have sufficient oxygen for extended missions. To the Mun and back in stock is ok, but try to fly to Minmus and back and your capsule is coming home with corpses. Most command pods have 850 O2 per Kerbal. Station parts and hitchhiker pods have greater reserves. The O2 tanks have significantly more O2. Your average capsule can buildup 200 CO2 before it becomes lethal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlanned but not done is that recyclers won\u0027t have CO2 reserves anymore. Instead they\u0027ll have that capacity dedicated to O2 instead. So they\u0027ll be O2 tanks only with CO2 regenerators built in.

Anyway, the lander had no CO2 since I\u0027d been running the scrubber the whole time, but it was down about 18 days worth of O2. As soon as I docked it to the station, the \u0022recylcer\u0022 started generating O2 even though there was no CO2 available.
