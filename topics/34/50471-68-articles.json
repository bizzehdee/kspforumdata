I\u0027ve launched a mission from Baikonur (220x220x45.9\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 orbit) and then went for direct intercept from the line of nodes (that guarantees that you intercept orbit, and with right timing the Moon itself). Once you near apogee, you can do whatever plane change you need to aim for landing (in case of free-return-like trajectory) for just few tens of a deltaV since your orbital velocity is really low.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor GSO sats (I use RemoteTech) I use three burn profile similar to what is used in real life (check here on page 2: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.ilslaunch.com/sites/default/files/pdf/TURKSAT-4A%20Mission%20Overview%20final.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.ilslaunch.com/sites/default/files/pdf/TURKSAT-4A%20Mission%20Overview%20final.pdf\u003C/a\u003E ). My GSO sats require to have about 2400 m/s of deltaV as they complete GSO insertion and plane change at the same time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. LV delivers orbital unit (space tug \u002B satellite) to suborbital trajectory (-10x220x45.9\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.

Then at equatorial node (either AN or DN depending on target GSO position, I use MJ to find these nodes - \u0022Time to equatorial A[D]N\u0022) I do second burn (220x35875x45.9\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0). This way apogee will be exactly above equator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Unlike a real life, I separate my comsat at that point and later dispose of the tug via small burn at apogee.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. At apogee I do a circularization burn combined with inclination change (total dv is about 2250 m/s) - I use excel spreadsheet (essentially vis-viva equation plus cosine theorem) to calculate direction of that burn at exact dV as function of transfer orbit and then stuff numbers into RemoteTech flight computer. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI use RT\u0027s flight computer to pre-program that whole sequence so that I could turn off antennas to save electricity right after completing orbital insertion, and re-enable them once the sequence is executed to fine-tune final orbit - that mostly involves fine-tuning orbital period so that it would be exactly 23h56m4.09s - my comsats have small amount of RCS for that since it\u0027s hard to get it right using main engine only.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AndreyATGB","CreatedById":62674,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-02T22:12:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah I meant a \u0022go for it\u0022 moon encounter. It\u0027s surely possible to wait for the moon to get on one of the nodes, besides its SOI is gigantic anyway. Also, you can use MJ\u0027s limit acceleration option to get ridiculously low thrust from any engine. It\u0027s kinda cheating but useful if you forget some ion engines. It might not even work with some of the realism focused mods, I don\u0027t know if any recommended mods fix engine thrust so they can\u0027t go from 0 to 100%.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
