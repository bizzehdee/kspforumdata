Now that I think about it I did have a vehicle dock once that had docking ports (not the ones I used) attached to probe bodies attached to hinges. Could this have done me in?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a possibility. Docking ports do weird things when directly connected to an IR part but sometimes on certain cases it doesn\u0027t have to be that way. I haven\u0027t found a way to resolve the issue but it\u0027s almost always pistons or any non-rotational part that has issues due to the parenting when docking. I never tried attaching a docking port to a hinge.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bobprime","CreatedById":115505,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-17T21:33:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sirkut\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sirkut\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt\u0027s a possibility.
