Setting it to true results in normal KSP massess, while setting if to false results in the reduced, realistic masses. The engine masses, on the other hand are the other way around, with a values of false reulting in KSP masses and true resulting in realistic masses. The behaviour of the engine masses is the same as previous versions, while the tank masses are changed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile checking this I noticed that the additional dry mass for a Nitrous Oxide tank is much greater than for other tank types (3 time the additional dry masss for a Xenon tank, and 30 time that for a nitric acid tank).
