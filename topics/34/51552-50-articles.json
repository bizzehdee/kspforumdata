I mean variant with satellites on same Kerbin\u0027s orbit, as the Mun, but one with \u002Bphase angle, just ahead of Mun SOI and second behind.\u003Cp\u003ECould anyone help me with that? O:-)\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHi, I can\u0027t point you to that picture (I don\u0027t think to have seen that), however I know how to make as you described. I call it \u0022faking the use of the lagrangian points L4 and L5\u0022 (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_point\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_point\u003C/a\u003E), as in reality one could use L4 and L5 to station vessels in a stable orbit, but in KSP (thanks to its simpler calculation of gravity, always restricted to two-bodies) you can do the same by just entering the same orbit of the secondary body, just keeping outside the sphere of influence of that body is enough. According to the KSP Wiki, Mun\u0027s SOI is 2429.56 Km, so if you get in a circular orbit @ 11400 Km altitude from Kerbin, almost 0\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 inclination, at a distance just a little more than the Mun\u0027s SOI, you are in the perfect position. One satellite forward (L4), one satellite behind (L5), both with dishes pointed at Mun: voil\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A0.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW, once you reach the orbit, the most important value to match is the orbital period, has to be the same as Mun\u0027s: 1 d 14 h 36 m 24.4 s (you don\u0027t need exact matches instead for apoapsis/periapsis nor eccentricity=0).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-10T11:10:35Z\u0022 title=\u002212/10/2013 11:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 10, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by diomedea\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZobrAA","CreatedById":65233,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-10T12:15:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@diomedea: Yes, I know about L4\u0026amp;L5, but this is not an option. 1) Largest omnidiractional antennae have only 5Mm range, 2) L4\u002BL5 Sats left ~16% of Mun surface uncovered.

However:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) You can use the omni antenna (Communotron 32) with 5000Km range: that has way more range than required as you can sit your satellites just outside of Mun\u0027s SOI at 2429.56 Km. However I would prefer to use dishes, so don\u0027t have even that range restriction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) With any satellite while at a distance of 2429.56 from Mun\u0027s center, you have visibility of 45.89% of the surface. Two such satellites on (almost) opposite sides cover 91.77 % of the surface (they don\u0027t have to be exactly opposite, as the angle each of them has between Mun\u0027s center and the tangent to the surface is 4.72\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, they may be at an angle of 4.72\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 in relation to the Mun\u0027s center). Of course, the more distant the satellite, the larger the surface covered. At 5000 Km from Mun\u0027s center, Mun\u0027s radius is seen at an angle of 2.29\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, each satellite covers 48.0% of the surface, and two such satellites 96.0 %.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sma","CreatedById":67377,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-10T15:30:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Cilph\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Cilph\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EEDIT: Fourth: For you coder types, there\u0027s a new kOS integration implementation on my github.

Maybe I\u0027m missing something (literally, and figuratively), I dunno. This is only the 2nd time I\u0027ve tried something like this so I guess you could say I\u0027m a n00b as far as this goes LOL. When I try to build from the RT2 source (using RemoteTech2.csproj in xamarin studio 4.2.2, on win7) it says there is an error, but doesn\u0027t say what it is. In the window pane that lists all the files, it shows GlobalSuppressions.cs, but it\u0027s not found (highlighted in red). I imagine the problem is somewhere with that....\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk, I decided to try one of the other suggested compilers from the wiki (SharpDevelop) and it at least told me what the problem was. I think I was missing some MSBuild extensions so I got those, then I discovered (duh me) that there are file paths in the project file that point to where everything is on the developers system, so I changed those to match what I have as far as where my copy of KSP is. Then it was giving me an error about the line where it creates the zip file. Even after changing it to match my KSP installation and such it still gave me a problem so I just removed that line and the build completed successfully. I have yet to run it though so I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s gonna work or not lol. I did make a backup of my persistent and quicksave files though just in case. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Daisai","CreatedById":78873,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-10T20:52:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere seems to be a bug with the gx-128, it doesn\u0027t work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen using it on a long range satellite and facing them on eachother through targetting they still are not connected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe strange thing is that when i focus it on a other satellite which uses a Communtron 88-88 it does get connected. i know the angle of a long range version is smaller but like i said they are both faced to eachother through targetting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis makes long travels with a satellite rather impossible, unless you make a huge one with a computer control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see here, \u003Ca href=\u0022http://cpdv.home.xs4all.nl/KSP%202013-12-10%2021-55-15-41.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://cpdv.home.xs4all.nl/KSP%202013-12-10%2021-55-15-41.jpg\u003C/a\u003E it is suppose to be connected however it shows as not connected.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-10T21:00:15Z\u0022 title=\u002212/10/2013 09:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 10, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Daisai\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LC NOoSE IV","CreatedById":90643,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-10T23:02:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ecan you give mea list of mods this doesn\u0027t work with my RT2 isn\u0027t working\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
