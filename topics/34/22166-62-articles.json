Most people don\u0027t notice since the Kethane detectors currently scan all available resources, but the detectors were built to be configurable, and in the future I think at least the compact scanner will only find Kethane, not other resources. So if we blend colors, the question is: how do you indicate information about cells where there \u003Cem\u003Eisn\u0027t\u003C/em\u003E a resource? Do you also blend the black/gray cells? If so, you\u0027d get a strong gray when both resources are scanned (but none present) and a lighter one when only one is scanned. I suppose you could always hover to get detailed information, but it makes the visuals very confusing.

If each hex were, for instance, split into 6 pie sections that means the map would only be good for Kethane and 5 other resources.
