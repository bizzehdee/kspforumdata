And it\u0027s a really nice feeling knowing that I\u0027m filling a niche and that people enjoy it. But here\u0027s reality. 1. I\u0027m not wealthy. As a matter of fact, I don\u0027t even consider myself middle class. 2. I\u0027m a school bus driver and while the hourly pay and being home during the day is nice, the pay checks aren\u0027t all that spectacular. 3. My wife had to go back to truck driving to pay the bills and I really don\u0027t relish the thought of her being out there by herself. 4. I\u0027m 50\u002B and while mortality has been a lingering subconscious thought for some time, being comfortable in my retirement is even more pressing. I have 10-15 years to come up with something financially supportive so that I\u0027m not working till I\u0027m dead. I never expected or anticipated that modding would be a second income (though if I had been able to afford to do this full time, believe me, I would). It was a \u0027hobby,\u0027 an experiment and an education so I\u0027m not disappointed. \n\nI truly do appreciate all the donations and the praise. But as many of you know Dice and I have been conversing a lot of late. Dice is off working on his new boat project, and like me, he\u0027s not a young man any more. Whether his retirement plan will work or not, I can\u0027t say, he has a lot of work to do. He\u0027s pretty much given up on modding for KSP though in order to focus on what could be a nice payoff and I honestly can\u0027t blame him. My retirement plan, on the other hand, is non-existent. So, I\u0027m seriously having to consider whether the time investment in modding will pay off in the long run. It\u0027s sad and it pains me to do so, but I\u0027m having to look at my time investment financially.\n\nAnd then, about 2 weeks ago, I fired up a new sandbox game. I installed a few mods to make it \u0027fun\u0027, like RemoteTech. Within 2 hours I had a small fleet of geostationary satellites in orbit, a communications station in geo orbit and a refueling station full of fuel with RCS tugs in LKO and then I stopped and asked myself, what next? And I honestly couldn\u0027t come up with something I hadn\u0027t already done, something I wanted to do or something within the limitations of game physics that I could do. That was the first time since I started modding in June that I planned on \u0027playing\u0027 KSP and it lasted 2 hours before the \u0027fun\u0027 vanished. \n\nAnd I\u0027m not the only modder who\u0027s reached this point (though I seem to have reached it pretty quick). Dice is moving on, Lo-fi, the modder behind Kerbal Foundries is on a leave of absence and dozens of other really nice mods have simply been abandoned... and I have to ask if their reasons aren\u0027t the same as mine: motivation? Investment vs. reward? Lack of fun?\n\nI haven\u0027t reached any solid decision yet, but before I spend hours going though every single part in both mods to find out how badly Squad has screwed these mods over I\u0027m going to spend a bit more time thinking on it."},{"CreatedByName":"Kagame","CreatedById":141304,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-11T15:18:23Z","Content":"Ah, I see.

And quite honestly, when I read the new physics descriptions and I see things like this:\n\u003E *buoyancyWaterDragScalarLerpDotMult = 1.25 // The multiplier to the verticality dot which is subtracted from the base to compute the multiplier to lerp rate* \n\u003E \n\u003E and this:\n\u003E \n\u003E *buoyancyWaterDragScalar = 4.5 // Initial drag scalar for floating parts. The scalar is this when a part first splashes down, then slowly lerps to the End value. When the part is \u003C buoyancyWaterDragMinVel, or no part on the vessel is splashed down, it lerps back to this value*\n\u003E \n\u003E I realize just how many times I\u0027d have to restart KSP and tinker with these numbers in order to figure out what the hell it is he\u0027s talking about. And while I\u0027ve considered completely rewriting buoyancy in the past, I have to ask myself now, why would I do that?\n\u003E \n\u003E For now, until I cool off... these mods are, to one degree or another, busted.\n\u003E \n\u003E But hey, you can land your planes on water now and you have this really disgusting underwater camera!\n\nI hate the \u0027blue fog\u0027 underwater effect too, it needs a real surface for one...."},{"CreatedByName":"Thatdude253","CreatedById":140179,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-12T10:41:02Z","Content":"My 2 cents for whatever they may count for.\n\nI love this mod, and for a long time it did something that no other mod did--even with dice\u0027s earlier releases, I could never get them in the water and the kraken always came calling. With the new buoyancy changes, it may not be practical to update and I understand that.\n\nI also feel that I understand better than many that real life will always come first. It\u0027s so easy to forget that the person behind the icon actually has their own things going on, that not everyday is dedicated to content production. Many get into it because they enjoy it, then decide at some point or another, they don\u0027t enjoy it anymore, that they simply want to do something else. \n\nSo here\u0027s my thoughts. If KSP modding isn\u0027t going to work for you, that\u0027s unfortunate, for us, for you, hell for Squad. It seems like you truly enjoyed what you were doing, despite the occasional idiots who didn\u0027t bother to read what the plans were. Despite financial troubles (as a college student, I can sympathize), despite idiots, despite Squad pretty much ignoring boats, it worked. It was different, and fun. And if you do decide to call it quits, well, that\u0027s unfortunate, but I get it, and sometimes, you just have to say its time to hang up the cape and let someone take the reins in your stead. \n\nJust my two cents or so. Maybe that\u0027s more of a quarter, but whatever, I feel it needed to be said."},{"CreatedByName":"colmo","CreatedById":25950,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-12T18:31:42Z","Content":"Real life has to come first. If necessary, delegate some of the more menial tasks to others (like BobCat did in his heyday) so you can keep the mod as what it should be - a hobby.
