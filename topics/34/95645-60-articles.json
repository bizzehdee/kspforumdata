Ever since installing your (awesome, by the way) tech tree, I\u0027ve noticed several science instruments that no longer provide any science experiment while in flight, with no option on rightclick (and science alert doesn\u0027t see them either). The ones I\u0027ve found so far that behave like this are the ones from Sounding Rockets! and Kerbal Dust Experiments\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWas this changed by you in some way? Or is it an unfortunate incompatibility?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHm, I do not change any of them in particular, though they might be affected by some general SETIctt MM patches.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, Sounding Rockets does not have the 1.0.4 tag at the moment and it does not quite fit the current SETI \u0022balance\u0022. Since I did not want to rebalance it for SETIctt (especially since RoverDude really does not like it, when his stuff is rebalanced) and check for 1.0.4 issues, I can not support it for SETIctt at the moment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a similar problem with Kerbal Dust Experiments, which seems to be for KSP 0.25. Due to the nature of SETI, I encourage everyone to bring problems to me first, if the problem is not clearly the fault of the particular mod. Thus supporting ancient mods potentially increases support requests by an order of magnitude, which would be too much for me to cope with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI ll probably test SoundingRockets during the weekend, but I can not promise to find the issues, since it is not officially supported by SETIctt and there are no plans to do so in the near future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Hrv123\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Hrv123\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFound possible error with one engine in tech tree but dont know whee to post it, here in tech tree thread or some other mod thread because I have number of mod installed and could not figure it out in what mod are this engines and their cfg file placed. \u003Cp\u003EEngines are named: \u0022Merlin Family Rocket Engine [1.75]\u0022 and in tech tree are located in \u0022Survivability\u0022.

At the moment, SETIctt changes a lot of stuff that is already changed by CTT, resulting in a lot of double entries. I m also not quite happy with the tech tree itself. Therefore I m considering including a streamlined CTT fork (consisting only of the CTT nodes but not of the positional changes to the stock tech tree) into the SETIctt download and dropping the dependency on the main CTT.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I would rewrite the SETIctt, keeping the general layout but making a lot of smaller changes and cleaning up the positional inconsistencies from stock (and CTT).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese are planned to be \u0022under the hood\u0022 changes, with little to no impact on part mod support.

And even if they do, I should be able to make changes to Contract Configurator so that the contract packs aren\u0027t affected. Of course, I can\u0027t guarantee this, as there were a couple changes in 1.0 that I needed to just drop support for some lesser used features of Contract Configurator that used to use stuff that had changed significantly in stock. But if something shows up that breaks a feature of Contract Configurator that is widely used, I\u0027ll just rewrite it so there\u0027s no perceived difference to the contract pack authors (and users).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo as long as I\u0027m around, Contract Configurator should be able to insulate contract packs from a lot of the contract changes in stock.
