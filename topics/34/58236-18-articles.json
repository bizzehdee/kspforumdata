I believe part of the issue you might be having is that SpaceX claims a reduction of about 20-30% in cargo mass in order to spare enough delta V to reuse both stages. What I\u0027ve been doing is separating the first stage with about 700-750 delta V left in it (which without all the mass of the second stage/cargo on top it, translates to something like 2000 delta V for use in landing), then use RCS to flip the craft 180, burn using three engines until horizontal velocity is around 700m/s in the OPPOSITE direction to which we were initially traveling, flip 180 again so the engines are facing forward, then shut down the 2 of the 3 remaining engines and just wait until our trajectory takes us in for a landing. The weight of the engines on an almost empty core will keep the craft pointed correctly for the remainder of the descent. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor second stage it is a bit more complicated. At the moment I\u0027m working on creating 4 small Draco/Super Draco like thrusters which will be used in landing (like in the video) because the vac engine isn\u0027t optimized for atmo, doesn\u0027t have deep throttling capability, and the tremendous amount of thrust would tear the stage apart IRL if you tried to use it to land.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-22T16:38:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ExZise: The actual resource amount in a tank, and its max amount, are not rounded; if they were it would break compatibility with Stretchy.
