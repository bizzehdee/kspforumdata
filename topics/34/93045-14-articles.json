Various parts give a set allowable mass, and the mass limit is cumulative. Some parts (sounding rocket core, early probes), those with ModuleScienceCore, have zero allowable mass: they don\u0027t offer flight controls at all. Make sure you add enough avionics to your vessel for it to be controllable; the amount of allowable mass a given part offers is listed under the module info (in the editor tooltip list of modules). Various cloned parts allow sufficient avionics parts just in RP-0\u0027s basic stock/SXT environment, but in addition the various FASA replica parts (Atlas stages, Centaur stages, Titan upper stages, etc) have appropriate avionics added. Note that crewed craft are not exempt from these limitations!

I see that we\u0027ve got a new \u0022Able/Delta Avionics Package\u0022 which I\u0027m assuming would be used on the upper stages of a Delta II. Trouble is that avionice package can only support 8t which is basically the weight of the Delta K 2nd stage. That would be fine except that I\u0027ve got a Star 48/PAM-D third stage which is another 2.622t (my re-creation is a bit heavy). I\u0027m under the impression that the PAM-D didn\u0027t have it\u0027s own avionics since it was normally spin stabilized. The issue I\u0027m running into is the upper stages (Delta K \u002B PAM-D \u002B Satellite) weigh 10.752t but my avionics can only handle 9. I\u0027d be find if not for the PAM-D.
