In the model, the CFG file, you specify how to use the interior, which is good. I did my interior and ordered him to CFG file, but when I run the ship, this interior hangs in the air at 6 meters from the ship (the point of birth he is the point of the ship), and do not move. A must follow to ship. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. In the file description of the interior, for all devices written in places where they should be, and this is also cool. You can move the equipment on your own. But here\u0027s the origin location of seats (and therefore models kerbonavtov Interior), I have not found. Instead, the modules are described as \u0022Pilot seat\u0022, \u0022seat bootom\u0022, \u0022seatLeft\u0022 and so on. They can not assign coordinates,so for those modules coordinates are in the model itself. I then added to the model interior two points, \u0022Pilotseat\u0022 and \u0022seatbottom\u0022, but unfortunately the location of the crew has not changed and does not move in the points. The crew was in place at the bottom of the ship, face down. As much as I did not move the points on the model in Blender or Unity, the crew remained in old point. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have ideas or positive experience of how to fix this situation, I am happy to hear and learn to do the interiors.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BlueSubstance","CreatedById":40362,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-26T12:52:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAllright.
