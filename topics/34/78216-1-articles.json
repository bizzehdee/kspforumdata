It has slightly less thrust, weighs more, has no alternator or bottom node, is substantially more expensive, and above 3km altitude it has worse ISP. In my opinion a reasonable adjustment would be to increase its thrust, to perhaps 300 kN. This gives it a niche as a high-thrust first stage engine with reasonable ISP.
