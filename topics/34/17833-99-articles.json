It all gets complicated very quickly. Also, docking ports can\u0027t be decoupled in the staging sequence so the calculations can\u0027t make any decision about when during the mission they will be decoupled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Alshain\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Alshain\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI suppose it could be done the opposite way (add up toward the root) but it would fail with planes.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy would it fail with planes? You just have to make a part of the payload root and connect it to the plane using a decoupler and everything will calculate properly. It also has the benefit of the jet engines not drawing fuel from the payload until all the fuel from the plane has gone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout the only way this could currently be done reasonably easily and in a general enough way would be to add the payload fraction to the build engineer and simply show the starting mass of the stage as a percentage of the total mass of the vessel. However, the payload fraction isn\u0027t exactly an important figure unless you are specifically trying to optimize for it, and there isn\u0027t a lot of spare room in the build engineer UI so it would probably need to be made optional if it is deemed worthwhile enough to add at all.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Theysen","CreatedById":144656,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-10T22:03:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey, maybe someone of you has the solution to my problem I came across.
