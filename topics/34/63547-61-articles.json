Originally, effects for AJE engines were based purely on throttle, meaning that that the afterburner turns on at 67%. I believe that this is the threshold that the HotRockets configs use. When SolverEngines came around, NathanKell adjusted this to 25% core \u002B 75% afterburner, so the afterburner threshold was 25%. Now, with this update, I have separated the effects entirely. The spool effect depends only on core throttle, and the power effect depends only on afterburner. Others still use the 25/75 formula, though I might change the throttle effect to be actual throttle at some point. This was done partially to facilitate easy re-use of the new stock afterburner effects, but it simplifies creating effects configs from here on as well.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-19T08:29:13Z","Content":"\n2.5.1\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[LIST]\u003Cbr\u003E\n[*]Finish removing Kerosene and AvGas configs from jets and props.

So if a prop work similarly you would have to scale the whole thing by 3.3 to get the power you want. Then you need to reduce rpms by the 1/3 since the exponent for that is the inverse of the scale factor. No idea what r is maybe radius? Also weight is going to be multiplied by 3.3^2 so 10 time the weight.
