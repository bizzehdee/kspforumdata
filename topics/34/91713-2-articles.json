The usual FAR setup in the CFG is very simple and has zero fine tuning involved. Occasionally a part will require custom drag parameters but that is almost never the case. Engine curves are also not very different between stock aero and FAR - FAR nerfs thrust by 50% but that\u0027s across the board and the TWR you\u0027re seeing will be the corrected TWR. It\u0027s possible your acceleration problems have to do with a part creating more drag than it should. To check this enable FAR\u0027s drag visibility and see if any one part is creating a lot more drag than the others (the nose should of course be creating more but not hugely). If it is, try re-attaching that part and everything attached to it (that\u0027s been my problem more than once).
