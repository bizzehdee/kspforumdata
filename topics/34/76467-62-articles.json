What about say any real engine found in RO? You should know that SAS only helps with attitude control if there is enough force available to keep it where it wants to be. RCS in itself for attitude control while under thrust is going to be ineffective. Reaction wheels in stock are WAY overpowered for \u0027playability/ease\u0027. The Mk1 pod, and Mk1-2 pod don\u0027t even have them anymore. The stock reaction wheels have been severely nuked and aren\u0027t near as effective as they were. So that leaves engine gimbal. If you had looked, you would have realized that the Procedural Parts SRB has a gimbal range of 0.25 degrees. A lot of engines have 20x that much, at least.
