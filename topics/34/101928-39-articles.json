Building a surface base, I am not launching modules anymore, just shipping parts and doing the whole space-lego thing on minmus. \n\nHowever there is one thing that constantly gets in the way when disassembling things: the root part. The typical case is that you undock something and then can not remove the docking port or KAS connector because it has become the root part or the new vessel. Is there a way around this, like a select-root functionality that also works in flight?
