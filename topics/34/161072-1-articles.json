A few behaviors we\u0027d prefer people avoid:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBumping the thread of every mod you use to ask for an update\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBeing demanding or rude when asking for an update\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAsking for an update\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nComplaining that an update is taking too long\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNone of these types of posts are helpful or constructive, and make for an environment that is hostile to modders. Remember that modders are volunteers who give their work to us for free, work that they do in their free time as their real life schedules permit. Please avoid biting the hand that is feeding you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
