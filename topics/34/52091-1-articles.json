They were mostly made for my own games as I wanted to need some extra science points in career mode. I have managed to get a one star review already but there is no comment (this installs you with hope doesn\u0027t it). I have also managed to score it one star myself by accident and can\u0027t figure out how to change that (great \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;.;\u0022\u003E ). Available under creative commons rights (I think this is the right thing help would be appreciated on that) The present parts are divided into their tech node.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAerospaceTech\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGiant Jet Engine : Mainsail sized Jet engine using (low atmo) engine, nacelle and intake as one. For use in large aircraft and not very good in higher atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHigh Density Fuel: A Mk1 Fuselage sized Fuel tank that only contains liquid fuel but 400 of it in the same density as rocket fuel tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELinearRCS MK2: LinearRCS is usaly useless but these have 3 times the power, it\u0027s still less than an RCS block if you use all four nozzles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELarge RCS block: Bigger with 4 times the power for items you would normally still 4 RCS\u0027s on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAutomation\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESample Drill : Like a soil sample but using automated analysis, this has its own experiment data and can be either an addition to a manned (kerballed) landing or for use on a probe (like the Mars lander curiosity).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMulti-Sensor : The four old sensors and the Atmo sensor stuck together, a little lighter but that\u0027s all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExperimentalAerodynamics\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAilerons MK2: Just adding a little more control\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAir-Ram MK2: The first items I created after seeing the amount of air hogging in the forums and the added part count this causes. Uses 8 times the air area (acts like 8 normal rams) but has a max air of 0.12 instead of 0.2 AND weights 0.4 tons instead of 0.01. This is to stop people using 4 (equivalent of 32) per engine, they still can but they would add 1.6 tons per engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENacelle MK2: The old Nacelle was very heavy and produced little air for its weight, so this is lighter and has a bit bigger air intake.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExperimentalElectrics\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIon Engine MK2 : Half the Xenon use, twice the thrust and four times the electric to make up for the first two.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELarge Ion : Only 1.25 meter size and generates 8.5 KN but uses the equivalent of 32 LX-Panels of electricity. Designed to be used with the nuclear reactor (not produced yet) or as a burst engine with lots of Batteries.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAtmosphere Lab: A heavy lab module (16 tons) for analysing atmospheres from space. Holds one Kerbal if needed and is designed to be part of a space station. Adds a science experiment and can only be used in orbit round a planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExperimentalRocketry\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEmpty tanks : Only one at the moment but you get the idea, space for Oxidizer and fuel but empty on lift off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELong Tiny Tank: For use with probes or small craft. This tank is tiny in width and hold 5 times a normal tiny tank 28.8 liquid 35.2 Oxi.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOxidizer tank : Tank of just oxidizer. Simple.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELarge AeroSpike Engine: slightly less efferent but with much more power, this engine is designed to be on the same scale as the Mainsail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExperimentalScience\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EData Store : Right click to store EVA reports and Soil Samples. That\u0027s all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScience Lab : The most important item in the Mod probably. Its a 28 ton lab for use in space or when landed. Has its own experiment type that is low on value, very high on data but drops in value much slower than normal experiments. It also has a 100% transmission rate. It\u0027s designed to keep you needing time and electricity to run for a while with no point to returning it. With all that effort it would make a good space station starting point. It also acts as a command pod but with no torque. Sits 4.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExperimentalMotors\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdvanced Propeller Engine : Uses Very large amounts of electricity to generate lift in any Atmosphere. Not very efficient but can just be used to create light planes in low atmo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETiny Asas: A Tiny sized asas for probes or buggys. Only produces 5 torque unlike the normal 20, it is also slightly less efficient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHigh Speed Wheels : Uses more power, faster, tougher and very good at causing crashes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENanolathing\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESmall radial decoupler : for use on probes or decoupling small objects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERadial Attachment: An attachment for any surface that acts like a tank for radial, top or bottom attachment to it. Works well for adding engines air scoops or capsules without needing heavy tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETough Struts : Bigger and stronger, should be twice the weight but I\u0027m not sure with struts (needs testing) and no I don\u0027t have engineer installed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESmall to Tiny Adapters: Quad, Tri, Bi adapter for probes or very small ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlanned/Possible items to be made.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENuclear Reactor : Very heavy but pumping out HUGE amounts of power. Yet to be begun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpace Telescope : Hubble like telescope. Some CFG and skin work done but only about 50% complete.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELarge Coms dish : Unsure if needed yet, will see.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFuelled Nose Cones: Adding some fuel to all nose cones so that they have more purpose (not sure about stability).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShell Hull: A quarter of a large hull made of stock models. I know that you can get stuff like this from other mods (like quite a lot of this stuff) but it wouldn\u0027t add loading time or break on an update.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMagnetic coils: difficult to implement without game breaking, designed to be used on stations or large craft to accelerate small objects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECutlass Engines: Saber like engines for use in atmo and space, very difficult to get the balance right so they work as an SSTO engine but without making them the default atmo engine even on oxygen less worlds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELithium Batteries: Stores more power for its size and weight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEarly game generator: For use in early career mod to make power from fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGiant booster: Mainsail sized booster, easy to make but maybe too powerful.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"urablahblah","CreatedById":46911,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-06T14:51:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan you post an album of your parts and a link to the spaceport download?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Clockwork_werewolf","CreatedById":90749,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-06T15:12:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYea should have though of that \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E.
