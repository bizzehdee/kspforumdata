This core feature is expanded upon to create a larger system for managing your space center. Build your vessels, upgrade your facilities, research new technologies,\u00A0and make decisions where you never had to before (Do I upgrade the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E further or start upgrading the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E?

(can\u0027t rollout when something is rolling back)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0- Wheels, Mystery Goo, and the Science Jr. are now reset properly on recover to storage (might need to delete the KCT_ModuleTemplates.cfg file)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0- Modules to be reset on recover to storage can now have a \u0022parts = part1,part2,part3\u0022 line to limit that module to being reset only for those parts\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0- Warp To functionality improved. Now much, much faster to warp down.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0- Tech Node Research cancellation must now be confirmed.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0- Delay for moving a vessel to orbit in simulations is now configurable.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0- Simulations should (hopefully) no longer mess up orbits when they time out and you purchase more time.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nPreset Updates:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0- Added several \u0022Crew Variables\u0022 to several formulas.

Default is False\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nWarnings:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0- The launchpad changes are potentially save breaking if it doesn\u0027t update to the new system correctly. That bug should be fixed, however.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0- KCT now \u0022upgrades\u0022 buildings A LOT.

Default is based on user\u0027s progress tracking setting.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Possible fixes and workarounds for some bugs (specifically failure when saving data)\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Default build rates reduced to 0.1BP/s from 1.0BP/s (18 upgrades worth, each). 15 upgrades have been given at start. Existing saves will have their spent upgrades reset and 15 more upgrades. (This does make initial build rates MUCH lower to start with! 36 upgrades are needed to reach 1.0 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and 1.0 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E)\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Estimated times for completion in the build list are now based on the highest build rate.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- The build list, settings window, and part inventory now use a toolbar instead of a bunch of buttons. This looks a lot nicer, but is a bit bigger.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Parts taken from the inventory are now considered when recalculating build times after a ship finishes\u003Cbr\u003E\n- When scrapping partially completed ships, some of the parts are added to the part inventory (representing some of the work being done/parts being ordered)\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Added button to editor GUI to cycle through the available build rates (it\u0027s the asterisk \u0022*\u0022)\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Removed inability to switch vessels during simulation (it was easy to get around that limitation anyway, looking at you Map Mode!)\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Added ability to add currently simulated vessel to build list (only one of them though, \u0022Build it!\u0022 button)\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Fixed several issues with the crew selection GUIs, stopped autohiring and setting a default crew (for now), added button to hire the next random Kerbal when no more are available.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Added a window that appears on new games (or existing games with this version)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nPR6a (6/6/14)\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Fixed bug with right-clicking windows causing them to vanish until game restart.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Can reset spent upgrades (costs 2 upgrades, non-permanent loss).\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Small GUI change in simulations: Time Left window doesn\u0027t appear if time limit is infinity (0), removed the small window that appeared when clicking End Simulation (merged into main Simulation Window)\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Build times can be disabled for a \u0022simulation only\u0022 mode. Current ships/tech will continue progressing, new ones will be instant. Toolbar button opens the settings or simulation configuration window (or nothing) depending on scene.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Fixed bugs with starting a new game after loading an old one and with loading a game where the mod is disabled after loading one where it is enabled.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Getting the ship name is better now: doesn\u0027t require a save before building to get the correct name.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Can change the build rate used for time estimates in the editor (want to see how long it will take at a rate of 1, 1.5, 9001?). Defaults to highest rate.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Can opt out of using inventory parts for a build.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Temporarily removed the view button since it doesn\u0027t work yet anyway.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nPR6 (5/20/14)\u003Cbr\u003E\n- ForceStopWarp setting added (stops warp when ships finish, no matter how you start the warp)\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Internal code changes to allow for multiple ships building at once\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Added ability to purchase upgrades to build rates from the Space Center scene. 1 point is given per tech node unlocked, or 1 can be purchased for 250 science. Works with existing saves (sandbox may require you set the total points in the settings)\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Small change made to how times are calculated with the part inventory. The BuildEffect is included as well, so times will continue to reduce (even after a part is used more times than the InventoryEffect)\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Added a small window to the build list (access by pressing the \u0022*\u0022) for advanced functions (scrap ship, view in editor (not implemented yet), rename, duplicate).\u003Cbr\u003E\n- General improvements to the build list GUI\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Added ability to rename ships that are building/in storage\u003Cbr\u003E\n- The editor locks when the simulation configure window appears\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Inclination can now be altered in simulation initial conditions\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Science can now be earned for building ships (representing the hands on experience having some value). It is a separate rate in the R\u0026amp;D tab of the Upgrades window. Each point put in increases the rate by 0.5 science per 86400 build points the ship is worth (0.5 science per day at 1BP/s).\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Fixed/changed how parts are tracked (For some reason I was tracking every single instance of a part on a ship, instead of only once per ship like I thought I was.) The part tracker won\u0027t increase as quickly now.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Avoided loading ships as much as possible, as I can now extract the part names from the config node directly! (no more/fewer floating ghost ships)\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Fixed a bug with booster recovery code and crashed ships that caused the Tracking Station to go haywire\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Tech Nodes now take time by default to unlock. The default rate is 1 day per 2 science cost of the node. This rate can be increased (in the R\u0026amp;D upgrades, under \u0022Development\u0022) exponentially (1d/4s, 1d/8s, 1d/16s, etc))\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Fixed a bug with launching from the Tracking Station not removing the ship from storage.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Fixed bug with Warp to Complete and low orbits (game freeze because it can\u0027t reach the highest warp rate)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nPR5 (4/30/14)\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Adding settings menu so you can change settings in-game (time settings/enable or disable for a save).

Build List GUI needs a bit of work, so it doesn\u0027t look all that stellar.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Simulations now create a backup save which is loaded whenever the flight is finished. This fixes several issues with the current method, especially when the game crashes during a simulation.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Code is now on github!\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Fixed booster recovery bug where parts weren\u0027t being recovered when they said they were.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nPR4d (4/8/14)\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Automatically displays in Kerbin time or 24 hour time depending on game settings\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Enhanced build time controls.

The default GUI parameters are weird there, so it looks pretty different.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Fixed bug with reverting to launch not giving you crew.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- The toolbar is now optional, but still included and is highly recommended.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nPR 4 (3/8/14)\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Added a crew selection GUI that pops up when you try to launch a ship with crew capacity\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Fixed a bug with recovering vessels in the tracking station\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Removed ability to add Kerbals to your part inventory\u003Cbr\u003E\n- The part inventory now displays the normal part name (as it is in the catalog) in the editor\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Added optional support for RealChutes, but requires two separate versions now.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Added (and in fact, now require) Blizzy\u0027s Toolbar support. Icon credit goes to diomedea. The icon will flash when a vessel is completed!\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nPR 3c (optional update, 3/6/14)\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Added config option to use 6 hour (Kerbin centric) days for Day display. Purely cosmetic and disabled by default. Use6HourDays = False\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nPR 3b (2/25/14)\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Fixed a NullReferenceError that would totally break things when a vessel was being destroyed but the ActiveVessel was null. (I had that happen to me, it messed stuff up pretty spectacularly)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nPR 3a\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Config option to disable automatically reverting when crashing in simulations. IF YOU USE THE EVIL GUI THAT KSP POPS UP I WON\u0027T LOVE YOU. It\u0027s evil...\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Fixed some of the GUIs having weird dimensions (they use the same Rect object, so when the height gets expanded the others look silly)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nPre-Release 3\u003Cbr\u003E\n- THE BUILD LIST! Vessels are added to a build list (one for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, one for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E) and built sequentially. The order can be changed with the TOP button and the vessel can be cancelled with the X button. Vessels are moved to storage after completion.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Vessel storage. One for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and one for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E. Can launch craft or scrap them for their parts. Currently unlimited size, same as Build List, but will change later.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- If SimulationTimeLimit is set to 0, then simulations will last indefinitely, but it may not let you revert depending on what you do (docking, still untested)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nPre-Release 2\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Simulations are now based on game time. Currently set to 2 game hours. They don\u0027t auto-revert except in the case of crashes. Periapsis/apoapsis don\u0027t matter.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Boosters are automatically recovered if they have enough parachutes to drop the terminal velocity below 10 m/s. Check the Alt-F2 log to see if they get recovered on unload.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Possibly fixed issue with time warp getting stuck on when the total build time is only an hour or two (may still overshoot a bit though).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nPre-Release 1 - initial release.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-03-15T14:59:33Z\u0022 title=\u002203/15/2019 02:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 15, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by magico13\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Enew thread\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr Shifty","CreatedById":68146,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-30T01:55:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWoohoo!
