A lot of people are flying with FAR and are having a lot of fun with it. Please consider that you are very used to stock behaviour. That means that changes to it might seem counter intuitive at first, because it is very much outside what you are used to. If you read back in this topic, you will see that a lot of problems have with FAR actually stem from a lack of understanding what is going on, and is no fault of the mod. In reality, the stock behaviour is much more \u0027made up\u0027 than that of FAR and is the more counter intuitive one when compared to reality, but you are \u003Cem\u003Eused\u003C/em\u003E to it and the effects it has on craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso consider that a new version of KSP has just been released, so it is possible that there are some bugs in there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking at your craft, it appears to me that it has quite a high thrust for low weight. Vehicles tend to loose control with FAR when pushed too hard through the atmosphere, so that might be what is happening. Also, are you aware what happens when the fuel drains? Maybe a shift in CoM changes its behaviour. I would start by adding some fins to the bottom and switching the two SRB nose cones out to something a bit more aerodynamic (like the black and white cone with a small nosecap).

You did not tell us anywhere that you did not and only started your SRB\u0027s. Anyway, it still is a whole lot of push for a little craft, so that might very well be your problem. Be aware that the air with FAR is a lot less dense than with stock aerodynamics (just like in reality). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESRB\u0027s in reality burn equally all over, as they are \u003Cem\u003Etunnels\u003C/em\u003E of solid rocket fuel to optimise thrust. They are a little more advanced than fireworks. I am unsure how KSP models them, but I think it is not by shifting the CoM up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://galaxywire.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/solid-rocket-booster-cutaway.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022solid-rocket-booster-cutaway.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vrana","CreatedById":79915,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-18T14:04:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Frostiken\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Frostiken\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESolid rockets burn from the bottom up. \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENope.
