Given the the issues the Mk2Expansion AJE patch has had, and that AJE ships with MM patches for most of the other aircraft mods out there, would it make sense to hand over the mk2Expansion patch and have it maintained on AJE\u0027s end rather than Mk2Expansion\u0027s and add it into AJE\u0027s collection of mod patches?\n\nThat might make sense, but a couple of things: (1) There a large number of parameters for each engine, many of which can only be set off of real-world engine stats. Do all of the jets in this mod have reasonable real-world equivalents, or at least reasonable equivalents already in AJE? (2) Given the large number of mod configs that AJE already has, I can\u0027t guarantee that updates would be processed in a timely manner.
