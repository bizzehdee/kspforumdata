KSP doesn\u0027t ship with a .NET 4.0-compatible runtime, so if you build against 4.0 or above, you\u0027ll often run into errors with KSP or other mods. ModStatistics runs a plugin version check that will fail if the mod isn\u0027t targeted for the right framework, and displays this notice so the mod author is made aware. You\u0027ll find that assemblies compiled for higher versions usually work \u003Cem\u003Eat first\u003C/em\u003E, but they\u0027ll end up breaking in odd situations. It looks like you\u0027ve fixed this now, but I just wanted to explain why ModStatistics shows this message.
