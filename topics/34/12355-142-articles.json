The version just prior to this only had fuel pipes going from the big tanks to the small ones. When the fuel ran low in the big tanks, MechJeb would light up the pair of poodles in the upper stage. I flew it that way a few times and *every time* until I added the other pipes it\u0027d do that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only change from that one to this one is I added fuel pipes running back from the small tanks to the large ones so all the engines will run out at the same time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve had this happen many times on rockets that are pushing the low end of TWR in a stage, with nothing wrong structurally - until after MJ goes looking for more thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did add four struts crossed between the orange tanks and the large tanks, and two more struts from the orange tanks to the nosecones on the SRBs, but that was to counteract the breaking from the downward jerk when physics kicks in. No other changes to the main stack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore switching to LV-30\u0027s added, I tried skippers but the throttle up after the SRBs dropped was too much and it all came apart. Turning off terminal velocity limit was also not a success with that configuration. Same as the original LV-30 config, I only had pipes running from the big tanks to the small tanks above the skippers. Too much thrust with too abrupt throttle control. Before that, I tried adding first four, then eight of the white, radial mount engines. The more power I added, the higher altitude it\u0027d reach before MJ would fire the upper stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMJ could really use a throttle response speed control, ideally settable per stage. Would reduce the need to spam a rocket with struts just to handle the throttle abuse MJ dishes out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBuggy Booster is going to need the poodles upgraded to skippers and possibly will need some more engines strapped onto its upper stage. Two of the LV-30s will get moved so all four will be on one side because two of these stacks are going under the tandem 16K tank kethane mining lander.

(Yes, I tried it several times.) To make it not do that I had to swap the stage positions of them, pairing the separatrons with the decoupler. I just tested it, reverted to the configuration (as pastebinned) that didn\u0027t work before, now it works in .22 with MechJeb 2.1.0.0-92 Other than the micro reaction wheel from KSPX, that rocket is stock parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBUT there\u0027s still the issue that MJ will not auto stage the final on the missile, no matter which way they\u0027re ordered. (I\u0027m going to put it back the way it was, with the separatrons going first because it missed the target this time by a long ways with the separatrons as stage 0.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a couple of manned landers that MJ will not auto stage the lander engine even though it is paired with a decoupler. Start the landing with just a little fuel in stage 1 and MJ will let the ship crash instead of popping off the dry stage and lighting up stage 0. I should try this with my Kethane rovers on the Mun. When making the first landing I manually stage off stage 1 because the landers have to make it down on the fuel they have onboard. Could test by first stopping at one of the refineries and draining all but a little fuel then go to land and see if MJ will do the staging properly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-27T11:41:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is no code in MJ to move part in the staging list.
