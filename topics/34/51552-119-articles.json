I\u0027ve got a couple mods that add fairings, but I mainly use procedural fairings in conjunction with FAR I think this makes all parts inside the fairing immune to aerodynamics. Is there a way to make it so that my omni antennas don\u0027t snap in atmosphere when they read as shielded when I right-click them? Even if it\u0027s activated, if it is completely inside the fairing there should be no way for them to break from atmospheric stresses.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Cilph\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Cilph\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAbout FAR, I don\u0027t think antennas should work when extended inside a fairing.

It is fair that we need to know the material of the fairing before we can state whether the antenna can or cannot work normally.
