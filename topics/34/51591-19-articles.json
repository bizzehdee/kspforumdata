One is to link the Tracking Station upgrades with higher gain recievers, so you essentially add to the length of the kerbin reception distance as you upgrade the tracking station. The other way would be to give Kerbin the highest tech antenna that you have researched, implying that the KSP has a distributed network of listening posts with current technology. Either way would help, without the need to put comsats up, though you could reduce the effect for kerbin with the excuse of atmospheric attenuation.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022smunisto\u0022 data-cite=\u0022smunisto\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAll up for it. But perhaps people come here for the simplicity, so maybe do it as something of an \u0022Antenna Diversity \u002B\u0022 menu option, or even a separate download.I was planning to download some of the old packs containing antenna models(maybe I will even check up with RT and see if its license permits it), making the textures dds, fixing the CFGs and using them as additional diversity for antennas, which I would tweak to my tastes. By initial calculations this would mean about 1-2 more antennas. One to go between 88-88 and DTS and one to go after 88-88, after I reduce the range of 88-88 further to make it more of a retranslation choice, rather than \u0022Send one to Duna, cover Eeloo\u0022 thing.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETying Kerbin\u0027s range to the Tracking Station level is probably a safe direction to go.

I could probably use ModuleManager Magic to shuffle things around when other mods (like Origami) are detected, but there are \u003Cem\u003Eso many\u003C/em\u003E antenna mods out there that I really don\u0027t want to put myself into a position where I\u0027m maintaining a giant pile of MM patches for every one of them.

So, if out of range, draw range data (ignoring occlusion). If in range, draw occlusion data (if pertinent). I\u0027m not sure how your com-network optimization code works, so I can\u0027t really say what will be easier to code, or if the \u0022otherwise-most-ideal target\u0022 even means anything in this context.

The green lines could indicate a two-way connection where both transmitters are within range of each other where yellow would indicate a one way connection. Could be useful for data that travels in one way, such as requiring a connection to (or two-way connection) for probes, but returning science being okay as a one way transmission.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Last good\u0022 might be easier for me to track internally but isn\u0027t necessarily relevant.
