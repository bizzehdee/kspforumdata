The orange Alignment Indicator has no analogue in Romfarer\u0027s, which is actually why I made this mod in the first place. The two gauges work quite differently, believe it or not. So while Romfarer\u0027s white lines are \u0027analogous\u0027 to my green lines and his red cross is similar to my yellow velocity vector, the actual behaviors are quite different, for reasons that are somewhat complex. Take a look at the source code if you\u0027d like specifics, but in general it\u0027s because my gauge attempts to remain oriented relative to your own ship\u0027s heading (i.e. so \u0022UP\u0022 on the gauge equals \u0022UP\u0022 on your ship), while his (at least back when I used it), remained fixed relative to the target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll try to explain the significance of each indication, using an an analogy. Pretend the target docking port is another person. You are standing in front of them, but they are looking slightly above your head and over your left shoulder (and are frozen in place, heh). Let\u0027s say they have a pair of horse blinders on, too, so they can only see straight ahead (no peripheral vision).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you were to move your body so that you were standing directly in their line of sight, you would effectively be centering the green cross.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom that centered green cross position, if you were to turn so that you\u0027re looking directly into their eyes, you would effectively be centering the orange circle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo let\u0027s say you\u0027ve done both of these things, and are now standing directly in their line of sight while looking straight into their eyes. From here, note which compass direction you\u0027re facing (let\u0027s just deal with a 2-d plane in this example), let\u0027s say heading 085. Now, if you were to remain facing heading 085, but where to move somewhere else (i.e. step sideways and backwards a few times), you would effectively be un-centering the green cross on the gauge, but keeping the orange circle centered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand, lets say you were back to standing directly in their line of sight, but now turned so that you were no longer looking into their eyes. Here, you\u0027d effectively be keeping the green cross centered, while un-centering the orange circle. Had you turned to your left, the orange circle would move to the right, indicating you need to turn back to the right in order to be aligned properly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022FastMINI42\u0022 data-cite=\u0022FastMINI42\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EActually ...

These components are then PROJECTED onto the gauge so that they are displayed relative to your current orientation (this is an example of what differs between my mod and Romfarer\u0027s). So, let\u0027s say for example you are directly on the imaginary line extending out from the target ports (aka it\u0027s normal vector) (your green cross will be centered), and you are also facing in the exact reciprocal of this vector (your orange circle will be centered). Now you use RCS to thrust to your right *L key on your keyboard). The yellow Vel Vector will move to the right. You stop thrusting (but obviously continue translating right), and then YAW your ship 90 degrees to the right (using the D key on your keyboard). The yellow Vel Vector will now be centered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s say that instead of yawing to the right, you instead rolled 90 degrees clockwise, using the E key on your keyboard. Now, the yellow Vel Vector would be directly ABOVE the center of the gauge (i.e. 12 o\u0027clock position), indicating that your translational velocity relative to the target is in the \u0022UP\u0022 direction relative to your current orientation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope this makes sense..
