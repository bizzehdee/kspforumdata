I was using an alternate SABRE engine config file I totally forgot about that got around the outdated ExurgentEngineering and related .dlls, but Firespitter got updated and I somehow got an updated EE .dll, but I don\u0027t remember from where. Anyhow, restoring B9 to its original state \u002B using the updated .dlls seems to have fixed almost everything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only downside is I can\u0027t auto-fill a fuel tank for LH2/LOX for the SABRE engines because MFS only sees the engine as air-breathing. I have to manually calculate the amounts for LH2/LOX.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing I want more than anything else at this point... is my sky back in RSS. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-23T04:39:05Z\u0022 title=\u002212/23/2013 04:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 23, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by jrandom\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
