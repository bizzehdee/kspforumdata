Specifically, docking ports used by ground based ships. I\u0027ve built a base on Mun that is made up of individual \u0022ships\u0022. Each \u0022ship\u0022 is built on wheels and has an external command chair so I can move them around if necessary, but they normally sit on their landing gear. The \u0022ships\u0022 are connected together using docking ports. Originally I tried using the \u0022Clamp-O-Tron Docking Module\u0022 from Stockalike Station Parts, but when I experienced the issue I switched to using standard \u0022Clamp-O-Tron Docking Port\u0022 and got the same result. Basically when I\u0027m trying to seperate the \u0022ships\u0022 so I can move them I right click on the docking port and select \u0022Undock\u0022. This splits the base into two \u0022ships\u0022 that I can control seperately, but the ships can\u0027t actually move away from each other because the docking ports won\u0027t let go of each other.
