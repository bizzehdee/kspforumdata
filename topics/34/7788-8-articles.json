When I started this whole package I had some modelling experience, but no texturing at all. I created the first set of parts when I was in class and was bored at college. Now it\u0027s summer time and I don\u0027t really get to the computer but not that\u0027s the main reason of the delay. I\u0027m learning faster than I\u0027m creating new content, so when I finish a part I look at it and say, \u0022heck, I can do much better then this now\u0022, so I restart the work. I simply can\u0027t release something that I know is not my best. Those lighting glitches were my biggest annoyance, but now finally I can get rid of them so time for remodelling/texturing the whole thing again \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E. But I see the light at the end of the tunnel, so expect a new release in one or two weeks. Mainly now I\u0027m focusing on the quality of the parts, I want them to be on par with the vanila parts. I also want to add some new habitation parts, like a lander pod. Imagine, you bring a lander craft with yourself EVA the crew from the main craft, land then relaunch and rendezvous and EVA back. I want to make that possible with the next version of the pack.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"gabmaia","CreatedById":33005,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-09T11:48:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you manage to do that, my good sir, thou shalt be given a cookie\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rageman","CreatedById":36371,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-09T18:33:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewhat do i do with the DS_STORE file??\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kreuzung","CreatedById":21035,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-09T18:43:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIgnore.
