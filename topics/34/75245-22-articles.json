I would like to keep the way you can connect them to each other, but without nearly as much range restriction as it has now.

I think the last time I loaded the game up it was sitting around 805 plugins and took forever (even on my I7 4770K/SSD setup) to get in game, most of the parts are things I wanted to try and wrote off after trying them, but the game sits pretty solid at 60FPS until I get some debirs floating around and 10\u002B objects in orbit.\u003Cp\u003EDidn\u0027t think about launching multiple com sats in one go, and with KW rockets new parts I think I could launch 2-4 at a time on a manned mission and drop them as I go at different heights and inclinations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, even with basic stock technology (only 1.25m parts) that\u0027s easily possible. It depends on what you really want to have on a communication satellite obviously, but for a basic network allowing operation near Kerbin usually it\u0027s just an omnidirectional and a dish or two, plus enough solar panels and some batteries to supply them.

The method he showcases need the satellites to have some minimal propulsion, but you can also decouple them at the right position, then you don\u0027t need the small probe tech or RCS. The resulting orbits will be quite wonky (due to the decouplers accelerating the satellites on launch), but it\u0027s easily good enough until you can get a precise network up eventually when you have the tech. You obviously need to match the target orbit on every period with the deployment vessel instead of just pulling your periapsis up with the sat itself. This does need a bit more fuel (and a heavier launch vehicle).\u003Cp\u003EPlease do note two more things though: First, you basically need Kerbal Engineer for this (or something else that shows you the orbital period, like Void or MechJeb). Secondly, as you can read in my other post I linked above there is basically no reason to actually use sync orbits just for remote tech (except for maybe role playing reasons), and it even makes some things worse/harder (for example KSC and the other sats are not in range of each other). Secondly, if you do want to use a sync orbit, the height of it around Kerbin was slightly changed in 0.24 from the values he mentions (I don\u0027t know exact numbers though, kerbin now rotates in exactly 6 hours instead of 6h50s or something).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: With the new xlarge (5m?) parts in KW you can probably launch 32 at once if you really want to.

The major downside however, isn\u0027t comms with neighbours, but instead comms with vessels: if the sats are this far away from the planet, then then the other party needs rather big antennas too - after all, remember that for communication, BOTH parties must be able to reach each other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis being said, one problem i couldn\u0027t solve efficiently yet, is giving vehicles in the atmosphere a link to KSC almost all the time: If i put sats lower than 1000km, i start approaching the point where 4 sats are no longer safe - i\u0027d need five sats or have to place them VERY precisely. If i put them sufficiently high instead, then a plane somewhere in the atmosphere cannot uplink to the sat, because the atmo-safe antenna has not enough range.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat reminds me: Where is it defined anyways, how a model reacts to atmospheric pressure?
