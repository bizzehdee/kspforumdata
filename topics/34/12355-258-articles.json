What I do now is add a maneuver node for the planet transfer on the launchpad for the first launch then use warp helper to spin time on till approx 1 day before the window. Then I do my other launches and assemble in orbit before doing the last small warp for the burn. What I was suggesting is that this functionality could be built right into the launch assistant panel, which would remove some of the steps that my current method requires. It would speed things up and remove some unneeded tedium. As an alternative, the functionality Im talking about could be added to the warp helper so that when a planet is selected as a target, its possible to warp until X amount of time before the next transfer window.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MedievalNerd","CreatedById":84735,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-27T22:54:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sarbian\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sarbian\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ELet me get my magic wand.\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.sarbian.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/magic.gif\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.sarbian.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/magic.gif\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EErr, no.
