For large, heavy planes adding more wheels should be the answer so maybe reducing the max. load would work, if possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut maybe Squad should come up with new designs. Something like a gear with a longer leg that raises inside a 1.25m cylinder, and a larger version with two wheels per axle inside a 2,5m cylinder. A principle a bit like the radial docking port. The current design with the external pod is quite ugly and far from the RL aerodynamic doctrine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs TMS said, the landing gear is actually massless in flight, so I\u0027ve also zeroed it\u0027s actual mass in the VAB.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rakaydos","CreatedById":101988,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-12T21:16:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would like to see the Ant engine be given a space ISP of 600, with TWR changed to match the curve.
