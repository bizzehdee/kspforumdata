I missed on the metal-\u0026gt; rocketparts conversion? what did I miss? I made a modulemanager file that adds the ability to make rocketparts with a few MKS/OKS parts that doesn\u0027t depend on kethane present (by using the colonyconverter module from MKS. I tested it and it works.).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-28T14:13:04Z\u0022 title=\u002207/28/2014 02:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 28, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Carcharhinidae\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"taniwha","CreatedById":57176,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-28T14:16:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECarcharhinidae\u003C/strong\u003E: If you mentioned it, I failed to read it, sorry (tired).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vortexHD","CreatedById":117021,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-28T15:36:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EHello guys, can you help me with broken \u0022white\u0022 textures bug?

Namely the recycler part, for some reason i cannot fathom it fails to recycle anything I put in it into rocket parts, with the exception of ...you guessed it rocket parts. I miss the functionality of recycling old constructions to build newer ones in a Von Neumann probe fashion.
