The action group button just doesn\u0027t appear at all.\n\nSo I tried using Action Groups Extended and that didn\u0027t solve the problem, either.

If I try the starting VAB, no action groups are available.[/QUOTE]  \n\nOK, in the stock game in career mode, action groups work as follows:  \n\n[LIST]  \n\n[\\*]Starting VAB/SPH (no upgrades at all): No action groups at all.  \n\n[\\*]1 Upgrade of VAB/SPH: \u0022Stock action groups\u0022 only. That is, things like gear, lights, RCS, SAS, Abort, etc. IOW, something thsre\u0027s already a hotkey for. You CAN, however, edit what these stock action groups do. Abort is a blank page with no assigned commands. And if your rocket doesn\u0027t have RCS, that\u0027s also free to use for things like deploying your solar panels. And most early rockets don\u0027t have landing gear, or lights, so you can use the stock gear and lights action groups without messing things up. Be creative.  \n\n[\\*]Fully upgraded VAB/SPH: \u0022Custom Action Groups\u0022 available. This opens up the number keys 0-9 for you to define action groups that don\u0027t have a stock default like turning lights on and off. By this point, our ships almost certainly have lights and probably landing gear, but also now have all sorts of other thigns like science instruments, retractable solar panels, retractable ladders, etc. So now you can put all those things on their own action groups which you get to define yourself.  \n\n[/LIST]  \n\nCustomBarnKit\u0027s default.cfg does NOT change this. Even with this mod installed, you still have to upgrade the VAB/SPH twice to unlock custom action groups.  \n\nTo have ANY action groups from the getgo, you have to edit 4 lines in the default.cfg file. And as has been said many times, you really shouldn\u0027t actually edit that file but instead use [url=http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55219-1-00-Module-Manager-2-6-1-%28Apr-27%29-An-ode-to-code-duplication]ModuleManager[/url]. ModuleManager is the greatest thing since bottled (as opposed to barreled) whiskey and I highly recommend you read the 1st few posts of its thread, which tell you how to use it. It\u0027s so easy even an idiot like me can do it.  \n\nThat said, pending Sarbian\u0027s next update to this mod, you DO need to edit the CustomBarnKit default.cfg file to fix the bug that prevents action groups from working at all in the VAB. That change is as follows:  \n\nOriginal Line 12: \u0022actionGroupsCustomUnlock = 3\u0022  \n\nEdited Line 12: \u0022actionGroupsCustomUnlockVAB\u0022 = 3  \n\nOriginal Line 14: \u0022actionGroupsStockUnlock = 2\u0022  \n\nEdited Line 14: \u0022actionGroupsStockUnlockVAB\u0022 = 2  \n\nThis restores stock functionality. The numbers are the 3 upgrade states of the VAB. 1 is the starter thing where there are zero action groups. 2 is after 1 VAB upgrade so you get the stock action groups. 3 is fully upgraded with the custom action groups available.  \n\nSo, that\u0027s how things SHOULD be to start with. If you want custom action groups to appear from the get-go, then you want to change the numbers in lines 12 and 14 to \u00221\u0022 (and also do the same to lines 13 and 15 which unlock action groups in the SPH). But rather than editing the CBK default.cfg file to do this, I recommend making a module manager file. Call it MyCBKtweaks.cfg. It would look like this:  \n\n[code]@CUSTOMBARNKIT  \n\n{  \n\n@EDITOR  \n\n{  \n\n@actionGroupsCustomUnlockVAB = 1  \n\n@actionGroupsCustomUnlockSPH = 1  \n\n@actionGroupsStockUnlockVAB = 1  \n\n@actionGroupsStockUnlockSPH = 1  \n\n}  \n\n}[/code]"},{"CreatedByName":"razark","CreatedById":32993,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-16T03:59:28Z","Content":"[quote name=\u0027Geschosskopf\u0027]OK, in the stock game in career mode, action groups work as follows:  \n\n[/QUOTE]  \n\nI am aware of how the action groups work.  \n\nThe problem is that I edited the values, and the action groups are not available.
