It\u0027s basically a ModuleManager config that changes the way engine emissives work, switching it to the same system that the ion engine uses (FXModuleAnimateThrottle). That means that the emissives are updated not with heat, but with the throttle. This offers mostly pre-1.0 like behavior, apart with some quirks with specific engines (see [Known Issues](%5Brelpath%5D%5B/relpath%5D#%252%24s)).\n\nPics:\n\n[TABLE=width: 500]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD=align: center]**BEFORE**:\n\n[![33zlqxil.png](http://i.imgur.com/33zlqxil.png)](http://imgur.com/33zlqxi.png)[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center][/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center]**AFTER**:\n\n[![BdpXoVLl.png](http://i.imgur.com/BdpXoVLl.png)](http://i.imgur.com/BdpXoVL.png)[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD=align: center]Jets\u0027 emissives show up without the need to fly around for 2 hours!\n\n[![bYCidM6l.png](http://i.imgur.com/bYCidM6l.png)](http://i.imgur.com/bYCidM6.png)[/TD]\n\n[TD=align: center][/TD]\n\n[TD]\n\nSo pretty!\nhttp://i.imgur.com/fkx6hu7.png\n\n[![fkx6hu7l.png](http://i.imgur.com/fkx6hu7l.png)](http://i.imgur.com/fkx6hu7.png)\n\n[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[/TABLE]\n\nThis mod works best with stock, but there\u0027s really no reason why it shouldn\u0027t work with any other mod (apart from tweaking the response times).\n\n**Remember,** engines **still heat up** *regardless* of what it looks like. This means that an engine can look like it\u0027s completely cold, but can be close to overheating (but it should say in the staging UI if it actually is). You shouldn\u0027t trust it; rather, you should trust the new visual cue added in 1.0.2 (the orange highlight when a part overheats.)\n\n**DOWNLOAD:** [KerbalStuff](https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/833/BetterEmissives)\n\n**REQUIRES MODULEMANAGER:** [**GET IT HERE**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55219)\n\n**Changelog:**\n\n    v1.3 (August 30, 2015)-Jet engine and skipper patches are no longer applied when Ven\u0027s Stock Revamp is installedv1.2 (July 06, 2015)-The patch now applies itself to engines only so other parts with emissives (ex: nose cones) don\u0027t glow from throttle but from heat (as they\u0027re supposed to).-Updated to 1.0.4v1.1 (May 30, 2015)-Tweaked the Skipper\u0027s responseSpeed to make it heat up slower (consequently making it take longer to cool down, like the jets)-Changed the config to automatically patch parts with no thermalAnim name differently, so ModuleManager will throw no errors when the config encounters an engine with no thermalAnim name. This means that  all mods should theoretically work perfectly with this mod, apart from response speed tweaks.v1.0 (May 23, 2015)- Inital release\n\n**Known Issues:**\n\n    \u002B Jet engines\u0027 emissives stay active for a long time after being disabled. This is because the response time needed to be decreased, since using a higher value would make the engine\u0027s emissive animate (or \u0022heat up\u0022) much too quickly.\u002B Jet engines eventually start glowing blue. This was present [URL=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/98650-Blue-Jet-Engine\u0022]even before 1.0[/URL] but only happened when the engine was near overheating.Explanation why it becomes blue now is [URL=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/122673-1-0-2-BetterEmissives-v1-0-Pre-1-0-like-engine-emissives?p=1983763\u0026viewfull=1#post1983763\u0022]here[/URL].\u002B The Skipper glows completely white when you run it for a long time and takes a while to cool back down. This was because of a change of the emissives\u0027s response speed in v1.1. Explanation on why it burns white [URL=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/122673-1-0-2-BetterEmissives-v1-0-Pre-1-0-like-engine-emissives?p=1983763\u0026viewfull=1#post1983763\u0022]here[/URL]. The reason why it takes a while to cool back down is the same as the reason for the jets.\u002B The LVT-30, (maybe) Toroidal Aerospike, and (maybe) all engines with no ThermalAnim defined have no emissives.\u002B KW Rocketry engines do not receive this patch. This is because they use a custom emissive module.\u002B The LV-909 glows brightly as if it was burning in a vacuum. I might make this an intentional feature later on though.\u002B [B]MAJOR ISSUE: Engines cause FAR to spam voxelize when throttling. This is a huge issue with the Skipper and the jet engines since they almost constantly animate and I have no idea how to fix it. [U]If you have any issues with voxelization spam and have this mod installed, post here first instead of on the FAR thread.[/B][/U]\n\nI\u0027d really appreciate it if you notified me in this thread of any issues you find with this mod ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif). Issues include value tweaking, bugs, better configs, etc.\n\n**Wishlist:**\n\n    \u002B Actual pre-1.0-like emissive animation instead of some ghetto stock workaround. This could be hard, especially since I have no coding experience. I might have an idea with ModuleAnimateEmissive though.\n\n**License:**\n\n[![88x31.png](https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-sa/4.0/88x31.png)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)\n\nThis work is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/).

You just never saw that in action because they didn\u0027t ever get that hot. But, with the hacky workaround that I used, the max throttle position corresponds to the max point of the heat animation, which is the blue glowing. They way I \u0022fixed\u0022 it with the jets was by decreasing the response speed, but they eventually reach it and once they do they take ages to cool back down again.
