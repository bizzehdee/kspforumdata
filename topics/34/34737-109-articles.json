If you can\u0027t grapple with understanding the folder structure used by mods in KSP, then maybe modding it isn\u0027t for you. Getting to know this is kinda a prerequisite.

The only thing that can be done with an overwrite by the user dragging-and-dropping is to update files that already exist (assuming the user is smart enough to overwrite them when prompted), or add new ones, but there\u0027s no way to delete them.

My. God.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease don\u0027t tell me that people just blindly copy across Gamedata folders without even seeing what\u0027s inside them.. \u0022oh, this mod I just downloaded? Nah, don\u0027t need to check the contents or anything\u0022... Simply because of the inconsistency between authors and the lack of a standard folder layout is the reason I check \u003Cem\u003Eevery single folder\u003C/em\u003E before I even unzip the thing. The amount of times I\u0027ve seen people post on the Toolbar thread with a problem and it turns out they copied across the Toolbar 1.x.x folder instead of actually looking inside it, seeing the gamedata folder and inside that, the 000_Toolbar folder and copying that across. Mod authors should not bear the burden of making an install as easy as possible - the onus is, as always, on the end user to actually look at what they\u0027re getting. It\u0027s like blindly clicking on checkboxes when ordering a pizza online, then ringing up and complaining the toppings aren\u0027t right. Sirkut has done the most he can with the folder structure here - IR depends on Toolbar and until it doesn\u0027t, it\u0027ll continue to be bundled in the download. If you already have Toolbar, don\u0027t copy the folder across. And as I said, the onus is on the end user to actually look at what they\u0027re in for. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the user isn\u0027t sure if the bundled version isn\u0027t the latest, here\u0027s a radical idea - don\u0027t copy it across and get it from the Toolbar thread instead. If it wasn\u0027t bundled, the amount of people posting saying it doesn\u0027t work would drown out any conversation, despite the fact there might say in big letters in the OP you need Toolbar (you can see in the the ATM thread - \u0022ATM freezes the game!\u0022, \u0022have you tried waiting longer, just like it says in the OP?\u0022, \u0022oh yeah, it works now!\u0022). It\u0027s a lot easier on everyone if it\u0027s bundled with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m entirely on sirkut\u0027s side on this - people who don\u0027t check before installing probably shouldn\u0027t be downloading mods in the first place. It\u0027s really not difficult and saves a lot of time for all parties involved. Right now, it is as simple as it can be. The only way it could be improved would be bundling the latest Toolbar, but seeing as IR just requires ANY toolbar, is a test version anyway, and the fact sirkut would have to update HIS zip every time Toolbar was updated, I\u0027d say this is a fair compromise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL;DR - look before blithely copying across Gamedata folders.
