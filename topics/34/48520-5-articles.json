And would hold steady at 300 for higher pressures when the option is off. I\u0027d then presume that behavior between 0 and 1 atmospheric pressure would remain the same. And lastly I presume (perhaps wrongly) that atmospheric pressure is 1 at kerbin sea level and goes down to zero as you climb in altitude.
