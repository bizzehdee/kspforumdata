If you mean the lack of info in the resource definition file, that\u0027s because Kerbin and Mun use the defaults while the others are tweaked.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk, that\u0027s what I meant. So if it\u0027s not in the resource def file it uses default.

Mainly they concern Ore Processing and refining.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: Splitting ore processing into two stages instead of just one. Getting the ore and breaking it up to extract useful materials tend to present very different issues. I like the auger and with a little love I am sure it will look and feel splendid when playing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1a: Ore Processor: This would be a new object that is an intermediary step really. Using a combination of pulverization, magnets, and centrifuges the ore is separated from the useless stone. A byproduct of the process can be the release of O2, Water Crystals, and other chemicals from the rock its self that could be stored and used for life support and other things. It really would make an excellent model with all the spiny twirly bits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1b: Blast Furnace: Processing ore in zero gravity or low gravity offers some unique issues. Taking ORE and melting it will only result in wired and unbalanced alloys as convection in gravity and the natural weights of metals help to keep the separate. The Furnace could be redesigned to help with this by making a couple off shoots. A basic furnace would most likely need to use a toroidal centrifuge as the main furnace component. Adding rotational forces to simulate gravity and make metals act like they do on Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second furnace would be an allow furnace. Using a spherical heating chamber and a magnetic field, metals are added to a floating glob of molten metal in the middle of the sphere. Metal goes in one end, molten alloys come out the other using vacuum. This model presents an interesting look also as two cylinders can be at either end of the sphere with connectors all around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: Alternate Mining Idea: Condensed Light Drill (Thermal Drill): There have been many ideas on how to mine ore in space. One of them is the condensed light drill. Simply out light is gathered using an array of reflectors and focused on a single point. With the right amount of light, stone can be vaporized and metals collected. Depending on what metals your after, you can vary the intensity of the light to melt only specific ores. It would just look very cool to have a spire collecting light and a collimated beam traveling down the center to a particle effect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny these are the thoughts. I enjoy the mod and look forward to where you take it. I am also curious to see where it goes when Squad also add their resource systems. Good luck and happy moding.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
