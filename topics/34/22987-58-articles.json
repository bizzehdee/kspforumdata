I haven\u0027t posted in a long time here due to the hiatus the project was on until recently. The road bump Cardboard is referring to was a dispute the two of us had while discussing the future of the pack, and as a result, I will be leaving the project. Please refer to the following explanation, which we agreed would be the only word on the matter:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKosmos was founded as a partnership between me and Cardboard. For a period of time, ownership of the pack and the question of future profitability became the chief concern of the project, during which time we agreed to mutual ownership of the intellectual property and proportional ownership of the physical property which was understandably favorable to Cardboard. In this arrangement, neither member could dismiss the other, and future updates would require collective approval. In the time since, I feel that the project has grown to no longer represent its original vision, and this has created a dispute which I believe can not be resolved with the partnership intact.
