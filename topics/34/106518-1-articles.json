Any applicable license to this mod is hereby transferred to him, exclusively. I\u0027d assume he may/will start a new thread for this mod. I won\u0027t be supporting it any further. It\u0027s been fun and thanks for everybody\u0027s patience, assistance and kind words and encouragement.\n\nI will ask the mods to lock this thread. All future discussion should take place on the [new thread](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/176158-14x-pebkac-industries-launch-escape-system/).\n\n[See the imgur album for screenshots.](http://imgur.com/a/j7d3k)\n\nThanks [@Kottabos](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/36583-kottabos/) for doing a nice video review!  The PEBKAC parts actually start around 2:30.\n\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/wa6SF2ySxK0?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nRecompiled for compatibility with KSP 1.3.x  I have not done any localization, nor do I plan to do so. If you want to create a localized copy, let me know and we will figure out how to make it happen.\n\nIt seems to run OK with 1.4.1 but I have not examined any of the DLC yet.\n\nThis add-on is a set of parts I created because I was a little dissatisfied by the stock Launch Escape System (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Launch Escape System\u0022\u003ELES\u003C/abbr\u003E). The PEBKAC Industries \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Launch Escape System\u0022\u003ELES\u003C/abbr\u003E (PKI-\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Launch Escape System\u0022\u003ELES\u003C/abbr\u003E) is designed to more or less simulate the Apollo and Mercury \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Launch Escape System\u0022\u003ELES\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s used in real life. \n\nThe \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Launch Escape System\u0022\u003ELES\u003C/abbr\u003E for the 3-naut capsule features a totally non-functional Boost Protective Cover (BPC), launch escape motor, tower jettison motor and a small pitch control motor/nosecone and canard assembly. The canard assembly deploys roughly 8 seconds after the launch escape motor runs out of propellant and serves to help orient the escaping CM toward retrograde. It now includes a science experiment to simulate the \u0022Q-ball\u0022, which contained atmospheric/aerodynamic sensors which were part of Apollo\u0027s \u0022Emergency Detection System\u0022.\n\nThe \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Launch Escape System\u0022\u003ELES\u003C/abbr\u003E for the 1-naut capsule is modeled after the one from NASA\u0027s Mercury capsule. It didn\u0027t have any pitch motor or canards.\n\nThe included plugin allows you to automatically conduct abort procedures. Just add the parts, hit the \u0022ABORT\u0022 key and everything will take care of itself. Use staging to jettison the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Launch Escape System\u0022\u003ELES\u003C/abbr\u003E after a successful launch. Or you can add the jettison command to an action group if you prefer.\n\nI based all of the non-performance-related details (cost, tech-tree, etc) of the PKI-\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Launch Escape System\u0022\u003ELES\u003C/abbr\u003E on the stock parts. Many of the other details were tweaked to be more realistic. One big difference is that the PKI-\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Launch Escape System\u0022\u003ELES\u003C/abbr\u003E has a much total thrust than the stock part from Squad. The mass (and centers of mass) of the parts were extrapolated from the Apollo and Mercury \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Launch Escape System\u0022\u003ELES\u003C/abbr\u003E and scaled to be proportional to a \u0022stock\u0022 CM assembly. I tweaked the aerodynamic properties to be (IMHO anyway) closer to reality. The end result is a more or less realistic flight profile. From the launchpad, the included example craft should reach the ocean upon initiating an abort. Also included in this version is a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Launch Escape System\u0022\u003ELES\u003C/abbr\u003E for the 3-naut capsule which has no BPC. Aside from this visual change, the part should function identically to the other Mk2 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Launch Escape System\u0022\u003ELES\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\nThe plugin code to make is compatible with the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Launch Escape System\u0022\u003ELES\u003C/abbr\u003E for the [SDHI Service Module System](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/48073-121-sdhi-service-module-system-v322-22-november-2016/). It should be flexible enough to use with pretty much any other \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Launch Escape System\u0022\u003ELES\u003C/abbr\u003E out there.  If you find one you want to use and can\u0027t figure out how to use my plugin to automate it, drop me a PM.\n\nThe download includes a sandbox save-game which has two example craft using stock parts showing how the PKI-\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Launch Escape System\u0022\u003ELES\u003C/abbr\u003E is supposed to be assembled and configured.\n\nFinally, if you play career-mode, you should eventually get some flight-test contracts for the PKI-\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Launch Escape System\u0022\u003ELES\u003C/abbr\u003E parts.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-06-25T16:28:59Z\u0022 title=\u002206/25/2018 04:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJune 25, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Kurld**\n  \ntransferred to another modder"},{"CreatedByName":"Clythoris","CreatedById":116254,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T09:41:53Z","Content":"So, if my launch doesn\u0027t go as planned, I use this to get my crew to safety?

Mainly, the entire LES does not have enough mass (especially the nose-cone, which IRL was loaded up with lead and depleted uranium ballast).  The centers of mass for the individual parts were also not correct, especially for the escape/BPC part, the result of all of these factors being the CoM for the spacecraft in abort mode was too far aft, relative to its center of pressure. In other words, it flew like a dead duck.\n\nThis was semi-acceptable, given that it resulted in a quasi-realistic \u0022flip\u0022 towards retrograde at the end of powered flight. But I wanted it to be more realistic. After examining the NASA technical documents in depth and tweaking the config files to more or less reflect \u0022reality\u0022 in the Kerbal universe, I believe I now have it much closer to real-world performance.\n\nOf course, no good deed goes un-punished... Now that I\u0027ve got it flying in a more or less \u0022stable\u0022 attitude, it\u0027s taking too much time for it to naturally pitch into the attitude required for deploying the earth recovery systems. So I\u0027ve also been working on some new models and learning how to do animations so that the \u0022nose\u0022 part will have deploy-able canards. Not sure what I need to do to achieve the aerodynamic effect I am after here.\n\nWish me luck!  And, hopefully your kerbals will never need to use these parts!"},{"CreatedByName":"Kurld","CreatedById":79950,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-13T21:44:49Z","Content":"I\u0027ve more or less completed \u0022release 2\u0022 for these parts.  Specifically, I\u0027ve:\n\n- reworked the look and dimensions of the various parts to more or less represent the Apollo LES.  I probably went overkill on some of the details.\n- tweaked the masses, centers of mass and drag cubes of the various parts to, again, more or less represent the Apollo LES, relative to typical \u0022stock\u0022 CM.\n- the combination of those changes results in a stable, prograde, flight profile.\n- wrote plugin code to automatically handle abort procedures. No more messing around with action groups. Just put the parts on your craft and it is all set up for you.\n- The nose cone now has canards that deploy automatically after a short delay.  Deploying the canards causes the escaping CM to re-orient itself retrograde, just like in real life.\n- the LES will self-jettison once it reaches the retrograde orientation\n- In case of a successful launch, I added an action (on the nosecone part) to manually jettison the LES.  Add it to any available action group you want.\n\nThe revised LES is [here on Dropbox](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/95986775/NEW_LES.zip).\n\nFuture plans:\n\n- add the other parts from the original release (a version with no BPC and one that will fit on the FASA Apollo CM).\n- add a full set of parts for Squad\u0027s Mk1 CM.\n- further plugin code to model various abort modes from real life (for instance, the pitch control motor did not fire above a certain altitude)\n- any suggestions or requests?"},{"CreatedByName":"Kurld","CreatedById":79950,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-15T22:01:58Z","Content":"Added screenshots to the original post."},{"CreatedByName":"Deimos Rast","CreatedById":157420,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-16T19:02:54Z","Content":"just want to say that\u0027s one the best \u0022all rights reserved\u0022 licenses I\u0027ve ever seen, nice!"},{"CreatedByName":"Kurld","CreatedById":79950,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-20T21:48:12Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 6/16/2016 at 3:02 PM, Deimos Rast said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E just want to say that\u0027s one the best \u0022all rights reserved\u0022 licenses I\u0027ve ever seen, nice!\n\u003E \n\nThanks.\n\nI\u0027ve started work on the escape system for the Mk.1 command module.
