The idea being that when your vessel returns safely to Kerbin, there would be a required wait time before the capsule, crew, science, etc. got back to the KSC. This is my opinion of course, but I feel it may add a little more \u0022realism\u0022 like this already does by adding building time and recovering parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt could even be somewhat dynamic where if you land on the complete opposite side of kerbin where the KSC is located it could take a while to get back to base; if you land close it could only take maybe an hour or two. You could also add in that if splashdown occurred the recovery times gets a hefty boost. The total time it takes to get the crew back along with everything else could vary widely: Distance from the KSC, the amount of crew, the amount of data, the capsule, and any remaining parts that landed safely and survived reentry. These are just a few ideas I\u0027ve been tossing around in my head.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother cool thing that also \u003Cstrong\u003Ejust\u003C/strong\u003E popped up in my head as I was typing that last statement is there could also be an option for the player to return the the crew / parts / data / etc. themselves. The downside to this idea is that you\u0027d need a decent sized cargo plane that includes a small lab for the science to be stored and analysed during transit, and you\u0027d need enough seats to fit the crew. By now I think you can see that this would need to be a pretty decent sized ship to get \u003Cstrong\u003Eeverything\u003C/strong\u003E back, or maybe it could be made to bring some objects for higher rewards... Maybe it could even be made to return the science in the lab that can boost the amount of science of each experiment it has on board by a small fraction meaning more people may physically recover parts because, \u003Cstrong\u003EYAY, MORE SCIENCE!\u003C/strong\u003E Oohh...

I\u0027m happy to see you\u0027re still evolving your mod and making it even more in-depth than it already is. I\u0027ve had this mod installed along with your Stage Recovery mod since I first saw this thread right at the end of August. I\u0027ve never removed them because of the unique aspect of time actually being a critical component with LS mods, plus it makes sense to get spent boosters back if rigged right. Another thing I heard was coming rgar would add more even more realism is the pad reconditioning / rollout (Can\u0027t recall if it\u0027s being changed. I\u0027d personally want both. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E) that\u0027s hopefully coming soon. Which, by the way, would be absolutely awesome to have the ability to have both play a factor for people that that little extra level of realism. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomething tells me its crossed your mind about having both as an option, or it\u0027s currently in the works. I say that because you\u0027re exactly like me when it comes to coding something that a wide variety of people will be using. Customizability - a lot of it. Say, little Billy likes having a slight challenge but he doesn\u0027t like to wait for things to build or research. You have options for that. Rebecca here likes to have everything as hard as it can be and wants the most realism you can get from \u0022stock KSP\u0022. Once again, they have the options. So, after that tantalizing image I tried to paint in your mind, if you still don\u0027t get what I\u0027m saying, having options for rollout time and the lifting of the rocket, plus pad reconditioning would be amazing!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERollout and lifting speed could be determined by overall mass. One thing I\u0027d love to see, but don\u0027t\u0027 know if it\u0027s possible, is to be able to determine pad reconditioning by multiple factors: The overall heat produced by all engines that fired, the amount of force that was exerted on the pad as the thrusters ignited, and the overall mass of the craft sitting on the pad. As said, I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s possible, all I know is it would be one hell of a script but one of the coolest features, not just myself, but others would probably have seen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd now I\u0027m here rambling again, I have a bad habit of doing that... Anyways, something that may make you smile: Installed KCT and Stage Recovery August 30th. They have only been removed for updates. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep up the awesome work, man! It\u0027s completely changed the game. Honestly, and this isn\u0027t me just going nuts over this mod. I feel this has made career mode actually feel like a proper career mode more-so than what Squad has done so far. And if we really are starting on a F***ing barn at the beginning then yeah, you have definitely done more for career and making it feel like a career than Squad, hands down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce again, more rambling!

Heat production I can imagine being essentially scaled with vehicle launch weight. As for force exerted on the pad at ignition -- could you be suggesting that a lower TWR (or initial throttle setting until the launch clamps are cleared) would be rewarded with a slightly reduced pad recondition time when compared against just full throttle blasting off with a TWR of \u0026gt;1.5? Intriguing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy follow-up question would be -- does that mean that you can launch with radially mounted SRBs, angled slightly outward? Inefficient as most of your thrust vectoring would be angled outward instead of against gravity, but it reduces Launchpad stresses until the SRBs can be jettisoned by radial decouplers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"severedsolo","CreatedById":80345,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-06T13:02:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo... question on future 0.90 development.

As for customizability, I tend to prefer to give people the tools to play however they want. With the rollout times (which are treated the same way as reconditioning in that it\u0027s mass based, they\u0027re actually two instances of the same internal object in the code) there\u0027s a slider to let you choose how much time for a rocket should be spent on rollout and how much should be spent on reconditioning. Set the slider to 0% rollout and it acts like it does now, 100% rollout and there\u0027s no reconditioning (you just pay that time prior to launch), the default is 25% if I recall correctly, meaning if the total \u0022reconditioning\u0022 time is the sum of the rollout and post-launch reconditioning then 25% of that total is rollout and 75% is reconditioning.

The EXTREMELY reduced build times are representative of refueling/repairing (default settings result in a build time of about 10% compared to a brand new ship). You can always increase the InventoryEffect (5% build times would be 400) if you feel it isn\u0027t reducing your times to something you would consider satisfactory. The development version (aka, the pretty much 100% stable except for some weirdness with Procedural Parts) has the ability to recover straight to the inventory without going through any build times first, but since KSP provides ZERO way to easily turn an existing vessel into a valid craft file (and straight copying it from the save doesn\u0027t work because suddenly everything is named differently or has a totally different meaning) it is currently pretty buggy (since I have to manually parse the ship and fix its rotation, remove science from containers, repack parachutes, turn off engines, etc). It works ok for rockets, but planes tend to get put tail down on the runway due to lost rotation information.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then you get to play with vessel recovery time instead, with a really wacked out frankenplane that may or may not be missing modules \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E Squad doesn\u0027t make anything easy for us it seems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou also can do it manually by keeping the ship next to the runway and refuelling it with a tanker.

The inventory system was one of the very first things I created (it\u0027s present in Pre-Release 1) and was designed such that you could reuse (space)planes or other reusable craft without having to take the full time to build a new ship. The original version of KCT (when EkkuZakku was still working on it) didn\u0027t have any systems to reduce build times, so you\u0027d have to pay the full time every single launch (and you could only have one ship building at a time and couldn\u0027t switch to a different craft, it was a good time \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E ).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt wasn\u0027t until recently when I was trying to add a way to recover craft directly into storage, thus bypassing the whole refurbishing and refueling stage and its associated time, that I discovered that there is virtually no simple way of turning an existing craft into a craft file. The conversion is definitely not as straightforward as it should be, but changing one or the other on Squad\u0027s side would likely break save games. I did find one way, and can get valid craft files, they\u0027re just pretty messed up. Which I might actually keep as-is (once I figure out the rotation issues) since it\u0027s a side effect of not going through the refurb phases that your wheels or solar panels are still broken and your tanks are empty. You can just use the edit function to fix those yourself, many of which won\u0027t require any extra game time other than what you take to manually fix things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI personally don\u0027t care so much for the \u0022recover to storage\u0022 thing since the part inventory was designed to satisfy that requirement, but it was requested enough that I\u0027ve spent quite a bit of time on it despite the many issues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe particular github issue for this is \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/magico13/KCT/issues/10\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Enumber 10\u003C/a\u003E and you can view some of the progress I had on this by reading the posts on the dev forum (linked in the bottom of the first post). As I\u0027ve mentioned before, it won\u0027t be a feature present in the \u0022normal\u0022 1.1 release since it\u0027s got a lot of issues (primarily with resetting things), but will be available if you have the \u0022Debug\u0022 setting enabled in the KCT settings. If you (you being anyone reading this) wants to test it out now, the dev version is actually pretty stable otherwise (but we\u0027ve only got one other person actually testing it out, so there\u0027s likely many bugs him and I can\u0027t anticipate that only more eyes will find). All the warnings on the dev thread about it breaking your save are there to ensure you know the risks before trying, especially because the next version uses a radically different save mechanism, but we\u0027re pretty sure old saves convert properly now. 1.1 required much, much save breaking to get to the current state (even between individual builds).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor comparison, the update branch is 31 commits ahead of the current release (plus or minus one or two since the master branch has some very minor stuff not actually in the release) while the master branch only has 116 commits TOTAL since PR4 which was 8 months ago. That\u0027s over 25% of the total current commits all in one update, mostly because we had to keep retrying things.
