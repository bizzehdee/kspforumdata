It maps best at 10x warp, using the default scan settings. 1x warp is just as bad as 50x warp for some reason. Maybe adjusting the scan settings fixes this?\u003Cp\u003EThose of us who run with large parts packs installed will experience this issue. For instance, I was using KW Rocketry, NovaPunch Remix, and B9 Aerospace, all of which have many parts. These would work fine, but ISA MapSat takes up a lot of extra memory, and the game itself can only use up to ~3.3GB of RAM. Anything over that will crash the game. I managed to go through and prune off a lot of the extra parts I never use, and am actually able to run the game fine now, although memory usage still climbs even when not using ISA MapSat. Seems to point to a memory leak with the game itself, and not really something specific to the mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve noticed a bit of extra mem usage with mapsat, but nothing close to what everyone here is talking about.....and I have ALOT of mods installed....sitting at 714 parts.
