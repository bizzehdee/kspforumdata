The included \u0022SPU\u0022 probe cores are the only ones that induce the requirements by default.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight, but in RT2, there is no included SPU, as it adds that functionality to the stock probe cores, at least that is my understanding. I imagine you could modify it and add the old probe cores in and disable the RT2 function on the stock probe cores. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen again I haven\u0027t been keeping up with everything lately. Maybe with the modifications the others have made to RT1 to make it compatible with KSP 0.21 wouldn\u0027t cause problems with stock probe cores. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cilph","CreatedById":21477,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-18T12:02:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022BigNose\u0022 data-cite=\u0022BigNose\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EJDP and Cliph are propably waiting for the release of v0.22, which will change and add many things regarding a vanilla networking system to transfer data back to Kerbin, based on the vanilla antenna and dish.\u003Cp\u003EI bet once that\u0027s released, they will start adapting RT2 to 0.22 and release it eventually.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: What I said is maybe not that accurate.
