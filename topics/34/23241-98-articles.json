I have to be doing something wrong but i dont know what it is. For whatever reason when I use the VTOL engines from this pack. When I use them in symmetry mode, or I even download a plane that has done that. One of the engines is always upside down. I know you can invert the rotation. But being that none of the crafts I download have a action group set for that. it makes me wonder why im always having to just deal with it. Or almost break symmetry by placing the vtols by hand trying to get them rotated the same direction. Anyone have any idea what im doing wrong here? Thanks\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can\u0027t setup an action group for only 1 side of symmetrically placed objects, so you just have to manually invert that one side at launch. No other way to do it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"viperwolf","CreatedById":66190,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-25T00:28:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022briansun1\u0022 data-cite=\u0022briansun1\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eso what is the secreat part?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think its a separator located in the structural parts group.

I have not seen a fuel/mono tank that just has air in it.

Most every VTOL in reality uses engine bleed air, which I see B9 compressed air as, but unlike engine bleed air, it\u0027s very limited (you have bleed air as long as you have a running engine). The compromise I\u0027d take is having tanks that would deplete in upper atmo/space but while in atmo, stores the compressed air. I could see it being abused for stock intake air though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
