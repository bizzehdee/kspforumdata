This isn\u0027t an issue for me, as I personally edit each chute for each new craft I make, but if I loaded a previously used craft, KCT seemed bound and determined to use the old craft\u0027s settings, in a few cases, deploying too late, and with way not enough parachute to stop the descent before litho-braking occurred. I have never seen this behavior before with the previous version of KCT, and KCT was the only mod I updated last night, so I\u0027m not sure what was going on. I\u0027m going to plunk around with it some more here in about 5 minutes, and see if I can get a repro on this, and if so, get you out some log files and such.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magico13","CreatedById":73338,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-26T13:41:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo I don\u0027t necessarily think that\u0027s entirely KCT\u0027s doing. KCT won\u0027t modify the default parameters of anything, but real chute is probably having their defaults messed up when loading the recovered craft (thinking that those values are some how \u0022pristine\u0022). It might be possible to fix with a change to the default template in the KCT_ModuleTemplates file, but it might be more a real chute issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did warn that things might be a bit buggy, since KSP is really not designed to go from a Vessel to a Craft (but gladly goes the opposite direction). One other fun issue I forgot to mention is that planes will be randomly rotated 90 degrees so that they\u0027re pointed straight up. Just clicking on them in the editor is enough to fix that though, since they\u0027re stored with the correct rotation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut yeah, if you can get me logs I\u0027ll take a look and see if there\u0027s anything I can do.
