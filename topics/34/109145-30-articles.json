I will check through later at work but I thought I should mention this. I had a rescue mission for a Kerbal and their craft. Low Kerbin orbit, easy day rescue. Well, as soon as I latched onto the craft, I started increasing my ap as I happened to be pointed mostly prograde at the time. I had latched onto a SC-TD Multipurpose Cockpit. Nothing appeared to be happening visually. But when I turned retro I seen my ap started decreasing. I even cut off all access to mono and electricity and all engines but still it continued. It was a slow change of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003Edv\u003C/abbr\u003E apparently. After a few minutes, it finally stopped. I have no idea what was going on. Never had anything like this happen before in the 1000\u002B hours of game time I have. I have several mods so its hard telling whats going on. Since it was that part I latched onto from this mod. I thought I better post this up just in case it had something to do with that part. It was like thrusters were active. Not sure whats going on.
