First, the BioMass mod has evolved a bit since it was first released. There are FOUR different ways it can be played. You can change the difficulty level by using the in-game button (see here for details):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/fWf3oNG4RtQ?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.) \u003Cstrong\u003EClassic\u003C/strong\u003E. This is BioMass as it was initially released. Each greenhouse produces a different thing, things are not mass balanced, and there are fewer parts. As Roboto has said to me, it\u0027s meant for \u0022casual\u0022 players. For details on how Classic works, see \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/62631-BioMass-Ongoing-Development?p=1383124\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1383124\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.) \u003Cstrong\u003EEasy\u003C/strong\u003E. Easy is similar to classic, but the reactions are mass balanced. The categories that some parts were in under Classic have changed, as have some of their descriptions\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.) \u003Cstrong\u003EMedium\u003C/strong\u003E and \u003Cstrong\u003EHard\u003C/strong\u003E are, for the time, identical. The various biological and chemical reactions are more complex, mass balanced, and relatively close to reality in terms of rates (read as: things happen slowly).

You germinate the seeds by exposing them to IR light. The germinated seeds take in CO2 and water in the presence of light and make O2 and Biomass. Be careful, though, because in the absence of light Biomass \u002BO2 is turned into CO2 and water. Luckily the photosynthetic reaction is 4x greater than the respiration reaction. Once you have Biomass you can harvest it to make Biocake. If you allow the Biomass to grow until it fills the greenhouse, it starts to produce seeds.

Thanks for following up. The green leave button in the space center doesnt do anything when I press it. I wont be able too see what each difficulty level will do. Any ideas?

I think I have everything?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing about the hydrogen. You should include a reaction to break down water into hydrogen. Maybe slipstream the process into the hydrogen compressor or make a separate part. I feel the hydrogen resource has a critcal missing logistics in this regard. Seems like a catch-22 if the only way to get hydrogen is monoprop, but to get monoprop you need hydrogen. So the hydrogen ends up coming from a terrible ratio source such as the air using the air splitter gizmo. Idk if that overbalancing it , but I just have this bad feeling hydrogen is the weakest link in the whole fuel creation scenario.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Olympic1","CreatedById":79730,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-31T03:30:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m making a patch for BioMass for 0.90 but I need some help with the coding.
