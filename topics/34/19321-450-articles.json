Can I add my own NACA profile to a wing?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally: How realistic is it? Does FAR simulate using computational fluid dynamics to solve the dynamic equations around the aircraft? Or is it just following the lifting line theory? How do the CL-alpha curve look?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWill I be able to see a separation bubble (and the linear cl_a change there?). Is stall hysteresis visible? Does the model take into account deep stall, and actual air-flow direction changes at the tail wing due to the main wing? (Giving rise to T-tails). Just because I did the test not too long ago, here is a CL-alpha curve I might want to see, you can see the seperation bubble at alpha = 4.5 degrees, hysteresis, deep stall plateau clearly:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bu49ab5.png\u0022 alt=\u0022bu49ab5.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-26T00:59:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ferram4\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ferram4\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is nothing in there that would ever cause FAR to update the aerodynamics.
