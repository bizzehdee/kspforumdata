This way you can customise the readouts for power production and consumption in the VAB. Although these are also available in flight, they don\u0027t do anything. In flight the readouts show you ACTUAL power production and consumption.\n\nI have also added a Dark-Side Transit GUI window that allows you to:-\n\nSelect a celestial body (works with stock planets as well as any planet mod like Kopernicus, etc), then you enter an orbit (assumes this is roughly circular) in Kms and it will show you the dark-side transit time and amount of EC required to complete the transit. This EC calc also takes into account what parts you have included/excluded in the PartsList in the VAB. This window is also available in flight but it uses the ACTUAL power consumption. This EC calc does NOT factor in any parts that PRODUCE EC. But I am thinking of just adding a tweak to that to include anything that produces EC but exclude Solar Panels (because you will be on the dark-side). \n\nWhat do people think?"},{"CreatedByName":"speedwaystar","CreatedById":153092,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-01T04:58:21Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 8 hours ago, JPLRepo said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E What do people think?\n\u003E \n\nsounds fantastic.\n\noh, and as for the timewarp issue when on reserve power, i\u0027ve confirmed that it kicks in whenever timewarp rises to 50x and reserve power is active. so, hit 50x, get warning, timewarp drops to 1x, rises back to 50x (because warp to destination is still active), another warning, drops back to 1x, rinse repeat.\n\nthe 18 power draw for the Mk1-2 cockpit in the VAB seems to be based on average of XYZ torgue = 15 x ElectricCharge 1.2/sec. since this is a worst-case scenario i\u0027d be inclined to either ignore it (since reaction wheels aren\u0027t usually running), or multiply it by some notional percentage, say 0.05 or less.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-01T05:17:23Z\u0022 title=\u002212/01/2015 05:17  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by speedwaystar**"},{"CreatedByName":"JPLRepo","CreatedById":114736,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-01T06:03:08Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, speedwaystar said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E sounds fantastic.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E oh, and as for the timewarp issue when on reserve power, i\u0027ve confirmed that it kicks in whenever timewarp rises to 50x and reserve power is active. so, hit 50x, get warning, timewarp drops to 1x, rises back to 50x (because warp to destination is still active), another warning, drops back to 1x, rinse repeat.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E the 18 power draw for the Mk1-2 cockpit in the VAB seems to be based on average of XYZ torgue = 15 x ElectricCharge 1.2/sec. since this is a worst-case scenario i\u0027d be inclined to either ignore it (since reaction wheels aren\u0027t usually running), or multiply it by some notional percentage, say 0.05 or less.\n\u003E \n\nOh ok, I forgot, when you are on reserve power yes anything above 50x forces you out of timewarp.

There are just so many parts in that mod.  \n\nAlso, Unlikely I can support any parts in that mod that use MegaJoules instead of ElectricCharge (AmpYear only supports ElectricCharge and ReservePower resources).  \n\nMegajoules just makes it way more complicated.\n\nAlso for the Dark-Side calcs - I\u0027m working on something like this:  \n![7DJZJPI.png](http://i.imgur.com/7DJZJPI.png)\n\nSo now in the Dark-Side calcs window it shows EC required for Dark-Side Transit = Power Consumer Parts that you have selected in the Parts List  \n\nEC produced for Dark-Side Transit = Power Production Parts you have selected in the Parts List (will also include solar panels unless you de-select them, I\u0027m thinking I could automatically de-select Solar Panels if you have the Dark-Side Window Open, or you have to do it manually :- **Looking for people\u0027s thoughts here**  \n\nThe Last line will show Surplus or Deficit EC required for the Dark-Side Transit depending on the difference between your producer parts and consumer parts you have selected.\n\n[@speedwaystar](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/153092-speedwaystar/) - Is your RLA stockalike fuel cell working?
