I am having exactly the same problem. I am brand new to Map Overlay today so I have no config file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAccording to Player.log it is initially trying to write to the path /PluginData/KSP for which it will not get permission because this path starts in root and will not exist. For diagnosis I created that path and gave permissions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow from my experiment it appears that if new users copy the file Base.cfg from ~MapResourceOverlay to ~MapResourceOverlay/PluginData/MapResourceOverlay and rename the file as MapResourceOverlay.cfg it will correct itself from then on, but I am still testing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf that is all that is bugged then I expect it will be easy enough for Cyrik to find the wrong path assignment and do a fix (but then again I don\u0027t speak C# or Unity so who knows!) \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: For some odd reason it needs write permission to a folder \u0022/PluginData/KSP\u0022. I cannot remove that folder without breaking it, but it appears that it does not actually write anything there.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-12T16:10:26Z\u0022 title=\u002209/12/2014 04:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 12, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Kaa253\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EMore info:\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
