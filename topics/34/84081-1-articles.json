The techtree implementation starts with simple heavy truck parts being available right away, leading up to lightweight car size wheels and an advanced omnidirectional 360\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 wheel controlled via RCS translation keys ideally suited to base construction. The wheels also have dynamic friction and will slide to reduce the probability of rollover when driving at high speeds, unlike stock wheels which will typically see you dead in the same scenario. There are also two new capsules (truck cabs!) to use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome pictures: *I\u0027ll get better ones later, these are from in development\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETweakables in action.
