I will take a look at the queue problem. The parts in the list are selected by volume, not by mass. Maybe for some reason the front section is larger than the back section. You can see the volume of a part when you add it to an inventory in the VAB. I don\u0027t know why it freezes, but it may have to do with the very long list in your menu. I am already looking for a solution and may implement some kind of paging like in the VAB.
