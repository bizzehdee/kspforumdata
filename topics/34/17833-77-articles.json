You should be able to figure out how much dV you need to simply get into orbit (Usually it\u0027s 4500-5000 but every ship and player varies) and then from there you can use a chart like \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/UUU8yCk.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis one\u003C/a\u003E to guesstimate how much more dV you\u0027ll need. For example, if it takes you 4500dV to get into a basic 70-80km orbit then you can guess you\u0027ll need another 1100-1200 to get Keostationary, 860 or so to encounter Mun, 950 or so to encounter Minmus, etc. For orbits lower than Keostationary you can get away with less dV, for higher, more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can use the in-flight readouts to note how much dV you have remaining before and after you reach orbit, and thereby get hard number for a specific orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Solarapple","CreatedById":137606,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-10T02:40:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENew here, just bought the game.
