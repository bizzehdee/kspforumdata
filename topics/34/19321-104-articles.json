According to some posts in this thread, it\u0027s because SAS expects instant deflection of control surfaces (which is not the case in FAR) and overshoots, then corrects itself, over and over.

I\u0027ve also exposed the parameter in the config, so it can be modded back to the original 0.1s if desired (or larger for hard-mode), or it can be dropped to a crazy 0.00001s if you need absolute instant deflection with all the instant stalling that will come with it; a good thing all around.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried to fix this behavior:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReducing ctrlSurfTimeConstant to 0.00001 or 0 doesn\u0027t help at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReducing \u0022Control Maxi\u0022 on control surfaces to 3-4 degrees helps a little, but makes the plane much harder to control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, INCREASING ctrlSurfTimeConstant seems to fix the epilepsy. 0.5 works for most planes, 1 (and slightly decreased \u0022Control Maxi\u0022 on surfaces) is required for light, less stable aircraft.
