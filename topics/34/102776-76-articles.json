KSP 1.1.2, NH 2 up to date, heck lot of mods.\n\nAfter aerocapture I got into ~55km x ~2.500km, I was still at 4x physics warp and orbit kept decaying after I left atmosphere. After disabling warp it kept decaying at same rate (25%  effect of 4x warp effect). Standard warp killed this phantom force, but switching warp (both types) on caused change in PE/AP by few dozen meters (however it seemed to keep same values).\n\nCan warp on active vessel cause similar issue on inactive ones?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-07-03T22:51:00Z\u0022 title=\u002207/03/2016 10:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 3, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by PT**"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-04T00:03:46Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 4 hours ago, PT said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E From 1.1.3 patchnotes:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E     \n\u003E     \n\u003E     Greatly reduce Apoapsis/Periapsis changing with no input, with thanks to ferram4 and eggrobin. option is toggleable in Settings-\u003EGameplay and tunable in Physics.cfg.\n\u003E \n\nIn stock KSP 1.1.3, orbital decay no longer happens with the default setting.  Or at least, it\u0027s no worse than it\u0027s been at any point in time except for 1.1.2.  IOW, if you put something on rails, its orbit won\u0027t change as long as it\u0027s on rails, although it WILL change somewhat when you take it off rails.  So bottom line, in stock 1.1.3, orbital decay is no longer an issue, space stations last forever, etc.\n\nThe issue is when using KSP 1.1.3, with Kopernicus for KSP 1.1.3, but NH for KPS 1.1.2.  Then you have serious orbital decay, far worse than stock KSP 1.1.2 ever was.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 4 hours ago, PT said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Can warp on active vessel cause similar issue on inactive ones?\n\u003E \n\nIn stock KSP 1.1.3, the orbit will change somewhat for the active vessel due to floating point errors and such, but not enough to make a difference.  So if you\u0027re still using antiquated Kethane and have to keep the scanning probe active for weeks, warping as fast as you can and still get a good scan, you really won\u0027t be able to tell.  And as mentioned above, if the ship is on rails, it won\u0027t change at all.\n\nMy issue with NH is with on-rails ships having serious orbital changes in very short time intervals.

It seems to generate a Barycentre inside Kerbin, and makes all your ships orbit the Barycentre instead of Kerbin, and because the bug only affects things in orbit of Kerbin, there shouldn\u0027t be a problem. They are all orbiting K\u00EBrbin (with the \u00EB)! Quick question, because this is a Barycentre, dose it require Sigma Binary? I already have it, so I have no problem, but just for the rest of the users on this forum I would like to know.\n\nEDIT: Don\u0027t download this without changing the reference bodies of all your spacecraft. Downloading the patch can cause the same glitches as downloading a new planet pack onto an already made save. If anybody has any problems with their ships orbiting a body that isn\u0027t what they were orbiting before the patch, tell me and I\u0027ll post a solution. Also, create another save with the same persistent file as the save you normally play to check if there are orbit issues. If you don\u0027t the orbits will be screwed up when they are reassigned to their normal body. Also, when you download this patch, don\u0027t ever expect to be able to collect science in space over Kerbin again. But most people will have already way past having to collect science from Kerbin. Also a bit of a funny occurrence occasionally happens at the main menu title screen if you download this ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022). \n\nBesides the aforementioned science and reference body bugs, I have found no problems with this patch.
