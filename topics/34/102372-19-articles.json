Other tourists do not have this issue, I bypassed it by doing a stock tourism mission and then accepted a \u0022orbit kerbin\u0022 tourism plus contract - the new kerbal worked fine. However, when Tito is on the vessel, the LS gets depleted the moment I launch. This is the same whether loading him through the stock interface, or the passenger loader.\n\nI\u0027ve included a [log](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ivrtklna104p7ty/output_log.txt?dl=0)and a [save](https://www.dropbox.com/s/lfevver4k9ltbeo/persistent.sfs?dl=0), but I don\u0027t know how helpful it will be, as I couldn\u0027t see any exceptions etc.\n\nEdit: I fixed it. Looks like for some reason TAC saved Tito as not having an update for over 10 days so it was depleting the LS as soon as he loaded, because it thought he had not been consuming.
