This mod adds a few parts geared toward making Mk3 SSTOs more aerodynamic and look cooler!**\n\n**FIRST UPDATE!**\n\n**Changes:**\n\n**- Added scramjet engine!**\n\n**- Retextured some parts**\n\n**- Added \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E to the Mk3 Hypersonic Cockpit (it\u0027s supposed to be a very advanced cockpit, seemed weird not having it)**\n\n**- Removed some extra bit of code from the tank CFG that wasn\u0027t needed**\n\n\u003E \n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/iNFHh)\n\n**Parts included are:**\n\n1. Mk3 Hypersonic Cockpit - A stylish command pod that fits five kerbals with a much pointier shape for less drag\n\n2. Mk3 radial attachment fuselage extensions - This essentially turns the Mk3 fuselage into a lifting body, much like the Mk2. Three parts fall into this category: A wing edge root extension, a lifting body extension and a RAM intake.\n\n3. Hybrid high-bypass turbofan/ramjet 2.5m engine - Much like Mk2 spaceplanes use the 1.25 jet-engines, it seems only natural that Mk3 spaceplanes could rely on proportionally large jet engines. This engine is just that.\n\n4. A 2.5m shock cone intake. Following the same logic, 2.5m intakes are needed for larger spaceplanes.\n\n5. A 2.5 switchable \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E 10m long tank - There\u0027s plenty of 2.5m tanks, but this one allows for fuel selection, very useful for spaceplanes.\n\n6. Radial attachment scramjet engine - This is a rather large scramjet with its own intake. Like real life scramjets it will not produce thrust until it\u0027s going at high speeds. It\u0027s designed to radially attach to Mk3 fuselages, bbut as you can see on the pics, it will attach nicely to the underside of Mk2 planes as well See scramjet instructions, if needed: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/132786-Update-Mk3-Hypersonic-Systems-scramjet-rebalancing?p=2164595#post2164595](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/132786-Update-Mk3-Hypersonic-Systems-scramjet-rebalancing?p=2164595#post2164595)\n\n**Note:** IVA is a provisional stand-in, it will be revamped in future updates along with more stuff!\n\n**Note 2:** This mod includes Module Manager by sarabian, CrossFeedEnabler by NathanKell, and the Firespitter plugin by Snjo. CrossFeedEnabler is not absolutely essential, but the radial attachment parts include fuel, so without CrossFeedEnabler, the fuel would just be dead weight.\n\n**Note 3:** Two example crafts are included, one of them (video below) requires B9 Aerospace Procedural Parts which can be found [here](http://kerbal.curseforge.com/linkout?remoteUrl=https%253a%252f%252fkerbalstuff.).

I don\u0027t think putting a docking clamp on the back is really necessary, though. Since inline parts are stackable you could simply attach the docking clamp that best suits your need on the back.
