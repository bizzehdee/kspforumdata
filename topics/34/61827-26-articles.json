If every part is on the same axis through the middle of the ship, then the steering\u0027s attempts to keep it aligned around that axis go haywire and roll the ship back and forth in a see-saw motion around that particular axis. I found that I can make it stop by designing it with some mass being off the central axis. (i.e. slap a couple of fuel tanks on the side with 2x radial symmetry, and use yellow hose to feed them to the actual engine). Once there exists some mass that is NOT on the central axis, the wobbly steering goes away. I don\u0027t understand the steering code myself but given the effects I\u0027d guess that somehow the LOCK STEERING algorithm doesn\u0027t deal very well with cases where the ship has a very low angular inertia around the axis in question. It tends to oversteer in that case, and gets stuck in a loop constantly trying to overcorrect itself, making the wobble get bigger and bigger over time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Codey737","CreatedById":76942,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-02T03:15:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Steven Mading\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Steven Mading\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ETest that it really is the correct directory you\u0027re putting it in.
