I\u0027m not disabling any features, it merely serves as a warning for the user if they\u0027re using a version of PreciseNode that isn\u0027t compiled for the KSP version it\u0027s running on. I didn\u0027t do this because I think PreciseNode really needs it (in the grand scheme of mods, it\u0027s pretty simple) but because I think more mod authors should include this sort of functionality and I want to promote it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, node saving between craft switching/loading is now working. The PartModule idea worked like a charm and provided the quickest and easiest method of getting that functionality into the mod without requiring any additional files. The maneuver nodes are saved with the individual craft within the persistence file just like any other persistent field. You\u0027ll need a part attached to your craft for this to work and I was lucky enough to have Talisar provide an excellent model for this purpose. I changed the texture a bit, mainly because the Soviets painted their original in some garish bluish-teal and washed-out red, so I\u0027ll provide a separate download for the original alongside the modified. The part will show up under the Advanced Flight Control node in career mode and has some reasonable costs that will probably have to be adjusted in 0.24.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThird, node merging is now a thing, as requested. It\u0027s not perfect, and it never will be, but for very close nodes it should provide the functionality that was asked for, specifically creating a normal burn node followed by a circularize node and then merging them. It does this by finding the difference in velocity vectors between the previous orbit to the first node and the patch from the second node, then converting that to a delta-V vector for the first node and wiping out the second node. Again, it\u0027s not perfect because the differences do not take into account UT shifting, but it does seem work pretty darn well for the given use case. I\u0027m calling it good at that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore I release all this I want to get the AN/DN buttons created and I already have some ideas on how to do that. My philosophy has usually been to let SQUAD\u0027s code do as much lifting as possible and I think they\u0027ll have the functions I need to get this functionality working fairly easily. After that we\u0027ll move towards the 1.0 release with ejection inclination, an additional time display on the clock window, locking magnitude, etc... Also, just dreaming, I might be tempted to put a Lambert solver into this thing for pork chop plots, but that\u0027s a bit down the road.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mic_e","CreatedById":60757,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-24T19:39:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022regex\u0022 data-cite=\u0022regex\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E(blah)\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESounds awesome.
