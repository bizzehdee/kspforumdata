Firing engines with a TWR of 2.00 doesn\u0027t move the craft an inch.

(Re-sized and removed fuel)  Also, if I take a smaller FTP tank and size it UP this doesn\u0027t happen. Likewise, if I use a 2.5 meter tank this does not happen.

Though, Since I can only recreate the issue using a FTP tank (and only a certain sized tank) I figured i would mention it here. I did read how IFS put out a patch that was designed to fix some phantom force issue. Maybe that\u0027s what this is.

If I then remove the fuel, the effect return to take me to the heavens.

Great! If I then remove the fuel and shut off my engines my craft will continue flying upwards at the current speed the craft was traveling at. (In this case it was 35 m/s) \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E For reference the dry mass of the tank is .33333 -This is when the force exists.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E If I add fuel to the tank (I don\u0027t need to add oxidizer. It just needs more mass), once the mass goes above .8t the phantom force disappears.\n\u003E \n\nPlease try to reproduce with IFS 1.27  I have good reasons to beleive the last update does not initialize the initila mass correctly. Whay you see as Frymass, is actualy the target mass, not the actual mass. They supposed to be the same as long as it is correctly initialised\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-02T11:53:43Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2016 11:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by FreeThinker**"},{"CreatedByName":"gonzo98x","CreatedById":102583,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-02T12:30:23Z","Content":"I am happy to report that using IFS 1.2.7 the phantom \u0027menace\u0027 is gone."},{"CreatedByName":"FreeThinker","CreatedById":117389,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-02T12:34:39Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 2 minutes ago, gonzo98x said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I am happy to report that using IFS 1.2.7 the phantom \u0027menace\u0027 is gone.\n\u003E \n\nGood, that means my last change for 1.28 caused the issie.
