But there is no reason whatsoever to fix a mistake that was made by the maker and use that, instead of dogmatically make every solid rocket hoplessly underpowered just because that was the case with the stock one in a very early version of KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, I just said that Harvester made a mistake with the stock solid. I have a ton of arguments for this, a few of which you\\\u0027ve already heard. I personally think it\\\u0027s impossible that they\\\u0027ll not be changed or atleast a better version introduced, likely with a big update that\\\u0027ll fix certain balancing issues ( decouplers weighing 0.4, heh? ) all at once. I see no reason whatsoever to continue using these numbers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is arguing from real-life rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArguing from possible KSP lore and logic is also possible. Solids are easier and are basically explosions. They make bigger booms and can\\\u0027t be turned off or controlled as easy as a liquid. Liquids require stuff like plumbing and cryogenic turbopumps, while a solid is basically a steel tube plugged on one side. \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Commander Zoom","CreatedById":8333,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-12-06T18:13:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo is someone going to make a damn thread in KSP Development about this, or do I have to?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tiberion","CreatedById":8356,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-12-06T18:16:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDon\\\u0027t make a thread, its been done.
