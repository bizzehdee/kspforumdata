This value i was trying to calculate it to make the user of the autopilot select an altitude and get the air density calculated, so the script can later calculate the level flight AoA, now if under FAR i can\u0027t calculate the air density, how can i make FAR stability analysis calculate the AoA needed for level flight for a X altitude?? I mean when i do the analysis for SSTO\u0027s, as you guys told me i use 0.5, 0.04 and 0.01, mmmmm i believe i\u0027m confused, is air density what i need to calculate the AoA? the inputs for that chart are \u0022temperature\u0022, \u0022air density\u0022, and \u0022speed (in mach)\u0022...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpeed is selected by user, temperature and air density are related to height, how do i tell the user of the autopilot to input under FAR\u0027s chart X temperature and X air density if the want a cruise altitude of 5km?, as an example.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll go a little further here and may be find a work around... provided i need AoA for level flight for my autopilot... i need just that so i can achieve that AoA during the flight and maintain altitude... instead of making my script calculate it i can just use the FAR stability data and make the script use that AoA provided there, and set the altitude and speed inside FAR\u0027s editor... so that solves the problem in a less sofisticated way... but it works nonetheless... the next problem is going to be to translate the pitch (which goes from -1 to 1) into a usable data, in other words the AoA for said pitch, now is there a way to calculate that?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m confident enough to say that the pitch value will change by the amount of elevons you have, the design of them, and the position in the plane as well, but rather than tweaking it until it gets there (which my current script kind of does) i would like to be able, if possible, to calculate that exact pitch number, is it possible?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd last but not least, i just don\u0027t remember this haha... but does far show the current AoA? it does right? under flight data? (i believe it is, so to save time i\u0027ll go ask the kOS devs if that value is gettable, if it\u0027s not, then there it comes the previous question, is it possible to calculate it, if it\u0027s not, then hmmmmmmm... will have to think a work around!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you once again for the support, i have been receiving so much support from the kOS thread, and from this thread that i do need to make this happen!
