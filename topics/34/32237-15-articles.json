The way RESOURCE\u0027s are stored is fairly simplistic. The only data there is name (for identifying it in the config node), current amount, maximum amount and flow mode/state. It doesn\u0027t seem like there\u0027s a lot to go wrong there. Maybe there\u0027s another issue such as order of MODULE/RESOURCE or presence of unexpected MODULE/RESOURCE or absence of expected MODULE/RESOURCE.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the example issues I cited in my earlier post I tried about 4 different backed up save files, each of which worked fine but two different stations (using FusTek parts) refused to load in properly. They were uncontrollable and no part menus could be accessed. The staging list was half on/off the screen and the station was not moving above the planet at all. The clock was even frozen. If I used time warp, the root part would suddenly start moving, leaving everything behind. I tried a few ideas to hack the station in the persistence file but nothing helped.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI re-launched another identical station, saved then compared them side by side using NotePad\u002B\u002B split view synchronized screen.
