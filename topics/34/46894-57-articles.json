And I\u0027ll probably continue playing without using stock parts (except for lander engines, as we don\u0027t have any of those in KW yet). As I\u0027m sure that not everyone will be happy about this, maybe you could provide an \u0027extra\u0027 config (similar to the autoshroud and clamp sound folders) that uses values similar to corresponding stock engines, as nonsensical as that may be?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI probably will at some point though, it wouldn\u0027t really be hard though. Just blanket set all the mid/heavy lifter engines ISP\u0027s to 320/360ish and leave all the upper stage engines as is or if I really want to set one or two the the bigger engines to abit higher ISP to make all the smaller engines useless.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Temeter\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Temeter\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI think the KW Rocketry Engines work quite fine for reasonable (sub 100 ton freight) rockets, as long as you don\u0027t want fully recoverable one stage-rockets. The Nasa engines are extremly expensive, and the KW stuff tends to be a bit cheaper than skipper/mainsail and co. So your launcher might be 40\u002B tons heaver, but still cost the same or less.\u003Cp\u003EThe Soyuz style (ST-25/37) fuel tanks are also really cheap. I like to use them like liquid fuel boosters, low-priced but extremly impractical and therefor usually only used in the first stage. To bad the 3.5m variant got nerfed into line with the stageable tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@\u003Cstrong\u003EKickasskyle\u003C/strong\u003E: That said, can we make the ST 37 a bit cheaper? :3\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s really not as practical as the the 40 ton fuel tanks, takes more place, can\u0027t be used alone, fits rarely into upper stages and needs a central tank or fuselage. Does that make sense?
