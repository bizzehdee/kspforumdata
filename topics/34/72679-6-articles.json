Gameplay wise...most planets don\u0027t have \u0027biomes\u0027 set up yet, but probably will eventually. It\u0027d also give an even bigger incentive than there already is to install that mod that adds biomes to the other worlds. Realistically speaking, almost regardless of what is meant by \u0027multispectral\u0027, *some* kind of result is going to get returned.
