I tried to make a folding plane so it can re-enter then deploy while flying and it\u0027s just not feasible with quantum struts.

Do you mean that the wings are destroyed during deployment? If yes I don\u0027t see any way to work around this since there is either a joint or not. Joints give way a bit, but that\u0027s it. You\u0027d have to de/activate the struts non-stop during deployment, but there will be moments (phys. frames) where they aren\u0027t present but the dyn pressure of the air is so destruction is still possible. What might work could be to use two struts: 1) connect the first one, deploy the wings as far as possible. 2) activate the second 3) deactivate the first 4) continue deployment 5) repeat. This way there hopefully won\u0027t be a time without struts. Depending on the forces you may need not only two but two pairs or triples.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vardicd","CreatedById":75832,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-22T17:11:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs this newest version carrier mode compatible?
