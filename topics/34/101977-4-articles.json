I like them. The Falken Drone core looks like a killer. (I saw it, read the name, and instantly thought of Ace Combat.)\n\nA couple of requests/suggestion:\n\n1) Any plans to incorporate the BDArmory Targeting Pod camera to the Kerbin Hawk? You already added some BDArmory integration. For the Kerbin Hawk, I figure the Targeting pod functions would be a logical step. (I love that camera system. I want a basic version for general use.) I\u0027d like to call a version with the camera system the Kerbal G(h)awk (another play on the Global Hawk name.)\n\n2) This something I\u0027ve been wondering about with modders and how KSP handles Intakes and engines. Would it be a reasonable idea to give cockpits with intakes 2 of them? KSP uses a very odd priority system based on the order parts were added to a design to distribute the IntakeAir resource to engines. Many Mk2 designs tend to have 2 engines on them. This coupled with the aforementioned resource distro method makes it very possible to get asymmetric flameouts at the upper limit of engine performance. This is something the mod Intake Build Aid helps mitigate, the best being able to symmetrically distribute the engine/intake assignments. Having an odd number of intakes disallows that, of course, but most designs don\u0027t have/need 2 identical cockpits with intakes. This is just something to consider. (Otherwise, I can do it myself for my own install.)\n\nThe asymmetric flameout thing has been less of a concern in 1.0.x, but it\u0027s still a possible and potentially disastrous scenario. (Like going at Mach 7 at 40k with dual wide-set Ramjets and suddenly having one flameout while the other is still going strong... OPT Ramjet, BTW.) It can also be a problem for any super-maneuverable plane designs. ([I built a small stunt jet that can turn on a dime](https://picasaweb.google.com/115227613550138738628/KSPBDArmoryArmedStuntJet?authuser=0\u0026feat=directlink), essentially. One engine was flaming out at high AoAs. The cause of this was I forgot to use IBA (Intake Build Aid) to split up the intakes across the engines.)"},{"CreatedByName":"martinezfg11","CreatedById":59995,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-18T15:52:27Z","Content":"So for your first request the answer is YES. I\u0027ll fiddle with the Kerbin Hawk and add the targeting pod module to it.\n\nFor your second question, I don\u0027t quite understand, the cockpit intakes on my mod have two IntakeTransforms , one for each side. As for the asymmetrical flame-outs, I don\u0027t really know what to tell you other than to continue using the intake aid mod. I wish you could assign intakes to engines in stock KSP, after all, that is how intakes work."},{"CreatedByName":"TMasterson5","CreatedById":144591,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-23T18:34:34Z","Content":"Any idea why this doesnt work with B9 procedural wings?
