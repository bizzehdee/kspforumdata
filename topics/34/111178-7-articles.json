Or if you do want to play these missions with real fuels you could find and replace all instances of \u0027SolidFuel\u0027 to the real fuels equivalent in each file in the LauncherMissions folder. \n\n I will remove these from the main pack until they are completed soon!"},{"CreatedByName":"Whitecat106","CreatedById":140086,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-03T23:47:13Z","Content":"Hello everyone, \n\nI am going ahead with an update of the pack probably by this weekend, this may or may not include some more shuttle missions (using the cancelled shuttle missions for Sts-136 etc.) possibly the Luna and Vanguard programs (thanks to gerishnakov). This version will also include a fix to the Soyuz 4/5 issues. If I get time I will try and also make some re-balances to missions (since it is obvious that people are now progressing further into the pack!). Since this release will be 1.5.0 I am hoping to bring the number of contracts in the pack up to the big 500 (just for the record of the most contracts in a pack...ever... -- I have far too much time on my hands!).\n\n Talking of time, soon I will have little to spare for KSP modding what with University starting and all, (or I might have a lot more time... hmmm...) but things will certainly be changing around here. Rokanov has already volunteered his 2.0.0 version for a release upon completion so this Historic Missions thread should not be affected really! \n\nAlthough I am looking for a partner/partners to assist with my slightly more neglected Orbital Decay mod, due to a series of issues (mostly code organization and optimization based) has been overlooked as of late, if anyone would have any interest helping out it would be greatly appreciated!

If that is the case then, yes, I believe those contracts as they are currently written are impossible to complete.\n\nYup, that\u0027s exactly how it works. To expand, if you have define=Something, the ship that meets the conditions will get assigned the label \u0022Something\u0022. If you have vessel=Something (in the same or a different contract), it will require the vessel to have previously been labeled as \u0022Somedthing\u0022."},{"CreatedByName":"Whitecat106","CreatedById":140086,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-31T17:51:01Z","Content":"Hello everyone,\n\n1.6.0 is now out, this includes a whole bunch of fixes and new missions thanks to Gerishnakov! 1.7.0 will contain some more \u0027what if\u0027 missions and will also focus on RSS balancing and gameplay changes.

I just tested the A-3 contract again to be sure and it definitely works; must be something wrong on your end? I checked my config file for Ranger-3 as well and the ReachState parameter for Escaping Mun is properly parsed, at least on my end, and it\u0027s not available at start in my test game. Well spotted however in the Luna-1 config file; **Whitecat** if you could fix that in the master file I\u0027d be grateful!\n\nI hope you enjoy the whole pack, Sparco!"}]}
