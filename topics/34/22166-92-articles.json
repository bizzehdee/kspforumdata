You\u0027ll already see a drop in framerate and responsiveness when you approach another ship to dock and it unpacks it and starts to simulate that one as well as your focused one. Imagine if it unpacked and activated every single ship you have in filght. How slow would that be?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt \u003Cem\u003Emight\u003C/em\u003E be possible to have a system where strictly passive information-gathering sensors could be active even on a ship on rails, but, honestly, it would be a real can of worms.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ee.g. Oh, I just want to run a kethane scanner\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebut that uses energy\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand now the batteries are out\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebut that\u0027s okay, there is a generator on board\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebut that\u0027s burning fuel\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebut that is changing the center of mass... of a rotating body that was -almost- skimming the atmosphere\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand so much for the part being passive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere would be absolutely loads that you could do if they could continue to simulate other ships. Imagine active station-keeping on keostationary sats, or MechJeb processing maneuver nodes for non-focussed ships.
