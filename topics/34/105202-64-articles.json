The only part that would bug me would be the lifecycle of the equipment.  I am fully invested in the idea put forth by Squad\u0027s design decisions that kerbal equipment simply does not break down in the game.  Its the reason that I do not use any of the breakdown mods and that I agree with Squad\u0027s continued stance against any sort of mechanic to that end in the stock game. \n\nI may give it a toss in my current sandbox but I think you might be right.  TAC-LS is probably what I\u0027ll stick with.  Its been fairly reliable and I understand it well. \n\nAre there any other LS mods floating around out in the modder-sphere?  I seem to recall something like Iron Cross or ION Cross or something like that back in the day.  I can\u0027t seem to find a reference to it but then again this new forum is still confusing the ever-loving hydrazine outta me, lol.

Having a bit of an OCD bent towards grammer but not being physically able to type well is, well, a slow process as you might imagine.  Your two replies do put give the topic a bit more clarity and I appreciate that immensely. \n\nIts funny that you mention the habitation requirements for kerbals.  Its a bit of a personal rule of mine to ensure that kerbals have sufficient space to occupy themselves within for long trips.  Generally speaking, I have a sleep can (Hitchiker) for every 2-4 kerbals depending on flight time and, unless needed, no kerbals in the actual operations sections of the ship/station (such as command pods and labs etc).  It just \u0022feels\u0022 better that way.  So, i can say now that this would actually compliment my gameplay style now that I fully grasp what it is doing. \n\nYou are right of course that it is a bit confusing at the moment but I imagine that you are splitting your time quite a bit between Squad and your own personal projects so, its justifiable.  I would imagine that with your library of mods that have grown quite substantially since I was last around the forums with any frequency, that deactivated features of say, USI-LS, are activated upon the installation of other relevant mods, correct?  As I have said previously, I really do enjoy your enthusiasm for expanding the game mechanics in KSP.  I especially enjoy the way you try to keep things mostly stock-a-like.  I use to play with lots and lots of mods back in the day but, it got to the point where I spent more time managing the mods than playing the game proper.  I never did get much into doing file tweaks and, being a steam user, I\u0027ve never been one to keep older versions for mod compatibility.  Nowadays I tend to stick to \u0022utility mods\u0022 as I call them.  Quality of life improvements like various autopilot programs and Kerbal Engineer etc etc. \n\nAnyway, I am sure I have droned on long enough.  Thanks again for the responses both of you (Roverdude and goldenpsp).  I\u0027ll definitely be giving it a bash now. \n\nMaybe... One day....

Solution is \n\n1. Disable any punishments on home sickness in LS and MKS configs\n\n2. Select thevessel\n\n3.Put your kerbals in a lander, undock it\n\n4. Fly around the planet, for good luck\n\n5. Dock again Kerbal should feel give now\n\n6. Re-enable punishments in configs\n\nYou can disable the hab feature, by setting NoHomeEffect and NoHomeEffect vets to 0 in \\*both\\*   \n\nGameData/UmbraSpaceIndustries/LifeSupport/Settings.cfg and  \n\nGameData/UmbraSpaceIndustries/Kolonization/USI-LS.cfg"},{"CreatedByName":"Kowgan","CreatedById":116874,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-03T12:55:36Z","Content":"[@matko1990](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/156162-matko1990/) Open Kerbal Space Program\\GameData\\UmbraSpaceIndustries\\LifeSupport\\Settings.cfg on a notepad.
