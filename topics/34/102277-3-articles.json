That means, you can go to the space center, warp your station to a different point in orbit and return to the flight scene, it will stay persistent. \n\nThe last thing I have no solution for yet is the ISS mode in realtime. The easiest way to achive this would be to give the SAS the roation it would use anyway when warping, but it turned out not to work like that. (e.g. extreme shivering)\n\nIn addition, ISS mode doesn\u0027t only work with the celestial body your vessel is orbiting, but instead EVERY celestial body! This means you can make probes that are always turned to Kerbol for highest efficency regarding the solar panels, or telescopes always observing Jool!\n\nI also reworked the cfg file persistence-thingy, so the plugin will use only one file for all data (including ISS mode celestial body). \n\nI won\u0027t release the next version until I solve the Realtime ISS mode problem, however. Thanks for your patience in advance. Happy rotating!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-29T23:08:53Z\u0022 title=\u002203/29/2015 11:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MarkusA380**"},{"CreatedByName":"xXIndestructibleEVAXx","CreatedById":110214,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-29T23:06:40Z","Content":"Cool, can\u0027t wait.
