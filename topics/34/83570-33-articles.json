Please!\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t \u0022know,\u0022 but I have some ideas on your issues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith respect to the inversion of your flap mirroring -- it sounds like you\u0027re dealing with rotational symmetry (as in the VAB) instead of longitudinal symmetry (as in the SPH.) I run a mod called EditorExtensions, available at \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/38768-0-24-Editor-Extensions-v1-3-19-Jul-2014-(EdTools-Editor-Tools-replacement)\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/38768-0-24-Editor-Extensions-v1-3-19-Jul-2014-(EdTools-Editor-Tools-replacement)\u003C/a\u003E, which allows the tab key to switch function between the two modes while remaining in the same editor scene. It\u0027s useful in both the SPH and the VAB scene. When designing payloads for spaceplanes, I can go the SPH where the plane is saved in the craft list, put myself in artificial VAB-mode, design my satellite, save it as a subassembly, and then hit tab to switch back into SPH mode before loading up my plane. Load the new subassembly payload, place it, check my CoM / CoT, and I\u0027m good. Opposite, I can use the VAB, design a properly longitudinal rover with my tab key in artificial SPH-mode, and then switch to VAB mode before installing it as a payload on a vertical rocket. The differences in the modes have always been subtle. Even if you don\u0027t run the mod that I linked to here, I suppose it might be possible that something else is skafoozed and the symmetry-mode has been switched. If that is the case, it sounds like the underlying problem would be rather tedious to troubleshoot down to. At any rate, it doesn\u0027t sound normal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the collider edges so you can surface-attach stuff to the leading edge of the wings. Well, not to advertise, but that mod above has some functions that could mitigate your inconvenience slightly (a rudimentary, semi-reliable vertical snap function, or controlling the angle increments of the default horizontal snap) but generally, just use the WASDQE keys with the shift key. Setting your mouse to a higher resolution may help, too, or using a higher precision mouse pad (or just cleaning the gunk from the sensor and mouse surface -- if you own pets, you\u0027d be surprised where the cat hair and dog hair can end up.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd on struts. I\u0027ve always been under the impression that struts DO increase joint strength, though you might be incidentally correct with respect to the fact that they might not be able to strengthen a joint infinitely. The invisible struts are the exact same thing, simply with an intentionally-omitted texture. For hiding the struts internally, if you\u0027re referring to the internally-clipped strut end points, that\u0027s just really detailed control of the scroll and zoom functions while assembling them. If your mouse doesn\u0027t have a scroll wheel, replace your mouse right away, and use that scroll wheel to zoom inside your parts to make internal strut attachments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd finally, I\u0027m not sure what the diffs are between the control surfaces. Run some FAR-tests on them and find out. At this point, I\u0027m willing to believe that it\u0027s just a difference in texture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope that helps! And if someone else sees an error in my advice here, please set me straight.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kitspace","CreatedById":109786,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-20T14:29:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you!

The problem is that it is extremely hard for me to make it face forward because the rotation axes are weirdly inverted when the part is surface attached to the wing and its attitude is practically uncontrolable. Is there a way to see its attitude and rotate it in some sort of global coordinates or coordinates related to this particular part only and not related to the surface of the part it is attached to?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s1.postimg.org/45qm8gf6n/Screenshot.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Screenshot.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-20T14:46:24Z\u0022 title=\u002209/20/2014 02:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 20, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Kitspace\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taverius","CreatedById":11815,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-20T14:45:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo, it cant be fixed.

Of particular note, the first one allows you to essentially build all craft from a single game scene (either all from the VAB or all from the SPH) which has the benefit of making all of your saved craft and subassemblies be visible within the same editor -- no more having to exit the SPH to go to the VAB to find your craft files! Or worse, having to design a space-only subassembly (with rotational / VAB symmetry) save it, tab out, copy the subassembly folder from your VAB to your SPH, to go back in, exit the VAB, enter the SPH, and then find it in your subassembly folders to load it into a spaceplane cargo hold. It seamlessly launches to the correct instance of Runway / Launchpad from the same building, too, if you were going to ask.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELemme know how these work out for you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MisterFister","CreatedById":85686,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-20T16:45:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso, to Bac9 -- 5.2.2 is now live on KerbalStuff!
