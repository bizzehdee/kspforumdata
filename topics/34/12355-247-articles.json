Are you suggesting that it would land acurately without a course correction? \u003Cp\u003EThe way that it works in the current version is (perhaps a little simplified) as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) High deorbit burn (unless it is doing a low deorbit burn, but that is a different matter!) This involves waiting until it is a quater orbit away, and then both changing the plane (hence the quarter orbit away) and lowering the periapsis until it is 10% below sea level.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Then it performs a course correction which will stop once the predicted landing spot is \u0026lt;150m from target\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Then it coasts towards a deceleration burn. If the predicted landing site is more than 600m from target it will got to step 2 and course correct again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) If there is an atmopshere, during both 2) and 3), once the atmospheric drag is \u0026gt;100mm/s2 the statistical analysis of the predictions starts to time the parachutes. This is significant because if the flight path does not pass over the target at this point then timing the parachutes can not move the landing spot laterally. However because it can correct for over/undershoot it is likely to bring the error down to less than 150m and therefore not course correct, and so not correct the lateral error. For this reason it might make sense to turn the autopilot off and on again before reaching step 4 (100m/s2 drag) to force a correction if the error is let\u0027s say 300m (and significantly if there is a lateral error.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) The parachutes will open at the time that the satisitical analysis say they should - once at least one parachute is deployed then course corrections are not allowed, as the parachute drag would prevent the craft having effective attitude control. The deceleration burn will fire if the speed exceeds the target speed defined by the breaking policy*.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) When we reach the deceleration end altitude above the predicted landing point (where the deceleration end altitude is something to do with the distance covered to produce enough drag to cancel our current speed, or something - it is a bit complicated and I do not quite understand it, or for bodies with no atmospehere it is 500m) we then move to the final decent phase, which is esentially a free drop down to a suicide burn to hopefully touch down at your desired speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7) The landing legs will deploy at any stage once the AGL \u0026lt; 1000m\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is pretty much how I understand it. So like I say I am not sure what you mean when you say a course correction is unneccasery. In the high atmosphere it is possbile and can result in a more precise landing. Once the drag gets too large then performing a course correction becomes difficult depending on the design of your craft, and once a parachute is deployed it becomes impossible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes this hold for planets other than Kerbin? Because when I try to use Landing Guidance on Duna it just can\u0027t succeed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: to clarify a bit, making course corrections in the atmosphere doesn\u0027t work well when you have Deadly Reentry installed.

Note the constant counterfiring on the RCS. That\u0027s happening because the ship is offbalance and when it tries to translate it\u0027s going to move out of alignment. That necessitates firing the ports on the opposite side.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, that also means that the force spent keeping alignment is counteracting the effort expended in translation.

Not quite in front mind you, a little off-axis such that the procedure taken should have been: Align, translate to axis, move forward.

I can\u0027t even describe to you how beautiful it is to watch.
