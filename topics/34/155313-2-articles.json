You will need to have parts that give you what I call marginal health bonuses: in stock, it is only the Cupola, but MKS has a lot such parts. Depending on the negative and positive factors and the bonus, you can stabilize your kerbals\u0027 health at some level (but never really reach 100%). This was specifically made for very long missions, big motherships and stations, which are supposed to have enough level of comfort to let astronauts recuperate there. MKS also has MediBays that can rather quickly restore (but, again, not completely, you\u0027ll still need to go home for that) the kerbals inside.

I\u0027m not a coder at all, so most of it may not be too practical. Do you think just assuming an \u0022average\u0022 of day/night being half while orbiting/landed on a planet, and additionally just taking the average distance of said planet from the sun,\u00A0would be too simplified? Essentially what I mean is just a small table of values for \u0022radiation coefficients\u0022 that just affect health at a flat, unchanging rate per day, such as: Moho orbit: -2, Moho landed -1, Eve orbit: -1.5, Eve landed: 0 (thick atmosphere), Kerbin orbit: -1.5, Kerbin landed: 0... etc. A basic framework number that you could then attach multipliers to for given situations like EVA is x5 for the duration of EVA-ing, certain altitudes or longitudes could be additional factors/divisors to tack onto that. I\u0027m just brainstorming, so if none of this is practical at all just ignore me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222951185\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022155313\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221486756645\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022141813\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022garwel\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, garwel said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn fact, you \u003Cem\u003Ecan \u003C/em\u003Erestore some of your health in-flight.

Depending on the negative and positive factors and the bonus, you can stabilize your kerbals\u0027 health at some level (but never really reach 100%). This was specifically made for very long missions, big motherships and stations, which are supposed to have enough level of comfort to let astronauts recuperate there. MKS also has MediBays that can rather quickly restore (but, again, not completely, you\u0027ll still need to go home for that) the kerbals inside.

And then a 3.75m version that would serve as more of a Hospital for the very large space stations, complete with operating theater for more extensive healing capabilities, though again only up to a finite amount.

Unfortunately have had to disable it a few times from some bugs, but it is still in beta so yeah.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nOverall it\u0027s nice. I play with TAC but wanted to use both. The thing that bugged me about the stock game was that there\u0027s really only ever one consideration: fuel economy. Any part you put on a vessel that isn\u0027t directly related to this end better have serious justification behind it, like science/landing/etc., and it just feels like all the rockets are just hollow tubes full of fuel and a seat on the end. Trying to build anything that resembles a real space station or a real logistics center in stock only is not even just cosmetic, but highly penalized.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThings like this mod and TAC-LS change that a lot, I feel. The most significant negative factor to fight the stock lunacy is the amount of free space, and of course your guys go crazy like they should if they have to\u00A0spend a year in a flying closet. There\u0027s really no conflicts with other LS as far as I know, it\u0027s just an extra other element that runs parallel to your (probably more major) LS concerns. I play on relatively low difficulty, lethality turned off and a pretty decent threshold to madness (for Kerbal Health that is, TAC I still have on hard). It\u0027s not a huge gameplay driver, but it\u0027s still just one more angle you can and should consider when designing voyages, and it can make your end-product much more rewarding when you get it right.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dlrk","CreatedById":60033,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-04T18:03:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow does this work with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s habitation?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nightside","CreatedById":150244,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-04T18:27:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222975277\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022155313\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221488626179\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022141813\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022garwel\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n7 hours ago, garwel said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDeepFreeze support is planned.
