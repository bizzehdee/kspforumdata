I know you said that not everything gets a debug line, but it looks like it does give out a debug line when it decides to use fuel. Specifically, in this chunk of code:\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E[B]foreach[/B] (Propellant pr [B]in[/B] e.propellants)\u003Cbr\u003E                                {\u003Cbr\u003E                                    [B]if[/B] (rmasses.Keys.Contains(pr.name))\u003Cbr\u003E                                    {\u003Cbr\u003E                                        rmassdry -= rmasses[pr.name];\u003Cbr\u003E                                        print([COLOR=#DD1144]\u0022Using propellant \u0022[/COLOR] \u002B pr.name \u002B [COLOR=#DD1144]\u0022(mass: \u0022[/COLOR] \u002B rmasses[pr.name] \u002B [COLOR=#DD1144]\u0022)\u0022[/COLOR]);\u003Cbr\u003E                                    }\u003Cbr\u003E                                }\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause the mass it\u0027s reporting in the line\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eprint(\u0022DeltaV available: \u0022 \u002B dV \u002B \u0022(Mass ratio: \u0022 \u002B (mass \u002B rmassdry) \u002B \u0022 / \u0022 \u002B (mass \u002B rmass) \u002B \u0022, TWR \u0022 \u002B TWR \u002B \u0022)\u0022);\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eis the correct dry mass, this implies that the fuel is never getting added, AND never getting taken away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suspect the culprit is somewhere in the block up above where it\u0027s counting up the resources.

It looks like it has debug lines commented out, so I\u0027m assuming those got looked at at some point, and that block of code is, in fact, running. However, I do notice that amt is set using \u0022Tools.GetValueDefault(r.resourceValues, \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#DD1144;\u0022\u003E\u0022amount\u0022\u003C/span\u003E, \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#009999;\u0022\u003E0.0\u003C/span\u003E)\u0022, but then in the debug line it\u0027s reported as \u0022\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#999988;\u0022\u003Er.amount\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u0022. It\u0027s possible that r.amount is just outdated, and the commented out debug code didn\u0027t get updated, but it looks highly suspect to me. Is it possible that amt is always set to the default of 0.0?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes its suppose to be 0. That part of the line helps with Null refrences if Values are not found. We are pointing at the values for different resources in the MCESettings.cfg file (all the different resource cost and tankage and all that wonderful stuff) The value is also important for the next line.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eif amt \u0026gt; 0 the ! means if not so reads like this if 0 is not greater then amt continue. Else it just loops.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen the reset should be pretty self explanatory we are getting the value for amt by checking the vessel and what it has for resources on it. And it has another if and else statement to stop any further null references that might come up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe debug code is commented out because this was checked long time ago and found to work. But Ill check it again to make sure when I have a little extra time to do some test.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Green Skull","CreatedById":103510,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-18T20:57:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo my initial description was off for which I apologise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have only one way of closing this window once opened or re-start the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1332.photobucket.com/albums/w615/greenskullinc/screenshot1_zps0df03482.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot1_zps0df03482.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1332.photobucket.com/albums/w615/greenskullinc/screenshot3_zps683f651c.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot3_zps683f651c.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1332.photobucket.com/albums/w615/greenskullinc/screenshot4_zps85154e4e.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot4_zps85154e4e.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1332.photobucket.com/albums/w615/greenskullinc/screenshot5_zpscf850aa1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot5_zpscf850aa1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did try a contract and after a lot of messing about I got a satellite into the desired orbit.
