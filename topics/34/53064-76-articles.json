Yes, that is your TWR at burnout, and what it means is that your rocket becomes very hard to steer towards the end of the first stage. I understand the reasons behind your design decisions well, I\u0027ve been there (i.e. at low tech levels) too. Suggested solution: try disengaging mechjeb after the first stage burnout, use RCS to manually arrest any tumbling, and then fly the rest of the way manually (easy, have the orbit info window open and just make sure your time to apoapsis doesn\u0027t fall under 10s, whenever it starts to fall towards that limit, pitch skywards). Don\u0027t worry if after second stage burnout your periapsis is still in the atmosphere, your RCS should be enough to correct that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: One tip for rocket design: SRBs are much more useful in RSS/RO than in the stock game. With them, you can have a rocket that is just one stage \u002B boosters. In fact, that\u0027s what my main satellite launcher (8 t to LEO) is like.

I managed to finish the tech tree as far as RPL goes at the moment and I find it pretty good so far. I havnt finished the tech tree, I just finished all the custom experiments. The experience was quite good and I like the direction this goes. I havn\u0027t had such fun with KSP in a long time as I had to play it in the RSS environment using RPL. Thank you again for making this fantastic tech tree mod!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome suggestions or more opinions what I would change. Of course, please dont feel entitled to follow any of them, I dont want to drive your progress but I still want to give you feedback.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* I guess it would be viable to decouple the experiments parts from the probe cores. That way, it is not necessary to launch an experiment if one wants to build a communication network for example. So it might be nice to have two or more types of probe cores, normal ones and radiation hardned ones (heavier). Normal probe cores simply stop working after 100 days in space or something, radiation hardened ones might survive indefinitely. The experiments them selfs are goodthough. They are diverse enough to be fun! Only the lack of instructions ingame what to do with them is a bit troublesome. The text is not always very helpful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso I experimented with SCANsat and I find the experience quite satisfying. Not for collecting science though (I only scanned Earth and the Moon) because the science return is just too small for the afford. But its still nice to do. BTW: The moons elevantion seems odd, except for some craters, the entire surface is at or above 7000m. Would be nice to rebalance the 0-level for elevation if possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would like to see the transmission of science option of the Science Jr and Goo container being removed or set to 0. These experiments are clearly designed for sample return experiments. Would make sense to not be able to transmit them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll together, the probes to launch are too light. I never needed to launch more than 5T into LEO. It would be nice if experimental equipment became heavier. Maybe for a moon rover, I would need 10T launch system.. It would be nice to have something that is really heavy and not fuel to launch into orbit. A space station does not really count as you cant do anything with it. And even if, as soon as the number of parts become reasonably high to be considered a space station, the game becomes unplayable due to lag. So I would like to see some really heavy non-station and useful things to launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI said it before and I say it again: The number of useless parts that can be replaced by procedural equivalents are too large. Especially aerodynamic parts. Also many parts that are specific to certain real space ships seem to be misplaced in the tech tree. Given the nature of the game (build your own rocket and fly it to the moon et al.), many of the specialized parts (not engines) should be hidden away somehow to make the parts list shorter and less clattered with junk. I know that some people like to replay history, but to do that, RPL seems to be the wrong concept. To replay history, a tech tree is not the appropriate tech model. Instead a linear progression is much more appropriate, with only a few options in the beginning: US tech vs. Russian tech vs. European tech. After that it should be rather linear with a few dead ends here or there. If a tech tree concept is preferred with themed tech in its branches, hisory is maybe not the best model to look at. In a tech tree approach, the nodes should focus on functionality and leave out shrapnel like warheads or parts that are clearly designed to recreate real space craft like the specific Mercury tech, Gemeni tech and Soyous tech.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome issues/bugs:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* The text for the range of antennas seems wrong.

I tried to balance it with other experimental parts of equal mass but did not succeed. I suspect the mass of small parts is not simulated correctly. Because the small probe engines do not provide enough gimbling (0.01 or so degrees, effects at least two engines), the result is a huge expense in RCS fuel. I suspect this is a bug.
