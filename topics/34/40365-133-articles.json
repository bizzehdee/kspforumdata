I\u0027ll just config-edit an otherwise-identical xenon tank into my file; how much capacity would you recommend, Fractal?

A ship containing nothing but a computer core, huge radiator, the 3.75m base nuclear reactor and upgraded generator, 500,000 Xenon, and the 2.5m plasma thruster will get approximately 8000 m/s of delta-v and 1.539m/s\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E of acceleration.

The main problem with the classical Orion drive is that the drive bombs have to be constructed and this ups the fuel cost a LOT. More recent designs use various packets of elements that are energized by particle or ion beams to make them go critical... or like the vista to compress something into generating a fusion reaction.

What does a nuclear detonation? It produces a lot of radiation(from heat to gamma) \u002B some particles that where the bomb before \u002B a decenct neutronflux. In the atmosphere, the radiation (and the neutrons) are superheating the atmosphere nerby, that causes the shockwave which do the \u0022work\u0022.\u003Cp\u003EBut in space, there is no atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat means, all radiation and neutrons and particles are going in every direction equaly. That means, even if the distance from the exploding bomb to the \u0022bumpplate\u0022 is zero (which can\u0027t be), only the half of the \u0022explosion energy\u0022 is hitting the plate. From this half, only a very tiny amount will be fast moving particles, that can actualy produce some sort of thrust. From these tiny fraction, only a tiny fraction will have the right angle to push the plate (the vast majory will be reflected without transferring kinetic energy). But the most energy of the detonation will be radiation \u002B neutron flux. What does that with the plate? It heats (and activate) it! Yeah!
