You want to balance these engines, for what exactly? They are meant to get the big boys into orbit, the 100\u002B ton crafts and more. Chances are when you put those on a craft that is barely bigger than a fighter, the engine will be way overpowered for that purpose. That is to be expected. But these engines are meant for K.Yeons parts so that you don\u0027t have to stick a ridiculous amount of them onto the craft which then can barely limp into orbit. Instead these are powerful enough to make the ride smooth. I am very happy with my 125 ton craft, powered by 4 ramjets and 4 ARIEs which has a TWR of over 3. That means the weight of the craft could probably be trippled without trouble and the ride would still be possible without much of a problem. My craft burns 2/3 of a huge amount of fuel to get into orbit and that is a fair trade off. There are enough \u0022balanced\u0022 engines to choose from.

All my grievances with engines are gone now. I didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t even dislike your ARIE concept from the last version. It only needed balancing in the resource consumption department or better thrust. That being said I love your new Turboramjets and how you incorporated that concept into them. One suggestion I would like to make, though I don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t know if it is possible to be done. The automatic mode toggling should probably be either triggered by altitude when sufficient SPA is available or by the emergence of SPA. Having it switch when the normal air runs out isn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t really a good way to go about this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile building with your parts I came to understand though why nobody has created your drop bay concept yet. Because of the top and bottom bay doors the drop cargo bay is really structurally weak. When I put two of those in succession of each other on my 100\u002B ton craft or a cargo bay and a docking port a visible crack at the top can be seen on the runway, even while using the Joint Reinforcement mod, which makes things VERY wobbly under FAR conditions. Struting isn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t really an option either because the doors need to move. So I think you should look into strengthening the connection of the drop cargo bay and the docking port as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat being said I created my finest SSTO with your parts. I present to you the Stardancer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/f7jio31.png?1\u0022 alt=\u0022f7jio31.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really love this bird. It goes into orbit like a true champ, absolutely steady with hardly any deviation in course and it is so beautifully powerful while doing so. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m kinda scared of loosing her when you update the mod again, because this is the absolute finest version of her yet. It uses your parts, B9, aviation lights and the new B9 procedural wings which look like they have been created with you mod in mind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as I am concerned your parts should be the stock mk3 parts and not the ones we got because they look like a true upgrade of the mk2 parts. I really dislike how the official mk3 parts are basically a carbon copy of an earth space shuttle. They should look a bit more unique.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat brings me to your mk2 adaptor, I don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 really ever like the look of it because the mk2 connection is not in the center. I think a craft build with that part would look a lot better with the connector centered but that might just be me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally I would like to make a request. As you can see in the picture of the Stardancer I am still using your IS-AA experimental cockpit which to me looks the best of the I cockpits. A few others have said that they prefer this cockpit so since you seem to be unwilling to support it anymore would you allow me to upload a version that works with your current version of the mod to my drop box? I would provide the necessary FAR config and all the the part files and configs. Currently it still supports your old IVA. If you want that removed I would put it on placeholder like with your other cockpits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWow that was a long post. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep it up K.Yeon, can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t wait to see what you come up with next.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S One more thing, you need to work on the placement of the Turboramjets.
