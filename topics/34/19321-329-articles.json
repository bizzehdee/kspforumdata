(always hold the angle), you can analyze them later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow on KSP you can quicksave while on the atmosphere, make several quicksaves and tag them with the situation so you can test more later if you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo guesstimate a good climb, measure how fast you are climbing, and how much speed you are losing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Epick the altitude

altitudes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow compare the speed loss with the time it takes to reach such altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo points for each \u0022shot\u0022 will be enough to draw two

cross a line speed x time, separate for horizontal and vertical speeds, remember starting vertical speed is zero and final vertical speed = altitude / time\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can do a lot with it, for instance, the point where both lines cross mean your thrust is being wasted only on atmospheric drag, the point where your speed loss is zero is the one where your thrust is being equally divided between atmospheric and gravity drags.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing the different curves for the different speeds, you can guesstimate the best climb profile for your plane, always be biased towards the fastest possible climb, you will notice that sometimes its worth to suffer a bit to get a bit higher then pick up speed from there and climb again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut again, this is a lot of work, if your design is underpowered I would seriously consider boosting it to higher altitudes or adding more engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is also empirical and HAS FLAWS (nothing is actually linear, etc, etc.), but it\u0027s a good way to understand your aircraft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: that is for gaining speed, after you are already high and want to shoot to orbit that is a whole different story, but I would recommend diving a bit to gain speed then pull up as much as you can to get as big arch as you can.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan
