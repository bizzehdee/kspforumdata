I get from your explanation that it\u0027s unlikely that this method would offer much benefit over launching to a circular orbit and then kicking out, though, with that being said, the reason I originally landed on this method is because this will be the first satellite in my RT2 constellation, so there would be a benefit in my specific case as it will save me from having to wait in orbit for my AN/DN to occur over a ground station. With that in mind, the next question I have is how much less efficient would it be for me to launch with a much steeper ascent angle, essentially staying sub-orbital and skipping the circularization burn until I reach apogee at GEO height, or would it even be possible to do this and have the apogee be near the equator?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-23T07:53:58Z\u0022 title=\u002205/23/2014 07:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 23, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by SpacedInvader\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Phredward","CreatedById":100166,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-23T13:18:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NathanKell\u0022 data-cite=\u0022NathanKell\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EPhredward: KSP does not actually support axial tilt.

I had originally thought the maps I had for the moons of Jupiter were going to be pretty decent already, only to find out that what I thought were fairly minor areas of blurring are pretty obvious in game. I\u0027m currently (and slowly) working on manually touching up the images to get rid of the blurry areas, but I\u0027d expect that process to take somewhere between 2 and 4 weeks based on my current schedule. The question I have for all of you is this, based on the following gallery, would you rather have them now with all their blurriness, or are the current KSP moons a good enough stand in for the next few weeks and you\u0027d rather have them when they are done?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/61XCx\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
