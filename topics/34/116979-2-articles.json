What would you expect to happen if, for example, you set it to take screenshots every game minute, and then you are in the middle of a timewarp? Would you want it to take the screenshot of the warp, ignore it?\n\u003E Second, sub-second intervals. Why not just run FRAPS or OBS? How sub-second would you like? \n\u003E \n\u003E The disk space can be an issue for some people if they aren\u0027t aware of it.\n\u003E \n\u003E LGG\n\nI\u0027d expect the game to take a screenshot at, or as close to, every specified interval. I don\u0027t think taking a screenshot would interfere with timewarp at all, only the other way around, in that maybe the requested intervals can not be met. If so, fine, use the closest available. Optimally, include an option to reduce the time warp factor as much as needed to get to the desired granularity.\n\nIdeally the minimal interval between screenshots would be one frame, and the option to use the new-ish high-res screenshots. A screen recorder is not always the best option, or sometimes not an option at all.\n\nIf I specify one screenshot per frame, I\u0027m prepared and willing, and fully expect, to not have fluid 120 FPS in game, but have one screenshot for every single frame that has been rendered. I may want to up my resolution to some ridiculous value, so I can post-process the single-frame images later, for the purpose of creating animations, and FRAPS wouldn\u0027t cut it for that.\n\nCall it a unique selling point of your plugin ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-12T13:30:41Z\u0022 title=\u002208/12/2015 01:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Corax**\n  \nKilling the smiley icon...
