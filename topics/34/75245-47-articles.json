As for the the :FOR\u0027s, perhaps I should clarify what I mean by proper association. Obviously it will work fine if you call it RemoteTech, you could have a different pass name on every config if you wanted. That doesn\u0027t fit with the naming conventions defined by MM though. That means that someone has to actually go look at your configs to find out some are running in first and some are running in RemoteTech, neither of which are the expected RemoteTech2 pass (to match the dll and folder name).
