Managed to make it happen using just a Mk1 Command Capsule. I could record a video of this occurring because it happens every time under the criteria I mentioned.\n\nForgot to mention, I do have MechJeb2 and Warp Plugin, I did double-check and saw there was an issue with PR and MJ2, however, I have both the Warp Plugin and MJ2 updated to their latest versions, so there shouldn\u0027t be a mod conflict there. So far every launch from orbit has resulted in subluminal speeds, so my game hasn\u0027t crashed and thus no crash log. The only other potential conflict I can imagine is Kopernicus (Used to have Kerbol Star System installed, however I figured out KSS was causing my 45 minute load times, so I went back to just having the stock system).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-05-22T01:19:23Z\u0022 title=\u002205/22/2017 01:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMay 22, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by chaoseclipse01**\n  \nDerpy Typos"},{"CreatedByName":"chaoseclipse01","CreatedById":176491,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-22T01:53:32Z","Content":"[@MarkusA380](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/45759-markusa380/) [@Drew Kerman](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/103177-drew-kerman/)\n\nAlright, I made a video of my bug happening.

I\u0027ll try to get it to crash later, but for now here\u0027s my KSP.log file.\n\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxPXtptMuIe2aWFRZ0xUUjNqb0E/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxPXtptMuIe2aWFRZ0xUUjNqb0E/view?usp=sharing)\n\nIt\u0027s a little on the large size at 5MB.\n\nEdit:\n\nI still can\u0027t get the game to crash so I can generate a crash log, but while messing around I think I may have come up with a temporary solution to prevent the bug from happening until it can be properly fixed.\n\nUnder the Rotation menu only, once a reference body has been selected, disable or \u0022Grey out\u0022 the Activate/Deactivate button so that the only way to stop PR from working would be to set the reference body to \u0022None,\u0022 which re-enables the Activate/Deactivate button, seeing how the bug doesn\u0027t happen once the reference body is set back to none. This way it prevents people from setting up the condition to cause the bug to happen in the first place.\n\nEdit: Something else I noticed while watching the video I made, under the condition when the bug happens, I notice all the parts on the craft get shoved into the command module. Does this mod calculate and modify the rotation and location of all the parts of a craft rather than just the command module only?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-05-23T11:35:31Z\u0022 title=\u002205/23/2017 11:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMay 23, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by chaoseclipse01**"},{"CreatedByName":"Drew Kerman","CreatedById":103177,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-24T15:41:31Z","Content":"I thought I noticed this earlier but I didn\u0027t really pay attention until now - asteroids are definitely no longer being spun up when I visit them for the first time from the Tracking Station\n\nOh, right - I noticed this after the 1.8.3 update but then saw 1.8.4 was out so waited until I was able to snag that before reporting the issue then forgot to check afterwards\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-05-24T15:43:28Z\u0022 title=\u002205/24/2017 03:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMay 24, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Drew Kerman**"},{"CreatedByName":"MarkusA380","CreatedById":45759,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-24T19:18:40Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 4 hours ago, Drew Kerman said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I thought I noticed this earlier but I didn\u0027t really pay attention until now - asteroids are definitely no longer being spun up when I visit them for the first time from the Tracking Station\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Oh, right - I noticed this after the 1.8.3 update but then saw 1.8.4 was out so waited until I was able to snag that before reporting the issue then forgot to check afterwards\n\u003E \n\nSo does it still happen or not?
