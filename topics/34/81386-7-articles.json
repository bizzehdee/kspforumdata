The seemingly very high ISP on them shouldn\u0027t be compared directly to LFO engine ISP since well, they don\u0027t use LFO! Broadly speaking you should end up with roughly the same dV in a vacuum with using a comparable sized engine and tank combination, but the MP combination will almost always be lower mass. In atmosphere the LFO will always win out. The exception to these \u0022rules\u0022 is the aerospike since that has no gimbal, lower vacuum ISP and higher atmospheric ISP. I\u0027ll be going over all of these stats and may end up changing them completely in the next update, mainly thinking about lowering the mass of the engines and decreasing the ISP to try and get the overall vehicle capability to be roughly the same. Right now you can get away with a smaller launch vehicle for MP vessels due to the overall lower mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL;DR: Lower TWR, roughly the same dV capability in vacuum, worse in atmosphere, lower mass, and I might change all that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SuccessPastaTime","CreatedById":110002,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-14T18:43:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETruly can\u0027t wait for the probe cores and panel.

The lengthwise attachment is great for building stuff, but it does make easy placement of balanced skycranes a tad harder. There\u0027s a bug with attachment nodes and MODEL{} (since the two frames share a texture) that prevents me from putting nodes in the middle that face up and down (in the SPH).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Boomerang\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Boomerang\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe new rover bodies look great!\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!
