I never really thought about it earlier but sounds like a better way than Apollo mostly because of budgetary constraints. It would have been cheaper. Of course technical difficulties is another case. I guess the no.1 thing caused the USAF most of the headache was re-entering a glider from lunar orbit. I\u0027ve never even tried that in the game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wasmic","CreatedById":64885,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-25T19:36:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Cdodders\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Cdodders\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe Saturn V is a direct descendant of the V-2\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know that the Saturn I and IB first stages used clustered tanks, which were directly descended from the V2.

For example it\u0027s far from clear that solid-boosted hydrolox is all that great of a thing, let alone that a lifting body RV is useful (if you don\u0027t need crossrange, wings are worth less than nothing). SLS would have been better than STS, but then again almost anything would have been.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile solid-boosted hydrolox is cheaper than kerolox-boosted hydrolox (that\u0027s why NASA scaled back from liquid to solid boosters for STS), what\u0027s expensive here is the hydrolox part. A pure kerolox LV is actually cheaper, IIRC, and certainly less dangerous for crewed missions. Solids and crew are a bad mix.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
