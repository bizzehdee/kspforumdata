Just updated to 1.3, since I didn\u0027t realize the version on CKAN was outdated, and for the most part it seems to be working just fine. So thank you for writing this mod! Makes planning a heck of a lot easier.\u003Cp\u003EOnly thing I\u0027ve noticed is that 1.3 seems to massively overestimate the amount of electricity probe cores use; I\u0027m playing with the RO/RP-0 set of mods, though, so I\u0027m not sure if that\u0027s playing into it. I have a OKTO2 on one of my satellites, which is stated to consume 3.6EC/hour. Fusebox 1.2 correctly calculated that as 0.001EC/second, but 1.3 thinks that it consumes 0.05EC/second. As a result, it predicts the satellite batteries draining within a half hour, when in reality the batteries are charging just fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there something I\u0027m missing? I very much prefer overstating consumption rate instead of understating (which 1.2 did), but perfect accuracy would be ideal...\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETACLS takes a flat rate 0.04, or at least it used to.
