This could play havoc with tanks that don\u0027t allow collision for example, so when you extend the piston it would break the tank as something would be pushing the collider from the inside, which would be the end effector of the piston thats moving. Make sense? ideally you are trying to avoid colliding ....colliders.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I said industrial, I mean something that both looks and acts like it was designed to push and pull extremely heavy objects, and in a variety of shapes and sizes.
