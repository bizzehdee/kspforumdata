So I looked it up, and i saw to try and do it completely through winrar or 7-zip, both of those didn\u0027t work, what happened from that was,the crew and the engine was fine, but the wheels seemed to lock up and have like a little graphical glitch. All stock parts from squad worked fine. I deleted the programmed B9 folder in atm and had it make a new one when i started up the game, i did not alter the mod files in any way, i just merged the two gamedata folders.
