Fire and Forget is definately something i would implement the next time i add something to the missile systems. The other suggestions you had build upon the remote control system, i think that whole system is poorly understood and also a bit complicated to operate effectively. Adding those features would complicate it even more so im thinking about ways to make the control easier. \u003Cp\u003EBut as you know, lately i have been focusing on adding features you can use to take apart and re-assemble vessels in flight using the robotic arms and the decouple/weld functions on the eva suit.

I can kind-of setup missile defense scenarios but its clunky (remote vessel explodes \u0026gt; 6km) when you activate the remote link.

Every time I try to put one of the tiny colored Lazor parts on a rover or an airplane (that is the little part, not the big circular part), when I launch, the Lazor instantly explodes :/ The explosion doesn\u0027t seem to damage anything, it just self-destructs D: Am I doing something wrong? is there a special way to be using those parts? The problem is I don\u0027t want to use either of the Lazor System parts because they don\u0027t go with my vehicles D: also they seem to be super heavy for some reason.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you in advance!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...
