At the bottom of the speed tape is a ground speed readout. This is the horizontal component of the surface speed. Below that is a mach readout (above a minimum value, in atmosphere only). To the right of the speed tape, and dominating the display, is the pitch ladder. It roughly replicates the navball. The wide, unlabeled line is the horizon, short lines are 5 degree increments, and medium lines are 10 degree increments. Dashed lines are negative pitch, solid lines are positive. At the top of the pitch ladder is a bank indicator. The top of the arc is vertical, if the diamond is at 3 o\u0027clock, you are rolled 90 degrees right, etc. In the center of the pitch ladder is the \u0022W\u0022 which represents the direction the nose is pointing. The prograde/retrograde marker will also be displayed indicating the actual direction of movement. To the left of the \u0022W\u0022 is a digital readout of speed, and to the right is a readout of altitude above the vertical speed in m/s. At the bottom of the display is a compass, displaying large lines as 10s of degrees, and small lines as 5 degrees. To the right of the pitch ladder is the altimeter. It displays your MSL altitude (above sea level), initially in hundreds of meters, then thousands of meters. Below this is a radar altitude, which displays actual height above terrain. To the far right of the display is a throttle gauge (intended for IVA use), and a thrust to weight indicator.
