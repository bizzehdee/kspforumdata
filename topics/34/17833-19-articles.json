Resource units and weights of resources are calculated and shown with the Build Engineer overlay in 1.0 already, so all the code is there. The only reason I\u0027ve not structured it into a nice list is space, and figuring out a position for it that is out of the way. There\u0027s just so much info that could be displayed that the hard part isn\u0027t getting it, but finding a place to put it. If it will require another window then it will be a no, if it requires another button then a no again.
