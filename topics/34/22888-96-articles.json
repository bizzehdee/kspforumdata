Saturn V is something I literally grew up admiring, a mighty rocket that put man on the Moon. A Titan IIIM missing a booster segment is not a big deal. What\u0027s supposed to be Saturn V looking more like a slimmed-down Saturn C-3 is not, because it\u0027s not doing this amazing vehicle justice. I can have this dinky thing as Saturn III, sure, but for a proper Saturn V, the S-IC and S-II should be 6.25m. Even if only because we have nearly identical parts in 5m already, in NovaPunch. F-1 looks properly scaled, everything else is literally the exact same stuff we already have in NP, and I see no point in making it 5m, other than perhaps making the Saturn C-3 (which would require the original S-IV anyway).\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen start your own thread some where else and stop trashing this thread with your annoying whining.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Virtualgenius","CreatedById":67644,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-07T08:34:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI flew the Saturn 5 and its really good MJ took it all the way to the Mun and into a 60km orbit with no issues everything staged correctly removed the Lem with no problems\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"XkaOnslaught","CreatedById":72043,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-07T08:41:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Esuch butthurt. very realism. wowe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrizzank has his own idea and design concept for his Saturn 5.
