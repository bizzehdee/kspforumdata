Try the low res version and make sure you launch KSP via the 32bit (x86) launcher, which is the default path on Steam, if you have not bothered making a copy of the \u003Cstrong\u003Estock\u003C/strong\u003E install and put your mods into the copy, which I \u003Cstrong\u003Ehighly\u003C/strong\u003E recommend. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are using the Steam paths and have upgraded the game with mods still in there, I would also recommend wiping the game folder clean and installing afresh.
