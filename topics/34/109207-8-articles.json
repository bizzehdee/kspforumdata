I\u0027m just a bit concerned about that being over-powered (yielding too much science).\n\u003E \n\nIn the part module of the STOCK orbital surveyor, \u0022SciBonus\u0022 is set to 10. IIRC you get 10 base science for scanning a body, multiplied by the \u0022low orbit\u0022 multiplier value for that body (a table can be found [here](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Science)).\n\nOSP works the same, you get the \u0022SciBonus\u0022 base science multiplied by the \u0022low orbit\u0022 multiplier for a 100% scan of a planet. \u0022SciBonus\u0022 is a value in the part module contained in the OrbitalSurveyPlus.cfg file, under the \u0022Patches\u0022 folder in the mod directory. This value is by default 20, which is double the amount of science you get from the stock surveyor. My original line of thought was that it\u0027s much more of a pain in the butt to get 100% scans with OSP, so you should get more science. Now that I think about it (and now that you\u0027ve brought it up), I might revert that default value in the next patch, as double does seem a bit much even though it\u0027s a bit more work compared with stock. It\u0027s easy to tweak in your install though, just grab the OrbitalSurveyPlus.cfg file and change the \u0022SciBonus = 20\u0022 entry to \u0022SciBonus = 10\u0022. You can also tweak the scan radius there if it\u0027s not to your liking (lots of players like it smaller for more realism).\n\n**TL:DR** - Scanning a planet 100% gives you double what you\u0027d get scanning a planet in stock, but it\u0027s tweakable.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-06-27T09:23:50Z\u0022 title=\u002206/27/2017 09:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJune 27, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Wheffle**"},{"CreatedByName":"ble210","CreatedById":167285,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-27T18:09:10Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 8 hours ago, Wheffle said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E In the part module of the STOCK orbital surveyor, \u0022SciBonus\u0022 is set to 10.
