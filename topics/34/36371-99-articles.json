Either play using the 32-bit executable (sorry, this does limit your memory a lot), play using Linux 64-bit (which is stable), or eliminate the check from the source code and recompile (understanding that this is an at-your-own-risk option, because e-dog does not support Windows 64-bit).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the KSP crashes: there is a good chance you botched some mod installation somewhere. Always make sure you are extracting the correct folder (usually either the top level, or the level below GameData), and just try deleting mods until it works. Also, some mods like Universal Storage have non-standard installation instructions: follow the provided instructions to the letter. If you wind up deleting everything down to the Squad and NASAmission folders, well, it\u0027s time to reinstall KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Though, looking at things, I\u0027m not 100% sure e-dog did disable Procedural Fairings for 64-bit.
