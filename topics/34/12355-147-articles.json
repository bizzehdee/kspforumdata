They\u0027ve spent more time trying to make the parts \u0022fun\u0022 and \u0022quirky\u0022 in the name and description and no where near enough time making them comprehensible enough for someone to be able to sit down with the game and have fun building on day 1 (unless they only planned on people playing the game who are also NASA engineers). The Wiki is not helpful often in this respect either. OSS games can sometimes be plagued with this issue, but more often than not they\u0027re documented even better than this one is it seems (though my experience with OSS games is fairly limited, my experience with OSS software is rather vast, so this may be an issue of quantitative vs. qualitative data, but still, I bought the game, I expect thorough documentation). This is a digression though, and has very little to do with this MOD.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"eliteprodigy","CreatedById":91545,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-03T22:08:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sarbian\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sarbian\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E@eliteprodigy the kind of problem you have most likely come from the fact that MJ go from 0 to full throttle instantly, while a human pilot does it progressively. \u003Cp\u003EIn the \u0022Utility\u0022 windows you ll find a \u0022Smooth throttle\u0022 settings that may help you.

MJ goes Full Throttle all the way through Stage 1 (I can\u0027t get past that because it separates the top part of the module every single time MJ flies, so I\u0027m not sure what it will do in stage 2). HOWEVER: I\u0027ve managed to successfully pull off all 3 stages of the rocket (a couple times) without MJ turned on using full throttle all the way through the first stage (I had to take the MJ part off though, because I catch on fire when it is on, again this doesn\u0027t make sense).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-03T22:11:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEdit : you posted at the same time as me \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince MJ wait a bit after an engine stop and before staging it can increase the stress on part.
