It does not matter how much memory you have in your computer, or how fancy the graphics card is. KSP is stuck in the 32-bit past on Windows and OSX, due to the Unity game engine being stuck in the 32-bit past. That limits you to 4Gb of address space on OSX, and less on Windows. Address space is essentially the total virtual memory which can be accessed by the process, and doesn\u0027t have a 1:1 or even a static relationship with physical RAM. If you set KSP to use half-res textures, or use texture reduction packs, you may well solve the problem. This is not a flaw with B9, it\u0027s a general flaw which can hit with any combination of mods which cause KSP to hit the memory limit.
