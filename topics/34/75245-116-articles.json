I\u0027m having trouble with this mod. When I use the Flight Computer to set up a maneuver node burn on the far side of Kerbin, it executes on time, but the node marker drifts at the very end of the burn, causing the probe to try to reorient itself to face the marker WHILE burning, which of course sends it into an irrecoverable spin until it runs out of fuel. Why is the flight computer not smart enough to either cut the engines while reorienting OR just cut the engines when the node goes green and is \u0022close enough\u0022?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso very suspicious is the fact that when the flight computer is doing a burn, the whole probe wobbles in a tight circle as it tries to keep pointing at the node.

So I\u0027ll have to bring the satellite to a SMA between 109,999 and 110,001). Then I leave the craft, and use HyperEdit to change the SMA to EXACTLY 110,000.

Warped to KAC maneuver node alarm. Switched to Sat two. Cleared and deleted alarm, opened flight computer. No maneuver node present.
