It won\u0027t let me repeat an experiment even though the previous attempt was never turned in for the science reward. I was attempting the high orbit experiments with the cube, but forgot to put any means of getting the probe back on the ground into the design, so once I ran the sample experiment and realized that I needed to bring the thing back to the surface to get any benefit, I reverted, redesigned, and relaunched. Unfortunately, when I got the probe back in position and ran the experiments, none of them reported any science reward, including things like the thermometer and gravimeter, even though I\u0027d turned none of them in for the science reward on the previous attempt. Some searching didn\u0027t seem to return any discussion about this as of yet, so I\u0027m wondering if there is a way to reset the experiments so that failed attempts do not mean you\u0027re out of luck...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStrange set of circumstances there.
