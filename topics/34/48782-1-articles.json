Here is how his tree looks like:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.mumech.com/uploads/TreeLoader_Yargnit.png\u0022 alt=\u0022TreeLoader_Yargnit.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Yargnit\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Yargnit\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis tree is a bit of a cross between a realistic space program and conventional KSP. While you do start out in a manned pod, you have access to both probes and planes much earlier than in the stock tree. While the different paths do maintain some degree of interconnectivity, it is done in a way that follows logical technology advancement, and allows greater individual choice on tech roots than the stock tree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall progression requires a moderate amount more science than the version of R\u0026amp;D that went live, and is just slightly above the higher version that was in testing for some time. My tree was designed in an attempt to eliminate some of the silliness of the stock tree, such as the 3 mission full tree unlock, and the ability to hop out sample the ground and progress a ton, without causing a huge jump in difficulty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe biggest changes you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll notice early on are the requirement use SRB\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s at first for heavier lifting, and that all early science must be returned to Kerbin. Larger liquid engines and transmission antenna come later, while fuel lines, docking, and wheels are actually slightly sooner. The order you receive the science instruments has been adjusted as well to delay the huge overload you receive with the Science Bay, and solar panels also come significantly later due to how game changing they are.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can try out this tree by selecting \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201C\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153KSP-TV\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 Yargnit\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s Tree\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 from the drop down menu when starting a new campaign mode game with R4m0n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s TreeLoader mod installed.
