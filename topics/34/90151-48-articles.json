The CFG documentation says altering scale under MODEL affects the nodes but not the model itself, but i\u0027ve found quite the opposite. Also, there\u0027s a bug somewhere which causes rescaled root parts to reset its size on a reload/revert. I was trying to make a RO config for StationPartsExpansion and i\u0027ve had the same problem, the solution i\u0027ve found is this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E%RSSROConfig = True\u003Cbr\u003E!mesh = DELETE\u003Cbr\u003E@MODEL\u003Cbr\u003E{\u003Cbr\u003E   @scale = 1.6, 1.6, 1.6\u003Cbr\u003E}\u003Cbr\u003E@rescaleFactor = 1.0\u003Cbr\u003E@scale = 1.0\u003Cbr\u003E@node_stack_top = 0.0, 1.16717376, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1\u003Cbr\u003E@node_stack_bottom = 0.0, -1.16245408, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1\u003Cbr\u003E@node_attach = 0.0, 0.0, -0.54553424, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve rescaled the model and manually repositioned the nodes, simply multiplying them by 1.6.
