Early on I found getting science a bit tricky, and was snagging bits round Kerbin biomes a bit. Since then it\u0027s been a mixed bag. A Mun science station brought a good few thousand and felt a bit overpowered, and then a mission to a heavily modified Jool system got around 4500 Science from orbiting its seven moons and landing on two of them. (I landed on the others as well, but forgot the antennae on my vacuum landers!) That 4500 felt like a lot, but then I realised I need another 6000 to complete the tree, so considering the complexity of the mission - gravicapture at Jool, transferring between moons at different inclinations round Jool while dealing with a ship in polar orbits round the moons, multiple landings on bodies I\u0027ve never before visited - maybe it wasn\u0027t unreasonable. Likewise my Mun station felt like it was giving tons of science easily, but then I did make multiple launches from Kerbin, multiple Mun landings, and tons of orbital rendezvous and docking, so again maybe the science was deserved after all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, I\u0027m regarding finishing the tech tree not as the end but as the beginning.
