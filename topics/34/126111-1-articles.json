I thought about it, I\u0027d love to handle it. However, having thought it through, I made a conscious decision not to, and that decision is unlikely to change.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nFirst things first: \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E is a very big, complex mod. Go look at its \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/CYBUTEK/KerbalEngineer\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EGitHub repository\u003C/a\u003E sometime... then go compare it to \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/KSPSnark/BetterBurnTime\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Emy own mod\u003C/a\u003E, which lives in a teeny-tiny fraction of the amount of code and has no UI at all. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E is at least 10 times the size of my mod, it\u0027s a massive tour de force. Not gonna try to compete with that. I have not the slightest intention of trying to solve the problems that \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E does. It\u0027s already been there and done that, no need to reinvent the wheel. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso: The staging problem is non-trivial. It\u0027s a massive jump in complexity. What you have in your head is undoubtedly the simple case of \u0022I have one engine below one tank, and then a decoupler above that, and then another engine with another tank.\u0022 \u003Cem\u003EThat\u003C/em\u003E would be simple to code. But KSP allows building rockets in all kinds of ways, and by the time you add fuel flow paths through ducts and so on and so forth, it becomes quite complex.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSolving that one problem is something I could do. However, not only has \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E already solved it, but I would spend considerably more time on it that on the entire rest of the mod put together. It would be a lot of effort expended to handle one particular scenario... and I have other mods I\u0027d rather write in the meantime. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nPlus, there\u0027s a philosophical issue here: Once you start introducing staging and such, it starts to get into the realm of uncertainty that a mod \u003Cem\u003Ecan\u0027t\u003C/em\u003E resolve without UI to get input from the player. For example, suppose there are some drop tanks... do you know \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ewhen\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E the player intends to drop them? It won\u0027t necessarily be right when they run out of fuel. Maybe the player wants to tote those empty tanks to Mun orbit to fill them up before heading off to Eeloo.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nOne way to solve that problem is to go the route of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E, which has not only a lot of logic under the hood, but also tons of UI. The player can make lots of decisions and tell the mod what to do.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nHowever, I don\u0027t want to do that. I like (and therefore want to write) mods that have the bare minimum of UI-- none, if possible. I\u0027ve deliberately designed this mod so that it doesn\u0027t require any interaction at all: you just install it and it silently and automatically makes your game experience better. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E That does mean that any decision point that would require player input is going to be an issue.
