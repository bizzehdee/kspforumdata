Collect rear science from Water Landed and I cannot get it to register that I have collected science data.\n\nOriginally it was three peace: collect laser data, Hydromomenter (both DMagicSci mod) and Magnetometer. On that mission I was able to collect first two but the magnetometer would not collect. The one difference with that experiment was that it was already completed, which is strange in the first place, since mod was smart enough not to include completed experiments up until that point. I eventually completed that mission from the ALT\u002BF12 console, but mission came back, but only had magnetometer scan. I assume that is because i have completed all experiments (including the magnetometer one), but the magnetometer one does not get registered as completed. So what is going on?\n\n**Update:** After some digging, I found what the issue is: it is does not actually looks like the problem is this mod, but some other mod (probobly community science.) Magnetometer is registered as one name,  but when the game is saved completed science for this experiment gets recorded as another, so contract parser thinks that magnetometer experiment is not complete. I worked around this by adding completed experiment with correct name to my save file.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-09-04T13:47:13Z\u0022 title=\u002209/04/2017 01:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 4, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Senaurus**\n  \nFound a work around"},{"CreatedByName":"elite72","CreatedById":40960,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-04T11:10:16Z","Content":"Hello all!  \n\nI have the mode [1.3.x] Contract Pack: Field Research [v1.2.1] [2017-06-04].  \n\nAnd I can get such a contract (see screenshot).\n\n[Screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/SjZTA)  \n\nQuestion - how can you create a situation on the water \u0022landed\u0022?  \n\nWhen I take this contract, I can not get the right situation.\n\nP.S.

To add missing biomes (e.g. flagpole, tracking station dishes, R\u0026D sub-buildings etc.) would require a code change and the CC DLL to be re-compiled. That would probably be up to [@nightingale](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/119307-nightingale/)\n\nEdit: If you have the coding skills it could also be done by writing a [CC extension](https://github.com/jrossignol/ContractConfigurator/wiki/Extending) and then modifying contracts to use that.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-11-02T17:37:46Z\u0022 title=\u002211/02/2017 05:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 2, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Aelfhe1m**"},{"CreatedByName":"Thygrrr","CreatedById":170612,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-04T17:37:53Z","Content":"I\u0027m seeing a bug with this, sadly nothing seems to show up in the console about it:\n\nField Research contracts, if Offered, are sometimes oscillating every second between visible and not visible (probably because of meeting and then unmeeting requirements somehow).
