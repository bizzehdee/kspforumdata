Basically, they go from | I | (I is the main rocket) to \\I/. They often hit the engine down there, and blow it up. I did use tiny SRB\u0027s to either blow the KW boosters to the side, or to have them keep going up as they move away. It\u0027s a cool method to fix the \u0022SRB\u0027s want to kill me\u0022 problem (in fact, I think nasa uses something like that, could be mistaken), but often times, it sends my main rocket spinning (mech jeb recovers, but is still problem). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve switched over to using Novapunch as my main parts, and using KW for engines and Payload Fairings (nice and smooth shape \u0026lt;3).

It\u0027s interesting to note that KW\u0027s small 2 meter fuel tank has a lower fuel per weight ratio than Novapunch\u0027s version.
