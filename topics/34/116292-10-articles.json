How to create a new plume?\n\nIt depends on what you want to do, it\u0027s something of an art, combining all the properties into something that looks good, but once you get the hang of it, it\u0027s not too hard. Basically, this is one of the \u0022pre-fabbed\u0022 realplumes:\n\n[https://github.com/KSP-RO/RealPlume/blob/master/GameData/RealPlume/000_Generic_Plumes/Kerolox-Lower-F1.cfg](https://github.com/KSP-RO/RealPlume/blob/master/GameData/RealPlume/000_Generic_Plumes/Kerolox-Lower-F1.cfg)\n\nIn that config are all the parameters you would need to adjust, attach it to an engine, go in-game and tinker with it using the same smokescreen tool. Once you get it how you like it, copy the parameters back to the config file, and you can attach it to any other engine you want, as long as you renamed some stuff.\n\nCouple things to be careful of, avoid using offset, it doesn\u0027t play nice with plume resizing like we do with the PLUME node, and be careful setting the speed too high, it can space out the particles too much when you get small. Also, strongly prefer using the floatcurves:\n\n logGrow\n\n {\n\n density = 1.0 2\n\n density = 0.1 2\n\n density = 0.0 2\n\n }\n\n[\\code]\n\nOver the \u0022variables\u0022 to specify behavior, it plays nicer later on. Really though, if you want to make some, the only way to figure it out is to go in-game and start tinkering, see what works, what doesn\u0027t, and you\u0027re halfway there!\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I did but still, you guys can work without me!

If you want, hop onto IRC, I\u0027m generally in a few of the major KSP channels in irc.esper.net, #RO, #ckan, #kspmodders, #rp0, etc. Send me a PM and I\u0027ll walk you through the process, it\u0027s really quite easy once you get the hang of it.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E If someone could make a Real Plume configs for CMES (Chaka Monkey Exploration Systems), I would be sincerely grateful.
