Each one is built around a probe core that is facing skyward. When the vessel is spawned, it tries to orient it with the core facing forward and it ends up sideways.\n\u003E I copied the .craft files to a sandbox save and edited them to have default forward facing cores. They spawn just fine now. I had to edit the .craft files afterwards to set guard mode to True so that they actually fight you.\n\u003E \n\u003E Ended up making custom replacements for each craft in the contract pack and have been having a good time.\n\u003E \n\u003E Might try adding more contracts soon.\n\nCould you share the craft files with the rest of us for the time being? I\u0027ve got BDArmory sitting in my GameData folder and can\u0027t do anything with it."},{"CreatedByName":"Volwen","CreatedById":78186,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T04:52:57Z","Content":"I\u0027ll see if I still have the edited originals.

Its about 5 missions aside from the intro. Missions start small and ease you into the content. Going to experiment and see if setting up dogfights and ksc defense based missions would be possible. I think I\u0027ll release it once its 10-15 missions which should be tonight. I still need to either modify the research trees to make aviation and weaponry more accessible (bdarmory is all on one tier 4(?) unlock by default) similar to what Odin\\_Spain did, or have missions unlock additional parts using the experimental part behavior. I also need to uninstall mechjeb and re-save the .craft files so that it doesn\u0027t cause issues for non-mechjeb users.\n\nScenarios could be set up in the same way but you would be forced to use the vehicle the scenario is set up with.
