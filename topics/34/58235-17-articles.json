This just allows you to change tanks, it doesn\u0027t add other resources like RF. I believe that even in RF the ratio depends on the fuel/oxidizer combo used, the engine pack used and maybe even the engine used.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!

Based on that, I\u0027m thinking that using the resource tank sizes to determine ratio may work for my purposes. For example, the LF and Ox tank capacities could be 45/55%, respectively or not. So If I did a calc against the 2 selected resources in the part, I could determine the ratio expected. I\u0027m thinking this would serve the purpose, as it would assure a consistent transfer, based on the source tank ratios. I would then not need to concern myself with the engines, as it would be the responsibility of the ship designer to have the ratios expected of the engine. I\u0027m not so much concerned with the consumption rate as the tank to tank ratios.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis also negates any need to \u0022manage\u0022 the ratios, as they are defined within the part...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-20T01:46:08Z\u0022 title=\u002204/20/2015 01:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Papa_Joe\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-20T05:42:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, it would make sense to, given a destination part, pull in the ratio the destination part has.
