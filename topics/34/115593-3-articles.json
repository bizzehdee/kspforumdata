Is there a complimentary mod that I need to install as well?\n\nThere are no dependencies for this mod. The parts are all inside the \u0022ShadowWorks\u0022 folder which should be in the GameData folder. Your path should be \u0022GameData/ShadowWorks\u0022.\n\nWhen you downloaded the mod it should have unzipped into a folder named \u0022ShadowWorks\\_Stockalike\\_SLS\\_1\\_1\u0022. Inside that folder should be 2 folders and 3 text files. The folders are \u0022GameData\u0022 and \u0022Ships\u0022. To install the parts correctly you need to copy the ShadowWorks folder located in \u0022ShadowWorks\\_Stockalike\\_SLS\\_1\\_1/GameData\u0022 to your KSP GameData folder. If you are in sandbox mode the parts should all appear. If you are just starting a career game, or don\u0027t have all of the tech nodes unlocked either all or some of the parts will not be available until you unlock the tech nodes in which they reside.\n\nSo, for the mod to be installed correctly the path to the ShadowWorks folder must look like one of the following:\n\n\u0022KSP\\_win/GameData/ShadowWorks\u0022\n\n\u0022KSP\\_osx/GameData/ShadowWorks\u0022\n\n\u0022KSP\\_lin/GameData/ShadowWorks\u0022\n\nI hope this helps, but let me know if you are still having issues."},{"CreatedByName":"peekingpenguins","CreatedById":147437,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T20:49:52Z","Content":"I double and triple checked the installation path.
