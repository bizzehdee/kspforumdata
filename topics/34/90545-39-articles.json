I\u0027m giving the 0.625m SRBs a more stock-alike mass ratio.

Some differences are from practicality, since the textures are laid out differently, depending on each mod\u0027s needs. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t really separate out the textures like that, no. The texture mapping is very specific to each mesh, and the color switching is done via mesh switching, not texture switching, since the colors are packed into the same texture files. This is a lot more memory efficient. I\u0027ve put a lot of work into making sure the memory use is low and texture data doesn\u0027t get duplicated much. This means the texture image files are very tightly woven into how each part works, especially since some of the tanks have physical details that switch out with the colors, such as rims, pipes, ridges, or recessed grooves. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo do what you\u0027re suggesting, I\u0027d have to have a single mesh for each part, and dozens of textures, which is the opposite of what I did. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be a great idea, just that it would be more memory intensive and require a completely different design philosophy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL;DR: No, I can\u0027t separate the textures, because I targeted efficiency and internal flexibility over file-based flexibility.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-13T14:25:32Z\u0022 title=\u002211/13/2015 02:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by NecroBones\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thourion","CreatedById":47430,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-13T17:41:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh well no worries.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn other news, if anyone wants some nice black or white fairings to go along grab \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/138581-KSA-Better-Fairings\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKSA Better Fairings\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESweet black combo with them and one of your tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s1296.photobucket.com/user/Photonion/media/KSP/Rockets1/screenshot8_zpswwy1tofk.png.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1296.photobucket.com/albums/ag18/Photonion/KSP/Rockets1/th_screenshot8_zpswwy1tofk.png\u0022 alt=\u0022th_screenshot8_zpswwy1tofk.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NecroBones","CreatedById":105424,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-13T18:45:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Thourion\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Thourion\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAh well no worries.\u003Cp\u003EIn other news, if anyone wants some nice black or white fairings to go along grab \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/138581-KSA-Better-Fairings\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKSA Better Fairings\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESweet black combo with them and one of your tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s1296.photobucket.com/user/Photonion/media/KSP/Rockets1/screenshot8_zpswwy1tofk.png.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i1296.photobucket.com/albums/ag18/Photonion/KSP/Rockets1/th_screenshot8_zpswwy1tofk.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i1296.photobucket.com/albums/ag18/Photonion/KSP/Rockets1/th_screenshot8_zpswwy1tofk.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENice!
