After a little while, it feels like the game is working against you, as it\u0027s simply not finished yet. The big thing for me is the performance/instability with lots of parts. We need either a 64 Bit engine behind KSP (I\u0027d upgrade to 16GB of RAM tomorrow if that were the case!) or a better parts system where there don\u0027t have to be several different lengths/sizes of the same part taking up space in the memory foot print. EG; we don\u0027t need a bunch of different trusses, design the game so that a strut can be \u0027cut to length\u0027 in real time, so we only need one part in the memory foot print for that strut.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Soviet borris","CreatedById":34487,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-12T06:08:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf u feel like that, go away 4 a while, play some other stuff then come back in a few days or weeks and it\u0027ll be good as new.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CardBoardBoxProcessor","CreatedById":10179,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-14T00:37:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Enow not only is it not as fun.

No, but that does not reduce its value at all. True our cosmonauts may be little green cartoonish creatures, but the spacecraft they fly do not have to be. So I encourage you to use your considerable talents to look beyond historic spacecraft and to give us Duna habitation modules or the next generation of space station parts as only you can.
