Basically, FAR is giving you unexpected data in the editor when you do an aero analysis. It is, however, unclear from your posts whether you have observed the same thing in flight. So, have you tried to fly a plane with the part in question? How did it fly? Also, you should post a screenshot of the plane you are having trouble with.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Svm420","CreatedById":136047,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-15T20:04:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI havent so far.
