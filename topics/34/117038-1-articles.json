Two of these missions are aerial combat, where you are approaching a target that is already in the air.\n\nThere are 2 types of aircraft with 3 and 6 variants for the player to use, if they are unable or unwilling to create their own in the space plane hangar.\n\nThe player is assumed to always be Team A. All enemies are Team B and will automatically fire at you if you are within their angle/range.\n\nThe current method used to spawn enemy aircraft above ground level is not perfect. They have no starting velocity, and there is currently no way to have them spawn with one.\n\nUnless requested for future versions, the tech tree is unchanged. There is an additional optional mission offered to provide a boost of science and funds for a player.\n\n[Requirements]\n\n[BDArmory](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/85209)\n\n[Contract Configurator](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/101604)\n\n[Download]\n\n[Kerbalstuff](https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/1039/Contract%20Pack:%20Kerbin%20on%20Fire)\n\nExtract .zip into \\Kerbal Space Program\\\n\nThe full path should be \\Kerbal Space Program\\GameData\\ContractPacks\\KoF\n\n[Plans]\n\nFuture updates/plans include:\n\n-Polishing\n\n-More contracts\n\n-More in-air contracts\n\n-Space contracts\n\n-More \u0022Kreigslist\u0022 vessels\n\n-Reward balancing\n\n-Tech Tree tweaks\n\nI will be changing contracts around to provide a \u0022cleaner\u0022 experience. There are currently no failure conditions for missions. For example: if you are destroyed during an aerial combat mission and quit to space center, the enemy vessel is destroyed by the game for being in the atmosphere and you magically complete the contract. I want the player to be able to fail the contract, and start over by accepting the contract again. Be ready to quicksave/quickload if you want an honest experience.\n\nI hope to be able to have a few contracts that are infinitely repeatable. It depends if I can figure out how to get enemies or packs of enemies to randomly choose one of several locations to spawn at. \n\n[License]\n\nKerbin on Fire is licensed under [CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/).\n\n[Changelog]\n\n07-25-15 Version 0.1 release.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-29T03:48:55Z\u0022 title=\u002207/29/2015 03:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Volwen**"},{"CreatedByName":"nightingale","CreatedById":119307,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T04:07:32Z","Content":"Awesome, congrats on the release!"},{"CreatedByName":"Prototype516","CreatedById":41701,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T05:23:17Z","Content":"Woot!!1!

Started a brand new career, and the first contract asked me to recover \u0027Volven\u0027 (Love the name!) I got confused because I\u0027m thick and Volven was already in my Crew complex, however a second contract then appeared spawning him and a turret, which I then actioned and completed both contracts. Do you think expanding the description in the first contract to refer that this is completed by accepting another contract, as at the start of my career we only have two contract slots.\n\n2. Is there a way to make that mysterious contract that gives you a billion science and cash a one time thing, I\u0027ve declined it, but it comes back every now and again and I would be very upset to accidentally accept it. (I\u0027m confident I could just delete that mission file, but if there was a tweak it would allow the process to feel a bit more seamless)\n\nSo far that\u0027s all I\u0027ve done as I\u0027ve a few more rungs to unlock in the tech ladder before I get my weapons and I would be much more interested in building my own crafts and have not tried your kreigslist ones.\n\nMy ideas:\n\n1. I recall a rocket with translational thrusters in the Armoury pack which would be great for a contract asking you to shoot down satellites, debris, stations in space or on other orbital bodies.\n\n2. Mission that requires larger aircraft, ie the contract parameters state that you must have a certain mass, or 4 engines, carry x no. of bombs and that the target is spawned 600k away. I would just like to build a larger bomber and want a contract to pay for it.\n\nThanks again."},{"CreatedByName":"Volwen","CreatedById":78186,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T20:35:12Z","Content":"Thanks for the initial feedback.\n\nI\u0027m not sure why I decided to make the intro contracts a double mission. It will get changed eventually.\n\nThe mysterious contract can only be accepted once, I need to find a way to make it stop appearing if you decline it.\n\nBoth of your ideas are planned additions. Contracts will eventually be in space and the far reaches of kerbin. Specialty vehicles will be for a few missions, but I want the player to retain creative freedom."},{"CreatedByName":"Andrewx21","CreatedById":140332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T03:36:53Z","Content":"I must ask Two questions.
