It is in fact related to the Octagonal Struts (both kinds).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was told to put something inbetween Octagonal Struts and docking ports since the struts have some kind of physics problem. Well, that didn\u0027t solve the problem. It happened less frequently, but it was still there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI believe the difinitive solution is to not use the Octagonal Struts anywhere between ANY docking ports and your main craft. I had removed the Octagonal Struts from the side ports on my craft, but not the one on the nose, and it still had problems even if I used the side docking ports.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI basically created 2 sets of crafts. One set with a single Octagonal Strut on the nose, one set without. The one with the Octagonal Strut would lock up the controls no matter how I docked, nose to nose or onto the side (without Octagonal Struts). The set without Octagonal Struts never gave me any problems at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for large space stations. I cannot verify at what point Ocatagonal Struts will have an impact on your craft. If they simply cannot be between docking ports and a major piece like a fuel tank? Clear line to the nearest SAS?

Virtually every capsule I use can easily stay fixed on a heading using ASAS alone. But SmartASS prefers to fire every single RCS thruster to maintain an equilibrium of offsetting forces, ignoring the ASAS. I\u0027d love to see changed logic, such that SmartASS thinks along the lines of \u0022I\u0027ve determined I need to turn 35 degrees to port. Do I have ASAS? If so, I use ASAS to turn, else I use RCS to turn. I now analyze my turning. If turning does not equal expected results, and I\u0027m using ASAS, I now attempt maneuver with RCS, else I leave RCS off.\u0022 And so forth. Which means that SmartASS and the MechJeb autopilots would only wind up using RCS for translation maneuvers, or for craft where ASAS turning is too slow or nonexistent, and not for every single pitch/roll/yaw maneuver, greatly increasing their RCS efficiency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Just my $.02, Duck....!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Also, MechJeb doesn\u0027t seem to prioritize engine gimbal control vs. RCS thrusting. Again, I find myself having to leave RCS off on launch, because if I don\u0027t, the ascent autopilot will just burn away RCS fuel to maintain a gravity turn that the main engine gimbal and/or the launcher ASAS could easily be maintaining. (And do, if you turn RCS off.) Which I think could be fixed using basically the same logic -- look at the most efficient way to do something first, then go to RCS only if the first option is insufficient.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-06T19:15:35Z\u0022 title=\u002206/06/2013 07:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 6, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by daver4470\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GeorgeT93","CreatedById":57263,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-06T19:17:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022daver4470\u0022 data-cite=\u0022daver4470\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI do that too.

According to Steam, I\u0027m at around 187 hours played, but I still haven\u0027t even attempted a docking. So far, my focus has been on unmanned rovers after a successful manned trip to the Mun and back. Lately, I\u0027ve been focusing on mapping out all the planets and their moons, so I\u0027ve launched a number of satellites. But I haven\u0027t built a space station or anything else that I\u0027ve needed to dock to (yet), so I had no idea that the docking autopilot overrides the RCS toggle. Guess I better plan on taking extra monopropellant with me when I am ready to start making docking maneuvers! LOL!
