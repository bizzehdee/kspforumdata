I think this is because Interstellar\u0027s tree.cfg is outdated. When the game loads, the outdated tree.cfg and squad configs try to put the same part in different nodes (e.g. squad configs put the turbojet in supersonic flight, KSPI\u0027s tree puts it in high altitude flight, if you buy the tech, its purchase isn\u0027t saved in its proper node, and when the game loads again it thinks you never bought the turbojet).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way I fixed it is I went through the tree.cfg and removed all the stock parts. They don\u0027t really need to be there, since their tech node is already defined in the part\u0027s .cfg.

Is that the reason you did it? Just to make it less of an ultimate technology? After all that Infrastructure and Science investment... you killed AM isp. I can\u0027t stop these tears of betrayal. I might have to just use the 10.0 settings. I really don\u0027t want to have to redesign all of my best ships. The temps inside the AM reactor are insane! Hence the higher ISP! Or is the argument that the nozzles themselves can\u0027t handle those temps during the transfer outside of the magnetically contained reactor cores? How about a new nozzle that can? Make it heavier and more expensive! WHATEVER IT TAKES!!!11\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~Steve\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHonestly, Fractal.. with limiting it to 2997.1 ISP.. you really cut flexibility. Now it only makes sense to use LFO or MethalOX with the AM\u002BThermal combination. No reason to use anything else. You\u0027re capped at such a low ISP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI R Teh Sad\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFYI, even with the old settings, many of my vehicles also use Plasma and even the DT Vista. It just depended on the application. I really don\u0027t want to be locked into the plasma and vista when I want high ISP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT2:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, I know you want us to use the new magnetic nozzles... but we aren\u0027t going to. We aren\u0027t going to because you can\u0027t generate Tritium in the backround AND you can\u0027t decay Tritium into He3 in the backround. We use AM because we CAN farm it in the backround.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe really don\u0027t need artificial restrictions placed on tech... we already have prices in place for that.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-04T22:41:21Z\u0022 title=\u002211/04/2014 10:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 4, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by NeoAcario\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
