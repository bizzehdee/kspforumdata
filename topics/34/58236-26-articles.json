The exhaust is cooler that way. Second, efficiency. Usually, fuel is lighter than oxidizer, and both are always lighter than combustion products. That means the rocket gets more energy from expelling exhaust gases with lower atomic mass (the same reason why H2 is the best NTR fuel). Peak efficiency is therefore achieved with a slightly fuel-rich mixture, and the effect is more pronounced the higher the atomic mass difference between the fuel and exhaust products.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scripto23","CreatedById":95288,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-09T16:46:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EInteresting, thanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sax Man Aeronautics","CreatedById":65964,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-09T22:49:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen I have a Stretchy SRB tank that has a Bi-propellant engine, how can I balance the amount of Oxidizer and Fuel so that one of them doesn\u0027t run out quicker than the other?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scripto23","CreatedById":95288,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-10T22:16:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen you attach an engine and then fill the tank from the action group manager menu there should be a button at the very bottom (scroll down) that says something like \u0022Configure for ___ engine 35% Fuel 65% Oxidizer\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scripto23","CreatedById":95288,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-10T22:30:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk, another stoich question.
