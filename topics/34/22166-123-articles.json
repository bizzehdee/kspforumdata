I think the main hurdle is connecting the crafts, but remotetech, which does this in a very advanced manner, has proven this to be feasible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe system could be expanded in such a manner that a multitude of scanners together can triangulate signals and allow for all sorts of fancy scanning obit combinations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EHow it is used (practically):\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaunch a few scanners with antennas into orbit around, say, the mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaunch a processing server satellite.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConnect to scan-satellites.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll scanners are now working simultaneously as long as focus is on the server craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like these ideas, but by no means should it be a requirement for a connection to be established every time the satellite wants to map. The satellite maps autonomously and can store data in the absence of a link. If the complexity of a linkup is still desired then maybe the probe could map but not update until a linkup is possible? Though honestly I think idea A is better. B does sound cool but I don\u0027t need a map processed at all until I\u0027m actually focused on that planet and if I have a lot of probes I don\u0027t want them bogging down my processor when I\u0027m playing on another planet.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zrikz","CreatedById":84308,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-06T22:58:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen I try to download this, it says the link is dead, any suggestions or alternative?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwaster","CreatedById":71262,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-07T02:21:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022zrikz\u0022 data-cite=\u0022zrikz\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhen I try to download this, it says the link is dead, any suggestions or alternative?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suggest you try again.
