KSP? The best practice is to make backups of your saves and ships elsewhere, wipe the KSP install, install the new one and put your ships and saves back in. Bad Things\u003Csup\u003ETM \u003C/sup\u003Ecan happen if you just drag and drop the new version of KSP over the old one. Putting your saves elsewhere is good because you then have backups if things mess up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually, I tell a lie, best practice is to make a duplicate of every KSP install where it can\u0027t be touched by updates (so you can carry on playing while the mods settle down/hotfixes are made). Savegames are not guaranteed to be compatible across KSP versions, though they usually are (I think savefiles from 0.21? are still valid for 0.90. Earlier ones may have trouble) so be careful (another reason to have backups of savefiles and of KSP). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for updating mods, it\u0027s best to wait for them to be updated and downloading them fresh rather than copying them across from old Gamedata folders (unless given the ok by the mod author. Follow their advice, basically. Some don\u0027t need updating, some are ok, but recompile to be safe, others break completely). If no update occurs, it\u0027s up to you if you want to install outdated software (it sounds more ominous than it is - if things go wrong, you quickly notice and if you have backups, no harms has been done).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-09T00:09:05Z\u0022 title=\u002201/09/2015 12:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ObsessedWithKSP\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Glasher","CreatedById":83599,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-09T00:35:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Thank you sir! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zeenobit","CreatedById":125578,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-09T04:49:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo interesting observation:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP 0.90 32-bit on Windows here, running with -force-opengl, Borderless Window mode, ATM x32 Basic version 4-3.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m starting a fresh modded build.

I decided to go to half res textures to save even more mem and I didn\u0027t like the icon look after changing it. I researched how to fix the issue by reading through this thread, I then went through all my ATM cfg files and made or changed overrides for all icons and deleted all cashes for those textures. I then rebooted the game to create new textures. I believe since res was set at half, ATM then created half res textures. So this didn\u0027t solve my issue. I then deleted the cashes again, set res to full and tried again. After rebooting and reloading the full res textures, I set the res to half. Things worked well, mem went down and all icons looked good. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a whim I rebooted KSP, not deleting anything, with my texture res at half to see what it would do. Half my icon\u0027s went back to their original ugly half res look while others stated good. If you then set the res to full, the icons stay the same. I have double checked my overrides on the ones that didn\u0027t take and found no errors. I have looked into the original icon png sizes and formats and see no relation on that. I have no clue why some revert to a blurred image and some remain good.

Of course you must match the version of ATM to the bits of the version of KSP you are using. From what info I\u0027ve seen on the forum, most using Windows are running 32 bit KSP due to the 64 bit version still being quite buggy while the 32 bit version performs quite well, especially on 64 bit Windows with lots of RAM so KSP can have all it can use, up to the limit of a 32 bit program. Since the most RAM a 32 bit OS can use is 4 gig or less (Windows cannot use a full 4 gig for various reasons.) KSP has to share RAM with the OS.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbas_ad_astra","CreatedById":126593,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-10T15:15:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Zeenobit\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Zeenobit\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI added a couple more mods (E.V.E. and PlanetShine), and I\u0027m consistently noticing that ATM is not only decreasing my memory usage, but increasing it.
