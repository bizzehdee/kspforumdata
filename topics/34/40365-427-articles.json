Impulse, measured in newton-seconds, is defined as the amount of momentum transferred to the system by a burn, impact, or other interaction. A Over a short enough interval that the mass of fuel used is insignificant compared to the mass of the rocket, the three ways to calculate it (Isp * reaction mass expended, thrust * burn time, or delta-v * ship mass) are equivalent. (Over longer burns, they diverge because they account differently for the cost of accelerating fuel that\u0027s expended later). As a matter of fact, the term \u0022specific impulse\u0022 comes from the fact that you can calculate it as (total impulse / reaction mass expended).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GiantTank","CreatedById":113180,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-01T21:59:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ice30\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Ice30\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ECould you post a picture of your ship?

It actually uses a set of pistons and hinges to extend the pontoons out, giving it more stability in the water. The fourth picture where it is in the water is actually an older model that used girders, pre-extending pontoons. It uses a few methods to turn; it works like an air-boat so it has those fins, and the thermal turbojet is on a hinge the thrust is vectored. There are also linear atmospheric thrusters on the sides of the pontoon to help steer, but it still handles like a tank that\u0027s lost its treads. The idea was, it folded up rather nicely in a fairing when the pontoons were retracted. So, I was going fly to Lathe with it attached to the bottom of my vessel, drop it off, and land next to it. It was going to be the source of fuel for the Jool system as well as the supply of water for my Lathe colony.

I have RasterPropMonitor and TextureReplacer installed and when combined with KSPI it was breaking RPM and I didn\u0027t know how it was but I have found it was because of TextureReplacer in my case. The solution was to add a cfg in the TextureReplacer directory with the following to fix RPM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETextureReplacer\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E{\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EkeepLoaded = ^WarpPlugin/PlanetResourceData/\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E}\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stevie_D","CreatedById":103007,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-02T14:41:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks Jefferson, ive got both the same mods installed as you have, but it hasnt been breaking RPM for me for some reason (typical KSP!)

Several of the peaces do not attach to stock peaces without many struts and will fall through the ground and some stock peaces. Also, no fission or antimatter reactors will work, so fusion is out of the question.
