Frankly with all the groaning and moaning and sounds of metal tearing and rending, I was surprised to only lose an RTG. Fortunately I\u0027d built it with a backup. Personally I feel that just relying on the part\u0027s crash tolerance and a simple multiplier are not enough. It should also be based on mass. . The Genesis sample return probe had G forces in excess of 30G. If you tried to do that with something more massive and complex it would crumple. There\u0027s no way in DREC to achieve similar results unless you globally set the multiplier for everything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did have some simple code floating around that did away with the multiplier and instead based it on mass. And it worked well in that small simple probes could withstand really high Gs.

I do not like some of the Realism Overhaul features so I am not using the complete pack of those mods. I would like to use just the heat shields. How do I do that? What critical temperature should they have if installed correctly?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am trying to replicate the Mercury missions. I have played Orbiter for a long time and still playing it and I bet Mercury entry paths are much more steep even on orbital missions not even talking about Redstone missions. I can tolerate maybe nine gees because that is realistic but not twenty nine! And that is with my path taking me through upper atmosphere really fast and shallow with just a couple metres per second of descent. Just a few degrees steeper and closer to the real path and the Kerbal is certainly dead.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
