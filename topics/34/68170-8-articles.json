If you\u0027re really hurting for power generation, there\u0027s a few mods to add in some things, such as the Universal Storage modules (with a fuel cell based off realistic Apollo-style measurements) along with mods like Near Future (which add in a large amount of energy-using \u0027futurish\u0027 engines and somewhat balanced nuclear reactors).
