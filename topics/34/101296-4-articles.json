Same for 400 and 500 just a different type of adapter. It just gets tucked away into an interstage fairing for the 500 series. The centaur tank on the 500 series is not the same size as the booster tank. So you need to either make an interstage adapter for the 500 series or you just allow the users to play with procedural fairings.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-15T19:51:23Z\u0022 title=\u002203/15/2015 07:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by sp1989**"},{"CreatedByName":"hieywiey","CreatedById":99098,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-15T20:03:02Z","Content":"When is the best time for ditching the boosters on the Atlas?

The engine is wonderful and it will go far. It might slightly be overpowered but we just gotta use it for heavy payloads. I mean the RD-180 is a very powerful engine. I think its balanced very well especially if its used with proper payloads. Took some pictures and the whole thing together looks really good. Well done man cant wait for the centaur. In the mean time I will just use procedural tanks and the fasa rl-10. Also I used a procedural tank in the last picture to show you what the copper tank in game can look like. If I can nit pick anything, I think there should be some smoke at least on the launch pad and small trail. I used to hate the smokescreen plugin but it has come a long way and it works really well without effecting performance. What ever you do, don\u0027t use real plume it looks really bad. I think one of the best implementations of the smokescreen plugin was by stubbles on his Zenit launcher. Its so well done, it looks beautiful, and its done very realistically. \n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

He designed it when it took off there was a plumes of smoke that shot out of the exhaust slots in the launchpad and the. The smoke would disapate as it took off. Then durin ascent there was the slightest trail of smoke and it wasn\u0027t white it was orangeish exhaust. But it didn\u0027t go all the way down to the pad. Download it and launch it once with the smokescreen config he has in the download. You\u0027ll see what I mean. Also when it comes to the design of the tank, that is totally up to you.
