The only differences I can see is mass (one has 2 times mass of the other) and number of fairings (4 vs 2, but doesn\u0027t everyone use all of them to cover up the insides anyway ?). So, the heavier one seems quite useless to me. Unless I am missing something, hence the original question.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Probable bug - the interstage adapter has two decouplers, for top and bottom of the fairing. The bottom one ejects both ends (not sure if it\u0027s intentional). The top one ejects the top end (as it should). But in both cases the icon for the top decoupler remains in the staging - so that\u0027s a bug, unless I am doing something wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- And lastly, a suggestion - could you make it possible to disable decoupling (by tweakables maybe) ? It would make a better distinction between fairings and fuselage so that a fuselage couldn\u0027t be ejected and it wouldn\u0027t clutter the staging with more icons than necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
