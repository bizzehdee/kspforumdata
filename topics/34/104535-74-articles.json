But it doesn\u0027t help that the first post hasn\u0027t been updated and points to a specific version on Spacedock that isn\u0027t current (and Spacedock doesn\u0027t have any later versions).  KSP 1.2 has been out for 3 months now.  I understand it can be challenging to upgrade a mod when Squad has changed so much going from 1.1.3 to now 1.2.2.  But people look in the first post for details on installing a mod and any serious issues it is having.\n\nPerhaps between yourself and [@sirkut](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/57229-sirkut/) you can either get the first post and the topic title updated or start a new IR thread, with cautions on KSP 1.2 IR still being in prerelease.

The ring is quite large and heavy (a lot of hitchhiker cans), it is supposed to rotate using the rotary plates. I suppose this has been done before.\n\nWhen just a few objects are attached to the rotating plate, no problem. But when it starts to get big, just a few parts try to rotate (the parts that attach from the central station towards the ring) but even before reaching the ring itself the parts dont seem to want to move. So inner parts try to move, the ring itself does not, causing rapidly the whole structure to break.  \n\nIs this a limit to the weight of the ring? Or the part count? Small rings to rotate without problem.  \n\nI was expecting it to rotate maybe slowly, or accelerate slowly due to the size of it, but here it completely breaks.  \n\nThanks!"},{"CreatedByName":"Sparky_Sct","CreatedById":161038,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-16T18:26:33Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 20 hours ago, Wintersdark said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Kerbal Joint Reinforcement caused that to happen for me.

For whatever reason, the parts, both new and old, aren\u0027t showing up in the editor. But here is the most confusing part, some have time to time. I have downloaded the mod and reinstalled it many times and this has not fixed the issue. The parts that have showed up are the Trusses, the Utilitrons And I think one of the rotatrons... I would really like this issue fixed.\n\n\u003Cmerged posts=\u0022\u0022\u003E\u003C/merged\u003E\n\nI have looked at the download file and all the parts are there, but they do not want to load for use in the editor. \n\nThanks.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-01-18T08:27:47Z\u0022 title=\u002201/18/2017 08:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 18, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Val**\n  \nMerged several semi duplicate posts"},{"CreatedByName":"Agustin","CreatedById":172127,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-18T16:51:53Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 8 hours ago, CGiuffre164 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Hello, my name is Vito.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E (...)\n\u003E \n\nYou\u0027ll have to be more specific as for what version of the mods you are using, your installation folder details, or something because it has been discussed before how to install you just have to read the past last pages of this thread.

You should have the 2.0.10 version of IR, and install legacy parts and/or rework package to have parts.
