So if you leave Kerbin you\u0027ll have an orbital velocity around Kerbol of ~8 km/s, if you warp out to Jool, you\u0027ll still be going 8 km/s so will be going 4 km/s too fast and probably be on an escape trajectory out of the solar system. That\u0027s your best case scenario if Kerbin and Jool are aligned on the same side of Kerbol.\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Angular Momentum\u0022 mode maintains the magnitude of orbital angular momentum (orbit.h) and your direction of travel. Your orbital velocity adjusts down as you climb out of a gravity well, and adjusts up as you warp towards the parent body. Same scenario: This time you will have too little velocity when you get to Jool. It actually ends up being like a Hohmann transfer where you pay for it all at the end. This mode you get no free potential energy like you do in the linear momentum mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn a way the drives are opposites.

Fiddling with settings probably won\u0027t do it. Every couple of frames the game gets a new set of orbital variables to calculate from and pretty much re-does everything about your ship as far as it\u0027s orbit and velocity go. It\u0027s part of the deal with translating through space this way regardless of which energy conservation mode you use. The velocity conservation mode is a lot simpler and is way easier on the CPU however.
