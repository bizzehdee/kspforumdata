Now, I have not been able to replicate your issue with either the stock S1B or my S2 analog I built. That being said, FAR has soo many physics breaking issues that it is almost not worth using. It is a SLIGHT improvement over the default engine in terms of aircraft in horizontal flight (G Limited, assumes Control surface stall is entire wing stall etc.) It fixes a control surface bug that caused gliders to fly for ever and gain speed and altitude. It however has serious issues with same control surfaces when attached to wings. It would be real nice if FAR had a button to disable it. Even aircraft do not fly the way FAR says they do.
