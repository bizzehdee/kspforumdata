A bit finnaky but I usually got it good enough.\u003Cp\u003EIt would be nice to have it line up to something but till then I will cope.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you, I never tried it that way before, I just finished docking 2 parts onto my new station doing it that way and it was easy.. (except when mechjeb stopped short of the station and just sat there until I exited to tracking station, went back set things up again and it finished things off \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing I have been thinking of, maybe the developer could add an extra box to the docking window that lets you type in a degree for rotation, so say you knew your station was at 90, you could type 90 into the box and then mechjeb would rotate your ship to the 90 thereby lining you up.. - I thought of this when I went to dock my second ship, I found I was going to be upside down, so had to quickly hammer the Q and E keys to rotate the ship around LOL.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-28T08:35:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have a version with a box to force the Roll in the ASAS and Docking Autopilot ( and other change ).

Mechjeb will split the difference on burn time so if you have a long enough burn it could technically try burning close to your retrograde. You\u0027ll notice a manuever node is relative to the exact vector for that manuever node. If this is the case you will probably have to do several burns to make your orbit more eccentric before making a final burn to escape. You have to do this using a nuclear engine especially if you have a very heavy craft.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was a 20 minute burn, from a 250 km orbit.
