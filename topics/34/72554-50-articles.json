This bug can also be reversed by resizing from 1.25m to 0.625m then back again and the part will have an unusually small mass. I was only able to cause the bug to happen when attaching a \u0022stack\u0022 part to another \u0022stack\u0022 part. Seems to work correctly when attaching a \u0022stack\u0022 part to a \u0022surface\u0022 part such as an Octo2 probe core which probably should be classified as stack anyways...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the Small Inline Reaction Wheel was changed from a 1.25m part to a 0.625m part in version 0.25 so the config should maybe be changed to reflect that? Some of the smaller probe cores are classified as surface and maybe should instead be stack or maybe not be configurable at all since there are probe cores for most sizes?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are some screen shots showing the bug with a different command pod and fuel tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore any changes are made the total mass is 3.28t\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/AUYEpIm.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/AUYEpIm.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESizing up make the mass go up to 19.03t which appears to be correct.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/DK1cCMu.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/DK1cCMu.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChanging the fuel tank back down to the normal size of 1.25m causes the extra dry mass to be retained from the previous 2.5m size.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KqhzaDr.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/KqhzaDr.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain this time going from 1.25m to 0.625m sizes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/OfLsxcA.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/OfLsxcA.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/hRimXKi.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/hRimXKi.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks a lot for this!
