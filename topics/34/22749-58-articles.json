I made your changes for the pod, did similar thing to the avionics nose. I also moded the RSC nose cone, to remove the old \u003Cp\u003E\u0022SASmodule\u0022 along with the KI KP KD lines, made it a \u0022Part\u0022 as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe VAB Buran made orbit again and again. I was especially concerned if it could hold heading during rotation, i also didnt see to much of the \u0022flapping wings\u0022 effect during vertical ascent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter ejection of side SRBs, still the same good control. Grav turn all good. Same thing around \u0022space\u0022 near 70-80 kms, although there it needs care if you want to roll the craft so the main Booster is below Buran (Kerbin perspective of course). Raising apo with the remaining fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeperation of the booster, with new sas still left on, no problems whatsoever. RCS a bit to get some distance, and burn main engines to circ.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my opinion making orbit with new sas, is way easier than without. (Take note that Turning it off, either if you fly with old or new sas, and go all the way manual, has nothing to do with what we talking about here. It is totally viable method btw lol)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow the weird stuff happens when you get back to KSP runway. Everything is fine, burn to lower PE, do adjustments near 40\u002B kms if needed, enter atmo, see the normal fireworks (as with any other craft), and then under 12kms abouts, you start to see the wing flapping again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt still holds steady, you still can manually correct, but you still have the constant flappin and jiggling. Of course at this point, i usually turn off sas and do manual touchdown (its smooth as silk anyway).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in the end i believe that something is going on with current aerodynamics of the craft, maybe along with CoL/CoM changes, drag/lift of parts etc etc. You can see that with the SPH Buran, where you stand on the runway, SAS always ON, nothing happens. Start the engines rolling off, still nothing but the second your nose gear goes airborne you get the flapaflap.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you try to keep something like 45 degrees ascent, the flaping reduces, it even stops at some point especially above 6kms. If you try to level the craft, keeping it near 0 at almost any altitude inside atmo, then the flappers flap like a happy pinguin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote also that, during SAS recover mode (when you stop giving commands and it goes to stabilize the craft), you dont see any flaping, it does smooth slow changes here and there until recover resets, where you see the pingpong starting again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEDIT:\u003C/strong\u003E Ehh, well i made my usual monstrocity and removed both ctr surfaces, along with the vertical ctr surface (i dont know if the vertical one has a problem though). I left the wings as they were, so only the surfaces. I placed stock winglets, but of course, since they are totally different i needed to add a few more to be able to balance the craft and take off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EResault? No jiggling whatsoever, full aircraft control. I totally removed any extra modules from the nose \u0022Buran_avionicsection\u0022, so its just a part, and like above only left the RCS module for the \u0022Buran_rcssection\u0022 part. Pod cfg is just like Deltac\u0027s above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo i guess the jiggleflap song, comes from the ctr surfaces themselfes (sas isnt able to handle them properly). Of course my craft probably will have balance problems later on when i drain some fuel, and i didnt dare to use it as the VAB version lol.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway im sure someone more comfortable with ctrl surfaces can edit the Buran ones. Something along the lines of \u0022deflectionLiftCoeff\u0022 value or whatever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut of course i could be wrong, and just the fact of puting the stock controls, and changing the CoL did play a part also... I dunno at this point the heat is killing me, so im off for some cold shower and stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAh and before i go, ive notice the jiggling from Burans ctrl surfaces comes in \u0022Roll\u0022.

You need to either balance your RCS manually (i.e. changing the maximum thrust output of them to \u0022balance\u0022 their exerted force) or use a module to automatically throttle them. Remember, both BURAN and the Shuttle used digital autopilots for all maneuvers, so there was never direct manual control of the RCS or control surfaces like with KSP.
