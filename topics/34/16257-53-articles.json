I\u0027ve attached the flight computer to each individual spu instead of the vessel. If you have multiple, one serves as a master. The advantage of this is that you can preload others with either attitude controls or Progcom assembly and have them execute on decoupling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECliph or JDP, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethinking about this master/slave device functionality and I was wondering: Would it be possible to have the active craft act as a Master, and be able to communicate with ships which are within the 2000m vicinity?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy idea with this is:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-be able to load commands to individual ships from the one currently being controlled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Have all ships which are set to be Slaved mimic the controls of the craft currently in control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the second idea, you can have all ships do a coordinated maneuver and basically have an interplanetary convoy (if all the slave ships have almost 0m/s relative velocity to the Master). All ships would modulate their throttle to achieve the same TWR among all the ships (ship with lowest possible TWR will be the limiting factor) so that their relative distances between each other remain the same (or close to it) during the maneuvers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Toyotawolf","CreatedById":75259,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-30T18:10:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am assuming that some of the antennas and dishes are broken on purpose at the moment?
