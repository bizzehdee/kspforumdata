While few of those have only undergone several iterations of formatting to work with the game, the vast majority came from countless hours of work for every single texture. I have invested my \u003Cs\u003Eblood,\u003C/s\u003E sweat\u003Cs\u003E, and tears\u003C/s\u003E to make the pack my own, and to say the least, I hereby depose that I have never used a single texture from any other visual pack.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, there is this one small thing that I wish to address that has come to my attention.
