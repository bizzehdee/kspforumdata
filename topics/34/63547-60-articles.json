There\u0027s a pretty old doc by Alan Bond showing peak TWR at around 2.0M with a big falloff either side which I\u0027ve been trying to replicate but failing miserably through lack of understanding atm - also I don\u0027t quite understand the reasons behind that shape - although perhaps to do it properly is a bit out of the scope of AJE anyway ( given it isn\u0027t a jet engine ). The later Reaction Engines docs have the SABRE 4\u0027s thrust varying from 0.5 to 2MN in airbreathing mode for whatever reason, so you can expect some difficulty using them even if they were perfectly modelled.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, the cycle is different, but the SABRE should have many of the same characteristics as a conventional jet. Thrust will grow with speed, as ram pressure increases, top speed will be limited by compressor heating (though when this happens will of course be very different because of the precooling). One of the major differences is that the rising intake temperature actually increases the amount of energy available to the helium loop and thus the compressor, so compression ratio (and thus efficiency) will not drop in the same way it would in a normal jet engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Svm420\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Svm420\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESince I didn\u0027t realize that you already had the Saturn engine under quiztech, which was simply to clone as another VSR TRJ for a nice single nozzle variant, here is another engine to add.
