I used NASA material to tweak my trajectories to the point where I managed to be very close to real life in my replay. You have to have a surprisingly shallow ascent path if you want to get into orbit with enough fuel left. First stage should burn out at around 70km height at a speed of around 2.5 km/s. Second stage should get you near an apoapsis of 190 km and a speed of around 7 km/s. Third stage should only use up around 500 m/s or so for circularization, and then have enough fuel left to get you all the way to the Moon (aim for a translunar injection profile that brings you close to escape velocity, i.e. around 10.8 km/s if I recall correctly; that way you need less fuel from the Service Module for the capture burn). Aim for a 110 km orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you\u0027re in lunar orbit, you should have plenty of fuel in the LEM to get you down and back up again. You can increase this if you use the SM to lower your periapsis to about 15 km before detaching the LEM. Once you\u0027re ready to depart to Earth, you should have at least 1200 m/s left in the SM (with no LEM attached, of course), and that is plenty to bring you back home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso note that in the stock Saturn V from FASA, all upper stages have their fuel and resources disabled, so you don\u0027t drain them prematurely.

Both vessels end up with very near 28.6 inclination and the GATV will be close enough to the Gemini\u0027s orbital path that no further inclination change is needed. One extra piece of info I have is an extra Mechjeb \u0022Target\u0022 panel that I\u0027ve setup to display \u0022Relative inclination\u0022. I use that to make sure my GATV\u0027s inclination stays very close to what the Gemini\u0027s is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for circular initial orbits, I use mechjeb ascent guidance with everything turned off, Orbit altitude of 33500 (though any value above your target will work) and Orbit inclination of -28.6 (or lower if I\u0027m going to a steeper incline). I keep the Ascent Path Editor open during the entire launch. Turn start altitude = 10km. Turn start velocity = 100m/s. Turn end altitude for my Titan GLV and GATV is 120km. Final flight path angle is initially and ultimately 0. Turn shape: 60%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEngage guidance and launch. I leave ascent path details as indicate above until my Apoapsis is within 20km of whatever I\u0027m targeting (so 130km if I want a 150km orbit, etc). Once I reach 20km from my target apoapsis, I change the \u0022turn end altitude\u0022 to be whatever altitude I\u0027m currently at. From that point I just want vertical speed. Depending on my launch vehicle, it\u0027s usually at 800m/s - 1.2km/s at this point but it\u0027s always dropping. I just let it drop with the rocket in level flight until it\u0027s down to around 20m/s. At that point I start messing with \u0022Final flight path angle\u0022. Raise it up enough to keep vertical speed just above 0m/s. As vertical speed starts to climb again, I\u0027ll lower the flight path angle. When it\u0027s finally back down to 0, I just watch Periapsis and as soon as it matches Apoapsis (or is within 10km for slower response engines like the RL10), I disengage the autopilot. It\u0027s not a perfectly circular orbit, but I usually can get \u002B/-20km between Peri and Apo which is close enough for me. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-22T23:35:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Trolllception\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Trolllception\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHow are you matching the inclination of the GATV/Gemini?
