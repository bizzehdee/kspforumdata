I\u0027ve been playing around and things seem to be working out, but how do I find those ratios if I don\u0027t know the IRL flow rates? I could do it for F1 because it\u0027s well documented, but I\u0027m having trouble finding information for other engines, or I can only find the total F\u002BO flow, as with the Fregat engine.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESites like astronautix.com generally give the F/O ratio on whatever engine you\u0027re looking up. Generally, I\u0027ll do a Google search for a specific engine (say \u0022RL-10 rocket engine\u0022 or \u0022RD-180 rocket engine\u0022 or something). Either Wikipedia (which has been pretty accurate so far) or astronautix.com come up most often, and they usually have the numbers you need. Also, might be useful to Google the rocket the engine is used on (say \u0022Centaur upper stage rocket\u0022 or \u0022Russian Proton rocket\u0022), since many engines are tied to the rocket they were used on. Research takes a while, especially if you have an obscure engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, if you know the fuels and the mass ratio, you can derive the flow rates in volume for KSP. It\u0027s a bit of a pain to do it manually, but there are two tools that can help. NathanKell has a XLS file that he used to generate a bunch of engines for his RftS thread/pack, which will get you everything you need to get configs out. If you don\u0027t like spreadsheets, I made an online tool for generating configs based on the XLS here: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://bit.ly/rfstockalike\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://bit.ly/rfstockalike\u003C/a\u003E Both of them will do the messy math for you and give you some cues as to what numbers are appropriate.
