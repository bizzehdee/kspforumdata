If you do vertical staging, you are carrying the dead weight for the engines of the upper stages, but you have less drag.

Most of my lifters are 2 stage, or 2 stage \u002B boosters (either SRBs or LRBs). Condition of TWR \u0026gt; 1 is only crucial for first stage (\u002B boosters where applicable), upper stages often have TWR less than 1 (as example consider Atlas-V rocket with it\u0027s underpowered Centaur upper stage). Upper stage design usually depends on destination orbit, for low orbits I usualy use KeroLOx RD-0124 or NK-43 (depending on the payload) since you have relatively short time for circularization, and as such it\u0027s preferred to have TWR or at least 0.7 at ignition with TWR crossing 1 somewhere mid-burn. For high orbits (KSO/KTO, escape) HydroLOx is preferred, while TWR is not as important for direct injection profiles. I use one or several of RD-0146s for low to mid-level payloads, and RD-0120 for heavy payloads.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022BrickedKeyboard\u0022 data-cite=\u0022BrickedKeyboard\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf I could check a readout somewhere that would tell me how much delta-V was taken by aerodynamic drag, that would let me do a direct comparison.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechJeb shows total dV expended, gravity losses and steering losses.
