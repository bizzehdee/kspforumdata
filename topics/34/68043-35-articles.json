I did attend a university (college, tertiary education, whatever comes after highschool, i\u0027m 25 now) doing design for five years, but probably 70% of that was theory papers and courses that had nothing to do with practical skills (postmodernism, feminist studies, cultural identity, small business analysis, etc). The few papers I \u003Cem\u003Edid \u003C/em\u003Etake that helped were anatomical studies and sculpting creatures for film (with maya and zbrush), either self directed or guided by the better teachers of the place. Nothing for game design, or with efficient hard surface modelling, so KSP has been a learning exercise for me in that regard (which is why its taking so long to resolve anything). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt doesn\u0027t really matter where you learn, its all about the amount of work you want to put in and how much you want to push yourself.
