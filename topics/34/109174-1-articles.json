This would be a goo thing, but currently the only LF-only tanks are aircraft parts, which do not make very good interplanetary motherships. This mod adds a new version of each stock fuel tank that contains only liquid fuel, so you can go on building interplanetary craft as you did before 1.0!\n\nRequires ModuleManager, but patch is included in download\n\n![ehjgcl.png](http://i59.tinypic.com/ehjgcl.png)\n\n[**DOWNLOAD FROM KERBALSTUFF**](https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/792/LiquidTanks:%20Liquid-only%20tanks%20for%20nuclear%20engines!)\n\nThis work is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-14T12:20:23Z\u0022 title=\u002205/14/2015 12:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FishInferno**"},{"CreatedByName":"Jovus","CreatedById":117163,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T11:23:06Z","Content":"You beat me by like, a day."},{"CreatedByName":"kerrigan778","CreatedById":102779,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T11:38:36Z","Content":"Is this done through tweakables or with a a load of extra parts in the parts menu?

The aircraft parts make nice looking interplanetary motherships. At least if you use adapters (which need fuelswitch to be liquid only at full efficiency, tho)."},{"CreatedByName":"FishInferno","CreatedById":106219,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T17:14:19Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027d be very interested in that.
