The scarcity angle can actually also be solved by adding drills in the tech tree that are increasingly efficient for geometrically higher cost and mass, and/or limiting access to low concentration resources until you get those bigger drills.

IT would be nearly impossible to deplete even a comet\u0027s worth of volatiles to create reaction mass for a space program of the size produced here over any reasonable time frame, much less a planet or moon. If its from a gameplay argument, thats fine because thats preference, but there is ALREADY a mod that plays that way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, I think there is no need to worry, as RoverDude wrote - Regolith will be configurable, so you can set up regolith to your own liking and i.e. switch depletion off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly, I think even with depletion you probably won\u0027t be able to deplete resource completely since it will include non-linear curve that never touches zero.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo for example in future you could configure RoverDude mods in a way that water/substrate/karbonite resources are infinite or depletable like in real life (you won\u0027t be able to deplete them even if you harvest them for 100 kerbin years). Then you can set up ore (and possibly minerals) to become depletable (but still non-linear depletion so no worry about depleting to zero).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would then encourage you to build mobile ore tanks / mining rigs to go few hundred meters away where concentration is higher. Then you\u0027ll be able to fill up resources much quicker. This is where my mod comes in handy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThirdly, from the realism point of view this set up holds its own - small scale mining would never tap out liquid / gas resources (like water or karbonite). But when we are talking about rock resources like ore and minerals you are actually limited to 10-20 meters below ground (largest blasthole drill rigs limit is 60-85 meters but those drill rigs have different purpose than harvesting ore). In order to harvest material/rocks you would need something like futuristic broad auger which has much smaller depth limit, 10 meters below ground?(think about auger that drills into rocks not muddy ground) If you think about strip mining you\u0027re also limited to a few meters below ground and also it makes sense to move around when stripmining, not just collecting rocks in one point (giant hole in the center of your colony:P).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this respect local depletion of non-liquid, rock-embedded resources actually makes sense from the reality standpoint.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERoverDude: localized depletion mechanic - thanks for this!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-05T13:10:18Z\u0022 title=\u002212/05/2014 01:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 5, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by riocrokite\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-05T13:07:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DivisionByZero\u0022 data-cite=\u0022DivisionByZero\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI would say that since you can extract the same resources from any side of the asteroid, the composition is homogeneous throughout.\u003Cp\u003EWhat Undercoveryankee suggests: is regolith going to retain the game mechanic of looking for the good spots?
