I was transferring a Kerbal from a station i\u0027m in the process of assembling to his return ride. It was a flat ended module, service I believe, with a 2.5m IACBM. I definitely did not switch IACBM modes while performing the EVA.

The 2.5t dry mass sounds fine, but a fuel tank of comparable size would weigh 18t, so maxing the loaded mass at 6.5t seems too low. Why not increase the number of parts it can hold to 4,800 and the mass accordingly - to 14.5t or push it to 6,400/18.5t. For those of us not using the mod, it won\u0027t matter - it\u0027ll stay at 2.5t. 18t is a reasonable lift for something that size, and it would allow station builders quite a bit of breathing room. Plus, the 38% overhead (2.5t/6.5t) to haul parts into space isn\u0027t realistic for any construction project, particularly given the usual 5% or lower payload to mass ratio, which is now cut by a further 1/3. By going to 18.5t, that becomes a 14% overhead, which is still a bit high, but quite a bit more tolerable.

Orbital construction shouldn\u0027t be too easy, especially not if you have massive designs. You need a large spacedock for large projects. There is the issue that ships in KSP tend to be heavier than they need to be, but that\u0027s not something for a mod to solve; everything else is balanced around that situation. The one thing that could improve Orbital Construction, I think, is being able to start a project you don\u0027t have enough rocket parts for, and allow the necessary parts to be committed to it over time. That way, you wouldn\u0027t need to have storage capacity for 100 tons to build a 100-ton ship--you could have storage for just 25 tons, and refill the station until the project is ready. This is a bit more realistic.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022johnsonwax\u0022 data-cite=\u0022johnsonwax\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI don\u0027t use Orbital Construction, but I think the warehouse isn\u0027t set up properly. The 2.5t dry mass sounds fine, but a fuel tank of comparable size would weigh 18t, so maxing the loaded mass at 6.5t seems too low. Why not increase the number of parts it can hold to 4,800 and the mass accordingly - to 14.5t or push it to 6,400/18.5t. For those of us not using the mod, it won\u0027t matter - it\u0027ll stay at 2.5t. 18t is a reasonable lift for something that size, and it would allow station builders quite a bit of breathing room. Plus, the 38% overhead (2.5t/6.5t) to haul parts into space isn\u0027t realistic for any construction project, particularly given the usual 5% or lower payload to mass ratio, which is now cut by a further 1/3. By going to 18.5t, that becomes a 14% overhead, which is still a bit high, but quite a bit more tolerable. I also fail to see why construction part mass, presumably well packed, would be so much lower density than fuel.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/35043-0-21-FusTek-Station-Parts-Expansion-%28R0-03-5a%29?p=620477\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post620477\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Edescribed in detail not long ago\u003C/a\u003E, my primary reasoning for heavily reducing the quantity and total mass of RocketParts is because I wanted to limit the total effective mass of the Warehouse modules to that of the other 6.5t full-sized Karmony series modules, allowing for reasonably balanced station designs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m in agreement with Kimberley that OrbitalConstruction Redux could be made more realistic by treating Warehouses as temporary holding locations, while \u0022committted\u0022 RocketParts are assigned to the vessel under construction.
