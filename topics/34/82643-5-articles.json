Only because it\u0027s difficult for a single kerbal to remove/move around modules without leaving pieces (floating away) everywhere. So let\u0027s say you\u0027re going to roleplay a maintenance mission on a BoxSat, if one of the sides of the frame isn\u0027t covered by a solar panel or something else, the kerbal could store the hatch on that free side while working on the inner modules.\u003Cp\u003EI realize that might pose problems when you want to \u0027store\u0027 the hatch back in it\u0027s natural position, but it\u0027s an idea. Maybe make another slim part that attaches to the outside of the frame that hatches and modules can be attached specifically too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELosing parts in space during a service mission is actually intended to be a feature. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E I know, weird feature, but I think having to plan your space walk and find ways to cope with part drift enhances the challenge of EVA. On my very first EVA during BoxSat testing I nearly lost the hatch cover (intentionally the easiest part to lose) and after a long search I found it had drifted 70m and was oriented edge on. If you need to stash parts during an EVA I suggest some KAS containers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tygoo7","CreatedById":57345,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-31T18:53:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat looks sweet!
