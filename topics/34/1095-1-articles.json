(dont forget to make a backup of the mk1pod elsewere, better safe than sorry).\n\nAnyway, thats it for now, maybe i would make more parts, who knows. comments are soo wellcome, if you have something to say or something is wrong with the download, go for it and comment; even en espa\u00C3\u00B1ol ;D.
