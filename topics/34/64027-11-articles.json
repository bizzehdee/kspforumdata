Be diplomatic with these people, ask nicely, and you might get a response as to what their rationale was. You blow past diplomacy and go straight to criticism and subtly. Its people like you that cause MODs to close or be abandoned because the modders just dont want to deal with crap from people like you anymore. No matter how bad the MOD is a certain level of appreciation and respect needs to be given because its really not an easy thing making something that remotely looks like the Saturn V and function. To do with Frizz and Denny are doing is unbelievable and your complaining about the effing red paint on the LES!!!! Im sorry but cant just appreciate that it functions just like the Saturn V and is a very very good model. Without these guys you would be stacking stock tanks and lander pods hoping to make a stable rocket to make it to the mun.
