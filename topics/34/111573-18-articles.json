Has anyone else had this issue? If so did you find a solution? The Field Research contracts were working fine until yesterday so I really don\u0027t know what happened ![:/](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/ZNGIcon1.png \u0022:/\u0022)\n\u003E \n\nI just started getting this exact same issue. Googling the problem I found in the ksp.log led me to find your posts about it. The configurator throws loads of errors upon loading the space center and continues to do so, resulting in a framerate of 1 per 5 seconds or so...\n\nIt also says the same thing: \u0027RA\u0027 is not a valid CelestialBody.\n\nUsing GPP, if that makes any difference. I had just accepted a \u0027take a scientist to explore biome\u0027 mission, the target being the Iota Highlands. Along with a bunch of others, but none from this contract pack.\n\nI will try testing if reloading the contracts solves the issue.\n\n**Update:** Some further testing and inspection done: completing or cancelling all running contracts has no impact, nor does reloading or re-generating all contracts from the CC control screen.\n\nAfter another look at the KSP.log, I noticed the error was tied exclusively to the contract \u0027FS\\_HardScience\u0027. Looking into the Field Research files, I found this is actually a separate .cfg which defines the \u0027rare situation\u0027 science contract (splashed down in land biomes for example). The error was coming up ingame, even though I had no such contracts accepted or even offered to me at the time - but apparently it IS trying to.\n\nThis is exactly the same as in Madindehead\u0027s case. \n\nRemoving just the HardScience .cfg file solved the problem already; so no need to disable the entire contract pack!\n\nLooking into the file itself, it seems to have specific configs for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E and GPP, seemingly only being applicable to specific bodies. I\u0027m no programmer, so sadly cannot know what goes wrong beyond that, but I\u0027d say it\u0027s looking for a body and/or biome that doesn\u0027t match with what\u0027s there.\n\nI have to say that even beyond this issue, Field Research has been having some wonky behavior in my installs, from 1.3 to my current 1.7.3 and with several varying planet packs: contracts loading in only sometimes and often suddenly dissapearing; contracts often only generating after a certain time or visiting science facility/tracking station.\n\nHope all this helps others with similar issues!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-01-22T16:44:57Z\u0022 title=\u002201/22/2020 04:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 22, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Morphisor**\n  \nTest results \u0026 ideas"},{"CreatedByName":"RoyCreditor","CreatedById":194250,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-08T20:10:54Z","Content":"Does this mod stop working if Kerbalism is installed?\n\nI am trying to do the contract which asks me to take a surface sample landed at Kerbin\u0027s water, and it gives me waypoints, and I am able to get into the situation and take the surface sample using Kerbalism.
