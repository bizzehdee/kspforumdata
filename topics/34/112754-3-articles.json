It\u0027s also possible to add ladders this way skipping out the PartTools, but it is more work, as you have to make the measurements yourself in a modeling program.  \n\nOne of the mod threads where someone added a door to one of the stock crew cabins using just a module manager cfg pach says how they did it easily.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-03-05T17:56:40Z\u0022 title=\u002203/05/2017 05:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 5, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Ruedii**\n  \nmoar info!"},{"CreatedByName":"MacLuky","CreatedById":138597,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-05T22:19:06Z","Content":"Sounds great.\n\nMeanwhile, i\u0027ve been pondering on a possible early science lab.\n\n![2Nv6Q13.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/2Nv6Q13.jpg)"}]}
