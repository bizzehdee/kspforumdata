I\u0027ve added SRB thrust curves to the options when we\u0027re setting up solid motor mixture configs. So, you should be able to create up to 7 different curves for your SRBs and select them like a fuel mixture in the VAB/SPH. I haven\u0027t fully tested this one yet, so if you want to hit the webapp (\u003Ca href=\u0022http://bit.ly/rfstockalike\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://bit.ly/rfstockalike\u003C/a\u003E) and run some tests, it\u0027d help out. There are 6 curves (plus the \u0022stock\u0022 non-curve) you can choose from. I\u0027d like to thank Felbourn for creating the config-ready data for these curves. For visual reference, curves are here: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.braeunig.us/space/pics/fig1-14.gif\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.braeunig.us/space/pics/fig1-14.gif\u003C/a\u003E They should be described within the options, as well. All curves will start at half thrust, and quickly ramp up to full. At the end of the burn, you\u0027ll have 1% thrust for the last 1% of your fuel load. So you\u0027ll have to stage them away prior to them burning out, but that should make them a bit easier to clear from your craft. The curves are not final, so if you have suggestions, please let me know. \u003Cstrong\u003EEDIT:\u003C/strong\u003E Err, the curves aren\u0027t working at the moment.

As you said, AJE is a better option. I just thought to bring it to your attention.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh and I pretty much agree with what you have in mind for the thrust curves. Um, can\u0027t think of anything for Increasing except maybe weaponized missiles, if you\u0027re into that sort of thing. I\u0027ll slowly start converting all existing SRBs. I\u0027ll probably leave FASA and such to you guys though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEDIT:\u003C/strong\u003E Should I also start worrying about the new crossfeed option? Anything that needs to change because of it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t worry about doing the SRB curves for existing just yet. I\u0027m planning on a mass-upgrade (scripts are fun!) once I settle on some nice defaults. Then if needed we can go through each and tweak as needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe crossfeed stuff is part of the \u0022housekeeping\u0022 I was referring to. It changes more about RealFuels than Stockalike, honestly. I just need to make sure I define the flow mode in the engine configs to make sure it\u0027s working properly. Which is complete for the generator. The only one\u0027s we\u0027ll need to figure out are the oddballs or one-offs (like the dual-mode SpaceY engines) and anything that is in the configs but not in the webapp. I think I have a list based on past commits, so hopefully that\u0027ll be easy enough. But, no worries about the crossfeed/flow mode stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anyone else has some insight/suggestions on SRB curves, feel free to chime in. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E I\u0027d rather have as much feedback upfront I can before I make sweeping changes. Do note that the thrust curve additions (or the flow mode changes) shouldn\u0027t affect any craft in flight, it should only affect new flights. So, let me know if you all have any ideas.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Raptor831","CreatedById":68286,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-01T17:12:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk, just pushed a rather large update to the repo.
