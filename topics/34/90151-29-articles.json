I launch manually without mechjeb and I follow Ferrams guidelines link in the OP. up to the point where you cross 45 degress at 1km/s and 35 kms altitude usually find that my apoapsis is a bit over 50 km by then.I like to wait a little (at ~60km altitude you are mostly out of the atmosphere and it is easier to steer without flipping) just to be safe thenwork my waygo all the down to near 0. From there you can do whatever you decide. the time to apoapsis is going to above be 1 or 2M by then and will start to count down. It is too far off and your ground stage has too much twr for the time to reach 0 yet. After you seperate into your upper stage, you are going to have a lower twr and the number is going to countdown faster. Remember that the periapsis is affected more the closer you are to apo. When your time to apoapsis gets too low pitch up a bit to slow it down so that you can more easily control it. When your periapsis lowers to -2MM or so you can let your time to apoapsis lower past 0 untill you finish the rest of your burn. Once you pass the apoapsis, your apoapsis and your craft is going to start slowly falling. Dont get below 100km or you are going to hit the atmosphere and start burning. Note that you should have an apo of 150 or higher until the very end to be sure that you dont get lower than 100. If your altitude/apoapsis is lower, then pitch up more/pass the apoapsis later if you think its going to get alot higher dont pitch up so much or go past the apo a bit sooner. Its something you really get more with a bit of practice. if you play with a few things you can manipulate certain variables and fine tune the numbers so that you can achieve a near circular orbit right from launch. you might decide an initial apo of 150 is too high and you want to see just how low you can go before you burn up and avoid hitting the atmosphere, or the opposite.
