I do, however, disagree. Players feel the same way about KSP when they first start. Until you have a little understanding of what makes a rocket move and the forces that act upon it, just getting to orbit seems impossible. Over time and explosions we learn more about deltaV, drag, terminal velocity and staging, and eventually going into orbit seems trivial. Some people cannot dock, they get MechJeb to do it for them despite being a simple concept. Really, FAR isn\u0027t so different. If you don\u0027t understand what makes a plane fly, you are just as bound to blind luck and failure until you learn more. The reason it seems harder is more likely because FAR exposes a bunch of numbers and graphs, KSP has some bugs (wheel colliders anyone?) that make it harder generally, and keyboard flying sucks. In the end however, just as people ask each other for advice on how to build better rockets, people ask for advice on how to make their planes fly. Eventually it becomes second-nature just like rocketry.

Anyways, you\u0027ll have to find where your fuel consumption is lowest and your speed highest. You may have nearly the same consumption, but doing two times the speed is obviously better. It\u0027s going to depend on a lot of factors, you\u0027ll have to find out which ones they are for your craft.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jrandom","CreatedById":74522,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-11T21:19:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you can get up to the really thin atmosphere (don\u0027t know what it is on Kerbin, but in RSS it\u0027s around 25-26km, you can easily build small Mach 3\u002B craft with a range of 3000-4000km.

Because the SABRE S has a smaller TWR than SaBRE M. Also I found that the SABRE M had 2920kN in rocket mode, which is weird because it should be 1350kN. I corrected that in the dev version on github. Another thing is that I think the RAPIER should use LqdMethane instead kerosene (which is ridiculous)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@kcs123, The SABRE and RAPIER are special, their afterburner cannot be turned off because they are actually rockets.

I have tried to clibm high as possible with subsonic speed where craft have best L/D ratio until it can\u0027t climb more due to thin atmosphere. At that point I accelerate to supersonic speed in area where L/D is stable again, usually near 1.4 mach on my craft design. Then I climb up again at lowest stable supersonic speed before I make finall push to 5.5 or 6 mach (depends on engine and used mods) before I switch to rocket mode. To make whole trip less tedious I have set throttle to just slightly accelerate, so I need less time to accelerate when I reach higher altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimilar thing seems to work even with this mod, but a bit more complicated. I have monitored closely both, engine stats, ship weight/acceleration and remaining dV. But I just haven\u0027t figure out is it better to push to full throttle or it is better to continue on cruising mode. While at some moment I have more then enough thrust on low throttle, when I reach certain altitude, craft start to loose height due to low atmosphere density. At that point I usualy have enough speed due to continious acceleration, but not with this mod. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith this mod there was moment that I have to set full throttle to keep the same altitude, but I think that is not always the best thing to do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess that I have to do few more test runs to find optimal procedure. Thanks for info, I guess that I\u0027m close to optimal route with fuel economy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBtw, sabre engines shows ~5500 ISP on flight until I reach higher altitude and gain more speed, but sometimes I got higher ISP on low throttle and sometimes higher with full throttle setttings. That depends on craft speed/altitude and that is main reason why I have asked question in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a bit confusing to figure out optimal routine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@camlost - Thanks, that explains confusing info on right click to sabre engines, not a big deal that influence gameplay, I was just curious.
