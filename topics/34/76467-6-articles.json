Also some new \u0027fancy\u0027 MM tags, which if say using PartCatalog (I love that mod), actually places new parts in their respective mod\u0027s tab, instead of being placed into the RO tab. Part of the folder organization also easily allows a person to cut/paste the folders within RedAV8R to the GameData folder, which while the same folder names may exist no files are overwritten.
