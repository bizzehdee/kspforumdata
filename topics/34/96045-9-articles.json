(Just a couple of months)\u003Cp\u003EI had the same problem as TheDog and Munitions where the timer would not start to count down and the contract would say \u0022CommSat III (New), Vessel: Not CommSat IV\u0022 I thought that it was because I set the satellites up in the wrong order. I did CommSat I, II, and accidentally did IV then I did III, but the contract highlighted the right stuff. So I was like why are you not working. I followed the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://remotetechnologiesgroup.github.io/RemoteTech/tutorials/c16network/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ERemoteTech tutorial\u003C/a\u003E to learn how to set up a perfect or almost perfect network. Anyway I also edited the satellites orbits like in the tutorial to have them sync up with each other by editing the \u0022persistent.sfs\u0022 file in my save game. I don\u0027t call it cheating if you\u0027re a perfectionist like me.

I figured I\u0027d correct the orbit later, so I launched the 4th and it put the satellite between the 1st and 2nd, which of course also would need to be corrected.

I noticed that in the contract it seemed to decide for itself which one was CommSat I and which was II etc. At one point yesterday, I got all four up and in a connection ring around the planet. But the contract did not complete because it said that CommSat I did not have a direct connection to CommSat II. There was definitely a connection ring though. The contract seemed to believe that the satellite on the far side of Kerbin was number II rather than III like it visually appeared. At that point I figured maybe it had hard assigned identities to the satellites and I tried moving them around so that the contract would be happy. Shortly after that, the contract failed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday, I simply renamed the satellites as soon as they got into space.

If the game didn\u0027t crash at least once an hour, this would be a lot easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, I can report that the contract does NOT fail now due to changing the satellite names.

Since it is first on the list, I assume the contract views this as \u0022CommSat I\u0022. Also, CommSat 0.4 is the one directly connected to KSC, so that does make sense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, looking at the next entry, it is looking for CommSat II. It lists in white the requirement for a direct connection to CommSat 0.4. This is strange, since the only satellite NOT connected to 0.4 is CommSat 0.2 on the far side of Kerbin. But why does the contract consider THIS to be CommSat II? Shouldn\u0027t it be picking 0.1 or 0.3? Both of those are connected to 0.4. Is this because CommSat 0.2 was the SECOND satellite I put into orbit?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext, we see the contract looking for CommSat III. Here, I am completely confused. In RED, it has the requirement \u0022Not CommSat 0.4\u0022 Does this mean that the contract is somehow LOOKING at 0.4 (again) when assigning CommSat III? This makes no sense. In white, it has a requirement of being directly connected to CommSat II, which apparently is 0.2, so that would be consistent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly, we see the contract looking for CommSat IV. It shows a requirement for being directly connected to 0.4. I\u0027m not sure what\u0027s happening here.
