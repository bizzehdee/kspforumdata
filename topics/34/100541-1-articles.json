It also features an [autopruner](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/101309-Script-AutoPruner-v1-1-Prune-those-parts-that-suck-up-your-RAM%21-%282015-018%29) script to remove the surplus fueltanks from nearfuture, and a texture for the nuclear fuel drum.\n\nThe tank content values were mostly eye-balled from the existing parts. I tried to make the hydrogen tanks somewhat less massive, so you\u0027ll need a bigger volume tank to fuel your LVN and near future engines.\n\n**Features:**\n\n- Liquid Hydrogen is now a tank type for procedural liquid fuel tank\n\n- A procedural nuclear fuel drum with a custom texture for the Uranium and depleted Uranium fuels\n\n- Argongas is now a tank type option of the procedural xenon tank\n\n- Autopruner script to remove hydrogen, argon, xenon and nuclear fuel drums from Near future propulsion/electric\n\n**Installation:**\n\nJust drop the contents of the zip into your gamedata folder.\n\nFor instruction on how to use the autopruner script see the [autopruner main thread](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/101309-Script-AutoPruner-v1-1-Prune-those-parts-that-suck-up-your-RAM%21-%282015-018%29).\n\n*Planned for next update:*\n\n- A few more PP textures to make up for the loss of the nice Near Future argon and xenon tanks.\n\n- Further integration patches.\n\n*Maybe some day:*\n\n- a set of modular struts and cosmetic parts to compliment PP.\n\n[Pic](https://www.dropbox.com/s/tqowg3b1lz3knm2/NukeTank.jpg?dl=0) \n\n[DOWNLOAD](https://www.dropbox.com/s/xqud35f0s5baguc/NFPforPP.zip?dl=0)\n\n**License:**\n\nThis mod is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported (CC BY-SA 3.0) license.
