But it\u0027s definitely harder than Tylo, with about the same delta-v needed as to get off Eve. Getting into low orbit takes a lot of delta-v by itself since there\u0027s no atmosphere to aerobrake in, but you can use nuclear or ion engines for that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-09T17:08:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow, that\u0027s incredible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope to put a probe down there.

It takes about 1000 m/s to capture. Flying around in the Sentar system takes surprisingly little delta-v since Sentar has a low mass. Ringle is the same size as Tylo, Erin is the same size as Laythe, Skelton is the same size as Duna (except its atmosphere is a lot thicker so it\u0027s harder to take off from). And Thud takes about 2000 m/s to go from low orbit to capture/escape and about 4500 m/s to land on or take off from.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESerious takes about 2700 m/s to get to from LKO, and 2000 m/s to match Joker\u0027s orbit.
