I\u0027ll just draw some comparisons, to point out the newly arisen issues. Basically, all stock engines were brought closer together in terms of ISP, upping this significantly for 2.5m and 3.75m models. This was needed, as some engines basically had no use cases.

After all, it can be made basically irrelevant by adding batteries weighing less than 0.1t...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Hypergolic compared reasonably well with the Poodle now I think. You effectively lose 10% thrust, sea-level-performance and some gimbal for the ISP boost in space and the oddity that it uses Monopropellant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Vesta also still compares nicely to the skipper. It\u0027s once about 10% less powerful, but gains some efficiency for quite a bit of extra weight. If it\u0027s worth it from a performance standpoint would probably depend mostly on the vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow the Maverick is where it gets tricky. In it\u0027s primary stats it is now noticeably inferior to the Mainsail, which has ~7% more thrust and, more importantly, significantly better ISP (ASL and Vac) with the rest of the stats being equal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally the Griffon is a bit of an outsider as it has no direct comparison, the only reasonable option would probably be the larger KR-2L. The stock engine is lighter (despite the fact that\u0027s its a 3.75m variant) and provides more thrust at significantly better ISP in space (at ASL it\u0027s equal). Yes, the KR-2L is an upper stage engine, but the comparison to the S3, which is a launch stage, doesn\u0027t work much better: While the Griffon is now finally a bit lighter (but not much), it\u0027s missing almost 70% thrust and it\u0027s space ISP is almost equal to the S3s ASL ISP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know that the KW pack can be seen as a replacement pack, but what I\u0027ve always loved about it was the fact that it perfectly fit into the stock balance model. Now the real question becomes: Is KW not officially no longer balanced against stock and meant to be played separately, or will you restore the balance somehow? It would also be perfectly fine to include a module manager config that re-adjusts the stock engines as an alternative to reworking the KW stats (but I\u0027d still prefer the latter).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly (and unrelated to the above) I\u0027d like to join \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/51037-0-24-KW-Rocketry-v2-6b-Available-New-5m-Parts%21-21-07-2014?p=1294602\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1294602\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EB787_300 and his request\u003C/a\u003E for a lander-capable, flatter engine.

Using x64 bit should allow you to use RAM way beyond your computer\u0027s capability, so any crash is not related to that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your game crashes with a KSP error window(the one that has only Ok as a button and the date of the output folder), then the error is probably caused by a mod or the game itself. If, however, you crash with windows errors - it means you are not running the 64-bit game and the 32-bit is running out of memory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou also did not include a single KSP output log.
