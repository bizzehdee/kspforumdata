Placed the sheild with the final decoupler stage before the pod and parachute. The red integrity bar popped up and I waited for re-entry. The re-entry effect started and seemed to be in full effect when I was transported to oblivion (black screen at the 555555 alt). Went to the tracking station without ending the flight and the only flight running was this one. Clicked to reinitialise the flight and it had turned into a small RCS fuel tank on sun escape trajectory??? Tried to replicate this again for some screenshots but no success after 3 attempts.
