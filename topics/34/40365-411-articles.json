I do not believe that anything changed in .24 that requires the .dll to be recompiled in order to function. Compiling is the process of turning the human readable text document that is written into the code that computer understands natively. Compiling is done by a special program called a compiler, which is usually part of suit of development software called an SDK used by programmers to write software. Usually, you only need to recompile if a part of the written code used in the software has changed. Basicly, if the part of the underlying code (the API) that the plugin utilizes is changed, the software must be recompiled or, more often, rewritten to adapt to those changes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know that running 64 bit will cause any problems that aren\u0027t just inherent with 64 bit\u0027s instability right now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is always worth it to mention any issue you may be having as knowing about potential issues is the first step in rectifying them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-20T10:36:59Z\u0022 title=\u002207/20/2014 10:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 20, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by WaveFunctionP\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sidfu","CreatedById":70409,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-20T10:41:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E[LOG 06:34:11.005] [KSP Interstellar] Exception caught adding to: radiator-1mw part: System.NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E at FNPlugin.PluginHelper.Update () [0x00000] in \u0026lt;filename unknown\u0026gt;:0 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[ERR 06:34:11.007] Cannot find module \u0027ModuleDeployableSolarPanel\u0027 (-298629360)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eis one error u get for kspi\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Donziboy2","CreatedById":74984,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-20T12:20:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NeoAcario\u0022 data-cite=\u0022NeoAcario\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHas anyone started a public spreadsheet or anything so that we can work towards a consensus of part and fuel costs?\u003Cp\u003E~Steve\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave not had any ambition to play lately, let alone do any spreadsheets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith costs it should be: AM really expensive, Tritium midpoint, Uranium still expensive but cheaper then Trit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll the other resources are fairly inexpensive, or they are dependent on the price of one of the above items.

First, I sent up a satellite with a 3.5m Akula fission reactor, with a 3.5m electric generator positioned right under it. I put 6 huge radiators on it (my radiators are upgraded to Graphene radiators because I have experimental electrics researched), and in ground tests this setup produces 1.91 GW of power with no complaints and zero heat accumulation. I put the same thing into orbit and the generator is producing less than half a gigawatt of power, the reactor (although running at 100%) is only producing 2.2GW of thermal power, and when I shut the thing down it took almost half a year to cool down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis isn\u0027t normal, is it? I mean, my supposed max heat dispersion with those six radiators is 5x what the reactor is capable of producing. Even assuming that they don\u0027t work as efficiently without an atmosphere this seems extremely....weak for the largest reactor with the largest generator attached to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, I have 4 satellites spaced apart in a 750km orbit around Kerbin, each with a microwave transceiver on it set to relay mode. None of them will detect that the others exist, nor will they detect that my wimpy power plant is transmitting 450 MW of power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny ideas, suggestions, hints? This is my first delving into microwave power transmission and so far I\u0027m very underwhelmed. I realize that fission reactors are entry-level but...well, I could live with the low power production if they\u0027re actually only supposed to produce that much, but the fact that I don\u0027t appear to actually be able to USE it is annoying at best.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Well, I figured out the solution to problem 2...the satellite relays will only activate if something\u0027s actually demanding power.
