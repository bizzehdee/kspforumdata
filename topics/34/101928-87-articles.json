Folks, let\u0027s please try to stick to the topic.\n\nPlease remember that the purpose of a mod thread is to be *\u003Cu\u003Eabout the mod\u003C/u\u003E*.  A guide to mod-thread posting etiquette:\n\n- *\u003Cu\u003EDo\u003C/u\u003E* post in a mod thread with questions about how to use or install it, if you\u0027re having trouble figuring it out\n- *\u003Cu\u003EDo\u003C/u\u003E* post in a mod thread with feedback about how much you love the mod\n- ***\u003Cu\u003EDon\u0027t\u003C/u\u003E* post in a thread asking \u0022please update\u0022, ever**\n- ***\u003Cu\u003EDon\u0027t\u003C/u\u003E* post in a thread asking \u0022when will an update be available\u0022, ever**\n- It can be okay to include a comment like \u0022looking forward to the next update!\u0022 in your post (but that shouldn\u0027t be the *\u003Cu\u003Eonly\u003C/u\u003E* reason for your post)\n\nIn addition to the above, some general rules to remember when posting on the forums:\n\n- Please refrain from name-calling, even if you\u0027re thinly veiling it in an attempt to be clever.  Doing so is inflammatory, contributes nothing to the discussion, and violates [forum guidelines](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/guidelines/) rule 2.2.d.\n- Sarcasm is best avoided (or, at least, used with extreme caution). On internet forums where the written word is all we have, it\u0027s extremely easy to misinterpret and can be [very difficult to distinguish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poe%27s_law) from serious intent. Don\u0027t be surprised if people take you at your word.\n- If someone else is behaving in a fashion that you believe to be inappropriate, please don\u0027t respond.  That tends to invite further response and can quickly escalate into a flamewar.  Instead, just **report the post**, with an appropriate note, and the moderation team will review it and take appropriate action, if called for.\n\nIf-and-when the author or maintainer chooses to post an announcement that says \u0022okay, it\u0027s ready for 1.1\u0022, *\u003Cu\u003Ethen\u003C/u\u003E* you can report bugs if it doesn\u0027t appear to be working correctly.  But until then, let\u0027s all just relax, shall we?\n\nThanks for your understanding, and let\u0027s get back to the purpose of this thread, which is discussing the incredibly cool and awesome KIS/KAS mod (and **not** \u0022when will it update\u0022 or \u0022hey, it doesn\u0027t work in 1.1\u0022).  ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"Padishar","CreatedById":97386,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-07T09:45:41Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, Koritastic said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Hey all, I attempted a temporary update for 1.1 for use until a maintainer finishes their work on the mod.
