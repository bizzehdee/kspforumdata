Replication is fairly simple, just swapping from then back to the station far enough away to unload it will cause the panels to be retracted, but the mount to be rotated into tracked position on reload. Mostly lately I\u0027ve seen two or three retract buttons, and clicking them causes one extend and one retract button to pop up. Clicking the extend button almost always causes it to simply disappear, and going through all of the retracts until they hit 8 buttons, then re-extending them causes them all to disappear."},{"CreatedByName":"Hachiro","CreatedById":147543,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-02-01T00:44:42Z","Content":"![JKwWuv0.png](https://i.imgur.com/JKwWuv0.png)![DrMwjtV.png](https://i.imgur.com/DrMwjtV.png)\u003Cas found=\u0022\u0022 on=\u0022\u0022 load-in.=\u0022\u0022 both=\u0022\u0022 panels=\u0022\u0022 had=\u0022\u0022 effectively=\u0022\u0022 identical=\u0022\u0022 readouts=\u0022\u0022\u003E\u003C/as\u003E\n\n![Kb1zn2K.png](https://i.imgur.com/Kb1zn2K.png)\u003C Kept clicking retract panel until it stopped appearing\n\n![MogILGH.png](https://i.imgur.com/MogILGH.png)\u003Cclicked extend=\u0022\u0022 panel=\u0022\u0022 and=\u0022\u0022 let=\u0022\u0022 it=\u0022\u0022 fully=\u0022\u0022 extend.=\u0022\u0022 other=\u0022\u0022 side=\u0022\u0022 behaves=\u0022\u0022 the=\u0022\u0022 same=\u0022\u0022 way.=\u0022\u0022\u003E\u003C/clicked\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"TheShadow1138","CreatedById":53694,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-02-01T03:04:17Z","Content":"Spoiler\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 17 hours ago, Hachiro said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [![JKwWuv0.png](https://i.imgur.com/JKwWuv0.png)](https://i.imgur.com/JKwWuv0.png \u0022Enlarge image\u0022)[![DrMwjtV.png](https://i.imgur.com/DrMwjtV.png)](https://i.imgur.com/DrMwjtV.png \u0022Enlarge image\u0022)\u003Cas found=\u0022\u0022 on=\u0022\u0022 load-in.=\u0022\u0022 both=\u0022\u0022 panels=\u0022\u0022 had=\u0022\u0022 effectively=\u0022\u0022 identical=\u0022\u0022 readouts=\u0022\u0022\u003E\u003C/as\u003E\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [![Kb1zn2K.png](https://i.imgur.com/Kb1zn2K.png)](https://i.imgur.com/Kb1zn2K.png \u0022Enlarge image\u0022)\u003C Kept clicking retract panel until it stopped appearing\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [![MogILGH.png](https://i.imgur.com/MogILGH.png)](https://i.imgur.com/MogILGH.png \u0022Enlarge image\u0022)\u003Cclicked extend=\u0022\u0022 panel=\u0022\u0022 and=\u0022\u0022 let=\u0022\u0022 it=\u0022\u0022 fully=\u0022\u0022 extend.=\u0022\u0022 other=\u0022\u0022 side=\u0022\u0022 behaves=\u0022\u0022 the=\u0022\u0022 same=\u0022\u0022 way.=\u0022\u0022\u003E\u003C/clicked\u003E\n\u003E\n\nI\u0027ll do some tests and see what I can come up with in the way of what\u0027s going on and how to fix it, hopefully.\n\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EUpdate:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/u\u003E  I\u0027ve done some testing and I think it has to do with the fact that I used only one animation for each deployment.  I think that when the \u0022Extend Panel\u0022 buttons are  clicked in quick succession that the animation keeps getting started over and only the first, or last deployment registers as fully extended.  This then leaves the others in a constant state of \u0022Status: Extending...\u0022.  There is a temporary workaround while I work on getting this completely fixed.  If you click each \u0022Extend Panel\u0022 button one at a time while letting the entire animation play before pressing the next \u0022Extend Panel\u0022 button, and repeating.  This will take much longer to deploy the panels, but it will still be deployed after unload/reload or packing/unpacking.  I\u0027m going to keep playing with it so that the procedure is not so complicated/time consuming.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-02-01T18:34:13Z\u0022 title=\u002202/01/2021 06:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 1, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by TheShadow1138**"},{"CreatedByName":"Hachiro","CreatedById":147543,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-02-01T22:42:14Z","Content":"Thanks for looking into it!!

I never really liked how the Solar Array Wing part deployed, but it worked, or at least it did.  At some point since the initial release of the SAW and other ISS parts if you quickly extended all of the arrays, only the first or last would actually work because the game apparently only registered one fully deploying.  I believe this was due to the fact that I had a single animation that was being used by all of the arrays/radiators, so the animation was getting played over and over and over, and the game only registered one full deployment.  This means that you could end up in a situation where you have a huge solar array deployed, but it won\u0027t charge anything.  That has been fixed!!!\n\nThe \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Part Action Window\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Part Action Window\u0022\u003EPAW\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E is much more sane and labeled.  You can now safely attach all toggles to an action group, or quickly activate each panel without having to worry about whether or not it will function properly.  First deploy the array, then activate the panels and radiators as quickly, or as leisurely as you wish, it works as expected now.  There was also an issue where the array would not stay deployed after moving focus away from the vessel with the array and back again, and it would not allow redeployment.  This too should also be a thing of the past.  Let me know if any new bugs have popped up, and happy launchings!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-02-02T01:41:01Z\u0022 title=\u002202/02/2021 01:41  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 2, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by TheShadow1138**"},{"CreatedByName":"u0fw","CreatedById":209799,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-02-02T16:11:33Z","Content":"Does the updated version work properly on 1.11.0?

Simply select the SM fairing wall, rotate it 180\u00BA, change symmetry to 3 (really anything other than 1) and attach to the node facing the camera in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, and you should be good to go.\n\nAs for the Launch Escape Tower, it is in two parts (the top with the jettison motors and the bottom with the abort motors and the boost protective cover).  Attach the top of the tower to the CM first, so you will have a spire floating over the CM, then attach the bottom of the Launch Escape Tower to the upper part of the Launch Escape Tower.  Hope that helps get you flying."},{"CreatedByName":"ksp player","CreatedById":217451,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-11-16T08:10:30Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 6 hours ago, TheShadow1138 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E To attach the Orion Service Module to the Exploration Upper Stage use the 5m Amun-Ra Fairing.\n\u003E \n\nI figured it out, but another problem, with the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E decouplers, it\u0027s really hard to get the struts to connect, because most of the time one strut isn\u0027t touching the tank, and the other strut clips through the tank.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-11-16T14:04:37Z\u0022 title=\u002211/16/2021 02:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 16, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by ksp player**"},{"CreatedByName":"TheShadow1138","CreatedById":53694,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-11-16T19:02:00Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 10 hours ago, ksp player said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I figured it out, but another problem, with the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E decouplers, it\u0027s really hard to get the struts to connect, because most of the time one strut isn\u0027t touching the tank, and the other strut clips through the tank.\n\u003E \n\nI assume you mean the struts that are on the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E decoupler models.  Are you using the attachment nodes to attach the decouplers?  I just did a quick check and the 4-segment and 5-segment \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E decouplers\u0027 modeled struts sit flush against the SLS core stage tank.  Regardless, the struts modeled on the decouplers are cosmetic and do not actually serve a structural role.  You will still need to use struts to prevent the SRBs from flopping around, but they can be placed so that they are not very noticeable.\n\nNow, if you\u0027re using the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E decouplers on other tanks (stock or other mods) I cannot guarantee that they will sit flush and look as though they are connected to the tank since I modeled them with the SLS and External Tanks so that they would look right with them.  Now, those tanks are 5m diameter tanks, so I suppose any 5m tank would work fine, as long as the decouplers are placed properly."},{"CreatedByName":"BSS_Snag","CreatedById":205397,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-12-21T23:57:56Z","Content":"[@TheShadow1138](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/53694-theshadow1138/) Quick question, what size is the orion capsule in this mod?"},{"CreatedByName":"TheShadow1138","CreatedById":53694,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-12-25T02:01:22Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 12/21/2021 at 6:57 PM, Aussie Toad Stool said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [@TheShadow1138](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/53694-theshadow1138/) Quick question, what size is the orion capsule in this mod?\n\u003E \n\nThe Orion capsule is 3.124m in diameter.  It\u0027s a very non-standard size I know, but I based everything off of having the SLS Core Stage be 5m in diameter.
