I\u0027d like to hear your ideas though!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo after a good 12 hours worth of sleep, I finally caught on to what is happening with the pipes not attaching, and it took me a whole 30 seconds to SEE what is happening, and I doubt there is anything I can do about it, even with attaching a fake command pod as a root part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem seems that if you pick something up that isn\u0027t the root part, pipes and struts are temporarily disconnected. So when you click on the subassembly icon to save, the ship is saved in that state, with pipes disconnected. Forcing a command pod to be attached during the saving process, then removed at when loaded, I don\u0027t think is going to help any, because the pipe doesn\u0027t have a proper connection point when its saved, but when its reconnected to a part of the vessel that has parts connected, it works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThings I know:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- When a subassembly of the ship is removed from the main part of the ship with the root command module, the pipes are temporarily disconnected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- When that segment is reattached, the pipes know who to connect to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- If you duplicate the same segment of the ship and attach, the pipes know who to connect to, and its not the prior part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- You must save the ship in a state with all parts connected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI *THINK* part of it comes down to a routine in the code that checks to see if things are connected or not.

He skipped a lot of steps to get the results that he desired in his post which caused me to do the re-reads and filling in some of the blanks. I\u0027m not discrediting him, and I think this definitely good stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s what he\u0027s doing step by step for his \u0022delete root\u0022 trick.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- He first takes and removes all his fuel stages, and puts it to the side, but keeps his decoupler attached to the main part of the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- He then takes the rest of the ship (Payload) and deletes it, so now he\u0027s left with an unselected fuel assembly, and no root part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- He goes into the Structure tab, selects the decoupler. The decoupler now becomes the new root part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- He re-attaches his fuel stage to the decoupler, and probably adds the RCS jets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- He then saves and does his file management stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the existing methodology SAL uses, I can\u0027t reproduce all those steps. First, I can\u0027t do any activity in the editor without a root part. Second, selecting the parts that need to save and dragging them up to the SAL icon is borked because of the temporary disassembly of certain parts and their state when the save is done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo using his methodology to get the ship to a certain stage, as long as you drag the entire ship up to the SAL icon, you\u0027re golden, and SAL is working as intended. This never was the fight I\u0027ve been having, although I may have skewed by looking at command pods only. Should have been looking at the \u0022root\u0022 part. Unfortunately I associated the root part as a command module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe bottom line differences at the actual saving stage within KSP is that when SAL saves, the ship is partially disassembled, UNLESS you drag the root part. Using his method, the ship is assembled. By all rights, all he has to at that point is just drag the ship up from the decoupler to the SAL icon, and he can skip on the file management.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo this means one of two things, and I\u0027m open to a third, fourth, fifth... hundredth option;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA\u0026gt; Leave things as is and just deal with broken pipes and struts. Just throw a warning if a fuel line or decoupler is found saying something like \u0022Loading this structure may not work due to fuel lines and struts not being attached during the save process\u0022 when saving.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB\u0026gt; Allow saving only if the root part of the ship is selected. Error/cancel out if the part isn\u0027t selected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOption A seems the most tasteful as there might be times when you just want to save an overly complicated RCS tank with about 50 RTGs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Boamere","CreatedById":68058,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-16T20:32:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow do I save ships with this, is there button i need to press?
