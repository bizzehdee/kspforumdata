I found with the (default) settings that a stock install of KSP adding Kopernicus and your alternate textures increased RAM usage by an average (I did 5 runs each scenario) of 195MB from stock. Texture replacer will not remove textures, but it does destroy them when it is swapping out to a new one!\n\u003E \n\u003E By using Texture Replacer to add dummy textures to all of the original planets when the game loads, you can vastly reduce how much RAM is used when Kopernicus goes through and adds your new textures. I have created 8x8 pixel pink textures (1x1 loaded inconsistently or INCREASED RAM usage- wth?) for all of the original planets for use with Texture Replacer. These tiny textures can be swapped to by Texture Replacer and then overwritten by Kopernicus, they will STILL be loaded but they are incredibly tiny and still net a positive outcome.\n\u003E \n\u003E Using this method I had the following results (RAM usage, not disk space):\n\u003E \n\u003E Kopernicus \u002B New Textures = \u002B 195MB over stock\n\u003E \n\u003E Kopernius \u002B New Textures \u002B Texture Replacer \u002B Dummy Textures = \u002B 46MB over stock\n\u003E \n\u003E I am not sure if you would want to add the dependency of Texture Replacer, but if you wanted to check this out or maybe include it in a future pack I wanted to inform you about what I was messing with.\n\u003E \n\u003E [NH_DummyTextures](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_CrRC_HheiDdUVQemQtQXFEYmc/view?usp=sharing) (copy over TextureReplacer- should be no overwrites unless you already have alternate planet textures in place)\n\nHad a look today and the net gain was more than around 270MB tbh, adding in TR as a dependancy now, BETA 2 for the stock planet textures will be up as soon as I finish tweaking some textures later today ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"ChrisSpace","CreatedById":140622,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-15T09:43:52Z","Content":"Quick request:\n\nCan you please add a patch that, rather than changing the kerbol system, moves all the new NH planets to a new star system in KerbolGalaxy2?
