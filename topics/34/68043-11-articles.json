No real-world fuels burn in that mass ratio, and the density ratios don\u0027t correspond to any known real-world fuels. More importantly, though, methane burns in a 1:4 mass ratio of methane:oxygen (CH4 \u002B 2 O2 --\u0026gt; CO2 \u002B 2 H2O, with each O2 weighing twice as much as each CH4).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if you simply have the Sabatier Reactor produce \u0022LiquidFuel\u0022, you\u0027ll be producing a fuel that is a lot higher portion of a methane:oxygen engine\u0027s fuel supply than its real-world equivalent (only 20% of methane:oxygen\u0027s fuel supply will be methane), and thus, is *LESS* useful for using in combination with the In-Situ Resource Utilization system of KSP-Interstellar, which allows you to easily produce virtually unlimited amounts of Oxidizer on the Mun by electrolyzing aluminum-oxygen regolith (such regolith makes up a large percentage of Luna\u0027s surface in real-life).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssuming the KSP-Interstellar pack allowed players to produce the mod\u0027s \u0022LiquidMethane\u0022 resource from your mod\u0027s reactor, they would be missing out on the opportunity to produce a resource that could burn in a 4:1 mass ratio with easily-available Oxidizer (KSP-Interstellar\u0027s methane engines work on the real-world stoichiometric ratios), and instead having to settle for obtaining a resource that only burns in a 10:11 mass ratio with Oxidizer, drastically reducing the potential for mass-leveraging to the point where burning it with Oxidizer harvested from the Mun could not possibly be economical...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-16T19:12:51Z\u0022 title=\u002205/16/2014 07:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 16, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Meridius","CreatedById":106907,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-17T18:24:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow about some batteries to fit in the wedges during earlier career mode?
