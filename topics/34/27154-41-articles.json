I came to the conclusion that it simply can\u0027t be done with legs that actually use the landingleg module. Anything other than a solid, non-moving attachment broke apart with anything higher than around a 2m/s vertical speed upon contacting the ground. Performing a soft landing in the ocean just off the shore from the KSC returns the same amount of cash as landing it on the pad, so I\u0027m going to have to go the ocean landing route for now. As for the gridfins, they are fully functional and make great retractable wings for jets and spaceplanes as well as SpaceX rockets. I have two smaller sizes that are included with the updated Launch Pack that I will upload for testing shortly. Here\u0027s an example of a spaceplane design that uses my new gridfins:\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://electrictomatoes.com/ksp/screenshot5a.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://electrictomatoes.com/ksp/screenshot5a.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELazarus, any chance you could release the landing legs we saw in a few earlier BFR shots?

As much as I liked making the opening hatch on the Dragon V2, the \u0022correct\u0022 way to make capsules in KSP is with a solid model for the outer view and a rendered interior for the internal view. Having a rendered interior in the main capsule model kept me from being able to render the interior of the capsule in the internal model used for cockpit views accurately and added unnecessary geometry for KSP to process. Also, the windows are now able to glow when lights are on, just like the new Kerbal spaceplane cockpits.
