And now it works. The solution? Exactly the same hardware but I\u0027ve upgraded to Windows 7 this week, and now KSP works with the Soviet pack nicely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wish the craft files hadn\u0027t been removed however; I downloaded a fan-compilation of them, with Mir components mounted on a Proton, but it doesn\u0027t seem to have enough fuel to put the Mir Core into anything but the basic 100km orbit, and I suspect there\u0027s not enough fuel to get the other parts to meet up with it. Is this because it\u0027s not entirely as it should be? And whilst the fan-made crafts had the Buran, there wasn\u0027t the Kliper, and remembering how much trouble we all had earlier putting that together and trying to get it to fly, it really would be lovely, as well as helping Bobcat himself if he included a standard build we could all test against still.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill... after months I can finally fly the Buran again.
