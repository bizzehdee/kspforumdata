Well, hydrogen and helium are the main components in this. Whats to say that the force of the very reactions behind some of the atoms themselves pushes them out of the star itself? I mean, there is a high chance that since it\u0027s basically a ball of fire, and that it is very large, giving it a strong gravitational pull, then they might not get out at all, but if they do, there would be an unseeable cloud surrounding the star. Of course, mining it would be a very tedious task, considering the rate would be low, but it could work, cause, ya know, free stuff is free.
