The most major change is the implementation of a Variable Recovery Rate model (though you can switch back to the flat rate model previously used). I wasn\u0027t really planning on adding this because it\u0027s pretty similar to how DebRefund works, but \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/magico13/StageRecovery/issues/1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis issue on github \u003C/a\u003E was opened and so I decided to implement it my way (but leave the flat rate option available, you can switch in the settings menu). That link also includes a fairly detailed explanation of how the model works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Variable Recovery Rate model has two cutoff velocities, a low and a high. If the velocity is below the low cutoff you get 100% of stock recovery, if it\u0027s above the high cutoff you get 0% (and the recovery failure event is fired). In between the cutoffs the recovery rate follows a quadratic formula which I refer to as the \u0022Recovery Curve\u0022. The default Recovery Curve (6 m/s low, 12 m/s high) is presented below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, Blizzy\u0027s toolbar is now supported for accessing the settings menu and the API was updated. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you use KCT along with this then there is now the fun feature of recovered parts now being too damaged beyond repair to be added to the part inventory (but funds are still returned), conceivably the first major interaction between the two mods (additionally, KCT doesn\u0027t have a variable recovery rate or Deadly Reentry support).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Also forgot to mention, but this now (should) support KSP-AVC for version checking.

In the meantime, you can disable failed recovery messages in the settings menu (space center scene, if using Blizzy\u0027s toolbar you\u0027ll have to enable the button) if you don\u0027t really need them. Then at least you won\u0027t be spammed by the messages. Additionally, I may alleviate the issue some in the future as I\u0027d like to try to consolidate all the recovery messages for a launch into one message, instead of one per stage. I just haven\u0027t figured out the best way of grouping the messages together yet.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"malkuth","CreatedById":57414,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-03T04:11:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMagico you have my permission to grab the rocket assisted auto landing from mce 23.5 version.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/malkuth1974/KSPMissionController/blob/master/plugin/MissionControllerEvents.cs\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ECode\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith this and the other auto recycle no point in adding it to mc2.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-03T04:15:20Z\u0022 title=\u002208/03/2014 04:15  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 3, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by malkuth\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magico13","CreatedById":73338,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-03T04:24:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022malkuth\u0022 data-cite=\u0022malkuth\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMagico you have my permission to grab the rocket assisted auto landing from mce 23.5 version.\u003Cp\u003EWith this and the other auto recycle no point in adding it to mc2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you!

I dropped the stage just before I finished my circularization burn. In other words, the dropped stage had an apoapsis of 80k and a periapsis of about 35k. This put it on an \u0022aerobrake\u0022 re-entry.
