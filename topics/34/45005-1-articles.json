The part is a plat that can be attached to the bottom of the upper stage stack - you can attach an engine cluster using octo-structs, and then attach the lower stage (probably a decoupler) to the node that is floating below the stack, at which point then fairing will be added.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s23.postimg.org/ifigca92z/screenshot6.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot6.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/pwb-engine-fairing-for-clustered-engines/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EDownload from spaceport\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003ELicense\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELicensed under \u003Ca href=\u0022http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ECC BY terms (attribution)\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EVersion History:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E0.0.1 - Initial release\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-12T09:40:02Z\u0022 title=\u002209/12/2013 09:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 12, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by codepoet\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Espelling\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"restordoc","CreatedById":70262,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-05T10:53:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh, goodie!

Float Node is just a baseplate (ie with no fairing), and a floating node below it (or above it - you can rotate it if you need to). The clever bit is that the position of the floating node can automatically adjust to be just clear of whatever is also attached to the base plate (engines, or tanks\u002Bengines or anything else). I will try to dig out a few pictures of stuf I have been doing with it - it just did nit really occur to me to release it, but perhaps it is worth a go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next step after that is I think to add the idea of floatnode to the engine fairing, and generate the fairing procedurally to account for the required length. This was the original idea, but prcedural fairings came along, and I stopped to see what functionality it ended up with. Most fairing things can be done with procedural fairings, and the floatnode can solve the problem of attaching a lower stage. Perhaps with a little work (and now I have more experience writting plugins for KSP) and a little time I can come up with something that is not currently possible.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bowman3002","CreatedById":57234,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-03T00:06:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHave you ever thought of having the radius of the part procedurally adapt to the part it is attached to as well?
