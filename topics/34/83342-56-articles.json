I only have ~100 days to get everything designed, tested, and launched into orbit before the transfer window opens. It\u0027ll take minimally three launches (infrastructure first, then refueling, and finally Crew) so I can\u0027t afford to waste any time with excessive warping. I do let a few days or weeks go by when really focused on one mission, but I don\u0027t want to have to utilize every second of my time to the fullest because that\u0027s just a bit too much for me. I do try to keep \u003Cem\u003Esomething\u003C/em\u003E building just to pad the inventory or increase the number of times a part\u0027s been used.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMight add TestFlight to my install, just to make things extra interesting. KCT\u0027s simulations have the option of disabling part failures, so you can test worry free or can test as if it were a real launch. When CrewQueue gets to a stable point I\u0027ll probably add that too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am curious what other mods people pair with KCT to enhance their experience.

The issue that KSP will inevitably run into with veteran players is looking for something more to do, something more to plan for, something more to handle. Once you have the basics down, it\u0027s very much a game about planning. I\u0027ve said it before, but that\u0027s what I like about your mod is it effectively turns time into a resource that can be used. Rather than just punish the player for an arbitrary metric, you can feel success and failure based on your own perceptions of your standing within the game: did you complete the challenges to succeed in your goals? Coupled with life support, a rescue mission is very much a race against the clock and one proper planning can either prevent or persevere against. I don\u0027t think those are good starting points for new players, but anyone who enjoys the game is very likely to start dabbling in one or more mod that adds further challenges and restrictions to the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I hate about TAC though is that it is SO FREAKING UGLY.

Half the KCT infrastructure should support that, but I think half doesn\u0027t.\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Aaaaannnnddd now the Debug versions fully (mostly) support Kerbal Konstructs. You set the launch site at build time, and each launchpad has its own rollout and reconditioning queue.
