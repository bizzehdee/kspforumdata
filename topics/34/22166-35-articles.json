I\u0027m new to the forums, and I have a small grasp on KSP. I\u0027ve finally refined my knowledge of Delta-V, (wish I had found flight engineer before studying all of the equations and such ._.) TWR, piloting and such to where I\u0027ve built a launcher that can successfully (and quite easily, actually, with plenty of fuel left over in the last stage) put a satellite/lander in orbit with the Mun.\u003Cp\u003ENow, my question is this; Does the orientation of the space craft affect the overall quality of the scanner? I currently have a satellite (below) orbiting the mun and scanning for kethane. Does the scanner have to be pointed at the surface? And if so, how can I do that? The satellite for some reason always moves away from where I\u0027ve aimed it, and this makes it a pain to keep it pointed at the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imgur.com/DsH38IN\u0022 alt=\u0022DsH38IN\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, my satellite scanner only shows me a small 1 pixel line, though, instead of a large map.

My lander has the converter and is the main storage for kethane, and the rover goes out and collects kethane to store back in the ship. The problem is that the clamp-o-tron is on the top of the lander, and is practically impossible for me to get back onto. I can provide a pic if needed... but I\u0027ve already spammed this thread with previous pictures XD\u003Cp\u003EAlso, this is the first time I\u0027ve actually mined kethane, so I\u0027m quite proud! c: (although that doesn\u0027t mean anything if I can\u0027t convert it ._.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELook into getting KAS mod, it really makes that aspect of mining ops very simple.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Conarr","CreatedById":60613,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-15T01:44:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LegyPlegy\u0022 data-cite=\u0022LegyPlegy\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis is my 3rd attempt and 2nd design at a Munar Rover driller.

I had a little issue that made the Kethane mod unplayable, but got it taken care of. Let me share what happened and the fix in case anyone else faces this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem was when I had the small survey scanner on a rocket and clicked launch, I would get a view of space with no rocket to control. Effectively I could not launch. Removing the scanner gave me the launch pad, so it came to the scanner.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat seems to have caused this is by using the Kerbal mod manager. It seems to have no installed correctly. Why do I conclude it was the mod manager? Because when I removed what the manager did and installed the mod manually (as if that\u0027s hard to do in the first place), everything now works just fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo there you have it. To anyone out there who gets to see space at launch, just reinstall the mod outside of the manager!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"entaran","CreatedById":67823,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-15T07:03:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis might seem really retarded, but what part to you use to generate \u0022KIntakeAir\u0022 for Zero Bypass Turbines?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
