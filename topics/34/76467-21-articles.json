If you wanted to ask the community in general for another chute mod then you very well could have created your very own thread to ask the question. Now, you\u0027ve gotten your answer not once, not twice, not three, but four times. Two have been implied, the other two quite explicit. Just so there is no confusion...here it is again...REMOVE RealismOverhaul from 0.24 of KSP. Once you do, RealChutes will work JUST FINE. Now go play, and wait for the new release of RO that is built for 0.24 and it\u0027s updated dependencies.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"frisch","CreatedById":71659,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-22T02:21:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDear RO devs\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERealism overhaul is absolutely fantastic, your work is much appreciated. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf practical, once it is running in 0.24, it would be nice to have a list of the associated mods that are also known to be functional. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFWIW, the sandbox version is fine with me.
