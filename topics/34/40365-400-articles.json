It may not be the most efficient, but it does work.\u003Cp\u003EWhat this means is if you need 3 reactors, you only need one generator, not one generator for each reactor, but the generator must be attached to one of the reactors or a thermal receiver.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee my videos in my sig if anyone is unclear about how power generation works.
