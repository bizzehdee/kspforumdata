Drift is easily avoidable, all you need is to have same period (semimajor axis), and inclination. This is a bit more difficult to achieve on low gravity worlds (Gilly is almost impossible even without signal delay). However since they are smaller, they allow for pretty big drift, also since drift happens each orbit, slower orbits will drift slower. A 3 sat on 750km over Kirbin can easily stay in sync for at least 60 years. If you have signal delay on, you probably will need a few extra tools, such as precise node. You will likely need control station or kOS for such a precision on other planets, or just a manned misson to deploy each sat. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESame applies for stationary sats. Even though they won\u0027t be strictly stationary, as long as your inclination is around 0, and your period same as the planet, you\u0027ll be fine. They are much more difficult to keep on place though, as the inclination will cause drift. Haven\u0027t found any particular use of these to be honest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe easiest way to deploy them, is do all 3 in the same mission. Get in desired \u0022circular\u0022 orbit. Deploy one. Get the mothership on eccentric orbit in such a way, that after 1 or 2 orbits, you\u0027ll be on the needed angle. You can do this with a node, paying attention to the distance. Decouple the other 2. Wait for position, circularize second orbit, wait, circularize third. What is important is your period, orbits needn\u0027t match, other than the inclination. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou need 2 dishes to each moon/planet to connect different sat systems. 2 of the three sats will be visible at any time (provided third body is not between), so at least one of the dishes will connect. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe time you need more than 3 sats is too big body (eg. jool/kerbol), or bodies with atmosphere. Most omni antennas will break under high dynamic pressure, so you\u0027ll probably need more than 3 for eve/kirbin/laythe landing probes/planes. You\u0027ll need quite a constellation in fact. I have found that adding one of the unbreakable dishes to your craft is much better solution.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEasiest way for interplanetary communication is solar orbit close to the planetary one, but apart from kirbin, this is not particularly easy to accomplish. Eccentric polar orbit with Pe at one of the poles works pretty good as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn any case, you might want some redundant connections, in case other planets/moons come in between, and most notably kerbol.
