Ended up using ATM Aggressive and the 128MB Volumetric Clouds--and a lot of runs to get all the textures compressed. After it finally launched without crashing, the sky was large blotches of red and white, Kerbin has a blotchy glowing sky both on the ground and from space, and Duna had a dark side with a blotchy glow. Removing the Skyboxes mod fixed them. To get rid of the unwanted blotchy glow, had to remove both Core Clouds and Lightning. Launched and looked okay, but memory was ~3500MB. So I went with launching that with -force-opengl to get memory down to under 1600MB.\u003Cp\u003EI too was wondering what the difference is between the 2 Sun options.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3500MB is definitely dangerous territory for hitting 32 bit KSP\u0027s RAM limit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI spent some time today setting up a 64bit KSP install to use for taking pretty screenshots. I installed the 256 volumetric clouds and all the optional graphics packs. I also added about 50 mb worth of some random textures I found a long time ago, Remote Tech 2, and my standard UI and Info mods. Without forcing opengl or using Active Texture Management, KSP seemed to use about 5 and a half GB of RAM on average.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am very surprised how well KSP ran with those mods. Besides the occasional lag due to physics calculations, I was getting 60 fps pretty much everywhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAstronomer, you have done an absolutely amazing job with this mod! KSP has never looked more beautiful! Keep up the good work! I wish 64 bit KSP were more stable. I\u0027d love to see what you would come up with if you didn\u0027t have to worry about RAM limitations. Also, why did you reduce the amount of clouds on Kerbin? I think I prefered how Kerbin looked in the previous release. Kerbin doesn\u0027t quite look right to me. Kerbin\u0027s colors seem washed out. The oceans are too light, and they blend into the ground texture too much. I have no idea what all you can do, but I think Kerbin would look a lot better if the colors were brought out, with a much deeper blue for the ocean, that the white clouds would really contrast against, and deeper more organic colors for the land.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do love what you have done with Jools clouds!
