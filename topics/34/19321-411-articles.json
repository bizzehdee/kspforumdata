The air doesn\u0027t magically travel over the top of the wing at one speed, then massively accelerate around and underneath to catch back up with the already-accelerating plane (engine thrust) in FRONT of the wing to then push it up.

As Ferram4 pointed out somewhere, disturbances, like a wing, cause pressure and density fluctuations which travel in all directions with the speed of sound. Thus you get pressure variations upstream of the wing. The pressure distribution plus inertia mostly drive the flow around. There are viscous forces, too, but as first approximation they can be neglected. Mathematically, this is formulated in the Euler-and Navier-Stokes-Equations.

That\u0027s the whole thing that makes subsonic flow subsonic, as opposed to supersonic flow. If you consider it wrong that someone should be annoyed after the person they\u0027re talking to (claiming to ask for answers) simply hasn\u0027t bothered to look at any of the stuff that has been provided as answers, then I dearly hope that you come across someone exactly like you in your field. I expect that you will be perfectly understanding when they deliberately ignore everything that has been said to them. I expect that you will be perfectly understanding when they claim that the integral parts of a theory are proof that it is fragmented (seriously, thin airfoil theory starts as incompressible (linear by definition) potential flow, which leads to the standard solutions of source, doublet, and vortex flows (with singularities at their origins, hence the name...), which leads to creating the flow over an airfoil by a distribution of those singularities (hence, singularity distribution method), which then simplifies down to the defining characteristics of thin airfoil theory:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethat dCl/dAoA = 2pi per rad\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethat camber shifts the AoA of zero lift by the factor -1/pi * integral{dz/dx * [cos(theta) - 1] dtheta}, where x = 0.5 * (1 - cos(theta) and z is the height of the camber line\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethat there is some amount of upwash ahead of the airfoil, and some amount of downwash due to the circulation about the airfoil caused by the vortex distribution\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethat the entire distribution of lift is built around the fact that the flow must separate at the trailing edge, forcing the pressure gradient about that and the vorticity there to 0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethat all of the lift on the airfoil is created by the requirement that the flow separates at the trailing edge, and that in the absence of that, no lift is created\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut it seems like you didn\u0027t bother to look at any of that. If you\u0027re really here to learn, I don\u0027t see why you didn\u0027t bother. Oh, btw, that fluid sim you used? You might want to try it without the airfoil stalled, since I know that you picked that orientation to deliberately reduce the circulation around the airfoil and create less upwash at the leading edge. And you had massive flow separation even at 0 AoA, which indicates that you set it up with either too low a Reynolds number or too large a cell size. Next time, for your counter-example, you might want to actually set up the sim properly; maybe show the settings that you used as opposed to hiding them, hmm?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E@Kitspace: \u003C/strong\u003EBecause teachers fail at explaining things, and then people like Jared muddy things up. Follow that with the fact that we focus on Bernoulli\u0027s equation a lot (which is more useful as a tool rather than an explanation) and the fact that no one wants to accept, \u0022they\u0027re both correct explanations, just coming from different angles,\u0022 and you get flamewars on the common correct topics, which keeps people from dealing with equal-transit-time theory and AoA-doesn\u0027t-produce-lift theory and mystical-earth-focused-lift theory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFAR uses the best models that can be run in real-time. In particular, it uses a modified form of lifting line theory, which is a generalization of thin airfoil theory to 3d wings. There are a few modifications to handle sweep, changes in Mach number, and of course, supersonic flow, where the trailing edge really can\u0027t affect the leading edge. But otherwise, it uses exactly the theories that I would point Jared to, if he would take a minute to actually read them rather than dismiss them in ways that prove he never bothered to look at them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kitspace","CreatedById":109786,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T17:50:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat kind of airfoil is used for calculations in game?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"damerell","CreatedById":123074,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T18:09:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022JaredTheDragon\u0022 data-cite=\u0022JaredTheDragon\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf it was a simple question, you\u0027d have a simple answer.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAir molecules bounce off the wing.

Pulling absurd manuevers in an overloaded airliner will cause the wings to come off.

For one, of course it flips back, you put the main gear in front of the CoM; if the gear is in the correct position, then all this proves is that you put the CoM in the wrong position. For two, your vertical tails actually look a little too small, which will cause yaw instability. For three, the cockpit / nose section looks like it\u0027s about 2m too short.
