It is heavily inhabited by Pudding Krakens, but if you get past the fact that touching the surface of Sprinkle can cause it to explode (literally explode...), its possible to make a planet with a diameter of less than 1k. The funny part is, because of its small size, to be able to give it a grabbable SOI, its gravet ASL is 0.3 which is more than the surface of Duna... its really funny, because if you have a strong enough ship, you can literally roll yourself into orbit, because a 10m orbit hight only takes ~19m/s!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nicholander","CreatedById":108347,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-16T20:32:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI see, but honestly though, I really don\u0027t want this mod to have super unrealistic things like impossibly tiny yet super massive bodies like that.
