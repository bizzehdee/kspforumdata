In fact excessive numbers of struts can sometimes cause worse problems than they solve. I had one craft that I downloaded from the net that when launched just led to cascading structural failures and the more struts I added to fix the perceived problems, the worse it got. I think I fixed it by reducing the struts to key areas. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I\u0027m getting off topic a bit, but lately I\u0027ve been experimenting with dephysicalizing all decouplers.
