I know, the license of it says it is not required, but you should at least mention that the stuff is not from you. Don\u0027t say now you modified the configs and it would be totally your work now. I totally agree with the others, TheShadow could have just made his own thread, but he\u0027s so kind to work for you (sounds not that good, didn\u0027t know how to express it otherwise ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif) ).\n\nMy advise now: Let this thread delete, or merge it together with \\*your\\* development thread, you can see that it is not ready for a release.

Could you please not link to my mod because I might add a CARV. I have not implemented a CARV yet and with my sporadic activity who knows how long that would really take, and I\u0027m not comfortable advertising what I\u0027m up to till I actually have some thing to show for it.
