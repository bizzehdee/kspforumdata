However, here is what I think is going on:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, this mod does directly not touch gimbals in any way, it controls the SAS system through which KSP controls the gimbals. Is there any possibility you could do a test of the same flight profile with manual control inputs to see if the gimbals exhibit the same behavior? My suspicion is that this is something in the stock SAS system that is revealed because this mod applies SAS in incremental steps, not one large setting like the stock SAS settings do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, you first say you set the throttle to 100%, then later on say that this mod did not fire the engine. I\u0027m not sure what you mean here as this mod does not control the engine throttle at all. Because this mod specifically does horizontal velocity only, it leaves the throttle alone so whatever method you are using to control your vertical velocity (whether by hand or another mod) is free to control the throttle so you can control your altitude above ground and not crash. Do you mean the \u0022Speed%\u0022 value in the settings window of this mod? That is not the throttle setting, that is how fast the mod will attempt to tip the vessel. Larger vessels need to reduce this value to damp out a pendulum effect their higher mass exhibits at the default settings. (The Vertical Velocity mod in my sig is what I used while developing this mod.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThird, you say you set an altitude setting of 5000m. Above this altitude the mod will not try to do anything, below this altitude you should see it trying to do something. Note that while the mod is trying to control the vessel, the icon on the toolbar should get a yellow border to inidicate the mod is attempting to cancel your horizontal velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll run some tests when I get home from work to see if I can replicate any of this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ED.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MisterFister","CreatedById":85686,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-17T23:32:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis looks like an intriguing mod for my upcoming career mode.
