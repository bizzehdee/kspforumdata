Same goes for any other IVA or objects that gives him issues. I\u0027m seriously fed up with KSP\u0027s lack of proper Mod and texture management support.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving to copy textures that are shared by multiple objects was it for me (and yes if it weren\u0027t for Naz doing some workarounds, each station module would have had its own internals folder with copies of the same texture file), which pardon my French but is bull**** and demonstrates total lack of proper experience, design, and quality control on behalf of Squad. This needs to be priority number 1 before spending a dime on NASA inspired DLCs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you guys would like more quality \u003Cstrong\u003Efree\u003C/strong\u003E mods made by me, you guys as a community will have to request from the Developer the following:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Textures \u003Cstrong\u003Emust\u003C/strong\u003E be able to be shared by multiple assets regardless of their designation, whether they are a prop, internal, or external. Preferably a dedicated Textures folders the way Skyrim and pretty much any Mod friendly game does it. This helps the issue of having to repeat the same texture on assets that share it. As it is right now (I\u0027ve never seen an engine do such an inefficient and absurd method) each part must have its own Internals folder, and even if the same texture is shared, a copy of that texture must be in that internals folder, and a copy of that texture gets loaded into memory (I can\u0027t confirm that). That is absolutely absurd.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Texture and Asset memory management. Folks are already cutting parts and mods off. An argument could have made that all the Phases in the KSOS could have been separate. But guess what? The savings you would have received by having it separate wasn\u0027t that much since all the parts shared the same textures. However, because of the way that KSP is currently configured, you would have had to \u003Cem\u003Ere-download and install all textures used by the other phases shared by each other anyhow\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Internals should be treated like any other object. Allow us to specify directly where the Internal geometry\u0027s textures are located.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-A workaround for texture lookup could be a Unity KSP export tool that allows the modder to designate specifically the location of an object\u0027s textures. The asset will always look in those folders first and then check the default folders if it doesn\u0027t find its texture. Alternatively, KSP should use a Textures folder with a part subdirectory. Modders place textures here and point to them in their exporter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the end these suggestions help everyone:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Squad wins because it means more quality mods out there. It makes their own asset scalability and production cheaper and efficient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-KSP owners can have more mods installed in a game lacking content.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Modders have an easier time getting their mods to work on a variety of systems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have zero interest on further phases. That includes Phase III which includes the larger 2.5meter KSO, why? Because it shared assets from the first KSO and the other phases. Unfortunately that would mean having copies of the largest files (such as the cockpit textures) inside the internals folder of the Super 25. Same goes for the moon lander and pretty much any other IVA\u0027ed object I create. And as you all know, my goal is primarily IVA\u0027ed spacecraft and spacecraft components.

The KSOS, in comparison, uses much less RAM, because of the texture sharing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Razorcane","CreatedById":66919,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-14T07:09:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe reason KSP is such a memory hog is because of how it loads its data. Most game engines, including Unity, use a database system to compress and decompress data, which takes less resources. Older versions of Unity didn\u0027t have this, which is what KSP is based on. I\u0027m not sure what version of Unity it was, but I remember Felipe saying he started the game nearly 10 years ago, so the technologies back then aren\u0027t what they are now. Of course, KSP is updated to the latest version of Unity, and they could make use of all these new features, but these features would require a re-coding of the game (the entire game if they want to make the conversion to 64-bit), which unfortunately Felipe doesn\u0027t really want to do. It\u0027s a shame, since this game could be so much better.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
