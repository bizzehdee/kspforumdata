I have a space hotel, and I completed a contract to bring some tourists to it, which generated the follow-on contract to bring the tourists back home.  So I brought the tourists home, but after landing and recovering two of the three spacecraft they were in, I realized I\u0027d forgotten to actually accept that second contract.  The contract was still available, and when I accepted it, all its \u0022recover kerbal\u0022 objectives showed as \u0022incomplete\u0022 even though most of the tourists were sitting on Kerbin, available for another launch.  I fixed the situation by putting those tourists in a pod on the launchpad and recovering it from there, at which point the contract showed their recovery objectives as \u0022complete\u0022.  (Then I brought home the last group from the hotel, to complete the recovery contract overall.)\n\nI know this might just be a limitation of Contract Configurator, but if possible, the \u0022recover kerbal\u0022 objectives ought to be automatically marked \u0022complete\u0022 if the kerbals are already on Kerbin when the contract is accepted.\n\nOn a slightly different note: the thread\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u00221.
