I WILL launch into the plane of the target if it\u0027s more than a couple degrees off equatorial, but I\u0027ll launch into a substantially-different target altitude to make sure I\u0027ll get a decent phase angle pretty quickly. For instance, if my target is at 100 km, I\u0027ll launch to 150 km. If my target is at 300 km, I\u0027ll launch to 150 km - 200 km.

I can execute a rendezvous this way with almost zero RCS usage if I have a medium sized vessel or smaller, and with Navyfish\u0027s Docking Port Alignment Indicator, I can do the final approach and docking manually quickly and reliably, with no need to hand over control to the auto-pilot and bite my nails. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMJ has a lot of wonderful and data and flight tools (precision parachute landing being the newest - thanks Sarbian and codepoet!) but I\u0027ve never had much luck with auto-docking and auto-rendezvous.
