Our current offers are as follow:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFRG-50 \u0027Snowman\u0027 heat sink: Engines heating up too much, yet can\u0027t afford to drop your thrust? Slap a few of these around your engines and all your woes shall disappear*!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Not pictured)Radiator Winglet: For when a Snowman is too much, or in the case the ejected fluid\u0027s drenching your stuff. Stick em and they\u0027ll deal with a bit of the heat once active.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECLD-8 Radiator: Need more than a snowman, but the Winglet doesn\u0027t cut it? Then this is for you. Safely gets rid of more heat, at the expense of being a bit heavier. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAV-T1R Bleed Winglet: This piece of high technology uses an experimental alloy dubbed Jebedianite to gather and expel massive amounts of heat**. While quite useful, it\u0027s very heavy for a winglet, due to the nature of the alloy. Get yours now and get a free bottle of glow-in-the-dark soda!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELV-T30a Fuel Collector: Research has shown that only a fraction of the fuel used is actually burnt. This tries to remedy to the problem by capturing back a certain amount of it. Might slow you down a bit in the process, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEAS-8 Carbon Connector: Tired of these flimsy strut connectors? Fear no more! Recent advances in technology allowed us to weave short-ish sticks of stable graphene, the nigh-indestructible material*! No more shall your side-mounted SRBs get torn off!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBalsa Connector: Standard aluminum struts not long enough for you? Look no further! Made out of the ever-viable Balsa Wood, these struts are able to stretch up to two times the length of a standard connector strut \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003Eat the expense of being slightly flimsy\u003C/span\u003E!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECHLL-2 Heat Conductor: For when a standard fuel tank can\u0027t get the heat quite quickly enough to your radiators. Holds no fuel, but allows passage through, and allows nearly direct interface to your radiators. Just be sure there are such, because if your stuff\u0027s overheating, your fuel tanks might not like getting all that extra charge. The insulation prevents heat from bleeding off, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFRST-5 Thermal Pump: Similar to the Snowman, only it doesn\u0027t bleed like a woman on her period. Follows your other engines\u0027 throttle to drop off just the right amount of coolant to keep them clear of a fiery catastrophe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESHTB-10 \u0027Shotball\u0027 Liquid Booster: Your SRBs don\u0027t fire for long enough? Need a booster that won\u0027t crap it\u0027s pants when it\u0027s nearly out of fuel? Look no further! The SHTB-10 is the solution for all your problems*! Just stick one of those onto your fuel tanks and watch your aircraft blast off! Just stay aware that it is still a booster, and like every good booster: \u0027Once you pop, you can\u0027t stop!\u0027. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003E*Results not guaranteed.

Similar principle, different use: this one generates fuel at the expense of negative (upwards) thrust. For fuel economy (haven\u0027t done the math, with the upwards thrust...
