How about had one accelerate so hard that even Jeb complained afterwards? Are your VAB workers lazy drunken idiots who don\u0027t get the job done (as opposed to mine, who are lazy drunken idiots who get the job done)?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, then, what you need is the new line of Vulpine Kerbospace MASS SIMULATORS!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESharing dimensions and general appearance with the classic SAS module, the VK Mass Simulators are much simpler parts, simple slugs of solid metal that serve no purpose other than being large, heavy weights. This gives them endless uses, from simulating payloads on test launches, to counterweighting unbalanced booster designs, to disciplining unruly employees by crushing them underneath! \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:48px;\u0022\u003E(DISCLAIMER: Vulpine Kerbospace neither promotes nor condones the use of any VK parts to inflict deliberate injury upon anyone, no matter how much they deserve it.)\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVK Mass Simulators come in three versions, differing only in density and thus total mass; the \u0027heavy\u0027 model weighs approximately 18 tons and is made of depleted uranium, the \u0027standard\u0027 model is made of iron and weighs about 6 tons, while the \u0027light\u0027 model is made of aluminum and weighs just over 2 tons. This flexibility allows you to tailor your ballast load to the requirements of your booster and mission with minimal effort.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWARNING: Due to their solid metal structure for minimum cost and maximum density, the VK Mass Simulators have limited heat tolerances. Refer to their operating manuals or your MSDS for the appropriate material to identify the thermal limits at which they will suffer structural failure due to melting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPICTURES:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe three separate VK Mass Simulators, mounted atop VK\u0027s reusable suborbital test booster (non-production item, not available to customers). The \u0027light\u0027 version is mounted below the command pod, the \u0027medium\u0027 version below that, and the \u0027heavy\u0027 version is directly above the test booster\u0027s SAS module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KM2Z9.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022KM2Z9.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThree tracking camera shots of the test units, following booster jettison.
