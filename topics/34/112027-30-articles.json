Nah, I\u0027ll stick to using the Poodle or Rhino, because I suck at keeping things lightweight (gotta have all the science experiments on the lander, and that means a fairly large lander, especially when you\u0027re sending that lander all the way out to Jool).  \n\nI think that comes from balancing based on the LV-N, which is in a very sad state relative to the performance of its real-world counterpart, IIRC the KSP devs specifically said \u0022we made it pretty bad so it doesn\u0027t just render the regular rocket engines obsolete\u0022, when in reality that\u0027s exactly what it would do... if humans were immune to radiation damage like Kerbals are anyways. So I remove about 2 tons of mass from the LV-N, and double the thrust, and half the amount of stock heat it generates, and hey presto the LV-N is looking like a pretty good alternative to the Poodle now, even if it is still pretty heavy and low thrust in comparison. I mean stock the LV-N is only putting out 60kn of thrust in a vacuum for almost 4t of engine mass, which is quite frankly awful unless you have the patience of a saint, which I do not. Then you have to factor in the amount of radiators, which just makes the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E (and therefore burn times) worse, and then you need even MORE radiators to handle that longer burn time.  \n\nPoint being, I can make a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E based interplanetary transfer stage for a rocket fairly easily. Yes, nuclear rocket engines are more complex, but they\u0027re supposed to reduce trip times, not increase them, and since you can time warp past the slower transfer speeds of \u0022\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E rocket\u0022-friendly transfer trajectories, it ends up being MORE of a headache to use the stock nuclear engine than it is to just use the dang old boring \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E rockets, which is exactly the opposite of the result I think they wanted.

The only time high thrust actually matters is for landers and launch stages.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-08-13T23:08:28Z\u0022 title=\u002208/13/2021 11:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 13, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by coyotesfrontier**"},{"CreatedByName":"SciMan","CreatedById":12748,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-08-14T16:54:06Z","Content":"Yes, but the problem I run into is that I have a finite amount of game-play time available per day, and I don\u0027t want to spend that time watching a single burn for a single maneuver (or for escaping the gravity well of a massive planet like Kerbin or Jool, multiple periapsis kick burns).\n\nBarring any specific mods for it, I can only run the game while doing a burn at 4x real-time speed, while I can run the same game while NOT doing any thrusting at up to 100,000x real-time speed.\n\nSee the issue here? The longer the burn itself takes (not the transfer), the longer the whole transfer takes from MY perspective, not the perspective of the Kerbals that may or may not be crewing the vessel, because I\u0027m an outside observer that has time-control powers. Lower thrust but higher \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E actually makes things worse, because while you spend less (real out of game) time at 100,000x, you spend a lot more (real out of game) time at 1-4x.\n\nThe issue becomes \u0022make the burn as short as possible to maximize time spent at 100,000x real-time speed\u0022, not \u0022make the transfer itself take as short of a real-time period as possible\u0022.\n\nAnd for that, chemical rockets are simply the best for it, because they have the THRUST, and the vacuum rated versions of the chemical engines (Terrier, Poodle, Rhino, Cheetah, even the Wolfhound) still put out a great deal of thrust while having a specific impulse that can get the job done provided you can build a big enough launch vehicle to get the transfer stage into orbit.\n\nBut I want to use the high technology drives, and so I guess my problem is better stated as \u0022I don\u0027t like how time works in this game.\u0022\n\nCan someone suggest an up-to-date mod that either allows thrusting while in on-rails time warp, while not even focused on the vessel, or at the very least allows higher levels of time warp while thrusting (ie. make the sim run at faster than 4x while thrusting)?  \n\nI know KSPI-E has a part of itself that lets you thrust while in on-rails warp, so hopefully that is available as a standalone mod.  \n\nI think we\u0027ll have to wait for KSP2 to get the \u0022thrusting while not focused\u0022 working.  \n\nI remember there being one or two mods that let you have different levels of time warp available, but I have no idea if those are updated for the current version of KSP (or current enough to work right).\n\nAny help with that would be appreciated, because if there\u0027s one thing I hate while gaming, it\u0027s \u0022grinding\u0022 or tedium masquerading as \u0022difficulty\u0022. Over in the KSP2 discussion forum, I\u0027ve made my position known that I hope the colonization part of the game doesn\u0027t become \u0022milk run simulator\u0022 because that\u0027s just more tedium.
