For those of you who help keep this pack in the top pages of the forum, who answer posts when I can\u0027t get to them, and to those of you kind enough to donate and follow the development of this pack, I present you with a pre-release of V0.1.1. It\u0027s not on Kerbalstuff, it\u0027s not on the OP. Only those reading this post will know where to find it.\n\nWARNING: DELETE THE ENTIRE MARITIME PACK DIRECTORY IN GAMEDATA BEFORE INSTALLING.\n\nI\u0027m introducing an entirely new directory structure to the pack so I can more easily maintain sub-packs. Not deleting the previous version could lead to... strange results.\n\nLots of new changes and parts have gone into this pack. Those of you reading this and grabbing this prerelease will also find a new part I haven\u0027t announced, the Gangway. This is a fully animated part that I simply could not exclude from paddlewheelers, they all had them. Surface mount them to the bow or side of your ship, drive up to the beach, lower the gangway and your Kerbals have a safe and easy way to walk ashore.\n\nAnother new part is the Clipper Deck Adapter. This part is designed so that you can add a second layer of Paddlewheel Quarters to your ship and have it look correct. Attach this part to the top of any Paddlewheel Quarters and then you can mount another Paddlewheel Quarters to the top of it and have it look like it belongs there. (the bottom of Paddlewheel Quarters are designed to inset on the top of the clipper deck, like the CVE parts. This part gives them a square bottom instead of the angled inset one).\n\nPowered sterns are gone. In their place under \u0027Engines\u0027 is a new clipper surface mount engine. You\u0027ll also find the new paddlewheels and stacks under engines.\n\nThe rudder has moved to utilities.\n\nGobs of new stuff including sounds, flags and lots more has been added. There are now 43 parts in the pack. AND, all of the textures have been converted to dds for MUCH faster load times.\n\nFor those of you who read this and download this pack... feedback please! I\u0027ll put it out to the public in the next week and though I\u0027ve tested these parts, I\u0027ve probably forgotten something or goofed something up. You are my guinea pigs. Please make the squeal noise if I screwed up.\n\nDownload the pack here: [KSP Maritime Pack P014](http://www.datainterlock.com/Kerbaltopia/Maritime)\n\nNextly. I\u0027ve intentionally left out instructions on using this pack to see if I created an intuitive set of parts. It seems I\u0027ve only partially succeeded. In the future, now that I have Win 10 64 bit, I\u0027ll attempt to create some videos of building ships and how the parts are intended to work. Once you know the intent, you can do any crazy thing you want. Since I\u0027ve seen some mount cradles on top of their boat, I have to assume I\u0027ve failed.\n\nTo help you transition to some of the new parts in this pack, I\u0027ve uploaded an example paddlewheeler to sketchfab and annotated a few parts. I can only annotate 5 with the free account. This should help explain how some of the more odd parts work and where they belong. Be sure to look at the annotations (the numbers) and read them if you\u0027re not sure how parts work (like the cradle which is completely redesigned)\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022640\u0022 height=\u0022480\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nFinally, last month, the Maritime pack was recognized by Sketchfab, where all the cool rotating 3D images come from. There was a blog post by the Sketchfab Community Manager entitled: [10 Craft you don\u0027t expect to see in Kerbal Space Program](http://blog.sketchfab.com/post/123981811324/10-craft-you-dont-expect-to-see-in-kerbal-space). Considering how many really, really nice models are uploaded to Sketchfab, I was pretty shocked that they even considered mine. Well, if he thot this pack was strange last month, that\u0027s only going to get magnified with this release.\n\nEnjoy guys and thanks for the support and donations!\n\nOh, and if you guys think you use the Maritime Pack in strange ways...

Something new for you to create your... interesting... videos with ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif).\n\nUploading a new pre-release P0.1.2 with some fixes.\n\nFixed the CVE stern - Had to lengthen it by 1m to fit the new, longer rounded clipper stern.\n\nFixed the engine not reversing - This had more to do with the location of the thrusttransform than anything else. In the old stern engine the thrust was actually located somewhere around the rear of the stern rather than at the propeller. When I first built the pack, one of the issues I had with the thrust being locate at the prop was that the boats would eventually lift the bow out of the water and begin flying due to the trust/COM angle and the fuel being located in the stern. I kept that location with the new engines. But, that meant when you tried to reverse the thrust, it was trying to thrust against a hull piece. So, the thrust is now closer to the engine but, this may lead to the bow lifting again. The solution is one of two things. \n\n1. Make sure you have a Clipper Hull LF with fuel somewhere around the middle to bow of the boat. This moves the mass forward and helps to keep it from lifting up.\n\n2. Bitts. If you have too much thrust and the bow lifts out of the water, transfer mass to bitts located on the bow of the boat to help hold it down. \n\nI just tested one ship with 2 engines and 2 Clipper Hull LF in the middle up to 110 m/s with no compressed water on board and it didn\u0027t have a problem staying waterborne. If you\u0027re Jatwaa inclined, flying boats may be your intent \\*cough\\*.\n\nFixed the CVE deck crash tolerances - something I intended to do and forgot (a suggestion by a user some time back). The old crash tolerance was at 50. If you tried to land at a speed \u003E 50 m/s on the CVE, the deck would splode. It\u0027s now set to 120.\n\nTweakscale - I\u0027m going ahead and putting this out with P0.1.2. I\u0027ve added tweakscale to the parts I think should have it. A few caveats. No part with a door or hatch will be tweakable (with one exception, the CVE Bridge). Tweaking anything with a door leads to HUGE doors and tiny Kerbals. This means most of the new paddlewheel lower cabins and Texas are un-tweakable. Most all other parts, including the hulls, are now tweakable up to 4X. WARNING... the Clipper Hull LF has normally 750 LF. Tweaking it up to 2X increases that to 6,000 LF. Two of these on a hull at 2X tweak means you have 12,000 LF fuel! The ships mass increases along with this. A basic ship at 2X tweak with 12,000 LF is well over 70 tons. Make sure you add extra blisters to handle this weight! You can tweak up to 4X but... get this... the LF in the Clipper Hull increases from 750 to 48,000!!! You have been warned.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-19T18:24:56Z\u0022 title=\u002208/19/2015 06:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fengist**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mad Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":139256,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-19T20:27:11Z","Content":"60%, 70%, I CAN\u0027T STAND IT!

A few days ago I decided to completely rework the stack. When I did, I forgot to check the node. Since I usually surface mount it, I didn\u0027t see that. Thanks.\n\nCrew Quarters Lights - Fixed. For some reason I\u0027ve yet to fathom, I apparently changed the shading from Emissive Diffuse to Diffuse. It meant, all the point lights that illuminate the walkway were working but it couldn\u0027t find a texture to light up the windows.\n\nPromenade - As intended. Here\u0027s why. The hull is the part of the boat that needs to remain intact. It makes contact with the water. Adding in nodes along the y axis of the Paddlewheel Quarters could lead to the quarters connecting along the y axis instead of the z axis. Meaning, you could put one hull part down, put a PW quarters on top of it, connect more quarters lengthwise and then put a hull underneath. So, adding nodes along the y axis would risk a rather flimsy ship. While I could put a node on the promenade along the Z axis, I chose not to because... There\u0027s two places where it\u0027s intended to be used, on the PW Quarters when they\u0027re attached to the clipper hull... AND on the PW Quarters when the PW Quarters are part of an upper deck. When PW Quarters are on an upper deck, the Deck Adapter will, or should, be used under the PW Quarters to make the bottom look square. This also adds a small fraction of height. Ok, I\u0027m getting complicated so I\u0027ll summarize. There\u0027s no node because the Promenade could conceivably be connected at two Z locations. In order to make sure you get a nice, seamless fit, the best solution is a surface mount. It\u0027s a bit of a pain to get it right, but, trust me, the alternative of adding nodes only a fraction of a meter apart would be even more difficult.\n\nPaddlewheel - Anywhere you like. The thrust comes out the bottom rear of each one. You can mount them on the sides or on the top and rotate down. What I typically do is mount them on the sides. I then go to a top-down view and use the offset to center them on each side of the hull. Then, I use the offset again to move them closer to the hull so that the bottom inside of the paddlewheel cover lines up with the red waterline. If you take a look at the sketchfab model of the paddlewheeler, you\u0027ll see what I mean. Those are actually attached to the sides of the boiler rather than the hull.\n\nWhite - I know it\u0027s hard to see on some settings and gamma but, every new part and hull part has at least an overlaid \u0027smudge\u0027 texture to add a bit of dirt. The hulls have another texture under that that somewhat resembles paint that has been chipped and painted over. You may have to look close, but it\u0027s there.\n\nNew prerelease uploaded.

The mass scales exponentially on those LF tanks when tweaking. I did a lot of testing. That red waterline actually serves a purpose. If you can keep that red line at or above the surface, your speeds should be ok. If not, moar blisters. Think of it this way, using the Bitts, it\u0027s easy to lower your waterline by adding compressed water (mass).

Check back to the release post for the link to the zip. I\u0027ll just keep updating that post till these hotfixes are done.\n\nClipper CVE Bow and Stern node locations - Fixed. The Clipper Bow, Stern, CVE Bow and CVE Stern were some of the first parts I ever made. The ones in the pack now are updates to those original models. When I created them, I didn\u0027t have a clue about getting the coordinates in the right places in my 3D editor. Therefore, all of the nodes are in really goofy (mathematically bad) locations. The bow and stern were never intended to have anything connect to them other than the CVE bow and stern so it made little difference where the nodes were, as long as they matched. Little did I know that someone would eventually try to build a REAL CVE with all the accompanying beams and such under the flight deck by using the PW Cabins. Well, now the nodes are in the proper location for most any Maritime Pack part to align to them. Meaning, you can now attach CVE bow and stern parts to the deck adapter via nodes.\n\nKeep in mind, the bow and stern were never intended to match up with any PW part so if it looks odd having parts overhang the bow, it\u0027s nothing I planned for or intend to plan for.\n\nAlso, while working on these nodes I noticed some abberant mipmapping going on with the bow. In non-technical terms, colors are bleeding over where they shouldn\u0027t. I took a quick look at it and it\u0027s not going to be immediately fixable. In technical terms, as a noob, I ran my UV map to the edge of the image and now KSP is trying to mipmap a color that\u0027s outside the bounds of the image. Hence, an ugly white line on the edge of the bow.

Stacks like that should be no problem. Next major patch I\u0027ll have something with an angle to it. If you\u0027re going to tweak this though, I have flexed a bit on the tweakscale settings. In the next release the PW Quarters - Cargo and the Promenade will have tweakscale settings. IF you want to tweak the cabins, it\u0027s not something I\u0027m going to put in the final release, but it\u0027s simple to do. Just add this to the .cfg for any part you want to tweak that doesn\u0027t already have it.\n\nMODULE\n\n{\n\n name = TweakScale\n\n type = surface\n\n}"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-20T14:41:49Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Filter request - DONE!

I\u0027ll look again this morning though to be sure it isn\u0027t some tweakscale screwyness.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-20T14:44:43Z\u0022 title=\u002208/20/2015 02:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by smjjames**"},{"CreatedByName":"ThatOneBritishGuy...","CreatedById":144135,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-21T02:11:32Z","Content":"Just barely short of traveling at 70% the speed of sound in the water.

Nice to know, that limit doesn\u0027t exist.
