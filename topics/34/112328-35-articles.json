I will find the time to fix some things but it is going to be a very slow road I\u0027m afraid.  \n\nI will try my best, but cannot gaurantee anything. Instead - I am sinking all my time into KSP2 development in order to deliver all the exciting new stuff we can for KSP2 and opening up modding in KSP2 for everyone as well.  \n\nI hope you all understand.
