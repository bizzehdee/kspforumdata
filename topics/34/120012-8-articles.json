Your Kiwi gives 425 at vacuum, so that\u0027s remarkably close to what Squad deemed appropriate for stock balancing, but looking at the TWR ratio between SSME and KSP\u0027s Vector again, 73.1 (rounded to three significant figures) divided by Vector\u0027s TWR of 25, gives us 2,924, which should be the ratio between Merlin 1D TWR and Kiwi TWR. Dividing Merlin 1D\u0027s ridiculous 180 TWR with this number gives us a TWR of 62, rounded to two significant figures, and at 2 tons this implies a thrust of 1215 (1240) kN (rounded down).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can tell that you don\u0027t want to balance it in this manner, but this math implies that, if the Vector is balanced, then the Kiwi isn\u0027t. Granted, Vector is probably one of the better engines, but we should remember that its TWR is beaten by the Mammoth and is equal to that of the Mainsail so make your own judgements there. Of course Kiwi also has nerfed Isp to fit KSP standards (I\u0027m not sure how you calculated those and I\u0027m not going into that) so keep that in mind too. This might be an idea for a Vector\u002B, rather than something to make Kiwi relevant on where it currently is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo let\u0027s assume this is a Merlin 1C. (it probably always was but I\u0027m too lazy to delete my earlier assessment which may be interesting in some regards) The thing is considerably wimpier, topping out at 480 kN vacuum thrust (420 kN sea level) with less Isp and a TWR of 96. Using our magic ratio of 2,924 we get a TWR of 33 (rounded to 2 significant figures), now that\u0027s more within the realm of reason. Less dedicated lifting engines have TWR in the vicinity of 25, so 33 certainly seems reasonable for good old inefficient Kiwi. We get 647 (660) kN out of this, but we don\u0027t want to upset Gaarst so at a mass of 1.5 tons, with 431 (440) kN, Kiwi is a stock-balanced Merlin 1C. This is probably what you had in mind all along so sorry if I wasted your time. All these numbers are from Wikipedia so I hope they aren\u0027t too inaccurate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: I forgot to mention the Isp thing, well, it\u0027s hard to compare Vector to the SSME here as the SSME uses cryogenic fuel while Vector is make believe and I don\u0027t have much insight into how the other engines compare to their real life counterparts. I do know that they\u0027re generally lower so Kiwi should be quite alright at 431 (440) kN, 1.5 tons and no Isp change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit 2: Darn it!

ATM frequently has cache issues that cause problems for texture reassignment across folder boundaries. ATM doesn\u0027t help as much as it used to, now that stock KSP and most mods use DDS texture format. We\u0027ve included configs to try to stop ATM from processing this mod\u0027s folder, but that may not be working either.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-18T18:27:11Z\u0022 title=\u002212/18/2015 06:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by NecroBones\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CrashTestDanny","CreatedById":151030,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-18T19:15:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLooks like deleting ATM\u0027s cache is the cheap option. \u00A0Will try that first. \u00A0I do have Lifters. \u00A0I have not renamed any folders or moved. \u00A0Will let you know after the ATM rebuild...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CrashTestDanny","CreatedById":151030,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-18T19:31:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nClearing ATM cache solved the issue. \u00A0Thanks again for helping!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDanny\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CrashTestDanny","CreatedById":151030,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-18T22:01:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222328111\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022120012\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221450467090\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022151030\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022CrashTestDanny\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, CrashTestDanny said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nClearing ATM cache solved the issue. \u00A0Thanks again for helping!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDanny\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, the problem came back... how odd... \u00A0ATM doesn\u0027t like your new textures for some reason? \u00A0Anyhow, I removed ATM altogether and now my install is using 400M less RAM than before... odd...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDanny\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blowfish","CreatedById":119688,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-18T22:24:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222328312\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022120012\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221450476061\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022151030\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022CrashTestDanny\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n22 minutes ago, CrashTestDanny said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, the problem came back... how odd... \u00A0ATM doesn\u0027t like your new textures for some reason? \u00A0Anyhow, I removed ATM altogether and now my install is using 400M less RAM than before... odd...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDanny\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nATM is sort of in an odd place now as most textures are compressed to begin with. \u00A0Always good to make an actual comparison to see if it\u0027s doing what it\u0027s supposed to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CrashTestDanny","CreatedById":151030,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-18T22:46:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222328337\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022120012\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221450477475\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022119688\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022blowfish\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n21 minutes ago, blowfish said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nATM is sort of in an odd place now as most textures are compressed to begin with. \u00A0Always good to make an actual comparison to see if it\u0027s doing what it\u0027s supposed to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah - So it would seem. \u00A0I was a little surprised that my memory usage went down...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDanny\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
