In particular anything lurking in Parts or Plugins in KSP root related to mapsat needs to be removed, or it will probably exhibit the problem you two guys are having.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou then need to put the \u0027Innsewerants Space Agency\u0027 folder from the zip into Gamedata. If you put the parts and plugins folders from it directly into the folders in KSP root, you\u0027ll have the \u0027no icon\u0027 bug once more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, while you\u0027re at it, go into \u0027Innsewerants Space Agency\\Plugins\\PluginData\\ISA_MapSat\u0027 and DELETE the Hilo.dat file. According to Innsewerants you can do this even if \u0027update hilo.dat\u0027 is not checked and it will work fine. I was the one that originally came up with the \u0027delete hilo.dat\u0027 method and specified that you should turn the update on first out of an abundance of caution. IS says it\u0027s not neccessary, though: that just has it check for new planets and update if there are.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next time you load a ship with a mapsat part, the game will appear to hang on the loading screen for some time while it checks the planets and rebuilds hilo.dat. How long depends on your system, I\u0027m told it can be up to several minutes, so be patient. This is strictly a one-time thing: even if you have \u0027update hilo.dat\u0027 checked, it won\u0027t do this again unless you re-delete hilo.dat (or if you have update checked, automatically when a new planet is added.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe bit about cleaning artifacts.dat is only neccessary once you\u0027ve started scanning, and uses a batch file that was posted some ways back, I\u0027ve linked it several times for people but don\u0027t have the link handy. The X4R1 version tends to put a lot of duplicate entries in for anomalies, that can cause severe lag or crashing when you enable the anomalies display for a planet with a lot of duplicate entries. The batch file cleans the dupes out and eliminates that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: And yes, the X4R1 version uses ~700MB of Memory, maybe a bit less. ~600MB of that is the very large map textures, apparently due to a general problem KSP has with texture memory usage. My testing shows that it\u0027s invariant, and the size is consistent with every step involved in getting the compressed map textures loaded into VRAM is being cached for no particularly good reason(Which seems to be support by some testing I\u0027ve done). There\u0027s an included, very small, png file that\u0027s used for blank maps, but planets being scanned or not scanned doesn\u0027t seem to vary the usage (which is extremely wrong given that very small blank texture.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat ~700MB is constant, so long as you\u0027ve loaded a ship with a mapsat part on it. The map textures aren\u0027t loaded if you haven\u0027t loaded a ship that has a mapsat part on it yet, so the memory use is about 600MB lower if you haven\u0027t used Mapsat yet this session. This is the cause of most people\u0027s complaints that trying to use mapsat crashes them: They install mods up to their memory limit, but inadvertently base that on not having the map textures loaded. When they go to use mapsat, the extra memory used by the maps crashes the game, and they end up blaming Mapsat for it basically because Mapsat\u0027s doing the right thing and not hogging up memory unnecessarily all the time (As much as KSP will let it, its memory usage for textures really is terrible).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.3.4 has much smaller, less detailed (and less useful) maps, and so uses much less memory.

It looks like the load-time improvements did (holy crap, dude.) The optimizations he did to core to improve performance with \u0027high numbers of parts\u0027 did not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t really have any specific reason to suspect that he\u0027d improved the memory usage for textures, I was just hoping he had, and it doesn\u0027t look like he did.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, the problem with the memory usage, so far as I can tell, is not the AMOUNT that\u0027s being used, it\u0027s the fact that almost all of it is cache that isn\u0027t getting used. Simply having things cached isn\u0027t in and of itself harmful: actually, it can speed up loading substantially because the stuff is already there. The problem is that you\u0027re supposed to be able to dump cached items if you need the memory for something else, and KSP doesn\u0027t seem to do that. Most of it only seems to get used during scene transitions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHonestly, probably the best solution for the problem would be to set it up so that it CAN dump the cache when it needs to. The memory usage would still be just as high, but it wouldn\u0027t crash if you hit the limit: It\u0027d dump enough stuff to stay under the limit and keep going. It could slow down load times when it had to do that, because it\u0027d have to pull stuff off the hard drive again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBased on mapsat\u0027s usage though, it looks like for textures what it\u0027s PROBABLY caching is all the intermediate steps in getting the texture converted into DXT format and sent to the vidcard. If that\u0027s true, it\u0027s an especially pointless bit of cache, since it shouldn\u0027t need to re-covert it unless the texture changed in the meantime, and you\u0027d have to do a manual database reload to do that anyway. They should, theoretically, be able to just dump the original file and what looks like two uncompressed copies as soon as they\u0027re done using them, and just keep the DXT.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPresuming I\u0027m right that it\u0027s keeping the original file, two uncompressed copies, and the DXT cached (the only way I could think of to get the filesizes up to the amount of memory the maps use), dumping everything but the DXT (the only thing the vidcard can use anyway) would reduce mapsat\u0027s memory usage by about 540MB.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mekris28","CreatedById":57577,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-19T15:03:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI just downloaded this mod last night, and I have some problems with it. Keep in mind that I own a Mac computer with 4gb of RAM and an onboard Intel HD 4000 video card. I installed the mod without a hitch, and I put a map sat dish onto my craft. I launched it, and my game started to freeze when I got to 6,000m above Kerbin. It would freeze for a few seconds, then continue for a few, freeze, continue, freeze, and so on, until my game was unplayable. This problem is very consistent, too; with three reinstalls of the mod and two reinstalls of the game, it continues to freeze at 6,000m. I tried to fly another craft without any Map Sat parts, and it ran just fine. The craft I used that had map sat was nearly identical to the other craft.
