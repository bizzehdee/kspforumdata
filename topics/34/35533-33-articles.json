I was just thinking, to load a single part instead of the whole database, perhaps the mod could load up a series of \u0022dummy parts\u0022 that the welding-system updates on the fly, while at the same time also saving the part configuration file to be loaded with the game at a later time. This dummy part could then be used straight away once the parameters for the welded parts were updated to it, and then... well, perhaps the plugin could look for dummy parts which have corresponding real configs in the plugin directory when the game loads and dynamically update the craft files on load to reference the new config.\u003Cp\u003EOkay, it all sounds very complicated now that I see it written out, but it really did seem to be an answer in my head a moment ago. The point is, if the mod could load these dummy parts into the program and then update them with the new welded information similar to how a procedural part can be changed to a different shape and used/duplicated within a craft without needing to be re-shaped, then you wouldn\u0027t have to re-load the database. The only problem I see is when the game is reloaded and the dummy parts revert back to \u0022dummy\u0022 status to be used by another set of welds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, still looks way to complicated. Gah!\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI see what you are offering here, and it is a good idea, so far what I see is:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Limited by the amount of dummy set before the game need to be reloaded\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I still haven\u0027t found a way to reprocess that .cfg file (or equivalent in game: ConfigNode).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
