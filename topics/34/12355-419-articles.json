In fact, I can\u0027t even make the burn manually unless I delete the Mechjeb node first. However, I think it may have been caused by some funkiness due to docking/undocking. My current suspicion is that after undocking, for some reason the engines are no longer staged (even though they are activated), and this seems to be confusing Mechjeb.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sober667","CreatedById":116695,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T18:16:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUmmm i have some problems i dont now why i bet that is mechjeb but not shure... smart A.S.S. not working so good if i say to keep any direction its mess things up(spinn out of control or hold prograde veven if its target mode )\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E i have remotech and FAR and litlle bit of other mods\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt.

On other launches I\u0027ve had it make orbit way off altitude and then the circulization burn ends up offset by whatever the the altitude error is.

What happens is that if you have low thrust/weight and you try to circularize at ap, you end up with a pretty elliptical orbit because half your burn happens when you are dropping back down again. If you drop all the way back to 50 km before you finish the burn, you are obviously going to end up with a peri of 50km.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt.

Try turning off the AOA limiter and adjusting the shape of your ascent profile to better match the changing direction of your velocity. Ideally you should be able to adjust your ascent profile to match the natural gravity turn of your craft and never trip the AOA limit, but that takes a significant amount of fiddling with the profile and your thrust limiter.
