That totally depends on too many factors. For an efficient launch vehicle you tend to want an equal amount of deltaV in each stage, except perhaps less deltaV in the first stage if you are using solids there. You also want to maintain a TWR (thrust to weight ratio) of around 2. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. That is true for stock. For FAR you want to start your turn much earlier, anywhere from 1km of altitude down to right off the pad. You then keep your nose roughly on your surface velocity vector until you are pretty much horizontal. Aim to be horizontal anywhere from 35km to 60km in altitude. Once your \u003Cstrong\u003Eapo\u003C/strong\u003Eapsis reaches your desired orbit then cut your engines until you reach apoapsis and burn prograde to circularize.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. It is always more efficient to use all engines, otherwise they are dead weight. If you can use less engines then it means you overbuilt. As long as you can maintain enough TWR ( and beyond ascent and landing a TWR of 0.5 is more than sufficient for orbital maneuvers.) you have enough thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. I believe it works the same for Kerbin yes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. It\u0027s more efficient to burn low. Having said that a burn to the Mun or higher can take a while, and part of that time you may be burning a bit towards Kerbin and if you start very low like 70kmish then you might find yourself entering the atmosphere. Again this depends on your TWR. An extremely high TWR, above 3 - 4, and your burns are very short so you don\u0027t point too much at Kerbin at the start so you can start low. An extremely low TWR, like below 0.2, and you will need to start higher like nearer 100km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdward\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-11T03:26:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, I finally managed a Basic Jet spaceplane in FAR. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/rwAvu9\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://flic.kr/p/rwAvu9\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe whole thing is loosely based on the Avro Vulcan.
