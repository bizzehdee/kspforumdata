I realize that it\u0027s probably one of the hardest planets to get \u0022right\u0022. Some asymmetry might help, as the human eye instinctively considers minor asymmetries pleasing. For instance, nearly no human has two identical face halves, and those who do tend to look creepy and artificial to us. Symmetry can be satisfying, but it tends to pop out a lot and shove itself into our perception. Also, maybe less of a sharp contrast between the white and the green? Can you use intermediary colors?

For me, the easily visible colored haze bubbles around airless bodies are too much of an immersion breaker to appreciate the effects they create, and so I will be turning them all off. I have this deep seated personal need to have my airless bodies actually look airless, and the haze has the opposite effect. I\u0027m wondering, are they necessary for anything beyond adjusting the apparent color of the object in the sky? Like, are they required to draw the sharp terminator or other such things?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso in my personal opinion, the white clouds don\u0027t fit Duna. Makes it seem like they\u0027re water vapor clouds and that it rains regularly there.

They seem to generate no light at all during nighttime, except from a very small number of very specific viewing angles, which causes them to all light up suddenly. If I rotate the planet away from that particular orientation, though, everything immediately goes dark again. Also, I noticed that the standard EVE floaty lights are still there, floating a couple dozen meters over your city textures. Is this intended behavior? (They don\u0027t help the lighting issue though.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, what\u0027s this about some issue introduced by RSS components I\u0027ve seen mentioned in the last couple pages?

The City lights detail texture is more dynamic, and the Main texture is less hazy and looks great from LKO and low fly-bys.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve also made some color tweaks. Such as making Jool not as bright(It was hurting my eyes), The mun\u0027s colors are more grey and dark. The colors match more with the ones of our own Moon.

For me, the easily visible colored haze bubbles around airless bodies are too much of an immersion breaker to appreciate the effects they create, and so I will be turning them all off. I have this deep seated personal need to have my airless bodies actually look airless, and the haze has the opposite effect. I\u0027m wondering, are they necessary for anything beyond adjusting the apparent color of the object in the sky?
