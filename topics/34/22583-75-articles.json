Making the other geo_noseconeMain a blade results in it being swapped out, so the effect actually works. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is that KSP object sorting causes alpha transparency issues when it comes to using materials with alpha transparency on objects that need to be opaque. It assumes that because they have a certain level of transparency, they\u0027re always going to be rendered behind other objects. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis means that the prob hub ends up being \u0022transparent\u0022--it\u0027s especially apparent with the backfacing polys (namely, inside of the hub tip).

It\u0027s moot trying the 64bit build of KSP as the majority of mods are not compatable. Squad themselves have said that the 64bit build is unstable, so mod authors stay clear from it for the most part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemember, your PC could be as powerful as Skynet, it doesn\u0027t matter \u0027cos 32bit Unity is limited to somewhere between 3-4gb of memory before it likes to crash.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can do several things to fix this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-If you use beautification mods try lower resolution packs/versions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-If there are parts in mods that you do not intend on using then delete them. \u003Cstrong\u003EPlease note parts only!\u003C/strong\u003E No other type of file should be removed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Remove any mods that you don\u0027t really make use of, or any mods that have the same functionality as others in your build but do not do it as well. Resource gathering ones are a prime type here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Lower your ingame rendering to \u0027Half Res\u0027, try this before you decide to lower the terrain detail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Use Active Texture Management. This will greatly reduce memory usage but sacrifices some graphical fidelity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u002BATM users may be interested in Naten\u0027s ATM configs to handle problems such as missing Toolbar icons and the like.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Force the OpenGL mode. I personally have had little luck with this, but many many others have. This will cut your memory usage yet again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother option that I\u0027m not too familiar with is to use a DDS converter to change the format of textures into a more compressed format. It seems that DDS textures are slowly becoming popular with mod authors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWork your way down the list, it\u0027s probably in the order that I would address things. Many would just jump to using ATM and OpenGL but you can get a better looking game, with more mods, that is just as stable, if you make small sacrifices here and there, as opposed to jumping in the deep end right away. Don\u0027t get me wrong, I\u0027ve used ATM in the past and it is a great mod, I just prefer to use it as a last option.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShould your memory usage be okay, redownload the main Firespitter mod and make sure you use the updated DLLs, which are somewhere over the last few pages of this thread. A correct installation should then sort matters. I\u0027m sure all will get an official update when Snjo returns.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-02T14:29:55Z\u0022 title=\u002201/02/2015 02:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Lei07\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
