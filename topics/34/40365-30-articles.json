You\u0027re talking about safely containing the equivalent of large nuclear detonations within a spacecraft, so you split them up into multiple containers and only have to contain some small nuclear explosions. It simply doesn\u0027t make a difference, even if you\u0027re orbitally constructing a massive ship that is hundreds of metres in length, chances are the force from one of these smaller scaled down explosions will chain detonate all the other containers. Even if you somehow do manage to contain the actual concussive force of the explosion, how is your heat dissipation system going to cope with an entire reactors worth of fuel for months or years going off at once? You\u0027ve killed the ship no matter what you do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only way to handle antimatter safety is to largely look beyond the ship itself. Of course you maximise the number of backup systems you have but the key is to keep the ship away from anything that might be damaged by the explosion. That probably means limiting the amount of antimatter you\u0027re allowed to store in containers while on the planet surface and until certain altitudes above the planet are reached because you certainly don\u0027t want that size of detonation occuring by accident around a civilian population nor do you want to destroy space infrastructure, like satellites or whatever. Likely that means putting your antimatter ship in a very high orbit and onerously transporting the antimatter up in tiny quantities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure that if we reach that technological level as a species, there will be people arguing that antimatter is simply too dangerous to use as a fuel source in large quantities and people arguing about the regulations it should be subjected to but ultimately, if you want to use it for a meaningful mission in a spacecraft you either accept that that spaceship will be one of the most explosive things ever created or you don\u0027t do it.

The idea of using heat exchangers instead of combustion in turbojets was actually developed actively by the US military for a while as a means of developing extremely long range bombers, they also looked into the idea of nuclear ramjets to produce cruise missiles that could maintain virtually indefinite hypersonic flight. Both of these technologies were explored relatively early in the cold war and in the end weren\u0027t extensively developed due to the development of superior conventional jet engines and intercontinental ballistic missiles respectively. One of the major disadvantages of nuclear reactors, of course is the weight of the extensive radiation shielding needed to keep your crew safe and you can see in the mod that if you try and build a nuclear turbojet it\u0027s probably going to be impossible to get off the ground due to all the weight you need to carry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAntimatter is, I guess, just an evolution of the design and goes back to what I was saying earlier about energy density. With antimatter, you can carry less fuel and still produce more power for longer compared to nuclear fuel, which should translate to a much more powerful and useful engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0027re all fine up to there but in reality actually obtaining antimatter isn\u0027t so easy. I\u0027ve scaled up the amounts that are collectable in planetary magnetospheres by quite a bit in order to make the mod more playable, though this approach may be practical for much smaller quantities, whether you could collect enough to be useful is another question. The other way to get antimatter is to make it, much like the science lab does in this mod, only in reality the only current way to do this is with a supercollider like the LHC, in which case you build 27km circular tunnel underground that uses up massive amounts of power to produce a few atoms of antimatter that can be trapped for a few milliseconds before they escape the trap. So, we are actually funding the idea, but we\u0027re funding the fundamental research, particularly looking at better ways of trapping antimatter as well as gaining experience with technologies like particle accelerators that you could theoretically adopt for \u0022mass\u0022-producing antimatter if you decided to go down that route.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou also have forthcoming projects like the ELI that might theoretically point to a more efficient or more practical way of producing it in addition to their primary research goals.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SeventhArchitect","CreatedById":80982,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-18T02:32:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Elol, the \u0022why are we not funding this?!\u0022 quote was towards research.
