More technically, it\u0027s the angle between the plane of an orbit and the reference plane (a planet\u0027s equator if we\u0027re talking about orbiting a planet) as measured from the ascending node. If the object orbits a planet with an inclination of 0, that means it flies directly over the equator, going in the same direction as the planet is rotating. An orbital inclination of 90 is a polar orbit, 180 is a retrograde orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_inclination\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ERead this\u003C/a\u003E for more info.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s noteworthy that, technically speaking, an orbital inclination is always between 0 and 180. It cannot be less or more, since it is properly measured from the ascending node, and if the angle was negative or \u0026gt;180, you\u0027d be measuring from the descending node. That said, specifying a negative inclination is a convenient way of saying you want to launch southwards instead of northwards (i.e. treat your point of ascent as if it\u0027s the descending node).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-02T19:47:28Z\u0022 title=\u002206/02/2013 07:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 2, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Gaius\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoboRay","CreatedById":46556,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-02T19:33:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TBryson2\u0022 data-cite=\u0022TBryson2\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOk, let me see if I understand this correctly. \u003Cem\u003EInclination\u003C/em\u003E is the direction that the planet (moon) is turning. i.e. if I set my inclination to \u00220\u0022 my ship will launch in that direction.

If you are orbiting directly along the equator in an easterly direction (heading 090), your orbit is not inclined (inclination is zero). A perfect polar orbit would have an inclination of 90 degrees.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile a retrograde equatorial orbit (heading west), is technically also not inclined, it\u0027s customary to refer to it as inclination 180 to eliminate confusion.
