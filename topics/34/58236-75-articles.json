RealFuels ALREADY HAS THE CAPABILITY OF CHANGING UTILIZATION. So your entire magic show is all for naught. Good day. Happy tanking.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re overstepping your bounds. I was *NOT* wrong about tank pressurization being commonly utilized in space programs (mainly to ease the load on turbopumps, or eliminate them altogether- as with pressure-fed rocket engines- both of which strategies have seen real use in space). Or about LH2 being compressible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I was wrong about was the DEGREE of compressibility- it appears very high pressurizations only yield a tiny increase in density (Raydar was close- you only get about 12-15% compression at 150 atm with a MASSIVE mass penalty of *150 times* the tank mass...) Nonetheless, real service modules are sometimes pressurized at 30-40 atmospheres if they\u0027re feeding pressure-fed rocket engines... This leads to a very small (5-6%) increase in LH2 density- not worth the extra fuel tank mass, and not worth simulating in RealFuels- where you can already out-perform real tanks by achieving utilization of 100% with Procedural Parts mod (remember, the space shuttle EFT was only 94%, and is one of the highest known utilizations...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll being said, a pressure-fed rocket engine requires a pressurized fuel tank. \u003Cstrong\u003EThere are mass-savings on turbopumps, etc., vs. a pump-fed design\u003C/strong\u003E, but according to \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/~sharring/pfcalcs.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ETHIS\u003C/a\u003E document, the mass-costs of heavier fuel tanks only make pressure-fed engines lighter for total burn-times less than 1 minute (in practice, that means they\u0027re only lighter for an OMS designed to boost a spacecraft into a slightly higher orbit). The *real* reason to use a pressure-fed rocket is that it\u0027s simpler, cheaper, and easier to design...

Because currently the prices for tanks are completely unadjusted from stock. I\u0027m finding that the tanks themselves are often more expensive than the engines, to the point that dense fuels like kerolox are invariably much more cost-effective than choices like hydrolox. For example, a Jumbo-64 fuel tank costs twice as much as a Mainsail, so using the lowest volume of fuel possible (and thus the fewest number of fuel tanks) becomes the key consideration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m currently using the stockalike pack, but with all the prices commented out because it was making all the engines even \u003Cem\u003Echeaper \u003C/em\u003Ethan stock and exacerbating this problem.
