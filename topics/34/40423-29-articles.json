There are some quirks to work out, maybe 0.90 will help with that - namely, whenever you go IVA, the control reference point (aka \u0022Control From Here\u0022 part) switches to the pod you\u0027re in, so it makes for inaccurate readouts on the DPAI (especially if your docking port is not immediately in front of the capsule). If I can find a way to detect when the camera switches from external to IVA view, I should be able to capture the old reference transform values and use those for the indicator, although the NavBall will not show the port-originated vectors (unless I can adjust those somehow...). This isn\u0027t trivial, hence the main reason why I haven\u0027t tackled RPM integration yet. But it\u0027s an oft-requested feature, and I think it would be really cool, so consider it on the planned features list for a later version (I\u0027ve been saying that for awhile, haven\u0027t I? :/)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bedwyr\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Bedwyr\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOh that would be delightful news.

I am simply neglecting to save the values of the button whenever it\u0027s repositioned. As you mentioned, using the mod with blizzy\u0027s toolbar obviates this problem. I have tested his toolbar with 0.90 and it works (although it\u0027s a bit quirky in the editor - you have to go to the action groups tab in order to see the toolbar for the first time, but from there if you activate and move it, it will be visible when you\u0027re in part mode). The next version will use the stock application launcher (top right stock toolbar), and remove support for blizzy\u0027s toolbar to simplify the codebase.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn other news, Genborg has produced a fantastic overview video of DPAI and mic_e\u0027s NDAI, which can be found here (OP now links to this video as well): \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/1xfqqpIMq8w?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"oversoul","CreatedById":66822,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-22T09:46:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethank you for update!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is one mod I really missed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lextacy","CreatedById":107955,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-23T07:32:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Apollo13\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Apollo13\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ETrue.
