I\u0027ll check to see what it looks like on my end. The tanks aren\u0027t part of this mod, but any engine/tank combo I mess with does contain a proper RF tank. The Odin heat shield is not something I messed with, since I didn\u0027t assume it had any propulsion. I can adjust if needed. As to your second bug, that particular engine does not allow hydrolox until you\u0027ve unlocked Advanced Rocketry. But if it\u0027s happening on other engines, I have no idea. I really want to say something about your setup is borking something in RF, but I can\u0027t say without a log. The logfiles are located in different places depending on your OS. On a Mac, it\u0027s at ~/Library/Logs/Unity/player.log, but on Windows I\u0027m not sure.
