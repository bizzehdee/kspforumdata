In MFS 1.3, it took about 500 units (Though I gave it 600) of LH2 to get up to speed and altitude. In 1a, I was at 1550 units and still slightly underspeed when I cut it off and went for orbit anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, a mission in progress prior to switching versions lost an engine on takeoff and had to emergency abort back to KSC as a result. This flight, in new version 1 (not 1a, yet), was barely able to make it back to KSC on well over 8000(I think close to 9000, actually) units of LH2. In part because it spent a lot of time, and fuel, wallowing at low altitude due to the difficulty it had in climbing with asymmetric thrust(including one flat spin I had to pull it out of, and several more that I barely averted). I have screenshots demonstrating total fuel consumption of 7358 units of LH2 to fly back to KSC and land, a total, direct distance of ~385 KM. With course deviation, planetary curvature, and landing approach etc it was probably closer to 450 or 500km actually covered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that when I started the flight with old MFS 1.3, I only gave it 10000 units of fuel.

I\u0027m pretty sure I had at LEAST 8700 units on the ground, and I think I had a fair bit more than that. The flight to get there was more efficient than the flight back, but still. I flew out there, circled around, found a landing spot, and landed, on something like 12% of the fuel it took to fly back, using a very excessive two engines on the way out and one on the way back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s \u0027switch back to the old version\u0027 worthy right there, so I hope to god that\u0027s a bug or miscalculation of some sort. And could you explain how \u002723 to 1\u0027 (95.833:4.1667) turns into 62.3:37.7? Even accounting for the different densities (Which I would\u0027ve thought the original ratio already did) that seems extreme, especially since air has less oxygen in it than LOX.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for that, I\u0027ve noticed two other, much more minor issues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConfiguring a fuel tank for a Sabre has gone from \u0027mildly annoying\u0027 to \u0027fair pain in the butt\u0027. They don\u0027t show up as options on the autofill, and before the easy answer was to just attach a radial engine to the thing, reconfigure it to LH2 and LOX, and then use that to set the ratios. Now, none of the radial engines and what seems to be very few of the inline engines are able to be reconfigured to LH2/LOX, so sticking something on temporarily just to get the autofill to work has gotten a whole lot harder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, just like the old version, the archive is a mess, with a .git folder, two source folders, and THREE copies of the DLL, plus Mac OS \u0027.ds_store\u0027 files scattered all throughout the stuff in gamedata.
