I hope I can explain this decently - maybe an example or two will help, because I don\u0027t really know how to phrase this so it\u0027s not ambiguous what I\u0027m talking about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssume you have a SCALETYPE with \u0022scaleFactors = 1.0, 2.0, \u003Cstrong\u003E3.0\u003C/strong\u003E, 4.0, 5.0\u0022 and a part whose defaultScale is 3.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now, you could, for that scaletype, define tech nodes that unlock particular scaleFactors. Heavy Rocketry could be required in order to scale the part to size 4, for example.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, that also means that if you apply that SCALETYPE to \u003Cem\u003Eanother \u003C/em\u003Epart, but one with defaultScale 2, it too can scale to size 4 when Heavy Rocketry is researched - in other words, unlocking that same tech node allows you to double the scale of the size 2 part, whereas you can only increase the size 3 part\u0027s scale by 33%.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs it instead possible to define a number of steps up and/or down a part with a given scaletype can be scaled, regardless of the size at which it starts - without having to write a custom scaletype for every original size of part?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample: unlocking Heavy Rocketry allows \u003Cem\u003Eone step up \u003C/em\u003Ein the scaletype you\u0027ve defined, no matter what scale the part starts at. So a part of defaultSCale 1 may now be scaled to size 2, a part starting at defaultScale 3 can become 4, etc., but a part with defaultScale 1.0 can\u0027t be scaled to 4.0 anymore. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyhow, I thought that\u0027d be a really powerful way of limiting what kind of scaling you could do (and WAY easier than writing tons and tons of custom scaletypes) according to tech progression. Can this be done right now? Is it something you\u0027d be interested in?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, I have rewritten SCALETYPES and configs and whatnot for tons and tons of mods with what for my own personal purposes I consider more versatile scales (mass = 2.5 or 2.6 rather than 3 for engines, 2.2 for really hollow parts, more increments for the surface scaletype, stuff like that). I\u0027m happy to rewrite and share some configs and some SCALETYPES, but would you be interested in expanding how the default SCALETYPES you include right now work (stack, free, surface etc.)? I.e. is that something I should clean up and send to you - would you want to use stuff like that, or do you prefer it more how it is now?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-19T03:11:48Z\u0022 title=\u002212/19/2014 03:11  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 19, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by AccidentalDisassembly\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NoMrBond","CreatedById":69263,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-19T03:17:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Biotronic\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Biotronic\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/Biotronic/TweakScale/releases/download/v1.49/TweakScale_1.49.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EI made a new release.\u003C/a\u003E Nothing but bugfixes this far.

The radially attached RCS thrusters were moved inwards, but the rest of the ship remained unchanged. When I entered timewarp, the RCS thrusters were moved back out. The amount of fuel was properly scaled (divided by 64) (which is pretty frustrating). The tank was attached to a proper 0.625m Monoprop tank and a 1.25m Engine. I have no idea how to reproduce this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are images of the craft in the VAB and after the incident:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jrR6Roq.png\u0022 alt=\u0022jrR6Roq.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/PYp7pzD.png\u0022 alt=\u0022PYp7pzD.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo messages appeared in my F3 log; the full multi-megabyte player.log can be found \u003Ca rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do have the following mods installed:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDangIt 0.5.3.1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKAS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Isp Difficulty Scaler 1.4.2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPreciseNode 1.1.2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrajectories 1.0.0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDeadly Reentry\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Alarm Clock 3.0.6.0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInfernal Robotics 0.19.3\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProcFairings 3.11\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETweakScale 1.48\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFerram Aerospace Research 0.14.5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Engineer 1.0.13.1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENavball Docking Alignment Indicator 6\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERealChute Parachute Systems 1.2.6.1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fuel tank is the core part of the vessel; when I attached the tiny RCS tank on top of it, it was re-scaled to 2.5m (which I undid).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-20T20:23:05Z\u0022 title=\u002212/20/2014 08:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 20, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by mic_e\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"juanml82","CreatedById":105344,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-20T21:02:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve upgraded tweakscale (well, and KSP) and tweakscale now scales the parts by default: if I put a rockomax 48-7s engine below a 1.25m tank, the engine will be placed scaled up to 1.25 m.
