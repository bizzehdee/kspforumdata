The advantage of the telescope is that it doesn\u0027t require large amounts of power to perform ongoing research, the downside is that it has a performance factor that decreases over time, reducing the amount of science produced until the telescope is maintained - this will probably involve transporting fresh supplies of Liquid Helium coolant. Maintenance will bring the telescope back up to full performance and the cycle repeats.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn effect this is just a new, ongoing, science experiment part.
