I accepted a (mod) contract to get materials, goo, multispectral and soil moisture (DMagic Orbital Science) data from around Arin. And I didn\u0027t read the bit where it said \u0022if no science data remains you must *return* the experiments\u0022.\n\nIn short, I need to get about 0.5 tons of science payload to Arin, *and back*, within 6 years. The time probably isn\u0027t an issue, but it\u0027s too heavy for an ion engine, and I max out at 2.5m chemical rockets. I do have nervas at least. TWP says I\u0027ll need ~2200m/s to get there, and 3200 to get back; excluding circularising, but I would like some spare. I\u0027ve knocked aero heating down to jack all, specifically because massive rockets and insertion burns bore me, so I can reasonably say I need 0.5 tons of payload with a minimum of 6km/s in the tank or better. And it\u0027s got to cost less than 300,000 roots.\n\nGiven that I *have* to come back, I\u0027m really tempted to send a crew... but my personal rules of play state no less than 3 kerbals when going interplanetary. Which makes it rather hard. I\u0027m eyeing up something basic like;\n\n![cI6tAYe.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/cI6tAYe.jpg)\n\n...but it\u0027s not exactly graceful (even after adding nosecones) and uses over half the budget. I\u0027m using Modular Fuel Tanks to remove all the oxidiser and dedicate those grey tanks to pure LF, but even so... ugh. I feel like I can do better.\n\nAnyone want to suggest some ideas?

I think my next one will be 4x orange tanks of pure liquid fuel with 4 LVN rockets. Dock your actual vessel to it and use KIS/KAS to strut the 2 ships together and you can easily have enough fuel to bring your other ship wherever it needs to go and back home, then just refuel the tug and use it for the next mission.\n\nThis is my first tug, no orange tanks but plenty of fuel. The central column the other ship docks to is pure oxidizer in case the lander vessel needs a fuel boost between missions, as there is plenty of liquid fuel. I also have a small manned ship in the bottom center to house my engineer, I decided to bring one with every long range mission so if needed they can affix spare parts to other craft or detach and rendezvous wherever they may be needed.\n\n\u003E ![ve85nGV.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/ve85nGV.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"MinimumSky5","CreatedById":115138,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-24T22:17:54Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Anyone want to suggest some ideas?
