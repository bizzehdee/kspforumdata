This is useful for building rockets that drain fuel from the bottom first, then from the top in order to maintain stability while moving through an atmosphere.\n\nAs seen here, it prevents fuel from flowing to the engine on the bottom of this craft through the stack attachment. Fuel can only reach the engine by passing through the external fuel ducts, causing it to drain from the bottom tanks first:\n\n[![GLEjvTUm.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/GLEjvTUm.jpg)](http://imgur.com/GLEjvTU)\n\nThe Para-Sci Fuel Flow-Blocking Bulkhead is available in all four standard rocket cross-section sizes and can be downloaded at\n\n[CurseForge](http://kerbal.curseforge.com/ksp-mods/230142)\n\nor [my Dropbox](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/13276416/KSP/ParaSciBulkheads.zip).\n\nAs far as licenses are concerned, officially this shall fall under Creative Commons CC-BY, although I don\u0027t really mind if you use it and don\u0027t credit me, as long as you don\u0027t claim to have made it yourself ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\n[![88x31.png](https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by/4.0/88x31.png)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-04T07:47:56Z\u0022 title=\u002205/04/2015 07:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by parameciumkid**\n  \nlink"}]}
