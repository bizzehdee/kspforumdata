The first post in a thread, or the person who posted it.\u0022\u003EOP\u003C/abbr\u003E for all his mods.. I\u0027m having so much fun with them! Life support just added another dimension to the game which was very needed, IMHO.\n\nI\u0027m sorry if the question I\u0027m going to ask is answered elsewhere, but I swear I\u0027ve googled a lot, read the wiki and everything, but I still can\u0027t get the correct answer.\n\nI\u0027m designing a new base to put in orbit, and I\u0027m a bit curious about how Recycling works. On the wiki it says that \n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Quote\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E After the crew capacity is exceeded, the efficiency is reduced by the amount you are over capacity. For example, the MPL Science Lab\u0027s efficiency divided by 2 if ten kerbals are present on the ship (double the Recycler\u0027s crew capacity).\n\u003E \n\nand it also says\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Quote\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E If you have multiple Recyclers running, their effects are cumulative. The vessel-wide consumption reduction is capped by the most efficient recycler - so if your most efficient Recycler is a Science Lab, you can\u0027t reduce your Supplies consumption by more than 70%, no matter how many Recyclers are running.\n\u003E \n\nI know that the values have changed a bit, MPL can save up to 50% of the supplies and the crew it affects is 4 people, while the RT-5000 can save up to 79% of the supplies and the crew it affects is 3 people.\n\nSo. I\u0027ve done some experimenting in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E. If I were to bring 8 people in a station with only the MPL, which saves up to 50% of supplies for 4 people, it would save 25% of supplies for 8 people. So if I bring a single can of 4500 supplies, 4500/(8\\*10.8\\*0.75) that\u0027s more or less 69 days, which is the exact same amount the Life Support Status gives me in this situation. Fantastic.\n\nNow I want a station with both the MPL and the RT-5000, 7 people on board, 4500kg of supplies. It has enough stuff for more or less 158 days, according to the Life Support Status.\n\nIt seems that the formula is 4500/(3\\*10.8\\*0.21\u002B4\\*10.8\\*0.5). That is, 3 people are affected by the RT-5000 and consume only 21% of the normal amount and 4 people are affected by the MPL and consume 50%.\n\nIf I were to bring 8 people, the formula would be the exact same, that is 4500/(3\\*10.8\\*0.21\u002B4\\*10.8\\*0.5\u002B1\\*10.8\\*1). So the other guy wouldn\u0027t be affected at all by the two recyclers and would consume the regular amount of supplies. In total, they would last for 114 days (confirmed by the Life Support Status, again).\n\nI tried many configurations, more recyclers, more people, more supplies, this formula seems to work if the crew of the stations is \u003E= of the sum of the affected crew of the different recycling components.\n\nI don\u0027t exactly understand how that follows the \u0022efficiency is reduced by the amount you are over capacity\u0022: does it only apply if I have one recycler? If not, can you please explain this to me?\n\nAnd another question.\n\nSame station as before, both MPL and RT-5000, 6 people on board, 4500 kg of supplies. Life Support Status tells me that they have enough for 255 days. So I assume that the first 3 kerbals are going to use the recycling functions of the more powerful RT-5000 and the remaining will use the MPL. Nope. 4500/(3\\*10.8\\*0.21\u002B3\\*10.8\\*0.5) is more or less 195.\n\nSo I try this:\n\n4500/(3\\*10.8\\*0.21\u002B3\\*10.8\\*X)=255 and X is 0.33466. This equation assumes that the 3 people are split evenly and the RT-5000 is filled first being the more powerful and then the efficiency of the MPL is somehow improved. But, well, that isn\u0027t the case according to the description of the MPL.\n\nSo I instead try:\n\n4500/(6\\*10.8\\*X)=255 and X is 0.27233. So, using the RT-5000 makes you use only 21% of what you\u0027d use normally, while using this \u0022combined efficiency\u0022 factor makes you use 27% of normal. How is this 73% saved calculated?\n\nI mean, what\u0027s the actual rule?\n\nI\u0027m sorry for the long post, I\u0027m just a curious guy xD\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-11-30T16:17:38Z\u0022 title=\u002211/30/2016 04:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 30, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Bartholomew**"},{"CreatedByName":"Kuldaralagh","CreatedById":168858,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-30T16:48:15Z","Content":"quick question. did a flyby mission to Minmus.
