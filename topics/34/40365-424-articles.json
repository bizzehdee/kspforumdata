That\u0027s fine and dandy for most people but all this does for me is fill my tank up with oxidizer which weighs me down. The DT engine doesn\u0027t use oxidizer so it just acts as a lead weight, which is why I run V.0.8.4\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am also running the latest in KAS and Procedural Fairings\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#222222;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#1a0dab;\u0022\u003EOnce I am off work I will check the openresourcesystem.dll like you mentioned. Might be awhile though since my roommate probably wants to use the gaming laptop for web surfing, don\u0027t ask. As for the fuel in the tanks, its regular liquid fuel with no oxidizer. I\u0027m not really sure how the Kethane mod would interact with it in a way to disable to the DT engine but I will try my best later tonight.
