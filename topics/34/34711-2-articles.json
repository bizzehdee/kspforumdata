There\u0027s a ton of great stuff you can do with the attachment pack in general, but for my purposes I wanted to build a folding crane that I could send to another planet and use for hoisting very heavy objects. So what I did was I put docking strut connectors on the base of my crane and on the winch that was the \u0022hand\u0022 of my crane, and then once I had the crane unfolded into the correct position I engaged the docking struts to lock everything very firmly in place. Just remember to disengage the docking struts later before moving any of the arm\u0027s joints or bad things will ensue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s an example of my testbed using a Dromoman arm and a KAS winch to lift a 25 ton weight completely off the ground in Kerbin gravity: \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imgur.com/9wburIJ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00229wburIJ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0022hand\u0022 of this arm consists of a clamp-o-tron Jr., since the Attachment Pack allows Kerbals on EVA to attach those to ships in the field I figured that\u0027d be a good basic interface. Currently attached is a winch with a clamp-o-tron Jr. base - as you can see, the weight of the rover it\u0027s hoisting has pulled the two CoTJrs apart somewhat. The arm is supported by three docking struts that I engaged once the arm was in position over the target rover, as well as a couple of struts I engaged to brace the shoulder and elbow joints (I suspect these aren\u0027t really necessary if there\u0027s enough struts bracing the \u0022hand\u0022 directly). I also added a grapple hook winch on the belly of my test crane that I fired into the ground before I lifted the target, to keep from flipping over. The target weight is considerably heavier than the crane itself is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI should probably have more than just these three docking struts holding the \u0022hand\u0022 up, 25 tons is causing some amount of jiggling and bending even with those. But without those docking struts this arm fails utterly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DYJ","CreatedById":8636,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-02T11:31:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERemoved the ChrisPhilips link since it violates forumrules regarding source and licensing, I suggest you point people towards Sirkuts fork until we get DR 2.0 up. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/37707-Magic-Smoke-Industries-Parts\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/37707-Magic-Smoke-Industries-Parts\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI added a link to this thread in the original DR thread.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-02T11:38:24Z\u0022 title=\u002207/02/2013 11:38  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 2, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by DYJ\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sirkut","CreatedById":57229,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-02T12:43:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DYJ\u0022 data-cite=\u0022DYJ\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ERemoved the ChrisPhilips link since it violates forumrules regarding source and licensing, I suggest you point people towards Sirkuts fork until we get DR 2.0 up. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/37707-Magic-Smoke-Industries-Parts\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/37707-Magic-Smoke-Industries-Parts\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/37707-Magic-Smoke-Industries-Parts\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/37707-Magic-Smoke-Industries-Parts\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI added a link to this thread in the original DR thread.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGreat news that you guys will be updating DR.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"onlinegamesz","CreatedById":70808,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-02T12:56:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo I shouldn\u0027t use this mod for my space station? because when it updates my space station is ruined?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"redteddy23","CreatedById":57312,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-03T01:16:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022onlinegamesz\u0022 data-cite=\u0022onlinegamesz\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo I shouldn\u0027t use this mod for my space station? because when it updates my space station is ruined?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust add it to your station by docking it on then undock and backup your save folder before you update if it is auto-removed then you just send up a new one.
