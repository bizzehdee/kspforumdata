Actually, you should initially know where you would want to appear after the \u0027jump\u0027. There\u0027s no translation or acceleration. At one point of time you are \u0027here\u0027 and in the other - you are \u0027there\u0027. In this regard, hyperedit\u0027s way of relocating your craft is more \u0027technically accurate\u0027. You could just use the same mechanism \u002B add some cool visuals. Plus, a little bit of navigation error should be in order (i.e. you should appear slightly off to the location you intended and the more the distance of the jump is - the more should be the error - to the point that you could actually end up inside a planet which would obviously ruin your mission catastrophically).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDull boring geek mode off\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDisregarding the tiresome old bore above - great job!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
