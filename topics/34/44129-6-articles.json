If I start by pulling on the gizmo handles, I see my conic path changing and the Precise Node GUI is updating the total dV. But the individual text boxes all read \u00270\u0027. If I then try to increment or decrement any of the box values, it resets the path back to the start (matching the 0, 0, 0 of the text boxes) and begins adjusting from there. After that the handles on the gizmo no longer have any effect.

I got my encounter and was trying to fine tune it when I tweaked a bit too far and over shot, losing my encounter with the Minmus SOI. Here\u0027s the odd thing. The entire Precise Node window blanked out. And since the gizmo handles weren\u0027t working, I couldn\u0027t edit anything. Ok, I tried again - this time using only the gizmo. I adjusted until I got an encounter, then purposefully went too far. As soon as I lost the encounter, the GUI blanked out again. This time, since I was only using the gizmo I could keep adjusting.
