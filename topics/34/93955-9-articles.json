Thank you\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegarding experiments its more tricky. I want to filter labs and/or experiment sensor. Sensors would be easy: they have experiments but no crew. I\u0027m looking at the labs parts either form stock and from other mods. It\u0027s not done with the same part module as the other experiments, so should be easy to make a filter. I want to create a filter with all the science part excluding the part that only have crew report (but I think I can do that using the crew filter). My only problem would only be IF there is one part that need crew and has also more experiment: labs. So its kind of tricky. Because currently there is no way to do that. Even if you create the experiment type filter. Also I think there would be very little part under this definition (experiment are either unmanned or use they own part module). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo don\u0027t bother with this, yet.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Crzyrndm","CreatedById":92871,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-07T10:37:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAll stock non-crew reports would becovered by this I believe:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFilter 1: Module experiment \u0026amp;\u0026amp; Crew == 0 (when added)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFilter 2: Lab module (or alternatively, you could check by part name/title)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KaiserSoze","CreatedById":117446,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-07T11:09:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, thats my idea.
