The first post has some info and as great as it is, its still a little confusing. Im not hating or discrediting. It is a complex mod and not intuitive straight away. Im still learning it and confusion stems from mod ignorance and small bugs and not knowing where the fault lies (module manager vs remotetech).\u003Cp\u003EWhen i feel i know enough and tried it all out ill write up a player guide with pics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBug report: ive notice sometimes when i target a craft in map mode, focus will shift to kerbin automatically without me doing that. When i tab through all the bodies to get focus back to the craft, it will cycle through to eeloo and stop. Tabbing at this point does nothing and getting focus back to your craft gets a little tricky. I run a few mods so im not ready to pin this on RT yet but keen to hear if this happens to others.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA player guide would be nice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIm able to manage a com-sat system which covers the whole orbital area around kerbin - but only with change a .cfg to set the length from 5.00 Mm to 7.5 Mm. Kind of cheating. But without that I cannot make it up to a synched orbit. (The other option would be more satellites..but my PC is not the fastest..so I try to keep the number of objects as low as possible)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have no idea how to use the dishes. It gave me some targets. And when I set a target to any ship it shows me a signal in the map view. (from a manned rocket with 6 kerbals in it)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut thats all.
