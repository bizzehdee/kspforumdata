As stated in my OP and my Wiki, SM is mod independent. No additional mods are required. When SM starts up, it will check to see if you have CLS installed, and if so will enable it by default. You can then disable it if you desire.. If CLS is not installed, it will automatically update its settings to disable CLS support.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@OpenWorldAddict: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, my question is: why not use CLS?. I firmly believe it enriches your experience with EVA versus internal transfers. having to make that choice is kinda fun imho. The stock transfer, out of the box for KSP allows transfers anywhere. With CLS, even the stock transfer can then respect the living space limitations, and you would then have to EVA if you want to go to a part that cannot be reached internally. I believe it improves the \u0022immersion\u0022 effect of the game. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is if course your choice, and I respect that.
