Every time I tried to change inclination or MJ tried during a landing it would crash the ship. Just trying to land it, twice it flipped on its side or pointed towards the ground. Simply put I could not use MJ to land on Duna or to change inclination. The transfer to Duna from Kerbin also seemed a bit off with the intercept being very high and in front of Duna forcing me to abandon the attempt quite a few times. In the past I\u0027ve used MJ to go to Duna and didn\u0027t have any issues but it took me a dozen times yesterday. After manually landing I tried the accent autopilot and it went up about 15k pointed to the surface and crashed into it at high speed. The other issue with the landing auto pilot is that it would plot the landing and then reduce orbit to the point that it would crash the ship well before it got to the landing target. I\u0027m not talking missing by a few k of distance. I\u0027m talking other side of the planet surface intercepts. I\u0027m using dev Build #128 (Dec 12, 2013 5:31:21 PM)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now I\u0027m going to test a landing on the Mun and Minmus.

Every time I try it it drives the Pe into the ground. I was trying to do an inclination change while in Kerbin orbit and 4 out of four attempts would have ended in de-orbiting the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne other thing. With a long ship and a low TWR I was not able to get into orbit using MJ. It would get to about 17km and then flatten out for a bit before heading for the ground. I could orbit the ship manually so I know it\u0027s not a ship problem.
