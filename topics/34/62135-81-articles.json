But then I got word from Nazari that having it split into three or more parts would have thrown off a lot of the data values he has set (same for the LRBs). So for now they are one part. It was also done in an effort to reduce the parts counts most folks are experiencing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-It would have significantly complicated things, particularly the launch and balancing. I think part of the simplicity and ease of use of the KSO compared to other shuttles is the solid EFT and LRBs which solved the whole fuel tank location problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-There are numerous fuel tank mods out there as it is. The KSO is fully compatible with the stock jumbo Rockomax stock tank as well as KW Rocketry series of parts. If you recall way back when, the KSO wasn\u0027t even going to have a lifter but was going to rely on KW Rocketry parts. Adding another set of general use tanks to the pile, I kind of felt was just, I dunno. So instead I made these specific to the KSO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-With the use of the KSO Top Mounted, I decided that eventually I\u0027ll include an alternate Noseless EFT (cut at the top grey ring just above the fuel radiator) since the EFT has a mounting point on the bottom. This EFT will be specifically targeted at Top Mounted users.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW, LOVE the Procedural Fairings mod and it\u0027s among the three mods I always install!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blackheart612","CreatedById":42741,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-25T11:26:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlright, cool I understand, here\u0027s to hoping it\u0027ll be out soon\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Csup\u003ETM\u003C/sup\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, PFairings is awesome.
