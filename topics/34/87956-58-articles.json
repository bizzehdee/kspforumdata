Hence the \u0022consolidated\u0022 release that stali79 posted earlier (last week maybe?) has a whole boatload of parts that due to not being in the right folder, just won\u0027t load. I haven\u0027t checked the latest one he posted right above this, was too busy getting my own stuff working, but unless he\u0027s done some radical pruning, there\u0027s about 70 MB of stuff that isn\u0027t loading in there.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, what I decided to do was basically to ignore all the original J and K parts, and just focus on getting all of the existing 1.8 parts into a single working version. To do this, I took the 1.8 Test release, and added only those files for which no counterpart existed from the Test 4.01 release, while maintaining their folders. Basically, my version has both the old I/J/K folders and a main folder.\u00A0\u00A0I could probably have done it the other way around, as there were probably fewer parts missing from 4.01, but it worked, and I think the parts that *are* common are probably pretty much identical. Then I copied the relevant parts of the Firespitter config from 1.8\u00A0Test 4.01 into the one from 1.8 Test, and the engines and sound files from stali79\u0027s pack, and checked if it\u0027ll load.

The J parts in both packages *are* compatible though, so at least I only have one version of J to contend with presently.
