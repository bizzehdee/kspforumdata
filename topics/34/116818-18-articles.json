It usually when I leave the vessel to go to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E and check on all my vessels in the Tracking Station when LAN jumps to zero.\n\nI have temporarily removed Orbital Decay from my GameData and the issue stopped appearing entirely. So I figure it has something to do with it.\n\nIn Whitecat106\u0027s GitHub I have noticed that there was an **[issue #42 \u0022LAN updating to zero!\u0022](https://github.com/Whitecat106/OrbitalDecay/issues/42)** which was closed on 30 Jul 2016. What I can\u0027t see, however, is whether the issue was actually resolved at the time.  \n\nI will happily provide more information concerning my KSP installation/mods if required.
