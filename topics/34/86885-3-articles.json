I already suggested adding a part for the Kerbal tether, another one for FreeAttach would be no problem. I can add a decouple option or even have it auto-decouple (that would be pretty much a stock strut then, though). However, I don\u0027t see a big advantage to Targeter-Target connections then.

So the \u0022broken\u0022 part is only the part-spawning. Everything added via KAS (which I don\u0027t want to have as a mandatory part of this mod, because I\u0027m not a big fan of bundles (but KAS is great, no doubt here)) or in the editor should be safe territory.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JeffreyCor","CreatedById":93167,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-05T19:53:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI very much agree with having a little interdependency as possible. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E I was trying to think of anything that could give a free attachment like function without free attachment.
