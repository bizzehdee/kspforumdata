I think i need to expand on my description:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a ship which has 2-3 MKS modules stacked along with their bases. My skycrane is at the top of this stack. There is a manned module on top of the skycrane. The skycrane is only somewhat wider than the MKS modules.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy main ship landed on Minmus. Then I separated from the landing stage, and was trying to use the skycrane to move the stack to a specific point on the ground. Once there, I land, detach the lowest module, and then take off and move over to land the next one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei\u0027m also using your Vertical Velocity control to hover.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat happens is that I lift off, make sure that RCS and SAS is engaged, then use the Landing aid to select a landing spot. Since the rockets are at the top of this long stack, it acts like a pendulum. The 20 degrees is too much for this, there is a very severe delay in the ship responding to the rockets, so it swings back and forth, and actually orbits around the landing spot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that being able to reduce the max tilt to maybe 5 degrees, or some way to specify the max tilt on a per-rocket basis would help a lot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are a couple of pictures of one of my ships:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter initial landing:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/hnuhqvk3wpf0qw4/screenshot9.png?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/hnuhqvk3wpf0qw4/screenshot9.png?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter separation from landing stage:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/4cj0s71tl1zwmep/screenshot10.png?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/4cj0s71tl1zwmep/screenshot10.png?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand here is a link to one of the craft files:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/8vd25q4pvq37z8v/Minmus%20station%20%26%20lander%204.craft?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/8vd25q4pvq37z8v/Minmus%20station%20%26%20lander%204.craft?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-29T18:54:17Z\u0022 title=\u002201/29/2015 06:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by linuxgurugamer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Diazo","CreatedById":81549,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-29T19:41:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmmm.

However, the low thrust of the RCS blocks meant you were layering them on to get any sort of reasonable thrust.

Looking at the math for the issue linuxgurugamer reported made me realize that on low-grav worlds I\u0027m not happy with how little sideways acceleration just tipping the vessel gets you. A 10\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 tip is only about 15% the acceleration of the force of gravity. Quite reasonable on Kerbin, not so reasonable on the Mun (or Minmus). Have not decided on a course of action about this issue yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the great help on this,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ED.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"linuxgurugamer","CreatedById":129964,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-31T23:55:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAren\u0027t the RCS jets either on or off?
