I was able to perform a fine gravity turn with the rocket I recently launched under the newest FAR. I suggest fairings over anything that\u0027s not a fin or fuel tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Read have Read\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Read have Read\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFrom what I learned is that most failures happen at at Q values in the neighbourhood of 34,000 and up depending on the plane. Usually 44,000 but some of Scott Manley\u0027s failures happened at 29,000 as well. The thing to keep in mind is low altitude is dense, and so is the Trans-Sonic regime (Area of Max-Q). If you must go fast to takeoff, rotate back gradually, don\u0027t pull many G\u0027s. If you are approching the sound barrier at 0.7 mach and up, don\u0027t try and maneuver. If you notice in Scott\u0027s video he was both at low altitude, and approching Mach 1. This is what the new EAS description calls overspeeding.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll have to check out Manley\u0027s latest, but thanks for the general info. Hopefully ferram can update the simulator tool to tell us when things will break off.

It flips, severe lateral forces on the vehicle, it breaks up. The default parameters are designed for an Eve lander with enough dV to return from datum altitude to enter Eve\u0027s atmosphere at with a 50 km periapsis from a standard hyperbolic trajectory and land perfectly fine; it hits a Q of ~80 kPa during that and it doesn\u0027t break up so long as it doesn\u0027t flip or go lateral during the procedure. Same principle here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E@federally: \u003C/strong\u003EWell, you didn\u0027t ask \u0022how do I prevent control surfaces from ripping off?\u0022 you just asked why they do; don\u0027t be upset when someone answers a question you asked. Now, to answer \u003Cem\u003Ethis\u003C/em\u003E question, reduce takeoff velocity (add more wing area, add flaps, reduce mass). Reduce need for control surface deflection (reduce stability, move CoL closer to CoM). Be more gentle with control inputs and take advantage of the delay between commanding a deflection and when the control surface reaches that deflection. Avoid overspeeding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E@Read have Read: \u003C/strong\u003ENo, the transonic regime isn\u0027t the area of Max Q, that\u0027s often after the transonic regime and into the low supersonic regime. It\u0027s just a flow regime where there are large regions of subsonic and supersonic flow and neither region can be assumed away in the analysis. Often the size of those regions results in much more severe lift and drag coefficients, but referring to it as the region of Max Q is fairly inaccurate, since Max Q has no dependence on Mach number itself, simply air density and velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Drew Kerman","CreatedById":103177,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-03T20:06:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ferram4\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ferram4\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E@Gaiiden: \u003C/strong\u003ESimple: go slower and fly higher to reduce dynamic pressure, or use more gentle control inputs at high dynamic pressures to reduce loading.
