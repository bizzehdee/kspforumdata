I don\u0027t know how this mod interacts with KCT but for the purposes of RP-0 orbit simulations are overly expensive. Part of the problem is that you often start over the pacific and need to have a longer duration (more expensive) test to get signal (when it\u0027s early and you haven\u0027t loaded the place with commsats) before you can try anything with an unmanned system.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI actually tend to turn off simulation costs in KCT. Never really understood having to pay, even small amounts, to test whether a design was viable or not. Or to try out different ascent profiles. When I was designing my surveyor probe (this was before I added American probes to my mod list), I must have run through about a hundred sims trying get the weights and thrusts right. And since each sim took place in moon orbit, I could only do a single test before having to go back to the hangar and call up another sim. No idea how much I would have spent doing all those tests if I were paying for sims.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-23T15:09:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022chrisl\u0022 data-cite=\u0022chrisl\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI actually tend to turn off simulation costs in KCT.
