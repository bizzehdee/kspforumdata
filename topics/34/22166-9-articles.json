Yeah, I did some digging and found a video talking about the conversion rates with everything but xenon. Since I don\u0027t really use xenon, nor would I with anything other than an interplanetary ship, I don\u0027t really need to worry myself with that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Throggdor","CreatedById":61234,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-06T18:48:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Majiir\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Majiir\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe efficiency indicator on the large Kethane converter is \u003Cstrong\u003Ecooling efficiency\u003C/strong\u003E, which impacts the \u003Cem\u003Espeed\u003C/em\u003E of conversion but not the waste portion, which is a fixed property for each converter type.

I\u0027m building a tanker/converter rover, and I\u0027m not entirely sure how large of a destination tank I need. I\u0027m using the heavy converter, which lists a conversion efficiency of 99%. By that logic, a full 16000 unit tank of kethane should produce 15840L of liquid fuel/oxidizer. This seems like too much.\u0027\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand, there\u0027s the kethane consumption stat. This lists a 13.5L/s for liquid fuel, and 16.5L/s for oxidizer. Do I apply the 99% conversion efficiency to these stats? This would result in an output 13.365L/s of liquid fuel a second. At this point, I\u0027m a little unsure of how to do the math (which isn\u0027t my strong point). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, upon further reading, I come across this several pages ago:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, according to this, and my own (shaky?) math, a 16000L tank would produce 1350.4L of fuel? And when Temeter says \u0022oxygen,\u0022 does he mean oxidizer? And this is where I get confused with this. If he does indeed mean oxidizer, then is there a ratio of fuel:oxidizer in his calculations? I mean, I know that you can only convert to one resource at a time and maintain maximum efficiency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah, a little help would be greatly appreciated, as I\u0027m a lost lamb on this one, and I\u0027d like to get all my ducks in a row before I start firing my gear to the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour initial conversion was wrong, you were right to think the output you were getting was too high. The conversion is based on essentially two main factors \u0022density\u0022 and \u0022efficiency\u0022. The densities for liquid fuel and oxidizer is 5000 kg/m\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B3, RCS fuel is 4000 kg/m\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B3, and I have no idea about Xenon, I\u0027ve never really used it (if anyone knows please feel free to share).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe base equation you are looking for is (KethaneConsumption/density_of_fuel_in_tons)*efficiency=Units_ of_fuel, having said that there are small errors somewhere in the calculations, or possibly in one of my conversions that introduces a small error I have observed when refining large quantities of Kethane into various types of fuel. I was working on some different experiments to help me figure out where the error was when I had to abandon my game because if I land on anywhere my game wont let me do anything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Malachai\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Malachai\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell, the whole point of my mobile platforms is so I can easily transfer and store resources. I\u0027ve got a mobile drilling platform, and the aim is to link it up with my mobile tanker/converter, and go on extended mining excursions. Then I return, store the resources at base camp, and go back out again. As such, I\u0027d like to know exactly how much fuel/oxidizer/monoprop/xenon is produced by a unit of kethane so I can build accordingly. I know it\u0027s a slightly complicated affair, but this is just how I\u0027m going about it. Besides which, knowledge is power.

It sounds like you want a base on the surface of something and you bring it there for refinement. What I did is I put a small space station in orbit and I began with a lander to drill the kethane (i developed a lander that was 2 parts, 1 had all the kethane equipment I needed and the other was for orbital redevious, when it refueled the space station it would go back down to the kethane section and dock), drill/convert/ferry/dock over and over, but once I started going out to other planets I realized I needed something that was able to produce in larger quantities, that\u0027s when I developed my refining rigs the down side is this is where i found out deposits could run out (enter the debugger, to replenish the kethane supply), and I built a cargo ship to ferry the fuel back and fourth with quantum fuel transfer mod. So I had a stationary tanker, that had wheels for positioning, and would drill kethane, another to store the fuel, and another to provide power and convert the fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"paranoidsystems","CreatedById":28206,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-08T12:52:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022paranoidsystems\u0022 data-cite=\u0022paranoidsystems\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI know I asked this once before...it was before the great forum crash....but how on earth do you use the kethane jet engine? mine just runs out kintake on kerbin....I cannot figure it out.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHi Guys, Im still really at a loss as to how to use the kethane jet engine....I have a rover testbed full of kethane with a kethane jet engine on the back and it always says kintake depleted...even if I cheat and fill upp kintake with hyperedit it just runs till that depletes...I am not sure what I am doing wrong.......I don\u0027t understand what I am doing wrong....I know I had this same issue when the engine first came out and I am sure it\u0027s me but can someone tell me what I am doing wrong?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ahd1601","CreatedById":60223,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-08T20:42:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ecould you help me out, im not very good with C# and i need to make a resource converter module, could you make your converter module universal by adding an input resource instead of default to kethane. or can you help me make a plugin?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BloodyRain2k","CreatedById":50835,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-09T00:57:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ahd1601\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ahd1601\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ecould you help me out, im not very good with C# and i need to make a resource converter module, could you make your converter module universal by adding an input resource instead of default to kethane. or can you help me make a plugin?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust use a generator\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003EMODULE\u003Cbr\u003E{\u003Cbr\u003E\tname = ModuleGenerator\u003Cbr\u003E\tOUTPUT_RESOURCE\u003Cbr\u003E\t{\u003Cbr\u003E\t   name = LiquidFuel\u003Cbr\u003E\t   rate = 0.9\u003Cbr\u003E\t}\u003Cbr\u003E\tINPUT_RESOURCE\u003Cbr\u003E\t{\u003Cbr\u003E\t   name = Kethane\u003Cbr\u003E\t   rate = 1.0\u003Cbr\u003E\t}\u003Cbr\u003E\tINPUT_RESOURCE\u003Cbr\u003E\t{\u003Cbr\u003E\t   name = ElectricCharge\u003Cbr\u003E\t   rate = 10.0\u003Cbr\u003E\t}\u003Cbr\u003E}\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
