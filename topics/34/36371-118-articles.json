I thought I understood the basics and I was able to easily make stable rockets..but now when I apply what I knew my rockets still flip ect so I thought perhaps something had changed with fairings since it\u0027s new to 1.0 so I thought maybe I wasn\u0027t shaping them right ect....(I\u0027m using Procedural fairings and procedural parts.) but apparently faring\u0027s don\u0027t matter? What you\u0027re saying is it\u0027s my whole design who\u0027s flawed? I mean I don\u0027t know what I can do it\u0027s a cylinder ... Usually I have no problems making rockets.... There\u0027s something I\u0027m not understanding.. It can be a bit frustrating. I\u0027m a visual person to learn...Does any 1 know of a Tutorial rocket video with nufar? I looked on Youtube but they are all in 0.90 and it\u0027s all stuff that don\u0027t seem to apply anymore? Or does it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd also as additional Info so you don\u0027t think I\u0027m one of those guys who force the turn. I know that when you launch you have to pitch over only a few degrees with a TW of about 1.30 and then let the nose with out SAS just naturally follow the Flight path marker and do a proper gravity turn... In other words keep as low of an angle of attack as possible and let the rocket\u0027s aerodynamics ease it into the turn. I\u0027ve flown countless rockets b4 and I rarely had problems like this... in fact i found rockets to be super simple compared to planes ect.... but since I got nufar ect I feel like stuff don\u0027t behave like b4.... I\u0027m thinking it\u0027s most likely me who\u0027s rusty or not grasping new features added ect. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo be CLEAR it\u0027s not the first stage that gives me issues it\u0027s as soon as first stage separates and I\u0027m at high altitudes but still in atmosphere a little bit and in inclination due to being in the gravity turn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo any 1 who knows of a good tutorial ect Don\u0027t be shy to refer me to it. Or if you know of anything I can do to help the rocket fly straight after first stage SEP....Because I can get them to launch right but no matter how much Fins I add to the second stage ect it flips over itself. Could it be procedural parts causing this? Or that my rocket doesn\u0027t have enough mass at the top? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t seem to find the issue. because i cant make that COL move behind that COM. But some 1 said that was irrelevant so what tools can I use instead? I don\u0027t understand the fancy graphics all that much for rockets. What should I be looking for number wise In the graphics for rockets? I know this is a lot but as you might understand this is quite frustrating for me... I\u0027m not angry at any one or anything other than my own inability to quickly master all the new aerodynamics ect.Any how Thank you for your help in advance \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E much appreciated!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-12T14:05:09Z\u0022 title=\u002205/12/2015 02:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Dermeister\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"funk","CreatedById":118840,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T14:25:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s probably the value of AoA which causes your rockets to flip out. If you build a \u0022standard rocket\u0022 (thin and long, streamlined) you won\u0027t need fins. Just have a look at your initial TWR at the ground. I\u0027m using around 1.5-1.6.

A trick regarding flipping rockets during coasting is, to reduce thrust if the apoapsis reaches around 50-55km to have more control due to gimbaling.

It might not contribute to the rocket\u0027s stability very much, coupled with a huge TWR coupled with a low payload can flip you as well.
