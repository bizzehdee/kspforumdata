I then decided to do a flyby of Phobos and realised it has a minute SoI. I spent less than a second in the sphere of influence thanks to an inclined retrograde trajectory relative.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy some miracle one of my timed RT experiments went off \u0027high over phobos\u0027 and it was magnetometer, so i\u0027ve disproved the \u0027hollow phobos theory\u0027, but I missed out on a lot XD.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI get it, phobos is a pebble and I came in on a really sketchy flyby, but can I expect similar from other micromoons? I\u0027ve seen the github wiki bit, are there any more useful cheatsheets and resources out there? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERocket pr0n, as an example, this is high over duna, and will be for 4/5ths of the distance remaining between us, I passed about 500m from it.:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8DgLTZD.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00228DgLTZD.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-22T16:59:23Z\u0022 title=\u002203/22/2015 04:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by celem\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-23T03:43:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ecelem: Sphere of influence for Phobos in real life is only a few meters above the surface, IIRC.
