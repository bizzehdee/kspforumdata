Hope the RL is going ok. I agree with everyone, this mod is essential to some good KSP creativity and function. i consider Squad a decent bunch of DEVS. Compared to most the other games out there. But i dont understand why they dont focus more on the things that people are using. Like this mod, NASA cant do anything without robotic assistance in some way. They should adapt this into the game and pay you and the original creator for your time. I know i will get scalded for this,(yes i know who it is) but you have taken this mod way beyond the original creator. Your setup is better than damned Robotics, without question.
