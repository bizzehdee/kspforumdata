There are a few options that you can use to achive more/less memory usage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emipmaps will add texture smoothing at distances, but increase memory usage by about 30%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Escale divides the texture by the amount specified. (use powers of two though)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emax_size restrics the dimensions of textures to that specified.
