So I have another version of this craft that I assembled in the VAB and HyperEdited into space as one ship and it behaves normally when trying to enable the heat overlay.

By default anything below 273.2K (freezing point of water) will be blue transitioning to purple the colder it is. The unhighlighted parts are ~287-289K, basically room temperature, where the color gradient transitions to fully transparent so there\u0027s effectively no color.\n\nWhy those parts are so much colder than the others I couldn\u0027t begin to say, I just show the data. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) I would guess maybe because those parts were in space much longer so they had time to cool down radiatively, but if I read your initial post correctly the cooler parts were the more recently launched ones? /me shrugs"},{"CreatedByName":"Eleven","CreatedById":60502,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T21:58:08Z","Content":"It does make sense that other parts in space longer would be cooler. Now that you\u0027ve mentioned it, I could be mistaken on which part was brought up last. I should have marked them somehow! The first piece up was one of the long sections, then the 2 in the middle, then the other longer section was docked last. \n\nI\u0027ve been actually thinking that the entire craft is bugged somehow, the temp gauge shows correctly, it\u0027s just the colors that are not showing up. I\u0027ll continue on with the mission and see what happens, I had just finished docking and decided to check the temps when I saw this anomaly ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n(EDIT) --\u003E So I quicksaved and did a long burn, and the color overlay worked just like it should. I think maybe I was so used to seeing the stock overlay where the entire craft starts out red, that I didn\u0027t take into account the different pieces being put together having different temps. Once I fired it up, it all evened out normally and worked like I expected it should.

See this [README](https://github.com/Apokee/HotSpot/blob/develop/README.md) for info.

A flux is a change in some quantity per unit area. From what I can see all of KSP\u0027s \u0022flux\u0022 measurements are simply changes in energy per unit time (i.e. a power), so I\u0027ve chosen to avoid using the word \u0022flux\u0022.*\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nBTW, if you want to give the new version a try you can download a nightly build from [here](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Apokee/hotspot/build/24/job/405cy6chniv5e2h4/artifacts); remove the EhancedThermalData folder of course.
