I want to build it into something better, a couple of issues with the MM script occur to me straight away, no dV with empty tanks, CoM is also a problem. This was just a really simple way to get something going initially. I also want to eventually\u00A0add a contract pack that supplies early career with some infrastructure and contracts to build it out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe idea is that, like IRL fuel is now a resource that needs to be provided, it just does not magically come into being. This mod adds another dimension to the gameplay by encouraging you to find, mine, transport, refine and fuel your Space Program. So any ship launched will not have any fuel and you must fuel it first before taking off. To do that you must have a re-fueller craft, storage tanks, a refinery, land, sea and air transport craft, and mines/platforms.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere is the initial \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/leocadle/nofuel/releases\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Erelease\u003C/a\u003E (it\u0027s only a few lines of script, I have tested and it works as advertised), let me know if you find the idea intriguing or have any issues.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLicence is CC by 4.0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-22T22:50:48Z\u0022 title=\u002201/22/2016 10:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 22, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by selfish_meme\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MatterBeam","CreatedById":133334,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-21T10:26:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis could be interesting.

Essentially, create a base resource that lists the current amount of on-hand fuel. That way, they still have to create all that infrastructure, but they don\u0027t have to fuel in on the pad (unless you want that of course).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"selfish_meme","CreatedById":125899,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-04T21:23:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi Zanda, thanks for the ideas I will keep them in mind when I develop this more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
