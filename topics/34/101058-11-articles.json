The clamps no longer clip to the floor in VAB, there is no corresponding icon in the staging sequence on HUD, and they can no longer be activated (or rather, the sound and visual fx are triggered upon activation of 1st stage, however the clamps remain clipped to the craft, but not to the ground, allowing the craft to take off with the clamps attached). \n\n2/3 times that causes a crash upon reverting to VAB, especially if the rocket is partially destroyed and the clamps clip through the ground.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003E [Javascript is disabled.
