But as soon as you add any staging or a fuel lines into it, it becomes an iterative nightmare -- it is never entirely clear just what should dV/burn time computations be based on. The actual code that computes your dV in MechJeb totals up to about 30kb worth of code that does nothing except that, in a separate thread (!) that it periodically polls to ask if it\u0027s done yet (!). I don\u0027t relish the idea of borrowing such amounts of code and then having to support something I barely, if at all, understand -- sometimes bugs are found in it, and sometimes, like with the 0.23 update, Squad breaks it. So these are two commonly requested variables that I will not add directly. If anyone is up to cleanly excising the code that does it out of MechJeb \u003Cem\u003Eand supporting it in perpetuity\u003C/em\u003E I will add it, but I seriously don\u0027t want to do it myself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am investigating a different approach to the problem which is based on extending the computing module with plugins just like the display module is extended. That would permit me to directly request that variable from MechJeb if MechJeb is available, which would be a decent middle ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022beita\u0022 data-cite=\u0022beita\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIs it possible to do any operations on the variables you can draw, ie: $\u0026amp;$REALISP*9.81 or something similar?

That \u0027TSC\u0027 example this article gives is very telling because that is exactly how these horrible things get born, and the RPM page definition language is already dangerously close. The correct policy for doing things like that would be adopting a real programming language to extend the system instead, or directly bumping up the number of variables -- i.e. REALISP*9.81 is trivial to add as a new variable, (what should it be called, by the way?) and so is mass of a resource in kilograms, so that could simply be done. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am not at all sure how to deal with the problem eventually, because I agree the need for some operations on variables does exist. The naive approach of making the computing module actually apply mathematical operations to variable names it gets is easy to make, but there is serious danger it is going to be completely monstrous by the time everything anyone wants is added to it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DasBananenbrot","CreatedById":70900,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-22T18:27:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022therealcrow999\u0022 data-cite=\u0022therealcrow999\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EEarly access MK3 Cockpit, it will be released in next update.
