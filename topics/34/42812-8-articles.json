Stretchy tanks use their own mass calculations and ignore the MF tank type\u0027s mass. As an example: NovaPunch has a 5m x 12m tank. Configured under MF (Tank type: Default) they should be about 5-6 tons. A Stretchy tank of the same size comes in at about 25 tons. That\u0027s dry mass. That will affect both your Delta-V and your TWR.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
