Your craft is solar powered, so make sure to keep your panels exposed to the sun as much as possible.\n\nIncludes a plugin that counts your score, a few custom parts that use no new models and a number of scenarios to race in.\n\nHow scoring works: Gain score by keeping the craft\u0027s antigravity repulsors on the ground. You get a bonus for traveling on steep slopes so try to catch some ground time on those hills and mountains but avoid crashing into them!\n\nRequires:\n\n- [**ModuleManager**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55219-Module-Manager-1-5-6-%28Jan-6%29)\n- [**Kerbal Foundries**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/84102-WIP-PARTS-PLUGIN-0-25-Kerbal-Foundries-wheels-anti-grav-repulsors-and-tracks)\n\n[**Download**](https://github.com/Lyneira/RaceKerbol/releases)\n\nOr install via **CKAN** and have dependencies resolved automatically!\n\n**Changelog:**\n\n**1.2.2 (16th of August 2015)**\n\n- Various tweaks to increase safety. Craft is a bit harder to crash and less bouncy.\n- Made repulsors physicsless.\n- Significantly increased default spring strength to compensate for KF\u0027s reduced antigrav height.\n- Moved repulsors down a bit to give a little bit of extra height. Updated scenarios with new Solar Racer craft.\n- Repulsor power usage should be roughly back up to previous levels (was significantly down in v1.2.1)\n\n **1.2.1 (15th of August 2015)**\n\n- Update scenarios, solar racer craft and repulsor for compatibility with the new Kerbal Foundries.\n\n **1.2 (14th of August 2015)**\n\n- Added a new scenario: Race Kerbol 03 - Island Hop\n- LandDistance plugin is now RaceKerbol - Please **delete your previous RaceKerbol folder** from GameData!\n- New toolbar icon\n- Now measures distance traveled on the ground as Score.\n- You get a bonus for traveling on steep slopes. The steeper the slope, the greater the bonus for traveling over it.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E **1.1 (9th of August 2015)**\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E - Added a new scenario: Desert Pass\n\u003E - Fixed a bug where Land Distance would calculate distance incorrectly when not traveling along the equator.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  **1.0 (9th of August 2015)**\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E - Initial release with the first scenario, Westbound\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n**License:**\n\n- [**GPLv3**](https://github.com/Lyneira/RaceKerbol/blob/master/Source/License.txt) (only source code)\n- [**CC-BY-NC-SA**](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) (other files)\n\n**History:**\n\nThis addon is inspired by the game Race the Sun. After playing it, I started mucking around with building a little plane that vaguely looked like it and stuck antigravity repulsors from Kerbal Foundries on it. After trying it out racing across the ground and having quite a lot of fun with that, I figured maybe this could be made into an interesting challenge. The original version used small electric ducted fan engines from RoverDude\u0027s excellent [Exploration Pack](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/86695), but I wanted something more high-tech looking. One thing led to another and now the addon has a custom rescaled and welded high-tech engine for the racer, a plugin which tracks how far you\u0027ve traveled across the ground and a few scenarios which set you off to a flying start!\n\n**Future:**\n\n- Fine tune the scoring system and come up with a final score calculation for scenarios that values checkpoints and speed.\n- Fine tune the Solar Racer craft and its power balance.\n- More scenarios!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-24T15:14:42Z\u0022 title=\u002208/24/2015 03:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Lyneira**\n  \nNow on CKAN!"}]}
