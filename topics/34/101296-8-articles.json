I use passinglurker\u0027s mercury capsule. With the way keeper, the rocket is very controlable.\n\nSo you don\u0027t NEED a gimbal, if you get the verneir out. One just a bit stronger than Tantares. If you aren\u0027t going to do a Vernier soon, then you should put gimbal. Even if you don\u0027t change the model and just add .25 gimbal as a stop gap. Otherwise people who don\u0027t have Tantare\u0027s can\u0027t really use the rocket.\n\nI mentioned a few pages back about adding alternate configs for the Atlas V/Centaur, I still want to do that.
