Cherryh\u0027s Alliance/Union series. In it the stations spin around but instead of having a \u00222001\u0022 style stationary, zero G hub to dock at, the ships dock at the edge. Not sticking out like spokes but perpendicular. To visualize, put a CD down flat then poke a finger straight down at the edge. Ship, meet docking port. The ships all have some amount of rotating space for the crew, passengers and cargo that can\u0027t tolerate zero G.
