Over 30k funds had to be spent expanding the maximum wingspan the hangar can build aircrafts with. This design had to use relatively expensive to tool aluminum stringer tanks, but because currently I\u0027m getting far more unlock credits than funds each day I still tooled it, and it is flimsy, any high G turns will break the 0.1 mass-strength multiplier wings and 0.2 control surfaces another risky move to ensure the mass of this very Kerbal aircraft for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E standards doesn\u0027t get too high for it to reach that ridiculously high altitude for a mid 1950s jet engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m sure there are more elegant solutions to achieve this within the 40m max width of the starting hangar than to attach an overpowered at sea level jet engine (over 1.7 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E)\u00A0 and huge wings to a X-1 cockpit, or maybe wait until later, better jet and turbofan engines get unlocked, but in mid 1958 the X-planes deadline will happen so I\u0027m trying to cram as many optional achievements into it while there is time in this career mode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd that is not even the \u0022real\u0022 mission. It took over 1 hour of in game time to climb to 30km and return to land, with difficulty, on the runway: you have to keep decreasing climb speed as you get higher, over and over to not lose so much speed you can\u0027t level flight at 30km, at the last leg it was limping at only 3m/s climb speed. I can\u0027t even believe any real X-planes program did a manned aircraft with a jet engine that beat that altitude record, definitively not in 1956. There were also things that\u0027d make it even more frustrating but were not necessary, such as reducing the wings mass-strength ratio so much that they break at 4x time warp\u00A0 if it was still too heavy to get that high up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis better be the last of these stratospheric subsonic flight missions in RP-1, no way I\u0027m trying another one that wants me to \u0022reach level flight with a jet X-Plane at 35km for 5 minutes\u0022 or something like that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPS: It really is tangential to the rest of the program, which is focused on designing ever faster, heat-resistant experimental aircraft to go ever higher up and eventually reach outer space as the final goal, instead of this, which is useless for anything else than its intended optional missions. I suppose you could use it as a basis for one that can somehow climb a bit past 40km to gather science at high altitude, but why?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-12-07T01:35:21Z\u0022 title=\u002212/07/2023 01:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Dec 7\u0022\u003EDecember 7, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by NotTheRealRMS\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"siar","CreatedById":231586,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-12-19T14:37:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp style=\u0022border:0px solid #d9d9e3;color:#374151;font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\nIs there any way to regain the merge function while editing recovered vessels that was previously in KCT?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022border:0px solid #d9d9e3;color:#374151;font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\nI would love to be able to use it with my reusable spaceplane.

Over 30k funds had to be spent expanding the maximum wingspan the hangar can build aircrafts with. This design had to use relatively expensive to tool aluminum stringer tanks, but because currently I\u0027m getting far more unlock credits than funds each day I still tooled it, and it is flimsy, any high G turns will break the 0.1 mass-strength multiplier wings and 0.2 control surfaces another risky move to ensure the mass of this very Kerbal aircraft for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E standards doesn\u0027t get too high for it to reach that ridiculously high altitude for a mid 1950s jet engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m sure there are more elegant solutions to achieve this within the 40m max width of the starting hangar than to attach an overpowered at sea level jet engine (over 1.7 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E)\u00A0 and huge wings to a X-1 cockpit, or maybe wait until later, better jet and turbofan engines get unlocked, but in mid 1958 the X-planes deadline will happen so I\u0027m trying to cram as many optional achievements into it while there is time in this career mode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd that is not even the \u0022real\u0022 mission.

I can\u0027t even believe any real X-planes program did a manned aircraft with a jet engine that beat that altitude record, definitively not in 1956. There were also things that\u0027d make it even more frustrating but were not necessary, such as reducing the wings mass-strength ratio so much that they break at 4x time warp\u00A0 if it was still too heavy to get that high up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis better be the last of these stratospheric subsonic flight missions in RP-1, no way I\u0027m trying another one that wants me to \u0022reach level flight with a jet X-Plane at 35km for 5 minutes\u0022 or something like that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPS: It really is tangential to the rest of the program, which is focused on designing ever faster, heat-resistant experimental aircraft to go ever higher up and eventually reach outer space as the final goal, instead of this, which is useless for anything else than its intended optional missions.
