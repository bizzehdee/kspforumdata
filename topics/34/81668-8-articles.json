On the OP page you can see the changes that have happened. The default textures are just plain ugly at scale were the new textures give a much nicer view of the planet Kerbin from a good distance. The new textures have been altered to match the new terrain created from the supplied height map. Lastly the ice sheets at the poles were missing. Now they have been restored.

Thanks to Natan suggestion the planets have been restored to the same state as the 0.90 version. What I did discover is that pre-Kopernicus didn\u0027t render the PQS the same way as Kopernicus does so the landscape changed. Kopernicus actually renders more closely to the actually height map than old RSS did. The new surface is in fact closer to my scaled space kebin color map. I had to redo the launch sites which I have finished all but the KSC2 site.
