When you first make a new save with the mod installed it interfaces with the server to pull the list of currently available trees. Once you select a tree, it downloads a tree.cfg (text file, readable in any text editor), or if you select stock it creates a blank notree.cfg file, in the save directory. From that point on, it functions offline unless you start a new save, at which point the process repeats. If you don\u0027t have an internet connection when making a new save, it will just have the stock tree option, but once you\u0027ve selected a custom tree it\u0027s saved locally and doesn\u0027t require an internet connection.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could actually install a tree without an internet connection if you had a tree.cfg file by simply placing it in the save file while the mod is installed, and when the editor becomes available people will be able to distribute trees to each other via this method, but for now it just connects to the server.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to the question of the number of trees visible, at the time treeloader was first posted, mine was the only tree ready, but once other tree makers inform R4m0n that their tree is ready, it just has to be flagged to appear on the treeloader list, otherwise it just appears in the editor version.

I think I may have screwed up the tree a little by removing the \u0022Start\u0022 node as the first node (felt redundant). Any tips or tricks on this? Or is there something special that the Treeloader does to the cfg file to make it run properly?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m hoping to have a functionally modded semi-realistic tech tree in the works for an upcoming project. Without an easy fix for the treeloader I\u0027ll just have to keep hacking away at a manual text file writeup.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Hammered on it a bit more and have found that while I can edit a tree (or add my own once a notree.cfg is loaded then edited to tree.cfg) it works until the R\u0026amp;D Facility loads then it flashes my completed tree list then loads only a single selectable node portion of the tree as visible. The initial parts are loaded into the VAB plus any configured for the default tree (with the TechID in their part.cfg) but they don\u0027t show in the R\u0026amp;D facility. Taking a look at the source code it looks like this is caused by an internal refresh of the Treeloader, but I\u0027m unsure.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-20T08:37:57Z\u0022 title=\u002210/20/2013 08:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 20, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by 4KbShort\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EMade some progress.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
