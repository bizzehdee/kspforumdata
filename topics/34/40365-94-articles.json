I just did the maths on the 40kVA UPS we have in the server room here... It has about 10 minutes of autonomy at full load, which means that, ignoring the power factor and stuff like that to keep the maths simple, it can store about 40kW x (10min x 60) seconds = 24MJ of power. It weighs in at just under 0.7 tonnes, and takes up about 4m3 of space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor comparison, 6 of the z-4k batteries will hold 24,000 charge (~=24MJ), weigh 1.2T and take up less than half that much space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, considering that the sample here is \u003Cem\u003Efragile\u003C/em\u003E batteries, that you can\u0027t safely tip over, let alone subject to acceleration stresses, I\u0027d say that the slight increase in mass for stability and containment is reasonable, and that, if anything, KSP batteries are a little on the small side.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEssentially, this is the reason that large scale power protection involves a few minutes of battery to allow for a generator to cut in, rather than trying to provide emergency power just off the batteries. There\u0027s nothing to stop anyone doing a config edit to store thousands of MJ in something the size of a AAA, but anything more power-dense than the batteries in-game at the moment would definitely be based on wishful thinking rather than science. There are some promising looking possibilities in the nano-tech field, but, as anyone with a smart-phone or a laptop will tell you, real batteries just aren\u0027t very good, right now.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ShiRocketer","CreatedById":68329,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-23T12:00:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/yID2FtB.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022yID2FtB.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust tested new AtmIntakes, they appear to work better than before (more IntakeAtm).
