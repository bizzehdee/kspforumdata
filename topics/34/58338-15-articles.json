The reports of my death have been greatly exaggerated!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway... awkwardness aside, I\u0027d like to thank Diazo for stepping up to help maintain the mod while I was away. He did an excellent job, and I\u0027m sure he\u0027s going to continue taking an active role in it\u0027s development going forward, which I fully support and encourage. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as my absence, truthfully, I was mostly just taking a break from KSP while waiting for version 1.0 to roll out. Now that it\u0027s here, I\u0027ve prepared another official update (or six...).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe big news is that I was able to implement a much requested feature... the proximity detector. Incidentally, it was a very interesting challenge. In the end, it ended up being an amalgamation of the remote control and altimeter parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike the remote control, it uses the concept of discrete \u0027channels\u0027, up to 20 in total. Each proximity sensor will listen to other proximity sensors broadcasting on the same channel, once it hits the target distance to the nearest sensor on the same channel it will activate whichever action is configured for that proximity sensor. Note that it\u0027s also able to fire actions on remote vessels, just like the other smart parts. Like the altimeter, it\u0027s capable of firing actions during approach, departure, or both. It\u0027s also capable of resetting itself. Unfortunately, because I was never able to get the original model/texture files for Smart Parts, I had to temporarily reuse the model of the remote control. I plan on fixing this, in a way that won\u0027t break vessels that use it. I just need to figure out how to import KSP models into 3DS Max. I\u0027ve tested it fairly extensively, but it\u0027s still a bit experimental. As such, I wouldn\u0027t rely on it 100% for high priority missions. If you find a bug with it, please let me know.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, beyond that, the timer bug has also been fixed thanks to NobodysNightmare. Furthermore, I\u0027ve corrected the auto-stager bug that can occasionally prevent it from staging at \u00270%\u0027 due to floating point errors. As long as it\u0027s below 1% of total capacity and it\u0027s no longer drawing resources, it will still fire. Finally, Diazo\u0027s KIS compatibility module manager patch has been integrated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI still need to read through this thread to see if there are any new bugs that have cropped up, but beyond that I plan on making the fuel gauge/controller bi-directional in the next patch, which will be a boon with the addition of mining, and possibly the fuel cells.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs always, you can get the official release from my GitHub page here...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/BrettWebb/KerbalSmartParts/releases\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#ff0000;\u0022\u003ENew Releases\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EChangelog\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ev1.5.2 Bug Fixes\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E * Timer now accounts for timewarp (Thanks to NobodysNightmare)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ev1.5.3 KSP 1.0.2 compatibility and bug fixes\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E * KSP 1.0.2 compatibility\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E * Auto stager now properly activates when rounding errors result in minor fraction (\u0026lt;= 1%) of resource remaining in tank\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ev1.6.0 Proximity Sensor\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E * New proximity sensor part\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E * Allows up to 20 individual \u0027channels\u0027 to monitor\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E * Capable of firing actions on both the remote and local crafts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E * Will select nearest object on the same channel as target\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E * Similar logic to altimeter smart part - fire on approach, departure, or both\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E * Works out to 2,000 meters\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E * As placeholder, shares model with radio.
