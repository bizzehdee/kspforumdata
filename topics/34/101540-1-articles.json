A few notes:\n\n- Please place your TweakScale .cfgs in your mod\u0027s folder, not in the TweakScale folder. This way users can delete TweakScale and install a new version without breaking your mod.\n- If your mod is already supported, please post here or PM me, and I will remove support, giving you full control over the .cfgs.\n\nFeatures\n\nSpoiler\n\nScaling Control\n\nYou as the author of a part or addon get complete control over which parts you want to offer in which sizes. Should that fuel tank only be available in size 2.5m and 3.75m? Make it so! That \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thruster on the other hand, could be scalable freely between half regular scale and double regular scale.\n\nMass Control\n\nFor heavy, solid parts, mass increases with the cube of the scale - you scale it in three dimensions, after all. For parts that are a thin layer of aluminium plates over a rigid skeleton - like fairings, crew compartments, empty fuel tanks - mass probably scales closer to the square of the scale.\n\nControl Over Every Feature of a Part\n\nThis is not all! Engines can be made more powerful as they increase in size, generators more efficient, and wings more lifty. All by writing a simple config file, and then automatically for all rescalable parts of that type.\n\nHow to use\n\nSpoiler\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E First add a part that\u0027s the wrong size:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E ![NxMyyTK.png](http://i.imgur.com/NxMyyTK.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Right click:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E ![BBw1x4M.png](http://i.imgur.com/BBw1x4M.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E See how it says 3.75m?

No, you cannot scale parts very much bigger. 1.something times original size is the maximum. Why? Apparently because IR parts only work if the node sizes on the parts are size 1 or smaller after being scaled in-game (or something vaguely like that, my explanation is most likely incomplete and wrong). Why? I don\u0027t know, because you *can* (I think, anyway, have to check that) make node sizes larger in the configs and the parts maybe still work.\n\nBut that means you *can* scale IR parts *smaller* (in-game) and it doesn\u0027t break. So far, anyway. IR includes tweakscale values to do so.\n\nIf you want larger IR parts, you\u0027ll need to either:\n\nA) Copy the configs for the parts, make new ones scaled up, scale up all values appropriately, or\n\n![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) Use a module manager patch to do the same thing.\n\nThis works, I\u0027ve done it, but not always with all parts for mysterious reasons."},{"CreatedByName":"pellinor","CreatedById":85299,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-08T22:45:23Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E It feels like anywhere I look I get different answers and they all have different ages so... Does this or does it not work with infernal robotics so I can make the \\*trons bigger and thereby more stable when adding large loads to them?\n\nSure, and there is no need to create new parts. The simplest way is to add larger scaleFactors to IR\u0027s scaleTypes with a MM config (so you replace the \u0027scaleFactors\u0027 list with a new list that contains the old ones plus the ones you want to add). This will make both the parts and their nodes bigger, so all is fine from TweakScale\u0027s side. \n\nThis is a config I used in one of my old saves for adding a smaller stack size: \n\n    @SCALETYPE[stack]:Final{    @scaleFactors = 0.3125, 0.625, 1.25, 2.5, 3.75, 5.0    @scaleNames = 31cm, 62.5cm, 1.25m, 2.5m, 3.75m, 5m}\n\nHowever, I heard that IR tends to have problems with very large nodes, and I suspect that this has to do with the instant acceleration that IR does. Just like in real life, heavy things do not like to have their speed changed instantly (simple example: driving a car against a brick wall). It happens that this is also an area where I am [tinkering at the moment](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/37707-0-90-Magic-Smoke-Industries-Infernal-Robotics-0-19-3?p=1773143\u0026viewfull=1#post1773143).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-08T22:49:21Z\u0022 title=\u002203/08/2015 10:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by pellinor**"},{"CreatedByName":"AccidentalDisassembly","CreatedById":110936,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-08T22:47:47Z","Content":"Hey Pellinor,\n\nQuestion about tweakscale \u002B the tech tree. I was wondering if it would be possible to implement something like this. Hopefully my description will make some sense-ish. But I\u0027m working under some assumptions that might not be true, so please correct me if they\u0027re not.\n\nI\u0027m using \u0022Tech node 2.5m\u0022 and \u0022Tech Node 3.75m\u0022 and whatnot to refer to whatever tech node would unlock those sizes, just for the sake of generic argument.\n\nAssumptions: are these true?\n\n1) Right now, the way tech tree \u002B scaling works is that particular scaleFactors in a SCALETYPE{} are connected to particular nodes in the tree, right? Assuming that scaletype has factors 0.625, 1.25m, 2.5, 3.75, and 5 only:\n\n2) So, for example, if you have a 1.25m part, you wouldn\u0027t be able to unlock scaling it to 2.5m until you research Tech Node 2.5m. Then, you can scale it to 5m when you unlock Tech Node 5m, etc.\n\n3) But, if you have a 3.75m part from the outset, it cannot be scaled down to 2.5m until you unlock Tech Node 2.5m, and then, later, it too can scale to 5m when you unlock Tech Node 5m.\n\nSo, if that\u0027s actually how it works:\n\nWould it be possible instead to implement a relationship to tech nodes like this:\n\n1) Let\u0027s assume you start with a 2.5m part, and that its SCALETYPE has major increments at 0.625m, 1.25, 2.5, 3.75, 5.0. \n\n2) When you unlock the first tech node that allows scaling up or down, it allows you to go one \u0022notch\u0022 (one scaleFactor) in either direction of the part\u0027s defaultScale. So the 2.5m part could, at first, only be scaled to 1.25 or 3.75m. Likewise, a part that starts at 3.75m could only be scaled to 2.5m or 5m after this first tech node.\n\n3) The second node in the research tree that has to do with scaling allows you to scale things *two* scaleFactors in either direction of the default scale - so now, the 2.5m part can be scaled anywhere from 0.625m to 5m. But a part that starts at 1.25m could only be scaled up to 3.75m.\n\n4) The third related tech node allows moving three increments in either direction of original scale, the fourth four, and so forth. Or, it could allow plus or minus a particular percent of the part\u0027s original scale, since everything is FreeScale - that might make it more flexible... Or some other system to figure out how much larger/smaller any given part can be made after a particular technology.\n\nThen, of course, the real question is whether that kind of system would even make sense. My thinking is that progression in the tech tree should allow *greater and greater* *manipulation of part size*, no matter what size a part starts at. But maybe that\u0027s not a good way to do it... thoughts?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-08T22:50:12Z\u0022 title=\u002203/08/2015 10:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by AccidentalDisassembly**"},{"CreatedByName":"Dazpoet","CreatedById":132380,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-08T23:07:16Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Sure, and there is no need to create new parts. The simplest way is to add larger scaleFactors to IR\u0027s scaleTypes with a MM config (so you replace the \u0027scaleFactors\u0027 list with a new list that contains the old ones plus the ones you want to add). This will make both the parts and their nodes bigger, so all is fine from TweakScale\u0027s side. \n\u003E This is a config I used in one of my old saves for adding a smaller stack size: \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E     @SCALETYPE[stack]:Final{    @scaleFactors = 0.3125, 0.625, 1.25, 2.5, 3.75, 5.0    @scaleNames = 31cm, 62.5cm, 1.25m, 2.5m, 3.75m, 5m}\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E However, I heard that IR tends to have problems with very large nodes, and I suspect that this has to do with the instant acceleration that IR does.
