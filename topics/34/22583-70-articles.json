Make sure that your center of mass is DIRECTLY under your center of thrust, and that you put enough wings on the side to keep it dymanically stable at speeds where wind is going to be an issue. i find that the enclosed tail roter with both fins (top and bottom) and two jet fighter elevators (with control disabled) on the sides of the tail is just about right to keep a chopper stable at or above 40 m/s. Faster choppers use aerodynamic half-wings, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/67/Apache_DOS.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Elike the apache\u003C/a\u003E, for stability at high speeds.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was using the .craft that came with the mod. And even then, even when everything is in place, the mod wont remember the RPM i set for the engines, and every time i revert back to launch or i relaunch the chopper i must retune the engines (i think this counts as a bug).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason why the stability its a problem its because this isn\u0027t just me not knowing how to fly, if i could make a VTOL when i dont even know how to make proper planes and i can fly it better than a FS chopper there is a conflict. Of course, it could be that i was just using .crafts that were not compatible with FAR, and i would love to check that, but i will have to wait for FS to get updated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts not like i was expecting 100% realistic helicopter physics anyways, the way the KSP physics/atmospheric engine is made makes impossible for proper realistic simulation of airplanes and choppers to happen.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snjo","CreatedById":57198,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-15T06:56:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe 0.25 \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/snjo/Firespitter/blob/master/For%20release/Firespitter/Plugins/Firespitter.dll?raw=true\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Edll is available here\u003C/a\u003E, i just haven\u0027t baked it into a full release yet, since the rest of the package is still a bit messy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@dr. death, there used to be a few separate craft files for FAR planes since they needed tweaks to wing positions.
