If it\u0027s already been suggestions, my apologies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I noticed that every command you input into the queue is immediately sent to the actual operation queue for the vehicle as you enter it. This means that you have to not only worry about getting your timing down on your commands, but you also have to get the speed in which you enter your commands for a quick series of events down crisp and clear as well. As every space between each command has its own delay and will be sensitive to any mistakes you make while trying to set up a queue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that rather than immediately sending each command directly to the onboard queue, you have an \u0027upload queue\u0027 that you can line up all your commands with delays set between them as you see fit, and then upload them all to the vehicle at once with a master delay before first command execution. This way you can set up event sequences without having to deal with the unexpected side-effects of trying to frantically perfect how fast you can efficiently zip through your command sequence. This seems a lot more user friendly than trying to work out the exact delay from NOW that each command would require and making yourself into a formula one vehicle programmer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQ upload \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMASTER DELAY (1024 sec)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Command 1 (Executed immediately after master delay)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-- Command 2 (5 second delay after previous [Command 1])\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-- Command 3 (3 second delay after previous [Command 2])\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-- Command 4 (Immediately following previous [Command 3])\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-- Command 5 (30 seconds after previous [Command 4])\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd since the sequence queue would not upload until the user tells it to, an additional ability to drag and move each command in the setup queue to reorganize it would also be nice. So you can set up a sequence of commands, realize you need to move say, a prograde command in front of the burn command, and simply drag it forward instead of having to clear half the queue and reenter it to fix the error.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other thing I noticed is that the FLComp sits on top of the direct command interface and piggybacks it... So you have to actively go back and zero out the command queue delay time if you want to control the vehicle in real time (not including lightspeed delay), otherwise it throws all your commands into the queue.
