Does it show up in sandbox mode? If it does then it\u0027s installed correctly, if not, then try re-installing. Once it shows up in sand box, go to career and then to the R\u0026amp;D building. You need to click on Advanced Electrics, that\u0027s the third from bottom in column six. They should be there. That\u0027s where they are in my save, and I just removed the protractor folder from the game data folder and ran KSP to remove them, then put the folder back, and ran KSP and it\u0027s back, like so:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img801.imageshack.us/img801/393/e0op.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022e0op.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClick the buttons in the parts area to bring up the research dialog and hit the research button to get them working.
