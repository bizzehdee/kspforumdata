Most of what I know on space-based radio theory I only learned from a friend at school who was related in some way to the guy that developed a lot of the coding for Voyager\u0027s signals. Everything else I know about space radio is generally available online, although some seems as difficult to find as the SRB curves seem to be. My actual radio experience deals primarily with short range (\u0026lt;100km... like the time when I was 10 and accidentally jammed TV signals to the block for a while) stuff and most of my recent programming experience is embedded systems so I\u0027d be considerably better at writing the software for the space ship itself rather than the plugin for the space ship game =)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d generally say that doing something like making radio signals work in kerbal was outside the realm of possibility, but the modding community seems to be insane, yourself especially. (And I mean that as a compliment to the modding community).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also really don\u0027t think that RT, in its current implementation does much useful for RO:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The signal delay functionality doesn\u0027t allow for autonomous processing so removes the vast majority of unmanned mission capabilities which I think is directly against the idea of RO - the only way to improve that is something like a better version of kOS to do things like fire retrorockets at a specific altitude and then deploy airbags. For the majority of users it also needs to be simpler. Preferably with buttons and sliders and a drag and drop mission planner.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn Sandbox mode I can lob a network of satellites to pretty much any planet in the solar system in a single launch so I see it as adding only a level of annoyance that everyone has to do once and then forget about. Perhaps one could argue that there aren\u0027t a lot of people that can do that and it may take them dozens of attempts... and so on and so forth.

I do recognize, as I said before, that the satellite communications network is unrealistic, especially in the time frames that RPL theoretically deals with, but I did actually enjoy the challenge of launching the first 2 satellites in my simple network (the remainder were essentially automated mechjeb ascents... and bored me to death). I did enjoy being able to upgrade them as my tech improved and I planned out Luna, Venera, etc... but for realism sake I think that would be better handled either in the contract system or as science missions (ie use the dedicated probe concept and place ComSat 1 in such and such orbit). There are already plugins for similar in the contract system. I really see a bit of a merging of the Red and NK concepts for Career mode using a hybrid Tech and Contract system, and I really don\u0027t know how my convoluted track on radio theory made it to writing a new career mode, but, there it is, it was a long day trudging through the (literal) desert for me today and that does strange things to a person\u0027s head sometimes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, that\u0027s my probably a lot more than $0.02\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-JM\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"woahprettyricky","CreatedById":115197,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-20T08:00:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI will say, on the subject of ascent pitch program, I launch most of my rockets with Mechjeb and have no problems at all, as long as I design them carefully, and am conservative enough with my numbers.
