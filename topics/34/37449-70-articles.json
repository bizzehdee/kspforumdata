I just gave up on TAC LS for now... But are you actually telling me, if i add LS containers, that i can still use LS??? Gotta try this! If that works i\u0027ll buy you a beer!! (or non-alcoholic beverage)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[edit] IT DOES WORK!! None of the capsules/pods come with any life support. Added LS tanks to the craft and it seems to work just fine now.
