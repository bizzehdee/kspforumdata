All it did was reduce by a small amount the huge number of SAS modules that every non-rocket thing I build requires to fly. Their is no reason why I should have to add 20-30 SAS modules to a plane to make it fly without wigging out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI actually had more success making FAR work with that new pilot assist mod that came out recently than with MechJeb, with or without that module. Even then, I crashed half the time. And don\u0027t even get me started on trying to land a plane with FAR installed and MechJeb piloting. I basically have to resort to landing the plane with chutes to get it back safely. So I switched to using vertical SSTOs for crew transfers but FAR makes MechJeb totally unable to land anywhere remotely close to where its supposed to when landing vertically. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo be perfectly honest, I did not intend to get into a discussion in Bac9\u0027s thread about the merits of FAR and MechJeb, though I appreciate you trying to help, blowfish. I really only intended to speak my piece about the mod and leave it at that. Thankfully there aren\u0027t really too many mods that rely on FAR so its not like I am losing half of the mods that I have downloaded. I\u0027m just not gonna subject myself to trying and failing to make FAR work when I have proven to myself time and time again that its just not possible with my limitations.

While it did work better than MechJeb with FAR, my attempts to figure out how to tune it just made it handle worse. If I wanted to dedicate a couple of weeks to trying to figure out how to get it working just right, it might actually be okay. The only issue there is that I still have to land the thing. So far, there is nothing I have found that can land a plane safely hands-off, and that is with AND without FAR. Though FAR makes it even more difficult. I wish there were more mods like Stock Drag Fix that simply repaired obvious bugs in the stock aero models rather than trying to replace them entirely. Even though SDF made some pretty strong changes to drag, it only extends MechJeb\u0027s vertical landing accuracy (on bodies with atmospheres) by a few tens of meters rather than completely dumb-founding the entire landing guidance system.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blowfish","CreatedById":119688,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-20T08:07:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESorry to hear about your troubles then.
