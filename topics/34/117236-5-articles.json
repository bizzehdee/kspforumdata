The[\u0022PControlsurface - B9 SH\u0022 Part](http://i.imgur.com/gB7LtLM.jpg) has the same problem.  All the other procedural wings work fine. Its not just the debug voxels, the analysis tool doesnt see the wings either (most of the values are red) , and a [plane that i built](http://imgur.com/a/E6N6L) had did not lift off when using the B9 SH part. When i exchanged the wings for the sp\u002B version the plance flew fine. I noticed that the CoL does change if you [add and remove wings](http://imgur.com/a/i6igY) however.\n\nI tested this on a fresh ksp install , 64 bit , with only FAR and Procedural Wings installed (and their dependencies on ckan) .
