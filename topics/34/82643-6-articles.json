I apologize for the miscommunication. We also said we\u0027d be adding a Yagi-Uda antenna and regrettably there were issues that cropped up during design of the part that would delay our release. Instead of delaying the release for two weeks we decided to include a second short range tape antenna to compensate and released the update. I apologize that the promised Yagi-Uda antenna was not included in the update.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as the next update is concerned we are just beginning the early planning phase of what parts will be included in the next update. Our current thinking is that alpha.03 will be have a primary focus on propulsion. As we get further along in planning and designing alpha.03 I\u0027ll be posting about what parts we have selected to develop.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"eygc","CreatedById":119751,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-02T07:55:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022orcmaul\u0022 data-cite=\u0022orcmaul\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOK, so I\u0027m working with some assumptions here.\u003Cp\u003EAssumption 1: you are playing career mode\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssumption 2: you\u0027ve listed all the antennas you are using\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssumption 3: you are launching a new vehicle\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssumption 4: you have no control as soon as you put it on the launch pad\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssumption 5: you haven\u0027t unlocked the technology \u0022Unmanned Tech\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssumption 6: you are not using launch clamps\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis set of assumptions suggests you are starting on the launch pad and you don\u0027t have an active antenna. The solution is to add a reflectron dp-10 to your launch vehicle. Your other option is to add launch clamps and activate an antenna that won\u0027t fall off in-flight before launching. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf one or more of these assumptions is incorrect let me know.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI installed the mm cfg from the last page, problem disappeared?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"orcmaul","CreatedById":19612,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-02T08:31:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022eygc\u0022 data-cite=\u0022eygc\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI installed the mm cfg from the last page, problem disappeared?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAh the one assumption I didn\u0027t think of. You needed to update your install to the A.02a version. The update fixed the tape antennas not being omnidirectional.
