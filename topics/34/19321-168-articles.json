I haven\u0027t flown any aircraft in three or more versions of FAR. Today I decide to build a new aircraft to go collect the last bits of science left on Kerbin. I ran though several designs and no matter how much tweaking I always got the same result when testing the aircraft. When I stall it, it settles flat, slightly rear down and just falls down in this attitude no matter how far forward the CG is of the center of lift. It acts almost as if it\u0027s in a vacuum or very thin air. I can get a little roll and yaw out of it, but it pitch control seems almost non existent. I loaded up an earlier aircraft that flew fine the last time I used it. I remember it being very stable, nearly impossible to stall, and if I did stall it, it just pitched back down and recovered on its own. Now it too behaves as above after stalling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother odd thing is happening too. If I fly to the upper atmosphere (\u0026gt;18,000m) and then descend back, it seems to act as if it\u0027s still flying in the thin upper atmosphere. It\u0027s very sensitive and twitchy up there. I take off, fly at 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 nose up until I hit 18k altitude. When I ease the stick forward (I\u0027m using an Xbox 360 controller to fly) to level out, it goes out of control. Every time, with several different designs, it yaws to the right, then rolls over and flies belly first into the direction of flight. After bleeding off speed and descending back to the lower atmosphere it is nearly impossible to recover. A few times I managed to recover control, but it still seems to fly as if it\u0027s in the thin upper atmosphere after I descend back to the lower atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did a test by flying to the upper atmosphere in a gentler approach. I flew at 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 until above 10,000m, then at 15\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 until hitting about 20k. I then cut the throttle and let it pitch down on its own. By the time it had nosed over and descended below 18k it was going over 500m/s, and I was barely able to pull it up to level off. I managed to get it leveled off at about 4000m altitude and it had slowed to 200m/s by then. Pulling full up elevator at this altitude and speed barely did anything. I loaded the same aircraft, took off and flew up to 4000m, then pulled full up elevator at 200m/s and it rips its wings off.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AndreyATGB","CreatedById":62674,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-09T08:25:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile your description is pretty detailed, we\u0027re still gonna need pictures and seems logs as well since something must be going wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Azimech","CreatedById":50750,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-09T09:22:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s funny to see how a manned re-orbit capable Eve lander is now nearly impossible using the newest FAR and DRE.
