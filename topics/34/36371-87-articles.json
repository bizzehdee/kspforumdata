(x64). I\u0027ve done my best with testing, troubleshooting and searching for help in this thread, and nows the time to ask for help! ^^;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs many of the mods out there are showcasing updates compatable with the newest version of KSP I thought I\u0027d update my build from my mod stable .23.5 to a fresh .24.2 install. Whilst debugging and otherwise testing that everything was working I stumbled upon an oddity where PF Conic and Egg Fairings (under Aero, not the structral versions) do not like to decouple if the craft is at any angle other than straight up! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, the craft itself is a stereotypical Apollo-esque affair, appearance and functionality only increased with the recent KW Rocketry update, which I had a little toy with in .23.5 before updating fully. The CSM sits on the LM, which is hidden inside the PF Conic Fairings, and the LM is \u0022docked\u0022 at the engine to a Clamp-O-Tron Snr which sits on the PF Interstage Fairing Adapter. The adapter is expanded to 3.75m and this is where the fairings are connected in x2 symmetry. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs of .23.5, the seperation and translation of the CSM would occur once the burn to the Mun or Minmus had been completed. The fairings would fire via an action group, the CSM would undock, turnaround, redock with the LM, and the LM\u0027s engine would then undock from the Clamp Snr. The fairings would work as expected and there were no niggles at all with the process. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs of .24.2, no matter which fairings are used, whatever angle of pitch or roll I am at, the fairings seem to have little to no ejection force and sort of flop off, perform a bottom to top headstand and, with a bit of rolling to help matters, they eventually peel away. At first I thought it was something that was just happening in vacuum as they seem to work fine on the launch pad. However, after launching straight up to 70,000m (as opposed to using a gravity turn), and hitting my action group they seperated fine, no problem. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs stated I\u0027ve done my best to troubleshoot this myself, using the \u0022Decoupler for x64\u0022 fix (which, I later learned, had no effect on PF), using the .24.1 fix stated a few pages back in this forum, changing the ejection forces, swapping the parts out for \u0022fresh\u0022 ones, re-downloading and installing the mod, creating new installs of my build, none of which has had any success. The craft itself is the same as was created in 23.5, using the newest KW pack as stated earlier, and has remained unchanged. No mods relating to the rocket had any update issues and I cannot find anything in the debug log relating to a possible problem with PF. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, in essence, this has me stumped! Sorry for such a long post but I wanted to get all the relevant or otherwise useful info in there.
