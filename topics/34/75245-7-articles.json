Mind you it was a few months ago and I haven\u0027t bothered or wanted to try and repeat it, because it took me almost 8 hours of play time to get that ONE landing right. It was a lot of quick save and reloading. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut basically I did one drop where I let it plumet all the way to the ground, timing roughly when it hit each layer of the atmosphere when the chutes should be deployed and when the landing gear should be deployed. I failed to account for the thick atmosphere of Eve and the fact that the craft jettisoned its heatshield with its deorbiting thruster. That was a pain in the butt. But I adapted and overcame. I set my re-entry angle from the start on the deorbital burn, so the PE was set pretty high because it was Eve, any shallower with DRE the probe would have just skipped, any deeper and it would have burned up. But I had to tell the FC (flight computer) to perform the burn at a set delay that I manually put in 15min before the burn node, and told it to burn for the exact m/s needed to achieve the PE I wanted. I then had it jettison the engine and come in heatshield side down... well that didnt work because I screwed up on the building of the probe and had it set to high in the shield so the shield went with the engine. But it survived re-entry, I had to pre-program in the maintain nose up retrograde, until it got to the thick atmosphere, then I let it tumble through the atmosphere to disipate as much of the heat as possible. I also had to tell it to pull in the antennas and solar panels at a certain point. That was the point I could no longer send anymore updates to the probe, and even if I could it would have been to late. I had to make sure that at T-25min to node I had EVERYTHING programmed in the FC before it hit T-15min. Because at that point I would have 3 minutes left to send last minute adjustments, because at that point the probe went on the dark side of Eve and I would lose signal from Kerbin. Everything had to be perfect. It wasn\u0027t but it was mostly good, I messed up and the gear didnt come down and one chute burned off of it leaving it 2 which lead to a lopsided landing. Which resulted in it rolling down a hillside for about 100m before stopping on its side. But the solar panels extended while it was tumbling down the hill which tore them off, and the long range satelite antenna was facing the ground. But the omni directional antenna extended at T\u002B5min and worked! So all in all success.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starstrider42","CreatedById":104043,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-24T00:46:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022dlrk\u0022 data-cite=\u0022dlrk\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThanks!
