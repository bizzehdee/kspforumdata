Worked fine in the most previous version I was using (6.4). This occurs with no other mods (beyond a handful of my flags), and I have plenty of memory left (the system has 16GBs, so Unity /should/ able to use whatever its addressing space allows). This was also a problem when I attempted to use Papics\u0027 8k clouds prior to your inclusion of that texture into the mod. I had written that off as possibly a download error on the part of the texture, but I suppose not. If I copy over the smaller kerbin1 cloud from 6.4 the issue goes away (but has the obvious texture repetition).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Incidentally, resizing the new kerbin1 texture to 4k also makes it \u0022small enough\u0022 to work. 8.7MB vs 30MB.... Sure, it\u0027s not the full 8k, but it\u0027s a possible work around if anybody else hits this. So far I have only tested 6.7 on OS-X, though the previous 8k issue also occurred on Linux.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-28T08:33:28Z\u0022 title=\u002212/28/2013 08:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 28, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Cydonian Monk\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-28T08:33:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022rbray89\u0022 data-cite=\u0022rbray89\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EShould work without issue.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry, but it seems with 6-7 im getting no clouds at all.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
