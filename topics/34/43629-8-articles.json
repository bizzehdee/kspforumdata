To use it, I need to set the initial parameters of the ejection burn manually (usually in 2 kicks due to typically low interplanetary TWR). After launching into Kerbol SOI, MechJeb2 can take over and perform the expected mid-course plane change maneuver using the fine tune closest approach planner. \u003Cp\u003EHowever, setting up that initial ejection angle is more of a pain than it needs to be. I typically would orbit at least once and use the orbit info window to find where to create the maneuver node for the right angle to prograde, then do the initial kick burn, then set it all up again for the interplanetary burn. Or I could get impatient and eye the ejection angle, only that angle is actually quite important for big burns like Eeloo or Moho (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/27236-Tutorial-Step-by-step-Interplanetary-Hohmann-transfer-guide-and-tips\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/27236-Tutorial-Step-by-step-Interplanetary-Hohmann-transfer-guide-and-tips\u003C/a\u003E).

After all, it calculates the prograde angle in the orbit info window.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I added the ability to show and set it in the maneuver node editor window, like shown here (I\u0027m the probe body setting up a 800 m/s kick burn):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI made it for me, but if anyone else is interested I can set up a pull request of github (as a giving back sort of thing).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECyberSoul\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S.
