Remove one of the mods and the problem goes away. In a nutshell. And I just tried again with the latest versions of both mods, same problem.\u003Cp\u003EI really find myself in need of the ability to weld parts, both to reduce part count and to increase structural strength and rigidity, but I need RCSBuildAid even more, so if it\u0027s a choice between one or the other like it is now... well, you get the point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh yes, just remembered, along with all of the above, the \u0027Weld It\u0027 button isn\u0027t visible either. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s because you\u0027re trying to use a dll compiled for 0.22 in 0.23.
