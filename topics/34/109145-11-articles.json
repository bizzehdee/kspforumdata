I can take a look, see if I can replicate the bug. As for the rapier-like engines, do you mean the ESTOC or the MATTOCK?\n\nThe Advanced hypersonic cockpit is the one I have been using, so it may happen with others too. I also found it occurred when reloading a save as well. I have a mk2 drone core so I control from there and ignored the issue, but it would be good to fix it.\n\nI mean both, although I only tried the ESTOC once and it didn\u0027t perform well enough on the sci plane I was building so I may never have got to that point - can\u0027t recall. With the MATTOCK\u0027s I had 2 and at 12-18k alt IIRC and mach 3.7 the combined thrust was about 1200-1300 kN (as reported by KER) and when I click on the engine I\u0027ve never seen above 700kN when the stated max thrust is something like 1600-1900kN (sorry can\u0027t check I am at work)\n\nUsing a manta per mattock, so maybe it\u0027s airflow?\n\nI found the 250 data limit on the mk2 lab very restrictive, maybe 400 would be better? I understand you want to limit it from the basic lab but because sci/day scales with data, 250 is too low to be of any use. (that and the fact I forgot to put enough solar panels to run it... :-))"},{"CreatedByName":"SuicidalInsanity","CreatedById":143878,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-12T02:32:37Z","Content":"@Hazelnut; I can\u0027t replicate the navball bug - tried with multiple crafts, different revert scenarios (from runway, in flight, post crash).

As for the science lab, I can buff it a little, but I might need to increase the weight slightly in turn, since at present it has half the science capacity for half the weight as the 2.5m lab.\n\nI have a hunch that the navball bug only occurs if the part is the root part of the craft. Reason for this is that I had a similar issue with a Tweak Scaled KSPI fuel tank yesterday where it kept resizing to default size whenever I reloaded or reverted to launch. Changing the root part to something un-scaled fixed the issue and I suspect it might be why you dont see the bug. Try making it root part. I think cabins will often be root parts, so it would be good to know why it was happening.\n\nYeah, probably was that. Had fun withe the MATTOCK engines anyway, no matter.\n\nThe science lab is a tricky one, right now IMO it\u0027s only good for resetting experiments, but any science class can do that so it\u0027s simply not worth having as I found out when I tried it. Admittedly I only had a single 1\\* scientist, but with only 250 data the science return was 0.003 after several days of research. Maybe reduce the weight to a quarter and make it half as long for 250 science since the research return isn\u0027t linear? I think 350-400 data for half weight would be fair TBH, but it\u0027s your mod. I shan\u0027t be using it again, and I could easily edit the config if I did want to so no need to change it on my behalf."},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbas_ad_astra","CreatedById":126593,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T00:11:48Z","Content":"Hey SuicidalInsanity,\n\nYour service bay isn\u0027t properly shielding its contents as it is right now. (Quick way to test: put a solar panel inside, set it to an action group, launch, and try toggling it while the bay is closed. If the panels open, they\u0027re not protected, and neither is anything else inside.) The ModuleCargoBay doesn\u0027t point to the animation module, and the center is surrounded by a tank, so it wouldn\u0027t actually shield anything even if the DeployModuleIndex were correct. (Check out [my post over here](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/124701-Troubles-with-non-hollow-cargo-bays) for more details.) To fix it, delete the current ModuleCargoBay and replace it with these:\n\n    MODULE{    name = ModuleCargoBay    DeployModuleIndex = 1    closedPosition = 0    lookupRadius = 1    lookupCenter = 1, -0.5, 0}MODULE{    name = ModuleCargoBay    DeployModuleIndex = 1    closedPosition = 0    lookupRadius = 1    lookupCenter = -1, -0.5, 0}\n\nThis puts a ModuleCargoBay \u0022bubble\u0022 on each side of the center tank, so the rays properly catch the parts to be shielded, and \u0022DeployModuleIndex = 1\u0022 indicates that the animation is the second module in the config (counting zero-indexed), after the ModuleLiftingSurface.\n\nAlso for your consideration, here\u0027s a patch that will let engineers in the lab be more effective for building stuff with Extraplanetary Launchpads -- not as much as they could be in a workshop, but better than a command pod (in line with the stock lab):\n\n    @PART[M2X_SmallLab]:AFTER[ExtraplanetaryLaunchpads]{    MODULE    {        name = ExWorkshop        productivityFactor = 0.6    }}\n\nFinally, the small lab should have mk2 as its bulkheadProfiles, not size2, which is for round 2.5m things.\n\nThanks!"},{"CreatedByName":"Hazelnut","CreatedById":146815,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-15T08:11:45Z","Content":"Ah that would be why my Science Jr kept exploding on re-entry when it was in the cargo bay then?

That said, a few things have come up while fooling around with it -\n\n1) I\u0027ve been having a few issues with the high-visibility cockpit - just how much clearance do you need from the ground to get a Kerbal in/out? I\u0027ve got a rover that looks similar to your front-page example but using rugged wheels instead of balloon ones, and even with a decent ground clearance Jeb remains stuck ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\n2) Likewise, I\u0027ve noticed the VTOL rear engine doesn\u0027t let you attach anything to it - while I get the engine itself should be left alone, it\u0027d be nice to be able to strap tails to the sides of the mounting, yeah? I can\u0027t speak to the other engines and their, uh, mountability, but this one stood out to me whilst I was building my zoomy devices.\n\n3) The science lab seems a little... light. I get it\u0027s smaller, and holds less science, but even so I\u0027d expected it to be a pretty heavy payload - and it\u0027s nearly half the weight of the stock example, which should probably be the \u0027gold standard\u0027.\n\n4) I\u0027m also mildly bothered by the fact the nuclear jet is surprisingly light and remarkably high-peformance (even with decent thrust vectoring on a naked nozzle, apparently?) for a pay-no-fuel-ever engine, but that might be my personal sensibilities showing ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\n5) Is it possible to have the Utility section actually toggle between LFO/Fuel/Oxidiser/Monopropellant instead of just having sliders for all three? Don\u0027t get me wrong, it works as is, but it feels a little weird that you can a) load a single part up with all three, and ![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) you can take oxidiser out but don\u0027t get to pack any extra liquid fuel in for your troubles, if that makes sense. I\u0027ve been using this part a whole lot, because it\u0027s awesome, so the incongruity has stuck out. Perhaps this is just a matter for having another mod alongside? I don\u0027t really know.\n\nDon\u0027t get me wrong, though - this mod is one of my favourites, because I love me some Mk2 planes, and this is my favourite parts pack for them bar none. In fact it\u0027s the fact I use it so heavily that I\u0027ve noticed the quirks, and wanted to comment accordingly. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"SuicidalInsanity","CreatedById":143878,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T23:36:30Z","Content":"@Kerbas\\_ad\\_astra;\n\nThanks! I\u0027ll implement this in the next update.\n\n@Kweller;The engine FX is not supposed to to be present when off and on launchpad. Why it\u0027s happening, I don\u0027t know, I\u0027ve never seen this behavior on my test copy of KSP - does the stock turbojet have a similar issue? Are you running any FX mods that might have a compatibility issue?\n\n@Reiver; 1) Yeah, that cockpit is finicky, which is why I ultimately added the top hatch - kerbals can enter through the bottom hatch, but leaving through the bottom I found to be hit or miss. I\u0027ll most likely be reworking the model somewhat for the next update.\n\n2) [I\u0027m depreciating the old clunky J.Edgar engines](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/121514-Mk2-Mk3-Expansion-Dev-thread?p=2074174\u0026viewfull=1#post2074174) come next update for nicer, more usable models, and the engine that takes the place of the rear mount VTOL engine will have a 1.25m attach node on the end for primary jet engines, tails, etc.\n\n3) When I originally make the mk2 lab I made it half the weight for half the efficiency. This didn\u0027t quite end up as intended, so a rebalance of the mk2 sci lab is in progress.\n\n4) The Rontgen was always something that I\u0027m less than totally happy with. Cnceptually, it was an end game engine to allow exploration of more planets with aircraft. In practice, it seems, the balance of it is still a little off. I can\u0027t really make it any heaver, but I can take another look at the velcurve and atmo curve. Alternatively, I can make default its usage of Enriched Uranium, giving it a finite flight time before it becomes a mildly radioactive dead weight.\n\n5) With the base mod, the universal tank has small tankage for the main fuel types, removing oxidizer and not getting more LF is in this case no different than trying the same thing with a FL-T800; the ability to toggle between fuel types is added with IntersetellarFuelSwitch, which is included with the mod as an extra."},{"CreatedByName":"Feradose","CreatedById":111211,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-17T05:49:37Z","Content":"\u003E ![zk0lIhn.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/zk0lIhn.jpg)\n\nBrakes off, engine inactive, no effects or graphics mods."},{"CreatedByName":"volcanicshrimp","CreatedById":139666,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-17T15:49:03Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E What other parts did you have in mind?\n\nmainly the crew capability of the cockpits etc. but I guess if they\u0027re later in the tech tree they might be balanced (I use sandbox almost all of the time)"},{"CreatedByName":"SuicidalInsanity","CreatedById":143878,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-18T00:36:03Z","Content":"@Kweller; Try deleting the Mk2 expansion from your Gamedata and doing a fresh install."},{"CreatedByName":"Rath","CreatedById":138223,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-18T14:09:36Z","Content":"How about a half size crew cabin?"},{"CreatedByName":"SuicidalInsanity","CreatedById":143878,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T23:20:21Z","Content":"@Rath; Maybe?
