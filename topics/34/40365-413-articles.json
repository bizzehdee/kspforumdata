For AM in particular I setup an AM containment tanker at KSP. When I\u0027m about to recover a craft that has a supply of AM I note how much and use TAC to add that to the tanker. Similarly when I want to launch a craft with some AM I add the desired amount to the ship and subtract it from the tanker. slightly cheaty but its mostly just saveing me alot of bussy work that should be handled by the ground crew anyway.

If you give it a cheeper value to avoid that now its too easy to just run a few contracts to buy the stuff and just skip collection.

My maximum dissipation was 5x the total heat production of the radiator. I know the radiators are more effective in atmosphere but it seems really strange to me that they\u0027re less than 1/5th as efficient in vacuum.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen in vacuum, the amount of heat dissipated by the radiators depends very strongly upon the radiator temperature (proportional to the fourth power of the temperature). The temperature is determined by how much of your WasteHeat capacity is filled. The net effect of this is that in space, if you generate waste heat at a constant rate, the level of stored waste heat on your ship will increase until it reaches equilibrium (the rate at which waste heat is removed by radiators is equal to the rate at which waste heat is produced). Note that no matter how many radiators you add to your ship, if you are generating power in space, you will ALWAYS have nonzero stored waste heat, because your radiators need to heat up in order to function. Adding more radiators will let you push the equilibrium temperature/amount of stored waste heat lower, but it\u0027s very hard to push it below a certain level due to how strong the temperature dependence is (to halve the equilibrium temperature, you need 16 times the radiator area). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen in an atmosphere, radiators will also dump heat by convection. This is modeled as a fairly large level of waste heat removal that does NOT depend upon the radiator temperature. Technically that\u0027s not how it should work in the real world, but it\u0027s how it\u0027s coded at the moment. This is why you can have 0 stored waste heat while generating power in atmosphere- heat is being removed by convection faster than it is produced by the reactor, so your radiators don\u0027t heat up at all. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn top of that, if you\u0027re using an unupgraded Akula reactor (particle bed reactor), that has an optimum operating temperature- if it heats up above that optimum temperature, its power output drops. Also, generator efficiency is determined by the difference between the reactor temperature and the radiator temperature. Upgraded radiators plus unupgraded fission reactors can cause problems because the maximum radiator temperature is actually above the reactor temperature- if you have very few radiators and they heat up to the reactor temperature, the generator efficiency will drop to 0%. Your reactor won\u0027t melt, but you won\u0027t get much electricity, either. The VAB thermal helper should let you check that, though- look at the equilibrium temperature/generator efficiency figures for 100% power.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WaveFunctionP","CreatedById":104784,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-21T10:36:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Lightwarrior\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Lightwarrior\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYes, i can use tac fuel balancer, and will probably use it as i did in 0.23.

It assumes that the intended behavior of the player is to \u0022cheat\u0022 to obtain those resources freely (since time has no effective cost in game). I was saying that the only reason why such methods are viable is because the resource system isn\u0027t design to disincentivize such behavior and that the systems could be modified to provide more depth. I think that you are missing another critical point in that if the cost of resources is high, player psychology tends to turn to a grinding strategy (doing boring stuff over and over because it is more optimal) vs playing the game the way it was intended. Meaning that you could make antimatter cost really high and it would just incentivize many players into grinding contracts for currency. This behavior is not exactly unknown, it is pretty predictable. From camping in EQ, to mining in EvE, to farming in D3, if there is a more efficient way to do something in a game, it will be done that way by the majority, even if the thing itself is unfun so much so that it makes them hate the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI rather a system that rewards high tier technologies by setting up infrastructure to support those technologies. IE, sending a am collector to Jool, vs sitting on the tarmac time warping with impunity. I\u0027d rather you have to collect said resource by performing a mission and then recover the resources that have been collected before they can be made available in the VAB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, there is no \u0022buying\u0022 in a sandbox game, so I must admit your post is very confusing. The examples in your previous posts are the exact type of unfun behavior I\u0027m talking about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eafaik, the only resources that can\u0027t be collect in the background is He-3.

When fractal comes back, he is not likely to incorporate any of my code into the base kspi. And in fact, each time he updates the code I have to go back and reapply all the changes manually because his repo isn\u0027t functional or complete. Which means that I am very wary of making any code changes since it basically means double the work for me. Unless I get word that fractal isn\u0027t coming back, few changes will likely happen that aren\u0027t bug fixes or part.cfg edits. Fractal is a much better programmer than I am, so I don\u0027t expect things to be different should he come back. And he has already mentioned some fairly big code changes in development. Since he doesn\u0027t share the code while he works on it, I have no option to wait just like the rest of you or risk wasting a bunch of time and effort on work that will be made obsolete in the next version.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am happy that some of you have chosen to use my version, and I\u0027ll continue updating it as long as I am playing KSP regularly.
