Ordinary users will probably never notice, but I actually spotted a couple of things I want to correct on some of the parts in the video. It\u0027s always nice with a new perspective - so feel free to post pictures and videos of what you\u0027re doing with Behemoth Aerospace Engineering Large Parts in this topic.

When we get up in the larger sizes, I don\u0027t think maintaining the 1.25m gap is very useful, so at least on *greystork*\u0027s island, size 5 is 7.5m and size 6 is 10m."},{"CreatedByName":"greystork","CreatedById":131085,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T11:22:50Z","Content":"Here\u0027s a little news update, so you guys have something to look forward to!\n\nVersion 1.2.0 is in the skunkworks, and this is what I have planned for it:\n\n- Extremely heavy solid rocket boosters to fit the three stack sizes.\n- Extra long landing legs that clear the Ajax engines.\n- Large radial decoupler with built-in sepratrons.\n- Ablative heat shields.\n\nI estimate that the new version will be out in about a week\u0027s time.
