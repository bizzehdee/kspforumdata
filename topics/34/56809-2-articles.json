I\u0027d say any kind of dropbox or google drive link would be super easy, but really it\u0027s anything I don\u0027t need to \u0022agree to terms\u0022 before I can see your files. The guy was right about the screenshot: imgur is really easy, but you could also just as easily put a JPG/PNG in dropbox so I don\u0027t see that it\u0027s required. Pastebin may not require terms agreements. I think I\u0027ve visited that one before. You could try that if you don\u0027t have a dropbox (and on a side note if you don\u0027t have dropbox or google drive, they are friggin\u0027 awesome). We could start with just the log and forget the screenshot if it\u0027s easier since I bet if the log doesn\u0027t have it the screenshot won\u0027t either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you for your support and for the clarification. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have tried dropbox and google drive before.
