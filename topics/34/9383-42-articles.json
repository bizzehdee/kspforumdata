Does anybody else have the problem with the button not showing ? I play in windowed mode, 1024x768 and the button is not showing at all, even with both of the parts mounted.

It\u0027s just caused too many problems for me. As noted above, I think there are some memory issues with 0.20, and something about Mapsat -- I think it\u0027s the .jpg drawing routine -- is making everything worse. It\u0027s managable with the old version (the game freezes the first time you use Mapsat, but copying over my old maps and anomalies file fixes that), but the new version is too much. I think it\u0027s the huge increase in the size of the maps that\u0027s the culprit. I assume (lacking any real coding knowledge, for the record) that those files are being loaded into basically the same space as the textures, and it\u0027s overwhelming the KSP memory manager when Mapsat is combined with texture-heavy part sets like KW or the Novapunch Gemini pack. I don\u0027t blame ISA at all -- I think this is a more general KSP issue. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESigh.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lalwcat","CreatedById":3041,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-26T18:00:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan we get the ability to drag or otherwise move the icon for MapSat?
