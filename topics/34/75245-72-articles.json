I know that there is the desire to be able to transmit back science, if you are interested in transmitting any, but I want a reason to HAVE to MAINTAIN contact. To simulate the desire of the kerbonauts to hear from home, and send some hellos of their own. Also to you know, receive orders and updates etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I\u0027ve thought of a few things that could be implemented to simulate this. They come in the form of penalties to play when there is no signal back to kerbin, and rely on existing mechanics. This is to attempt to make it non-invasive to the existing experience, simple to code and easy to learn. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, number one, map view while in control of a disconnected manned vehicle will revert to tracking station level 1 style, no-planning, non-orbital view. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENumber two, if snacks/TAC-LS is installed an increase in snack/food consumption-waste production......anxiety and such.....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENumber three if scansat is installed and there is no scan sat part on the vessel scan sat small and large views disabled. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the goal here is to make it a small annoyance to loose signal for a bit, but completely feasible to plan for. The LS related effects could be made to scale related to the population on board the vessel, so more kerbals = less stress/anxiety related to lack of social outlets. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Perhaps to further simply code, on point two rather then attempting to modify TAC-LS/SNACKS! rates on the fly a generator could be activated which consumes the related resources. Same effect. Easy to vary the amount as population changes too. At least I think, I haven\u0027t actually written any code in about 10 years.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT2: Another penalty could be number four: mks module efficiency negatively affected, proportional to population again.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-03T18:00:37Z\u0022 title=\u002201/03/2015 06:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Errol\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-03T11:18:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EQuestion: Is this the error message when you don\u0027t have a connection and try to send data?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.minus.com/i8czYfxX7x1dX.png\u0022 alt=\u0022i8czYfxX7x1dX.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see, I do have a dish on it.

I have lots of Ground Stations (with the Kerbinside mod) and it looks weird.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- is it somehow possible to add some in game support for the Kerbinside bases, so that you only activate a ground control station when you purchase/upgrade one of the specific bases?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- the Antenna Range mod by Toadicus has a really cool idea, increasing electric charge when outside nominal range and that got me thinking. I use the Root model in Remotetech but I still can\u0027t really get over the nagging idea of an antenna suddenly loosing signal at the range limit. Is it possible to add a new \u0022Root\u002B\u0022 method, in which any antenna that tries to communicate outside of its nominal range (but within the root range of her link) gets an exponential drawback? Something like Electrical charge or even Light speed time? The logic would be that you should still be able to send commands to a very far away probe, but unless you equip it with a powerful antenna, the small one will get garbled info so the command needs to be sent again and again until it\u0027s complete.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WuphonsReach","CreatedById":130759,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-03T21:45:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Xira1234\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Xira1234\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAhh.
