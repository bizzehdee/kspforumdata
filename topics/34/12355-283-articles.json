I hate to be \u0022that guy\u0022, but its getting worse and worse for me. MJ ist constantly misscalculating his burns (crashing into the ground), waits to the very last second for burns (crashing into the ground), tries to to burn corrections and keeps hanging at the last 0-1% (doing nothing noticeble, and consequently crashing into the ground). The good thing is, that i\u0060ve gotten used to it (at least with non-stock engines, ksp interstellar engines for instance is something that MJ completely doesnt understand most of the time), and therefore rather good for my needs to land myself in most situations. But i always liked the perfectionism of MJ autolanding and the offer to handle lots of standard situations, and most of all \u0022precision landings\u0022 near bases. What happened? In what cases can i trust MJ, and in which i can not?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing... picked a landing spot on Moho, MJ makes his burns, Auto-Warp is on, and now MJ hangs with the Statusmessage \u0022Deorbit burn complete: waiting for the right moment to start braking\u0022.

If MJ is doing it, the target indicator (the blue one) doesn\u0027t move once it shows up in map view. It also pops itself onto the map far to the west of the target, instead of the intersect point of the orbit with the surface. MJ seems to take the data from the indicator when plotting out the last part of the burn, which is why it wants to burn pro-grade. Maybe this is at the root of the problem with all of these landing modes, whether at Kerbin or Moho, or some other body.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESide note - Feature request: For better rendezvous, could we get an option about when MJ starts the velocity match burn? Perhaps something that allows MJ to begin the node burn earlier than the projected start time (typically half the burn duration ahead of the node). I\u0027ve had occasions where I\u0027ve screamed past asteroids at multi-hundreds of m/s at closures of less than 300 m, simply because the burn started later than it should (happens a lot) or because my ship\u0027s engine is a low-TWR type that takes minutes to bring the velocity down (instead of seconds). A checkbox to begin the burn at the full-burn-duration ahead of the node would be helpful; a slider allowing us to vary the time between half-duration and full-duration ahead of the node would be great.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"smart013","CreatedById":106088,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-11T16:20:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne little detail, not really a bug, but maybe something to investigate.
