Some of the extracted kethane is used to power the four rector units to stabilize power consumption and the rest is converted into liquid fuel and oxidizer and pumped into the centre tank. Once full, the four kethane tanks would be filled with raw kethane. I could then launch back up and rendezvous with a ship in orbit and transfer the kethane to the ship\u0027s fuel tank. I\u0027m not sure whether conversion at this stage would happen on the lander or on the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously a lander like this will only really work for low-gravity worlds, but it is feasible?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SnappingTurtle","CreatedById":69795,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-27T17:07:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKethane converters have to be directly attached to a fuel tank.
