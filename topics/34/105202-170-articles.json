So, what happens when batteries are empty, grace period is over - and I switch back to the vessel that let\u0027s say is in full sunlight when I do?\n\u003E \n\nJust to be clear - scavenging of Supplies is an LS feature, and doesn\u0027t require any modules: Kerbals will just scavenge if they need to, instead of staving when there\u0027s a box of food just outside the hatch.\n\nAnd: It recomputes given the updated information.  Before any status effects are applied - so if you have a vessel that says it\u0027s been out of EC for three years - but you haven\u0027t visited it in that time, and it\u0027s got plenty of hab/supplies, and it\u0027s got EC generation, when you switch back you\u0027re Kerbals will be fine.\n\nBasically: Ignore EC except on your current vessel, and then only worry about it if it\u0027s actually going down.  As long as you have enough generation to cover it whenever you decide to look at the vessel, you\u0027ll be fine.  (And yes, there\u0027s a loophole you can abuse there: A station that has no EC storage, spends half it\u0027s time in shadow, and is only solar powered will never \u0027run out\u0027 of EC according to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS if you make sure to never visit it in shadow.)"},{"CreatedByName":"strudo76","CreatedById":175831,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-19T03:41:29Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 11 hours ago, DStaal said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On the hab time being indefinite: Were you on Kerbin?

I did some testing and it seems that the habtime calculations are done *individually* for each multiplier part, so they are indeed reduced to 1/10 of their multiplier for each (assuming each has an crew affected stat of 1).
