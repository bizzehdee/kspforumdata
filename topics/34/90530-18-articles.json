What seems to happen for me is, \u003Cem\u003Eif\u003C/em\u003E you zoom out, then hit the GUI button, the nodes will blow up to the size of what they would look like if you were zoomed in to 100%. So, if you hit the GUI button while zoomed in at 100%, the button sizes won\u0027t change. But, if you zoom out to 60%, then hit the GUI button, the nodes will grow in size.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m also trying to write a similar plugin that will dynamically hide the nodes, change the parents and possibly change node positions, but is similar to module manager\u0027s method of editing config files.
