Each F-1 engine produced the same amount of thrust as the five J-2s on the second stage combined; since you have the second stage listed as making 400 thrust, shouldn\u0027t the first stage\u0027s thrust be double its current value of 1000?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly, a number of the proposals investigated used stretched stages to provide more fuel, partly for more powerful engines to lift a larger payload, and partly for extended burn time to get a larger payload to orbit.

In this way I didn\u0027t have to use the third stage (which is really only to get to the moon) to properly get into orbit... in fact I had to ditch the second stage with some fuel remaining. From around 50km altitude @ orbital velocity (2330 or something), using the lunar rocket I was able to speed up to just shy of 4km/s - I have no idea how effective this speed would be for a lunar orbit insertion... according to the kerbal calculator to do a transfer orbit out to the distance of earth\u0027s moon you only need about 3.3km/s...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Andras","CreatedById":3716,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-08-22T13:35:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot entirely correct about the 3rd stage Frost.

I did a circular orbit insertion at as low as possible with my vertical velocity running out just at around 35-36k specifically to preserve as much fuel as possible for lateral thrust, and still didn\u0027t have enough juice from the second stage to get much more than 1300km/s laterally.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have Moach\u0027s escape system on top, the modified RCS, and some damn rocket nozzle under it, that\u0027s it.

You should get to 0* about 34km, and only ignite stage 2 when you hit 300m/s velocity. Burning at 100% until you hit orbital speed, you should be within seconds of running out of fuel.
