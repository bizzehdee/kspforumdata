We do not currently have such a functionality.\n\u003E \n\u003E Also please put requests for mod metadata fixes into the CKAN thread or, preferably, onto the CKAN githut pages so we can adress them.\n\nDazpoet: I got that from your quick guide - the way it reads you said that you index Kerbalstuff, and you say that you dont even need the .nkan file in the distro. Did I read that wrong?\n\nAs for the rest, I was simply trying to help the author here with getting his stuff into CKAN - CKAN is a great tool and this is a great app.\n\nAnd I\u0027ll post it to the CKAN thread you suggest, but you still have an ancient version in the repository that lists separate versions of 1.25m and 2.5m, and they are 1.2, not the current unified 1.5 version that I referenced above. So CKAN is not working as it should.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nFYI, ctn: I\u0027ll post up to CKAN thread and see if I can get this sorted out for you. You just keep making the awesome stuff, I\u0027ll try to make sure your best and latest are widely available!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-31T19:44:03Z\u0022 title=\u002205/31/2015 07:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Murdabenne**"},{"CreatedByName":"Kitworks","CreatedById":97023,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T00:06:55Z","Content":"Love this.
