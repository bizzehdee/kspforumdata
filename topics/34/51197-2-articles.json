I\u0027m having an issue with shuttles though: because these engines are well off the side from the center of mass, there is a convolution between yaw and roll: When the engines yaw, the craft both yaws and rolls. This often leads my shuttles to roll out of control, especially late in the ascent, out of the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo question: is the axis that the engines do their yaw gimbal relative to along the main thrust axis, or the direction that the craft is pointing? If it is along the thrust axis then this shouldn\u0027t be happening (because presumably that axis is through the COM).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuggestions: If it is relative to \u0022forward\u0022, is it possible to make it relative to the engine\u0027s thrust axis? Separately, can the yaw gimbal range be kept less free than the pitch? Like keep the 10 degree pitch range, but decrease yaw to a more conventional 1 degree?

While it doesn\u0027t make it \u0022easy\u0022, per se, this does at least make it feasible to build true space shuttle designs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do have a couple of observations though. Mostly just related to balance, which is obviously subjective anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. The gimbaling doesn\u0027t actually seem to activate unless the engine is \u0022staged\u0022. If, instead, the engines are activated manually or through an action group, they don\u0027t gimbal at all. This is only a problem because it\u0027s pretty normal to activate the OMS/deactivate the SSME\u0027s with an action group.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Honestly, the OMS engines seem massively overpowered. They deliver a huge amount of thrust for their size, while being some of the more efficient engines available. A more modest thrust of 30-40 for the single engine and 60 for the double engine would be a bit more balanced I think.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. The large SSME is pretty well balanced overall, but it could be argued that it\u0027s ability to pivot to 0 degrees renders the OMS engines obsolete, since it can serve as it\u0027s own massively powerful OMS engine once in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, like I said.
