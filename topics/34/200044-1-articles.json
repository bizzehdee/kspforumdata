It is an ice world, in contrast to its parent planet\u0027s lava seas. This moon does, however, have four impact craters that have gone deep enough to create lava at the bottom. Ieros is 497km in radius (without craters, it would be 505km, craters are 9km deep), has an atmosphere, and has 0.67g surface gravity. it does have oxygen in its atmosphere from reactions, tho its atmosphere is consisted of water vapor, which would rapidly form into clouds since it is a bit too far for liquid water. Lorewise, the reason why it has lava is similar to Hados, the main impactor that struck Hados let out a large amount of debris, most of which crashed back into Hados, but some pieces escaped from low orbit and reached Ieros, where most got pulled in\u00A0 and impacted. most of the impact craters on Leros got filled with warm slush that was created from the heat of the impacts. there are temporarily habitable regions on the moon, it is warmer than it was. Only four impactors were large enough to fully penetrate the ice, and launch away the slush/water to keep from filling in the crater and extinguishing the lava. the lava on this moon is nearly cooled, but is still dangerously hot. realistically, the lava craters would produce intense thermals, where very hot air meets very cold air, creating thunderstorms the moon has never seen in billions of years. There are high concentrations of ore inside of the craters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:24px;\u0022\u003EIchor and its moon\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:24px;\u0022\u003EIchor\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022XojBEBC.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/XojBEBC.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIchor is a frozen super-kerbin close to the edge of the Estrela Dobre system. its surface temperature is very low at just 114 Kelvin, and a thin atmosphere that barely extends 20 km above its surface.\u00A0 This planet\u0027s atmosphere consists of primarily Nitrogen and Argon, and has trace amounts of oxygen in it, which is too thin for jet engine operation.

If you\u0027re not, one thing that would go a long way would be to get rid of the specularity (the white spot facing the sun) on the gas giant.

I don\u0027t know if it has oceans, but if it does it\u0027s oceans look more like flat rock than an ocean. If you have an ocean, you should have the ocean as a separate map, with transparency for land. You should put that map in ScaledVersion, and the regular map for the land in the VertexColorMap section of PQS. Doing so causes specularity to only be on the ocean and ignore the land, making the oceans look more like oceans rather than flat rock. The color palette of Correlate also doesn\u0027t agree with me. As a general rule, vibrant colors always look bad on planets, so I think you should cut saturation in half and readjust the color palette to make it look a little better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThird, Paxt looks to me what\u0027s called a \u0022noiseball.\u0022 A noiseball is a planet where it\u0027s only terrain is rolling hills. I have made a few of those, if you want to see them look at the older versions of the planets in my Japris Stellar Neighborhood. Now they all look much better, of course. Adding craters to Paxt\u0027s heightmap would go a long, long way in making the moon nicer.\u00A0 OystD also suffers from this problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, it looks like your gas giants need a normal map. Simply make a normal map using any normal map plugin out of a grayscaled version of your texture, and save that as your normal map in your config.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, is adding alien structures floating in the atmosphere possible? It is possible to add easter eggs, but I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s possible to add one floating in the atmosphere. Even if you did add one, it would be exceedingly hard to pinpoint one of these, assuming your alien structure is 1 km in size, and your planet is 8,000\u00A0km\u00A0in radius, then the surface area of your planet would be 8.04*10^8 km, or your alien structure would take up 1/804000000\u00A0 of your planet\u0027s surface area. I\u0027m going to assume here because I don\u0027t know the maximum distance an easter egg is visible, but let\u0027s put that at 100 km.\u00A0 The volume of a sphere with a radius of 100 km is 4.9*10^6 km, or\u00A04190000 km. This sphere is roughly 0.5% of the planet\u0027s surface area. So that means that at any given time, you will be able to just barely see one of these 0.5% of the time, if , there are 10, that adds up to a poultry 5%\u00A0of the time picking at random you will end up in at least one of these spheres.\u00A0It is possible to randomly find these but the fact that most people just drop probes\u00A0in the gas giant and do nothing else it\u0027s unlikely anyone will find it without seriously searching. What compounds the problem is that there is no easy way to go searching, especially since there is no surface to refuel at and no oxygenated atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-02-05T17:05:18Z\u0022 title=\u002202/05/2021 05:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 5, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by DunaManiac\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JcoolTheShipbuilder","CreatedById":204576,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-02-05T17:59:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223920571\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022200044\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221612543105\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022176003\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DunaManiac\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n22 minutes ago, DunaManiac said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLooks like this has a lot of potential so far, I particularly like Avon and Xaxt, but I have a few suggestions:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn case you\u0027re\u00A0on Windows or Linux, I recommend using Gaseous-Giganticus for making gas giant textures.
