They are highly configurable, with good reason and need the extra space from a dedicated place to be displayed. Not only that, but you certainly do not want to accidently open all that information with a right-click on your chutes, or have to open the UI Window through each chute (though there is a symmetry toggle inside the GUI to setup symmetry partners).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T18:17:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe reason is \u0022Chris wants to take advantage of career unlocks\u0022, IIRC.
