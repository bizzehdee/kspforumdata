I\u0027m trying to build a deployment system for my unfolding rover, and the root attachment point is a piston for lowering the thing safely to the ground. (There were rails attached to the moving part of the piston that would move the unfolding rover out away from the lander before unfolding.) A scissor lift wouldn\u0027t extend into the surface it\u0027s attached to at the base, preventing this issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI couldn\u0027t figure out why my lander was exploding on the launchpad during separation tests (the top part pops off to fly back up into orbit).
