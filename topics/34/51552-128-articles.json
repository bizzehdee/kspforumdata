You should check in the tracking station however to make certain that you have not got any duplicated ships listed there (this is now a rarely occurring bug). If you have any duplicated ships listed in the tracking station then delete the duplicate versions and exploding will then cease. \u003Cp\u003EThe separate tracking station lockup bug seems to be the only real bug coming out of the hotfix version of RT2. No known fix for that, only work-a-rounds. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you large ship is falling apart rather than violently exploding then I strongly recommend Ferram\u0027s wonderful joint reinforcement mod \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55657-0-23-Kerbal-Joint-Reinforcement-v2-1-3-7-14\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55657-0-23-Kerbal-Joint-Reinforcement-v2-1-3-7-14\u003C/a\u003E. In my experience, the TAC parts mentioned in the reddit thread you link above have particularly weak joints.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually i already use Joint Reinforcement system, this one way one of my other suspects for the issue. But thx for the duplication check in tracking station. Will check it, although i have never yet seen a duplicated ship\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do think it is a bug somewhere as regardless of weak joints in TAC components it does not make sense in scenario 2 that the ship and station are perfectly OK when connected with fuel line, yet do a quick and violent disassemble a second later when kerbal enters capsule.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy rough guess is that it deals somewhere with taking over control (or determining which module controls the joined parts), as in both cases the disintegration happened precisely when it should show the joined ship (1-2 sec after docking)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-25T13:12:22Z\u0022 title=\u002203/25/2014 01:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 25, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Grunf911\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kaa253","CreatedById":68628,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-25T13:33:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt sounds like a KAS issue to me rather than an RT2 one.
