I also enjoyed GPP a great deal, but found it not quite as challenging as I would have liked, so I nearly always played it at 3x or 3.2x scale. However, there were problems with using Sigma Dimensions and GPP as it relates to terrain height, atmosphere depth, and the location of anomalies. JNSQ at native 2.7x solves these issues and allows fine tuning of terrain slopes, atmosphere height, and anomalies for a better integrated gameplay experience.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGPP and JNSQ are both designed for advanced players who want a greater challenge. If the challenge is too much for a player, that player should simply go back to the stock system rather than complain that the challenge should be made less challenging. One of the great thing about KSP is its modability, so each player can find a balance that is enjoyable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"eberkain","CreatedById":157548,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-02-10T10:14:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223738704\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022184880\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221581320167\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022198037\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022fragtzack\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, fragtzack said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan you share a real life example where 3 rockets\u00A0 engines (with separate tanks) has been used?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScott Manley just did a video on OTRAG the other day, which was an system where they strapped together a bunch of identical rockets to make a bigger rocket.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022 data-embed-src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/ed4w4Cz5ccU?feature=oembed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"afafsa","CreatedById":129680,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-02-10T11:06:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI mean, he\u0027s kind of right that the 1.25 parts are a bit underpowered, but honestly that only matters for the first flight.

That is very much at the small end of the scale in terms of size. Pretty much any rocket with substantial performance is going to be the equivalent of 1.875m, 2.5m and up (in KSP diameter terms). 1.25m parts are more comparable to something like RocketLab\u0027s Electron - suitable only for small, LEO-ish satellites.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRe \u0022where the 2.5x/2.7x number came from\u0022 - it has long been accepted that KSP parts are 62.5/64% of the IRL size for their equivalents. I personally do not know where that number came from - it was already an assumption when I started modding. I believe it\u0027s based on the relative size of the Mk1 pod to the Mercury among other things. Given that, and assuming that you\u0027re balancing in line with stock parts - a tank of given volume has the same ratio of fuel, dry mass,etc compared to stock tanks, for example - then to make rockets perform \u0022realistically\u0022 the sweet spot was found to be ~2.5x/2.7x. IE if you build a rocket with a realistically proportioned payload it will more or less do what it does IRL. Think, building out a Saturn V and having it actually *just* accomplish a moon mission rather than being able to go out to Jool on like, the second stage. \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Personally I don\u0027t know where the specific comment on engines came from - proportionally, KSP engines are more or less realistically balanced other then their dry mass. My understanding was that it comes from the sum total of the way the KSP parts are balanced, particularly in that they have much higher dry masses overall than in real life. The point is the net effect of the scaling, balance ratios, etc results in ~2.7x being the point where kerbal scale rockets behave realistically.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Norcalplanner","CreatedById":112223,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-02-10T15:23:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223738745\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022184880\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221581334150\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022113260\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sigma88\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 hours ago, Sigma88 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNone were ever reported to me, otherwise I would have looked into it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you have any examples I would apreciate some feedback on what the issues are so that I can fix them\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProblems is probably the wrong word.
