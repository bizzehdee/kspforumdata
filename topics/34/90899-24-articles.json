By measuring the size of the warp drive using my mobile colony, which is bigger than the warp sphere, against the E class I currently have orbiting Kerbin I can safely say that the warp bubble is just big enough to get the E class inside it. Unfortunately by that I mean you would have to place the warp drive inside the asteroid at least in the case of the E class I have since the bubble only covers about 1/2 to 3/4 of the asteroid from outside. As for the claw in use while warping.... No just no. I am not sure if it is how we did our version, still using that while waiting for the official roll in from rover, or the claw itself but I get weirdness and explosions at random times. I suspect it is the claw and the fact that placing your ship directly aligned with center of mass is near impossible that is causing it all.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-14T11:42:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eheh, concur on the claw.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso will be adding you and Helaeon to the credits because your contributions are awesome \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Serino","CreatedById":127188,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-16T17:40:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYea after doing some more testing it is definitely the claw.

You don\u0027t have to do that burn all at once, maybe 60 or 120 seconds worth at a time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo bleed off the velocity difference with only the warp drive and gravity, I usually warp back to periapsis after traveling about 5 minutes away from it. The effect of gravity is strongest the closer you are to the body. I do it this way so I don\u0027t have to keep re-activating the drive. I\u0027ve also had a few mishaps where I miss the cut-off distance and warped into the planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is more convenient as you can warp directly to the periapsis and no further if it\u0027s outside of the drive\u0027s cutoff. If you warp past periapsis you will gain velocity and have to re-lose it. This method is not as efficient as warping so that you are traveling away normal but still pretty good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can use Kerbol to change your momentum and direction if you as well which can make things much simpler for capture. For example you\u0027d warp close to Kerbol (well outside de-activation distance!) and set it up so when you are falling at it, you are traveling the same direction Jool is and then warp away for Jool when your velocity is about 3900-4000 m/s. Go directly to Jool and you should find yourself requiring very little dV to capture or you will end up in orbit immediately (you need to take up the correct position though so your velocity is in the right direction).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tend to fly in map mode with the navball up. Also have a HUD from Kerbal Engineer Redux with readouts that help quite a bit. Especially now that we can usually turn while warping!

Hyperbolics you only have to worry about losing speed so for that you wait till you are almost out of the SOI and then warp back to the planet.
