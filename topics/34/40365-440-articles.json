Basically what I\u0027m looking to do is have a profitable yet balanced mining operation to earn cash without simply adding funds, which feels like cheating to me. I know it has been said that pricing will be balanced in the future and grinding for cash/science are undesirable, but I was looking for a realistic and temporary work around to these issues. Interstellar isn\u0027t working in the science only mode and I am a fan of setting up large space stations: modular interplanetary mining/refueling/science vessels... TONS of cash... Logistically it would make sense that if a program could gather valuable resources to fund its operations it would do so and it would seem easy enough just to add a value to a few ORS resources... On the other hand, I don\u0027t want to make a mining run to a hotspot on kerbin, get back to ksp and magically have 50,000,000 either... I use karbonite as well if anyone has values they feel are reasonable for that too.

Smaller orbits means that 100km is a bigger angular difference in velocity vectors. I imagine somewhere around kerbin stationary would work since even at 100km separation you would both be travelling in relatively similar directions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could probably do a lot better using conventional engines, and easier since you would still have to negate the difference in vectors once you got closer.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JeffreyCor","CreatedById":93167,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-18T05:08:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERan into a problem with the 62.5cm \u0022SAFE-1500\u0022 Fission Reactor giving a \u0022UF4 Deprived\u0022 status.
