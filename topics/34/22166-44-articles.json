In all my testing I never got kethane unless the drill was upright and deployed on the ocean floor. I\u0027ve got the KAS cable set to 600meter length, deepest I have drilled so far was just under 500meters. Not sure how deep you can go despite KAS limitations, hooked a barometer to the drill for one of the early tests, saw almost two times the surface pressure at 78ish meters down. I plan on droping a seaprobe in a bit, see if theres a crush danger within 600meters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is the crappy test rig...I made this in 5min for proof of concept, so try not to laugh to hard as it incompleteness.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/HEeOqzL.png\u0022 alt=\u0022HEeOqzL.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethis was one of the very first tests I did, the pic was taken with drill at about 45meters depth\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-19T12:47:55Z\u0022 title=\u002206/19/2013 12:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 19, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by KhaosCorp\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Epic\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mk78123","CreatedById":63768,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-19T13:12:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022smunisto\u0022 data-cite=\u0022smunisto\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIs it confirmed that Kethane is now lighter than fuel?
