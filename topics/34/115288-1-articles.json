The parts belonging to ATK from Launchers Pack will be moved in this mod too, and since I already have all GEM motors (GEM-40, GEM-46, GEM-60) for the Delta II and Delta IV, the GEM series is already done! They are currently not included, since I am still working on the balancing, so that they work good with the Launchers Pack rockets. \n\nGenerally, I am going to make the different series of ATK (maybe not each variant of every series ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)), but I am planning to do the most important things.

All of these little packs like this and the other new engine mod you have confuses me.\n\nWell, this is actually something which is 100% based on their real world counterparts, with exact sizes etc. SELV is \u0022based\u0022 on real world stuff, but with the \u0022KSP-flare\u0022 included, meaning that the sizes are adapted for KSP, and that they look not 100% like the real parts. So SELV and ATK won\u0027t be combinated there. \n\nAs far as the LV-T continued mod is concerned, well, I agree, it was probably not very well-thought of me. I will let that thread be closed, it is just unnecessary, it fits perfectly into SELV.
