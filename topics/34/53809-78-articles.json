I went ahead and compared the atm.cfg of each version and saw no difference. Removed the Squad folder and config files alike based on rbray\u0027s recommendation, added the forced openGL target, but then I found something strange. The compression wasn\u0027t nearly as high on the 4.2v as on the 23.5, so I copied over the compressed textures from that atm folder and pasted it over the 4.2v, then tweaked my terrain settings a bit, and now I\u0027m starting at an allocated 2.1Gb. Only problem I face now is all the new textures that StationScience changed (and maybe DavonIndustries, can\u0027t remember) and I should be golden.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYet another testament to the helpfulness and community here at the KSP forums.
