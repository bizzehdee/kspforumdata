You also have the ability to remove it easy too - just delete the cfg file and reload the game. Some of my mods involve going in to every single kethane or stock part and adding code and changing other bits - to produce an open-this-add-that-change-this file would be horrendous and would be time consuming to the user and for me - on of my MM files is a couple of lines long and would be 100 times that if I had to give instructions to do it manually.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve also done a lot of edits to my game so I\u0027m planning to change these to mm cfg files so its easier to remove and add changes to the game - need a certain tank to weight this much for testing add the relevant cfg file no need to open up an editor the just remove it when I\u0027m done testing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly, if you need to upgrade ksp or any mods or if you need to reinstall them you then don\u0027t have to go through the hassle of editing the code again.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sidfu","CreatedById":70409,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-16T17:31:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eusing MM is safter. just 1 space in a bad spot cn cause all your parts to disapear till u fix it ingame( ive had it happen when manualy editing .cfg)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Crater","CreatedById":48907,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-17T13:07:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Andrewmacor\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Andrewmacor\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe thing is that i dont have MM, but the stock parts work with the mod just fine w/o me changing the stock files at all.

What I\u0027m curious about though, being new to TAC and KSP at the same time, is whether or not the base electrical consumption is scaled correctly. The default is set to a base / per Kerbal of 2400 / 1200, and the documentation describes each pod as having 24 hours worth of use available, but at those rates, my MK1 pod runs out of charge in about 20mins, which means it can\u0027t even make a full orbit of Kerbin before the juice runs out. I understand the need for a draw on the battery to support life in the pod, but it seems that the numbers might be a little off? Anyway, I\u0027ve searched through this thread, but found very little relating to my issue, so I\u0027m hoping someone can bring me up to speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RuBisCO","CreatedById":59540,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-17T20:36:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo has anyone made a mod or .cfg that allows you to use KAS boxes to transport lift support?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpacedInvader","CreatedById":106018,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-18T08:55:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022FiesesAlien\u0022 data-cite=\u0022FiesesAlien\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHeyho.\u003Cp\u003ESo far the mod is superb but for me it has one giant flaw: Electricity.

Without water 3 days is also ocay but the depletion of Electricity is so extremely high that i need over 30 Batterys to have at least 1 orbital flight!

But with career mode you get the problem, that you need a significant amount of science for those solar panels, but without them, your means to get science are limited, because both your probes and capsules run out of power.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I only just now happened upon this exchange relating to my question. I can only attribute my inability to find it earlier to a lack of search-fu. That being said, I can think of two quick ways to solve this issue for people who are playing career mode rather than sandbox.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: Scale electrical consumption with technology advancement (if possible), simulating the increased electrical draw of more advanced systems, so that early pods only use 24-50 units of charge per day, but by the time you\u0027ve researched solar panels and batteries, you\u0027ve got to keep up with the demand.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: Add a very basic battery to the initial tech node. Something with enough capacity and light enough that it could be used in groups to support Kerbals on short missions, but not nearly enough capacity to support longer missions. This would at least bootstrap players through the early tech nodes until they develop solar panels and better batteries.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust some thoughts since career mode is only going to get more people on board and it would be nice to be able to use TACLS all the way through.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Crater","CreatedById":48907,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-18T12:51:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Andrewmacor\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Andrewmacor\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThanks that answered my question.

Off hand, I only know of one instance where a mod has included toolbar anywhere else, and that was fixed within a couple of days, and was back in January.
