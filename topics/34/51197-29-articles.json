My latest series episodes have essentially been \u0022Ode to dtobi\u0027s Magic Engines\u0022. Thank you, and best of luck! I started from Day One wanting a real Space Shuttle for KSP that I don\u0027t just snap together from a kit (KSO is awesome, and back in the day the old Buran was all we had, but I\u0027m a tinkerer at heart) and that I could tune for FAR and Deadly Reentry flight. Your mods made this a reality and I want to give the most sincere thanks. My latest Shuttle that my series has started revolving around lately is the culmination of about a year\u0027s worth of development and testing, but it would have never got to orbit without these wonderful engines.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shnoo","CreatedById":125986,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-15T07:42:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi dtobi,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope you still folow this thread.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENormaly i was just downloading Mods from here and stayed silent over the time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI liked your mod very much.
