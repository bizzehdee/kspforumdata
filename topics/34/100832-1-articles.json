It has two top nodes, one for attaching to the bottom of Mk1 fuel tanks, and a second for attaching to the bottom of the Mk1 Command Pod, hiding that annoying heat-shield-shaped bottom of the pod.\n\nThe plugin is simple, it adds a window displaying the current Earth-Universe time just underneath the game\u0027s mission clock to the screen whenever the current active craft has a RocketWatch^\u2122^ on-board. The code is based heavily on Cybutek\u0027s youtube tutorials for coding, in which he teaches viewers how to add text windows to their game as their first mod.\n\nScreenshots:\n\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/nhRNG/embed?background=ffffff\u0026text=1a1a1a\u0026link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nAs noted in the album above, this part can be attached in a variety of ways, beneath the Mk1 pod, on the surface (press \u0022W\u0022 once to orient it properly for surface attachment) and between two normal Mk1 parts.\n\n[DOWNLOAD](http://spacedock.info/mod/375/RocketWatch) @ Spacedock\n\n[DOWNLOAD](https://github.com/gkorgood/RocketWatch/releases/tag/1.1.1) @ GitHub\n\nAlso if you want, the module that adds the window is called \u0022DigitalClock\u0022, so if you don\u0027t want to have to add the part to get the window, you can write up a ModuleManager file to add that module to all command pods/probe cores. I made the mod for a school project that required CAD, and don\u0027t really know my way around module manager, so I will NOT be undertaking this myself. Feel free to do it and distribute it, if you do I\u0027ll even add a link to it on this post, just give credit, please.\n\n[Source Code](https://github.com/gkorgood/RocketWatch)\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

Offset tool can be used for precise positioning.\n- Fixed any issues with nodes not attaching properly, if you still encounter these, go into the Debug menu and enable \u0022Non-strict part orientation checks\u0022\n\nThis mod is fully compatible with KSP v1.0.5!
