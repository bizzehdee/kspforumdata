They\u0027re quite robust and resistant to permanent dislocation. I\u0027ve already experienced some success with bolting them onto other chassis with minimal changes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey do, however, consume an immense amount of power. Under heavy loads (77T distributed between four arms), the compression repulsor might use as much as 25EC/s at rest. Not to mention the hundred or so EC/s from the actual drive motors (KF Small Rover Wheel, scaled to 2.25).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also have a design in development with some...double wishbone(?) suspension. That model of suspension is far less sturdy as of yet, being susceptible to permanent dislocations, snapping, and several rather energetic failure modes. It\u0027s in need of some tuning as well, as the compression and rebound repulsors are fighting and inflating power consumption, but that will come after the more severe issues are fixed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like using the repulsors because they don\u0027t have wheels\u00A0at the other end, and thus should be slightly cheaper on the processor, but the power use associated with them is suboptimal for my purposes. Also, they have no reservations about overextension and are apparently lacking the anti-punchthrough measures afforded to most of the wheels. I think all these problems could be solved for my application by making a specialized shock part containing a KSPWheel suspension module and an IR module. I realise that this is most decidedly unsupported use, and don\u0027t expect anything in particular from you guys (I fully expect to do this on my own), but I\u0027d like to know if it\u0027s possible for a suspension collider to interact with another mesh in the same part. That is, can I make the same part have both the suspension and the suspension \u0022target,\u0022 or do I need to have a different part on the distal end of the shock (like the pivot to which struts are attached)?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s a shame that nonuniform scaling isn\u0027t possible. I feel that this suspension part would benefit from having different lengths without changes in thickness. I guess that\u0027s what levers are for, though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-03T17:07:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/50750-azimech/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002250750\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/50750-azimech/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Azimech\u003C/a\u003E if the resources that \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/50907-spannermonkeysmce/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002250907\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/50907-spannermonkeysmce/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@SpannerMonkey(smce)\u003C/a\u003E linked don\u0027t work for you / aren\u0027t enough for you, let me know and I\u0027m sure I can help you get it figured out.\u00A0 KSPWheel does also have accommodations for left-handed/right-handed part mirroring, but you have to explicitly create separate left/right handed models (used on a couple of the KF parts), and setup the config for them properly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223109432\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022155056\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221499041380\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022110660\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u00220111narwhalz\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n16 hours ago, 0111narwhalz said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s a shame that nonuniform scaling isn\u0027t possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIts possible -- its just that most \u003Cstrong\u003Emodels\u003C/strong\u003E don\u0027t support it well (and it also has to be setup at the plugin level).\u00A0 Mostly it comes down to you can use non-uniform scaling, as long as nothing gets rotated afterwards (or at least not rotated on the skewed axis).\u00A0 I\u0027ve used non-uniform scaling in SSTU for various purposes (fairings, fuel tanks).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor your uses -- a specialized suspension strut for use with IR/etc -- could probably be accomplished through a very small/simple new module that manipulated/rescaled a pre-built model according to the strut parameters.\u00A0 Could also remove the EC use for internal mechanical suspension parts (no reason they should consume EC).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaalidas","CreatedById":111158,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-04T09:53:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223104463\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022155056\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221498580759\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022138730\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Shadowmage\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 6/27/2017 at 9:25 AM, Shadowmage said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny new part models / textures would be a ways out.\u00A0 I\u0027m still very overloaded at work this summer, and won\u0027t have time for much of that kind of work for a few months.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTextures would likely come first, though I would need to add/adapt a texture-switching plugin from somewhere (either integrated into KF, or added from one of the SSTU bits;

The first versions of DustFX used a form of ground-region and/or location and/or biome detection method to specify high and low color ranges (though I pretty much stuck with non-ranged values for them at the time of working on that).\u00A0 Now we use, primarily, a camera that doesn\u0027t see the vessel and just averages the texture colors it\u0027s getting.\u00A0 That aside... you could use a combination of biome-detection and texture-color-range detection to set up an approximate slippage scale that could then be adjusted along with the dust colors.\u00A0 In fact, that would allow for dust densities to be adjusted not only on the speed of the craft relative to the terrain but also based on the estimated density of the terrain.\u00A0 Obviously there wouldn\u0027t be any perfect setup unless we could get access to the stock terrain/biome stats if they even have any form of terrain density/stability statistics.\u00A0 I seem to remember there being a setting in the game detail settings that had some form of density setting for planetary features, but I don\u0027t know if that means anything when you interact with the planet in the end.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, the code could be revived, which handled complex persistent settings for the old KF, to store pre-generated stats for some estimated terrain locales which could be updated on the go to create a slow-built database of estimated values for this sort of thing.\u00A0 It shouldn\u0027t be too hard to re-implement considering all it did with KSP specifically was integrate with the config node system which, while frustrating at first, turned out to be easier to use than expected.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother variable that could be used in estimating slippage would be the estimate temperature range of the planet as a whole, and then of the latitude of the craft vs the equator.\u00A0 Warmer material would likely be muckier than colder surfaces except when dealing with concrete (so, an exception in the case of anything with an estimate color of gray but not if it\u0027s blue-gray so ice doesn\u0027t become super stable... could be tricky to code).\u00A0 It would be so much easier if the actual texture could be detected under the camera so you could make overrides for specific texture names on the surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m rambling again I think... I suspect that most of this would be impossible using the stock game implementation of planets.\u00A0 Using the code from planet expansion packs might allow detection of such details directly from the planet comfig files included with supporting mods.\u00A0 As far as I\u0027m aware, however, these mods do not replace the stock planets with their own configurations so it wouldn\u0027t be too useful to us for stock surfaces.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEither way, I foresee a lot of interaction between mods we don\u0027t control to make it all work.\u00A0 I could estimate things based on the sampled color of the terrain, but that\u0027s pretty much it without reviving and overhauling code form other sources.\u00A0 I won\u0027t say it\u0027s impossible

for this to be a thing on the code-end that I\u0027m shocked it wasn\u0027t made a thing from the get go.\u00A0 My philosophy in coding modules for KSP has always been to put the power in the part-config and, if possible, user\u0027s hands.\u00A0 I altered lo-fi\u0027s code to his great annoyance, I\u0027m sure, to take away hard-coded values for resource usage and other such things and place them in the configs with a hard-coded default for non-specifying module definitions.\u00A0 Even then, some of thsoe defaults were put in mod-specific persistent config files in the dll directory so they could be configured outside of the running game.\u00A0 I even played around with the idea of expanding the config-panel I had in the old KF plugin to allow specifying a default resource to be taken up by the wheels by default, populated from the loaded resource types in the config nodes.\u00A0 I\u0027m sure lo-fi secretly hated me for that, but I always felt that the person who might use my code in the future would want an asy way to alter things to work the way they wanted them to.\u00A0 As such, most (if not all) the original KF animation controllers came with an easy way to select whether the default state could be toggled, by scene or globally, as well as what it would start with and whether or not it could be reversed after animating.\u00A0 When possible I even tried to give the editor scene the ability to alter the speed of the animation.\u00A0 If I were doing it now, I\u0027d probably try to add adjustable lengths of the extension-retraction animations too on a per-part, per-craft, or global scale.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI guess I just figured it was my job, as the programmer, to think of all the ways a future user might want to configure the part module and then make sure that my code exported as many of those options as possible to the module config while still maintaining default values in case a config is missing something.\u00A0 It\u0027s much the same as if you look at the stock KSP part modules.\u00A0 You can leave a lot of things out of them and still have a working part because they have allowed almost everything to be specified per-part while maintaining default values for missing data.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo... yeah... if no one else gets to it in the near future, you may see some new code hacked together from me.\u00A0 Otherwise... hop to it coders.\u00A0 Chop chop.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-05T14:57:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote
