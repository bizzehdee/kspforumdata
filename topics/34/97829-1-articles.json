If you issue SetFullLock(\u0022MyModLock\u0022) 5 times, a single issue of UnsetFullLock(\u0022MyModLock\u0022) will unlock the controls. If you need to keep track of the number of locks, pass SetFullLock(\u0022MyModLock1\u0022) and SetFullLock(\u0022MyModLock2\u0022), the mod will only unlock the controls after both UnsetFullLock(\u0022MyModLock1\u0022) and UnsetFullLock(\u0022MyModLock2\u0022) have been passed to it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, to avoid conflicts, everyone must make a dependancy and use the mod as provided.

Except SQUAD did not add the throttle keys to this control lock so that even if you engage this in-game lock, touching a throttle key still behaves as normal. (Such as the kOS or RemoteTech terminal windows.) Our best guess is Squad wanted to make sure players had an emergency method to avoid a crash while the lock was engaged, but at this point leaving the throttle keys out of the lock has caused more crashes then it has prevented.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, on Linux only, when you give focus to a text box, that text box does not prevent keystrokes from falling through to KSP and executes them as game commands.

As these are not events under your own control, that happen \u0022randomly\u0022 as far as you can control, it\u0027s very annoying the effect this has on the game. You type a sentence with spaces in it like \u0022hello, everybody, come see this neat thing I made\u0022 into the chat and partway through typing it a player joins the game making the chat window print the join message, and steal focus away from the typing line. If you don\u0027t IMMEDIATELY notice this and stop your finger within about 0.1 seconds as it was on the way down to the next key, you\u0027re now controlling the craft, staging it when you hit spacebar, and so on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not *quite* the problem the mod was designed for (the inability to lock out certain keys in KSP is different from a mod author *choosing* to steal focus from the chat window on an async event like a player-join), but it\u0027s a good workaround for it anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"godarklight","CreatedById":92588,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-04T17:21:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@Steven Mading: My DMP was set off \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yeah, this is linux-specific and *freaking* annoying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think I can work around that issue you mentioned though, I suspect unity is holding an integer of the active element ID, and when a new label (message) comes in it bumps it out one which deselects it.
