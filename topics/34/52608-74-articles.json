It\u0027s just so important because KSP is so memory hungry, and we\u0027re all in this section of the forum because we like KSP mods. But why, exactly, is KSP so memory hungry? Unity includes native support for memory management and delayed loading. Unity graphics assets, packaged into *.assets files, are automatically loaded and unloaded as needed, by Unity itself. A programmer who writes managed code within Unity environment never has to worry about using too much memory unless they actually need most of their graphics all at once. Very few games ever do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly, KSP is not using this asset management system.

In all other cases, it would be pretty easy to only load textures for parts which are actually present in the scene, and throw away everything else -- KSP would run on 2-gig machines with thousands of mod parts just fine, and the delays involved in loading textures from disk would remain unnoticed among all the other mess that happens when you switch ships. Palette would be the only stumbling block, and it would be best circumvented by rendering every part into a flat image, loading those while in editor and only loading the rest when the part is actually spawned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was hoping they would do something of the sort eventually. The GameDatabase structure introduced in 0.20 looked like the beginning of such a mechanism, introduced to promote texture reuse, and offering a clear path to load and unload textures on demand.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, instead, they made those neat spinning parts in editor, which actually make unloading textures much more complicated, and ran off to make science \u003Cem\u003E(which I remain dissatisfied with)\u003C/em\u003E, technology tree \u003Cem\u003E(which was and remains silly) \u003C/em\u003Eand contracts \u003Cem\u003E(which are even sillier)\u003C/em\u003E.
