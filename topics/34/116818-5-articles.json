Recompiled with 3.5 for 1.1.0.\n\nAs for 1.1.0 I have a pretty comprehensive list of fixes and additions and bugs, these are:\n\n- Removed lag spikes (only present at scene load and scene destroy), converted everything to ConfigNode processing (no more saving and loading constantly)\n\n- Implemented realistic decay rates (atmospheric drag and solar radiation pressure)  \n\n- Implemented resource efficiency\n\n- Fixed Area and Mass calculation issues \n\n- Fixed UI colour and sizes\n\n- UI Size change in Tracking station? - Why? - How? - When? \n\n- Decay rate and decay times in UI vanished since 1.0.9.... Don\u0027t worry I\u0027ll fix this!  \n\n- Added reliance on my new Solar Cycle Simulator plugin (SCS.dll) (packaged with 1.1.0) \n\n- Implemented realistic active vessel decay \n\n- Fixed stock active vessel decay \n\nSo at the moment I am just working on the bugs and the realistic vessel decay. As I have mentioned above the SCS plugin will be packaged with the Orbital Decay mod; this introduces simulation of the 11 year solar cycle which causes variations in Orbital Drag based on levels of solar activity (most prominently the Geomagnetic Index and F10.7 radio flux)\n\n- More realism yay!\n\nThe SCS will also be released in its own thread in add on development, I have designed this as a framework for Solar Cycles, allowing other mods to be developed to take advantage of its features, such as Solar Flare effects, Geomagnetic Storms or Coronal Mass Ejections (the latter of which I hope to mod myself after 1.1.0 of this mod).\n\nSo expect a 1.1.0 release within the next week or so, depending on how these new bugs are resolved and on the accuracy of the SCS model. Hopefully I will also do some more balancing of the decay formulas, since even the realistic decay formula seems to be too fast. At the moment the equation dictates that the rate of decay is a factor of 10 or so out compared to the real life estimation that the ISS looses about 2km of Altitude each month (Equating to 4Km Semi Major Axis loss per 28 days).\n\nIn the meantime please do try and \u0027break\u0027 the plugin in your games as much as possible so I can fix anymore bugs!\n\nWhitecat106 ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-15T14:00:31Z","Content":"Interesting mod, surprised I\u0027ve missed it until now.

As for engines, the mod does not currently check for engines on a craft (only requiring the volume of the set resource), however I may include this as part of the next 1.1.0 update. (Since ISP would be pretty useful in calculating resource efficiency).\n\n    So at the moment any fuel based resource will work, engines and the efficiency calculations are in the works for 1.1.0.\n\nAs for the next update; I am still working towards implementing the SCS system (Having issues with ConfigNode parsing errors?) and working on the Resource Efficiency, (I will now also play around with requiring an engine on the vessel). So look out for an update by the end of the week!\n\nWhitecat106 ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"FreeThinker","CreatedById":117389,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-16T21:57:19Z","Content":"Interesting but where have you hosted your source files?

As for KSP1.1 support, I can see some issues are popping up here that I had not expected, not to worry I think the only problems should be UI issues (Unity 5 broke things I guess..), but hopefully once everything on my list is finished I can compile with KSP 1.1 and see what the issues are.\n\nMy list so far: (High priority) (Low priority)\n\n- Fix VesselData cfg file read/write issues \n\n- Fix SCS merge issues \n\n- Add eccentricity adjustments for SMA changes\n\n- Adjust Realistic Active Vessel decay\n\n- Add engine support (Maybe in 1.2.0)\n\n- Tweak new realistic decay prediction model\n\n- KSP 1.1 changes\n\nSo at the moment quite afew things are going on, I would like to add at this stage that very little will change for the Stock game, this next update is solely focused on RSS compatibility, 1.2.0 will focus on stock (linear) decay management.\n\n    As for gameplay at the moment, well it works, the only issues are under the hood right now, I might consider releasing a intermediate version on the old development thread for this for anyone wishing to play around abit. Satellite management is now rather challenging.\n\n- Heavier smaller satellites will remain in orbit for the longest time across altitudes.\n\n- Decay rates are so realistic now (with the calculated F10.7 flux and Geomagnetic Indexies) that spaceflight is challenging.\n\n- Light satellites (around 100kg) below 400km have lifetimes of just afew days, where ISS style structures could last for up to 400 days in orbit.\n\n- And finally... Try keeping Skylab in orbit whilst developing the Space Shuttle in time yourselves now!\n\nOf course I must also manage my other mods (Boat Navigation and Historic Missions) to make sure these are ready for KSP 1.1 too so I am pretty busy at the moment! Patience is a virtue and if anyone is willing to help me set up a github repo for this (to aid me in getting some community help and feedback) it would be greatly appreciated!\n\nWhitecat106 ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"C4pt.Miles","CreatedById":57863,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-21T06:03:55Z","Content":"Thank you for your work on this mod.
