If you setup your capsule so it has 20 days of O2 for 1 Kerbal, then you\u0027re also going to have enough CO2 scrubbers on board to keep the capsule clear of CO2 for 20 days. It would be a waste of resources to outfit a capsule with 20 days of O2 but only enough CO2 scrubbers for 5 days (as an example). The only time I could see scrubbers being a concern is if you added an O2 unit (like the LS-O2A, LS-O2AA or LS-O2B), and again you\u0027d want enough scrubbers to cover the extra time those modules would give you. Maybe if you sent up one rocket with just a capsule and had it link to an orbiting rocket that only had extra O2 modules, but even then you\u0027d expect mission control would plan ahead and send you with extra scrubbers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I think I found a bug. It doesn\u0027t look like EVA O2 is saved. I have Jed out on a Mun walk when I found the need to restart the game. He had 97% O2 when I saved and exited. He had \u0022NaN%\u0022 O2 when I came back into the game. He didn\u0027t put any O2 back into the ship when I had him get back in (after the reload). He also didn\u0027t die which is good cause that would have sucked. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E But wanted to report this.
