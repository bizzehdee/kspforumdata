Basically the centre point of the navball, ie. when the craft is pointing straight up is 0 (zero). The trick is to know that even though that\u0027s your centrepoint, mathematically using this you need to work from 90 which at first seems very counter-intuitive. So if you were to input a command that tells kOs to go 90 degrees from straight up, the result is to go along the horizon, along the heading you\u0027ve set, the opposite from how it works in a plane which obviously sets the horizon as zero and everything else is plus or minus that horizon zero point.\u003Cp\u003ESo the first number up \u002B R(this one, 0, 0). controls the pitch along the line on the navball that reads 0-180.

It however it could well be incorrect or come to the right results for the wrong reasons, I haven\u0027t checked the kOS source to see what it\u0027s actually doing under the hood. \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m under the impression that KSP internally uses euler angles and kOS (and some other mods) are just handling the math of converting the user friendly input of heading by pitch on the navball into an appropriate euler rotation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re at level flight and rolled 90 degrees, your pitch controls will affect heading in relation to the ground, despite still controlling pitch in relation to the craft. You\u0027ll need at that point craft-yaw to alter ground-pitch. kOS tries to sort this out for you, but isn\u0027t perfect in it\u0027s execution.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen launching from the pad, changing to 45 degrees pitch with heading 90 and roll 0, requires rolling 90 degrees and pitching down. A human operator can see that this can be easily achieved by yawing to 45 degrees and then rolling, or rolling and then pitching down, etc. What kOS is doing is trying to satisfy both at the same time, pitching down to 45 while rolling 90 degrees, which results in the heading going towards south by southwest, because from the pad the pitch vector is north-south and the craft is rolling to make the pitch vector west-east, so kOS corrects by adding yaw towards the correct heading and since it\u0027s still doing the roll and pitch it can take a while sorting itself out towards the right heading and pitch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike you\u0027ve noticed, setting the values separately and letting it sort out the roll before pitching down should work, since it has a clear thing to do. Engineering your craft to have superb roll control and sluggish pitch and yaw can also serve as a workaround, since it\u0027ll manage to roll the craft to near the correct orientation before managing to alter the pitch too badly in the wrong direction, but it\u0027s hardly reliable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL;DR: Pitching while rolling causes yaw in addition to pitch, and yawing while rolling causes pitch in addition to yaw, which can cause issues for kOS finding the correct heading, so don\u0027t do it. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E (or expect the potential issues if you do)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain_Party","CreatedById":59820,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-04T22:35:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnyone have a script for RSS?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"check","CreatedById":71875,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-04T22:44:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Steven Mading\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Steven Mading\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYes.
