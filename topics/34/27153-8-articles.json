If I\u0027m not mistaken this is the first screenshot anyone\u0027s posted. How\u0027s KCA behaving with jet VTOLs? On some crafts the huge response time for jets can make it overcompensate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can sort of do some overheat protection of your own by scaling down the maximum throttle (strength) slider in the KCA settings, however this is not a measure of the maximum allowed individual throttle value, so be careful relying on that for very unbalanced vessels. I suppose I could add a feature at some point to do proper overheat protection. One thing you will definitely want to do is disable MechJeb heat protection, as with KCA enabled it will only hinder you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking at that picture, you can sort of visualise why the vessel was still stable. Look at the area formed by the convex hull of the engine positions. If the centre of mass is within or very close to being in that area KCA has a good chance of being able to balance everything. Judging from where the camera is pointing, it looks like the centre of mass really is within that area, and quite close to the front of the vessel. This is because of the distribution of the remaining engines being primarily in the front.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only thing I have found you can do other than resize your images is to use an imgur album.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S.
