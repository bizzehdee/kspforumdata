That is, stage types that could have fuel tanks sufficiently pressurized that their fuel volume capacity actually exceeds what could be held at 1 atmosphere of pressure, are never capable of holding more fuel mass/volume than what equates to 100% utilization at 1 atmosphere of pressure in Procedural Parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis mainly holds true of Service Modules (which can reach an average utilization of 400%, 500% or more compared to tanks a 1 atmosphere- through high pressurization in real life), but also could be thought to apply to other tank types to a limited degree, as other tank types are often pressurized at a lower level (the Space Shuttle External Fuel Tank was pressurized to 1.5 atm, for instance)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis mainly affects Service Module parts from the Procedural Parts mod, but also affects a few mod \u0022Service Module\u0022 parts such as the NovaPunch2 \u0022Yawmaster Service Module\u0022. All of these parts have MUCH lower volume capacities than they should for their size, as real life service modules often exceed 400% utilization (and can reach 500% or more) compared to 1 atm through highly pressurizing the fuel tanks. Even ordinary fuel tanks are often pressurized- the Space Shuttle External Fuel Tank was pressurized to 1.5 atm, for example...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mass of the fuel tanks should be scaled with the volume capacity- i.e. a Procedural Parts Service Module with 500% utilization should have slightly more than 5x the tank mass of a BalloonCryo tank of the same size (Service Module tanks are also insulated in Procedural Parts, and there doesn\u0027t seem to be a way to create Service Modules with uninsulated pressurized fuel tanks for hypergolic...) I say *more than* 5x the tank mass because service modules often include more structural mass than standard fuel tanks in real life (the Procedural Parts mod already accounts for this with an inferior mass-fraction).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe primary advantage of service modules is that they hold a lot more fuel mass for their physical size due to pressurization\u003C/strong\u003E (thus creating a much more compact aerodynamic profile with a higher ballistic-coefficient, or fitting inside smaller fairings, among other benefits)\u003Cstrong\u003E but strangely, this advantage is NOT reflected in the Procedural Parts- making them just heavy fuel tanks with inferior mass-ratios compared to all the other fuel tank types\u003C/strong\u003E (they do have the capability to store ElectricCharge, but this is only a minor benefit for their much higher mass...) There is no easy way to simulate the other main benefit of pressurization in KSP besides a higher space utilization- the ability to efficiently use pressure-fed engines that are simpler/cheaper/lighter to design and manufacture compared to those relying on turbopumps...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EP.S.\u003C/strong\u003E Turns out that fuel tanks are often even more highly pressurized than I thought.
