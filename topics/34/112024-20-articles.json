So we did. The overall footprint on disk is down to 188mb, and texture quality of some parts in fact has gone up. Any parts removed from our trimming process will now be included in a separate \u0022Extras\u0022 folder with the download. So if you want to go back and re live your favourite white-painted SLS launch or something, there it is.\n\nWe re built the rover to an extent, looking for frame rate opportunities on the ground. The other landers have had their parts count reviewed as well, looking for the optimum landing site frame rate experience. In this quest; the \u0022Technical Lander\u0022 series of products has been canceled. There is an issue with the fustek cupola which in certain circumstances causes a frame rate lag. It has to do with it\u0027s collider and mounting it, plus the textures for that system are huge. Sorry to see it go, but it\u0027s time, and in the end, you can add it back with the extras folder.\n\n**Revised Duna Habitat / Support Hardware**\n\n- New cupola system\n\n- Reduced parts count\n\n- Adjusted dock port heights\n\n- Flight tested\n\n![ASoJ4y.jpg](http://imageshack.com/a/img907/6746/ASoJ4y.jpg)\n\n![YwuFf7.jpg](http://imageshack.com/a/img633/5176/YwuFf7.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-07T23:25:36Z\u0022 title=\u002211/07/2015 11:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by YANFRET**"},{"CreatedByName":"YANFRET","CreatedById":90547,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-03T04:32:02Z","Content":"**Introducing:**\n\n**Advanced Monkey Rover Type X**\n\n-Mass balanced for greater stability\n\n-Direct connect wheels reduce parts count\n\n-Expanded wheel size option (shown)\n\n-New wheel textures\n\n-Expanded rover base\n\n-Fuel cell backup power\n\n-Auto Locking center wheel set (saves you a step after landing)\n\n-Reduced dependency on torque to remain stable on landing (saves you another step after landing)\n\n-Increased fuel capacity for terminal landing stage, and option for even greater terminal fuel capacity with expanded retro stage\n\n( updated images below )\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-07T23:26:06Z\u0022 title=\u002211/07/2015 11:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by YANFRET**"},{"CreatedByName":"Fatal_Gam3er","CreatedById":115908,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-04T19:49:56Z","Content":"Wow!

The remaining problem is collider snagging on service module style fairings. Other mod products with similar assemblies are experiencing the same issue. For example, if you download the 1.0.5 update to FASA and try to launch the Saturn V, you will see an explosion so large it will set you back in the chair.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Are RealPlume configurations an option that\u0027s possible?
