Idk. But Roverdude is more than happy to look into and help with any issues.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E RoverDude, I love your mods. But they do conflict a lot, and tend to have missing components.\n\u003E Especially USI Life Support always seems to break something. I always install it after it is compatible with the latest update, but I always remove it afterwards, because it breaks things..\n\nThis is what people are probably taking issue with. For a couple reasons. First it adds nothing to the purpose of getting help. Secondly it sounds, well rather negative. I\u0027ve used USI mods for almost as long as I\u0027ve played ksp. And there are rarely ever missing components, in the sense that something just wasn\u0027t put in by some oversight or some sort of bad work. Which is what this sounds like. I have no conflicts with any mods I run so far with this or any other USI mod. So they do not conflict a lot. USI life support does not always seem to break something, because it has broken nothing for me. In fact he goes to great lengths to make sure his mods do not conflict with other mods as much as possible.\n\nthese statements look nothing more than a knock on someone\u0027s hard work, and a put down towards there work and competency. It may not have been meant that way, but it\u0027s how it comes across.\n\nand then all you said is it conflicts with the Taurus mod. But offered nothing to explain what the conflict is or anything helpful to what is causing you issues in your first post.\n\nif you simply stated something along the lines of hey I\u0027m having an issue with this mod and such and such mod. This happens when I have this mod and some other mod installed. When I remove this mod the problem goes away. Then maybe add is the known? Does anyone know of a fix or workaround for this? Maybe even ask if the mods will be made compatible. And add any relevant information to help with your issue. It would probably have come across much better. The above quoted part is really Not needed and doesn\u0027t nothing to help with the problem, and more than often tends to seem inflammatory to many.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nSorry for for two posts in a row but seriously.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Ok, replying to you is a waste of time. But anyway:\n\u003E My initial post was a friendly heads-up. If you feel that was a rant, you haven\u0027t encountered me taking something apart. Be glad ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nNice attitude, so now it\u0027s passive aggressive threats? This makes your orginal post seem worse. \n\nThis tends to be a rather helpful community and well I see Goldenpsp help a lot of people. As do many others. Threats to be glad you haven\u0027t done something are just really bad form.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E RoverDude, I love your mods. But they do conflict a lot, and tend to have missing components.\n\u003E Especially USI Life Support always seems to break something. I always install it after it is compatible with the latest update, but I always remove it afterwards, because it breaks things..\n\nhow the above is read by me and many others I\u0027m sure. \u0022Hey Roverdude I love your mods but they are crap. They conflict with a lot of stuff and are always broken and missing things. \u0022especially USI life support. It\u0027s always breaking something and I always install it and remove it afterwards because it\u0027s junk and break things.\u0022\n\ni hope you get your issue fixed or find some better mods out there that aren\u0027t such junk and always broken and missing stuff. Good luck being received well in the future with the attitude you have.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-09T21:08:52Z\u0022 title=\u002205/09/2015 09:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Hevak**"},{"CreatedByName":"SymbolicFrank","CreatedById":138922,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T21:21:54Z","Content":"Hevak, if your KSP suddenly slows down to seconds-per-frame and takes many minutes switching between the VAB and launchpad, you have to investigate.\n\nThe first thing to do is press Alt-F2. And when you see mostly red, flashing along very swiftly, you gather something is wrong.\n\nThe next thing to do is look at the log, and especially the exceptions. And all of them had something to do with USI.\n\nA warning is something to improve, an error requires attention, and an exception is something that should be fixed ASAP!\n\nSo, after investigating that it wasn\u0027t a one-time occurrence, and that it was definitely related to USI, I wanted to give feedback to the developer. By posting the errors, with all the relevant information needed. But a moderator disagreed.\n\nAnd, you might ask, how do you know what information is relevant? Because I\u0027m a software developer myself. When I\u0027m not a project manager. But why should that matter?\n\nThen again, I know some modders here require you to follow their exact rules for you to be allowed to post a bug report. Because they expect nobody understands anything about programming or modding, and do everything wrong that can be done wrong. And they might have a point, in many cases.

It actually gets even more fun with new BDAnimations module.\n\u003E Also, RoverDune, please please update the version in the thread title? Now I worry I missed an update all the time :\u003C\n\nhe may have been notified on your issue but I see 4 issues listed on github and not about this. so for Roverdude to give proper attention to these issues please log a github issue for him. It is where he checks on things and tracks them when he updates mods. And if possible please explain what makes it more fun when bdanimations is also installed. \n\nAlso he usually uses ksp avc checker for all his mods. Maybe this LS mod hasn\u0027t been set up for it yet. But that avc mod is highly recommended for all USI mods as it will notify you in most cases there is a new version up. It\u0027s how I keep all my USI and many other mods up to date. But yes a title update would be nice and help a lot.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Taurus HCV has a monopropellant \u0022launch escape system\u0022 slash landing assistance engines. Those get triggered on launch if USI-LS is present. RoverDude knows about that. /me isn\u0027t bothered, because /me is very slow in career and this is an alpha anyway.\n\nThis kind of more detailed descriptions are much more helpful in trying to solve the conflicts between Taurus Hcv and USI LS. Again please log a detailed github issue so that these issues can be more easily and properly addressed by Roverdude. This is his preferred way of tracking and addressing issues, as he has somewhere near 15 mod threads to watch. Anything we can do to help him has always been appreciated by him. And he always asks that github issues be posted for any problems with his mods. \n\nThere are exactly 4 issues logged on github and none are related to Taurus Hcv as far as I can tell. So this issue could get lost in the shuffle.. Hopefully he can solve your issues.
