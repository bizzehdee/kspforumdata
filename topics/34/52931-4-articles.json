An old radial drogue chute mod made by I^3 had some great texturing to it. hasn\u0027t been updated since .20.2. Just google \u0022ksp radial drogue.\u0022 You\u0027ll have to fish around for the dropbox link, but it\u0027s there.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently the included parachutes are using the stock configs as a base, so they should have exactly the same temperatures than stock. I think deadly reentry has a ModuleManager file that cuts\u0027s every stock part\u0027s max temp by two, so Nathan would have to update his MM file to affect the RC parachutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn another note, I have made progress!
