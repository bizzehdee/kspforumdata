Also testing some new concepts with the icons.  As you can see below, the tree is using size, color and tech nodes as labels.  The tree itself is fairly **muddled up** at this point, especially in areas where it has grown. Now it really looks like a tech tree that was dropped on its head.  I add the new nodes, add parts to them and then move them to their final location.  There is a method to my madness...\n\nIts hard to tell exactly what has changed by a couple of screenshots. But some of the new features include:\n\n- New icons\n- Experimenting with icons that have differing sizes, colors and depth\n- Separation of fuel tanks from engine tech\n- Better definition of SRBs by potential energy\n- A new \u0027micro\u0027 tech branch\n- Separation of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E from gyro based controls\n- Better separation of space based vs land based colonization tech\n- And gave aviation a bit of attention\n\n![Screenshot-2022-06-16-16-31-08.jpg](https://i.ibb.co/710QqkQ/Screenshot-2022-06-16-16-31-08.jpg)\n\n![Screenshot-2022-06-16-16-28-18.jpg](https://i.ibb.co/qy3NqsQ/Screenshot-2022-06-16-16-28-18.jpg)\n\nI may end up making all the icons of a particular branch the same color.  So engines might be red. Control systems yellow and so on.\n\nAlso, it is still several months away from being ready for a release.
