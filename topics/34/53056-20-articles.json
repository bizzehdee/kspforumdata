That\u0027s a byproduct of marketing teaching you to associate \u0027fresh\u0027 with \u0027good\u0027. Also potable is a common word in SEVERAL languages including French, Spanish and Italian. There\u0027s a good chance non-native speakers are highly intelligent people too, and can figure this out. So instead focus on the positive! You didn\u0027t know an entirely commonplace and well-known word used in many countries around the world (many non-English speaking ones), and now you do! You learned something today! It\u0027s a little embarrassing to make a comment like that, but that doesn\u0027t mean no one else should ever have to suffer the humiliation of knowing a new word.

I don\u0027t care that \u0022fresh water\u0022 isn\u0027t technically speaking the same as potable water, but I do believe that more people would understand what you meant if you said \u0022fresh water\u0022, than if you said potable water.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, I know that potable is a common word, I know Spanish myself and it\u0027s a much more common word there. But in english it\u0027s far less used. You\u0027re more likely to see signs saying \u0022Drinking water\u0022 than you are to see those that say \u0022Potable water\u0022, at least in my experience (I live in the UK for the past 5 years).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThird, where did you get the fact that I DIDN\u0027T know what potable meant? I was merely giving a suggestion from the fact that someone earlier in the thread misunderstood the word potable over the word \u0022portable\u0022. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd finally, why in the world would it be embarrassing to not know a word?
