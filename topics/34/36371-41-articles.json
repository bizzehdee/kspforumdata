One the heat shields aren\u0027t re-rated for Real Solar System\u0027s earthlike (because earth-size) reentry, but rather they\u0027re still set for Kerbin\u0027s nice-and-cuddly not-really-deadly 2km/s reentry. The other is that one often loses the ability to click when all parts are destroyed; this is a stock issue that DREC exacerbates, and I have some idea as to how to mitigate it thanks to ideas from FlowerChild (which I will try in the next few days time permitting, along with new values for the heat shields). Other than that, it\u0027s quite solid: there are patches available for the heatshields, and the no-click bug can be gotten around by reverting, launching, and reverting again.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"e-dog","CreatedById":73796,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-15T22:47:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think I could make \u0022conical\u0022 tanks by refactoring your Stretchy SRB module (moving geometry calculations to methods) and then subclassing it.
