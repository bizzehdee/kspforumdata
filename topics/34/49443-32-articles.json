From what I remember looking at the airship source, Hooligan already had a bit to force the game to consider an airship as landed. From there you just add in a way to root the airship in place (KAS/KIS attach to ground works by creating a static invisible part in place and connecting to that, not actually creating a join with the ground, so it could work in flight) and you can make a static \u0022floating\u0022 ship you can safely scene change away from.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe hard part comes from something I think taniwha wrote but I can\u0027t remember for sure (seems logical enough anyway). Apparently when a vessel loads the game engine will compensate for save file rounding errors in the location data by adjusting the vessel\u0027s position to as close to the ground as it can (this is where vessel load jumping comes from, a fraction of the ship gets shifted underground). So to make an airship that will stay in the sky between scene changes would require disabling this adjustment, which I have no suggestions as to where to start.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEffectively impossible would be letting airships stay in flight while unloaded.
