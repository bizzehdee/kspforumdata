To get the science bay FAR compatible, we\u0027d have to fully enclose it in mesh colliders, meaning stacking multiple bays together to get a deeper volume wouldn\u0027t work, as each of them would have an invisible roof that blocked longer parts from attaching. \u003Cstrong\u003EHowever \u003C/strong\u003E - if everything is under a aerodynamic capsule\\nosecone and you ascend on a correct trajectory, it shouldn\u0027t effect the drag on the ship. We haven\u0027t really playtested with FAR so i\u0027m not totally sure, but you\u0027d like to do some tests, we\u0027d really appreciate it \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022nebuchadnezzar\u0022 data-cite=\u0022nebuchadnezzar\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ELooking forward to the TAC Pack!
