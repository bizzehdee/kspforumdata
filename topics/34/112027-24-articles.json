They will act like radiators in that they will move heat with the use of EC, but not have high emissivity and will have a high thermal mass. So you can use them to pump heat (probably non-core for now) to a specific location on a vessel, either for storage or to then use local static radiators to dump the heat."},{"CreatedByName":"Rayder","CreatedById":95226,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-30T19:25:49Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 41 minutes ago, Nertea said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E ...

Kinda overkill but I just wanted to see how big I could get before loosing all my comfy FPS amounts on my system (here it is stil around 30-40 FPS average even tho all the visual mods).\n\nIt can pretty much go anywhere in the system. It has extreme amounts of habitation time and supplies for the life-support as well so they are not like gonna run out of food or oxygen.\n\n![F607E49DB747C408AB725EFB9BD7E38EAE0C2002](https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/109609307487340049/F607E49DB747C408AB725EFB9BD7E38EAE0C2002/)\n\n![A3D37E4B7CA44004122E75C80C14D1E7F88BE91A](https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/109609307487547934/A3D37E4B7CA44004122E75C80C14D1E7F88BE91A/)\n\n![42260247A76AD83488EBBD4E3B0C1D6E98649758](https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/109609307487511868/42260247A76AD83488EBBD4E3B0C1D6E98649758/)\n\nI even know how to easily make this in space. Well without planetary launch pads it would be hard because of the fuel tanks. I guess I could try send them empty and dock them. But even that would be hard.\n\nResupplying it will be a pain. Which is why I have a few smaller designs more suited for playing.
