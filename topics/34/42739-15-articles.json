None of the cameras have a \u0022set zoom to 1/2\u0022 or \u0022cycle between fixed zoom levels\u0022 feature, so I can\u0027t have two cameras zoomed in by the exact same amount.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI realize I don\u0027t use your mod the way you intended it, but I believe at least some of my suggestions could benefit all styles of play.

With HullcamVDS is it possible to switch to a camera that is not on the active vessel and continue to have control over said vessel? It was possible. Years ago with a camera mod that used a model very similar to the smallest version available in Hullcam. I forget how it worked, but I was able to switch to the camera on a rover while still having control of my rocket.
