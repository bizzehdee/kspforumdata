Like, you know, a M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn-arch is quite a lot easier to detect than a monolith, by naked eye at least. What are the detection ranges anyways? It seems like i have to be \u0026lt;20km to the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn to have it mapped, but only \u0026lt;100km for Kerbin? Shouldnt be more like the same for both - and even more for Kerbin than for the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn, because of the atmosphere? I suspect gameplay reasons, here, as that would make either mapping Kerbin really hard (from within the atmo) or mapping M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn really easy (from way up high). Anyways, if its 20/100km i still think they could be a tad closer to each other, maybe 25/80?

Great job and realy feals lightweight on the game. I\u0027m now having a great time trying to find all those elusive artefacts and mapping futur landing sites ^^.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main reason of my post is to see if it wasn\u0027t possible to have an extra comunication system to ships to comunicate with ISA-MAPSAT.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk sounds strange but here is the method in my madness.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Quite often I tend to strand my kerbals on some unknown part of the planet and it can be realy annoying to get the exact coords just from the map gui.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I also use mechjeb as well as mapsat (with the coords when I hover over the map, realy great adition) to program my landings safer than my eratic flying\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-So the idea is to have a relay on a crashed / stranded ship (extra part to add to the ship when constructing) that can be activated via GUI or the right click menu you get in game which will then be picked up with a MAPSAT on it\u0027s next passage. This would also enable people to make there own markers with automated drones or other stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did browse through the code source to see if it was possible to do but it\u0027s been rather a long time since I\u0027ve messed with C# and I\u0027ve never tinkered with KSP dev or Unity so probably a bit out of my reach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI see that you grab the artefacts from a KSP array (I might be wrong, I only looked quick) and I supose that it would be possible to grab an array from a MAPSAT-communicator.dat file (created and updated with the new piece) and use the same principal. Since we can only control one ship at a time, the MAPSAT-communicator.dat file can be updated when the comunicator ship is controled. Would have to see though if it is possible to grab the status of the ship (orbit / landed / crashed) since only landed / crashed should show up on MAPSAT. I Don\u0027t know if it is possible to get a unique ID from each ship / debry since updating the dat file will also need some kind of unique identification.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewell that\u0027s the idea. Not trying to tell you what to do, just thought of the idea and i like to see if it\u0027s possible and throw out a few dev ideas before submitting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain thanks for this great plugin and Good luck for the 0.17 update.
