They may or may not make sense. All of them are intended in a tone of praise for your awesome work.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nMod compatibility: I entirely appreciate that the antennas you\u0026#39;ve built have RT configs. It seems those are made of unobtainium at times... Incidentally, I also appreciate a lot that the Sienno built in omni is active from the start node; why RT devs picked such a deep node for that always on perk, I don\u0026#39;t know... poorly documented too.. Ahh, I digress.[/QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI originally started working on BDB because I wanted more/varied antennas than what I got through RT \u002B AIES.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[quote name=\u0027komodo\u0027]Perhaps Mechjeb/KER builtins for the probe core(s)?[/QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI won\u0026#39;t be giving any command modules (probe or otherwise) built in MJ/KER, simply because those plugins don\u0026#39;t default to that. If people want them, there are MM configs around to add the modules to all the cores.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[quote name=\u0027komodo\u0027]On a similar note, there are a significant amount of AntennaRange users, I suspect. I don\u0026#39;t know how much effort that would take to re-antenna all of the ones here, though. (Plus with 1.1 coming up... eeeek.)[/QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSomeone actually did send me some AR configs they made, but I\u0026#39;ve been too lazy to include them...

I was scratching my head trying to figure out how to load a 2.5 m payload on the Centaur. I may not have all the parts unlocked, though. I have a serious addiction for odd diameter parts it seems. (HGR came out, I was all over that thing. :D ) Lately, these tiny parts have been... well, a blast, lets say.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI mention this because having a lot of lego like pieces is half the fun of KSP to me, and your guys\u0026#39; parts are very flexible in how they go together with themselves \u002B others. Boosting that flexibility would go a long way to mod compatibility right there, without any particular target in mind.[/QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThere is an adapter fuel tank for the Centaur to turn it into the Centaur T, as well as a normal 2.5m tank in the centaur style.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe only adapters I\u0026#39;m really missing right now would be from 1.875m to 1.5m. Not sure who would need that but it\u0026#39;s no big deal to make one and include it. Anything that is a non-stock size has adapters to other sizes, don\u0026#39;t worry.

Science parts already tie into DMagic\u0026#39;s, FASA, somewhat. I\u0026#39;m not certain who else is having a lot of science-y things to tie into. If a telescope ever happens, Cacteye would be something to look into. Science parts are generally good in my eye.

Fuel tanks, for instance, have little that can be said about them. I would rather just leave a lot of the things at simple descriptions, specifically noting their diameter as that can be hard to tell sometimes in the VAB menu.
