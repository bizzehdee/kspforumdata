Specifically in the area of scaling engines.\n\nStock game seems to me (a relatively new player) to have a pretty decent balance of engines. Pretty much everything has a niche, a compelling reason you\u0027d want to use that engine over anything else depending on the demands of the craft\u0027s situation. I\u0027ve experimented with tweakscale, so far just briefly - because I\u0027ve seen it\u0027s required for a lot of other mods that interest me. My impression is, with tweakscale the only engine stats that matter are ISP and whether it has the TWR to get you off kerbin, and the latter only applies briefly. For example...\n\nIn my current career mode, I\u0027m using the Rockomax Spark on a lot of my probes because of its size. It is surpassed by a scaled-down Terrier, which was available earlier. Terriers, which I used over Poodles in favor of their low mass, are no match for a Poodle scaled to 1.25. Ants are AWFUL, scale down almost anything to replace it - where previously it had the great advantage of being incredibly light, now almost anything can be better. A Twinboar has the same stats as a scaled-up Reliant, just has some fuel too. Scaled-down Mainsails have ridiculous TWR for teeny little things they are. Basically, once off Kerbin and toodling around space, why would you use anything other than a Poodle (or Terrier until it\u0027s unlocked) scaled to your needs, ever? Seems like it makes things too easy and eliminates the niche engines\u0027 usefulness. \n\n(EDIT: LV-N\u0027s, to answer my own dumb noob question. But there again, you can scale down an LV-N and mitigate their biggest drawback - weight - trading waiting through longer burn times for greater efficiency than is possible in stock game.)\n\nDon\u0027t get me wrong, it\u0027s great for aesthetic, and I love the concept of this mod, though right now I\u0027m looking for a mostly stock experience. Has anyone played with Tweakscale in career mode who could perhaps bring a different perspective?\n\nFurther edit / maybe a bug: How come the Oscar B scaled up to 1.25 has 144 units of liquid fuel and proportionate oxydizer, while being the same size as the T100 which only holds 45? It has 0.2 dry mass at that size, the T100 is 0.063, but the physical size difference is nowhere near that ratio.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-24T03:08:12Z\u0022 title=\u002208/24/2015 03:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kyrt Malthorn**"},{"CreatedByName":"MartGonzo","CreatedById":65764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-24T10:36:31Z","Content":"I\u0027ve been getting an issue with tweakscale and Infernal robotics, not sure what\u0027s causing it so I wasn\u0027t sure where to post it.\n\nanyway I use infernal robotics parts on satellites and when changing craft and going back later sometimes the parts are moved, sometimes to the center of the craft or sometimes offset completely and floating a meter or so from the satellite.\n\nHas anyone come across this or know of a fix?"},{"CreatedByName":"Trolllception","CreatedById":147346,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-25T17:37:40Z","Content":"Is there a way to create a CFG which will scale Hotrockets effects?

Specifically in the area of scaling engines.\n\u003E ...\n\nAs you\u0027ve noticed, engines don\u0027t really scale in a balanced way. This has more to do with Squad\u0027s engine balancing than it does tweakscale, however. If you calculate some stats like thrust to weight and compare that and ISP, you\u0027ll notice that larger Squad engines are almost universally better than smaller ones. As a result, I generally play with the house rule that I can only scale engines up, not down. Sometimes I just play as though the larger engines are just upgrades, however,"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-30T04:27:27Z","Content":"The engines are balanced for the tree.

I thought I would try this as a way to produce some larger parachutes to save on spamming dozens of small chutes on stages I am trying to recover after launch. I was using stage recovery for that, so at first I thought it might be that stage recovery was not accounting for the new parachute size. So I put a regular 2R parachute onto a fuel tank, put a 2R parachute resized to 200% onto a second tank that was 4x as heavy as the first, and with the aid of a few decouplers and a booster fired them a few hundred metres up, decoupled the two tanks and popped chutes. By my calculation, a 200% resized chute should have 400% greater open chute surface area and drag, so I would think the two tanks would descend at the same rate. But for whatever reason, the resized chute and larger tank fall at just under double the speed of the normal chute and smaller tank.
