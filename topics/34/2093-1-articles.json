I have made low poly versions of standard parts, to ease up rendering an possibly increase frame rate with big ships. Parts are in any other way identical to standard parts, they just have less details and less detailed textures (256x256 px). I have made new textures for this parts (more optimized use of texture space and UV maping), so you have to replace texture and 3d model file (DAE).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBefore you replace original files, make sure that you have made backup of those files \u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"koberko","CreatedById":6137,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-09-04T21:17:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have request for moderators and admins; can you please move this topic to \u0027Projects and Releases\u0027 subforum? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S.
