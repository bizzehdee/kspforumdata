One of the biggest struggles of this build was trying to configure each part to work together. After about 6 hours of trial and error, I\\\u0027m pretty satisfied with the results! Now, the SLS doesn\\\u0027t have easy handling like the Intrepid II (mainly due to its immense size and mass), but it\\\u0027s not that far off. On a scale of 1 to 10 (with 10 being the handling of the Intrepid II), I\\\u0027d rate the SLS around 7.5 - 8. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also made a few changes to some of the parts. I removed the separate S.A.S. module that was going to be above Odyssey and combined it with the payload adapter. Also, the SRB Nosecones now have their own S.A.S. modules as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI only have minor tweaks left to fix before the release on Thursday. The biggest being a small issue with the payload fairings being slightly dislodged until SRB separation.
