Once its installed connect to telemachus and you will have to change the address in the address bar from \u0022information.html\u0022 to \u0022hg_panel_main.html\u0022. Its made for the size of my second monitor so you may have to zoom your browser out a bit to see all the buttons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince I deliberately made it all a bit complicated since it wouldnt be a proper kerbal console if it wasnt made unneccesarily complex heres a basic guide to it:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo choose what is shown on each screen you can use the black buttons along the bottom. You will see the buttons are grouped into two sections, most of them are grouped under \u0022Screen display mode select\u0022 and the two rightmost are grouped under \u0022SDM Shift\u0022 (Screen Display Mode shirt). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically to adjust the main screen, just press one of the black \u0022Screen display mode select\u0022 buttons, so to get the fuel display up on the main screen just click \u0022Fuel\u0022. To change what is on one of the smaller primary or secondary displays press one of the \u0022SDM Shift\u0022 buttons (pridisp refers to the little display marked primary and im sure you can figure out what SeDisp button refers too) then press on of the \u0022Screen display mode select\u0022 buttons. So to get say altitude data onto the secondary display press \u0022SeDisp\u0022 then \u0022Alt\u0022. You should be able to switch between displays without the graphs resetting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe panel of buttons along the right hand side should be fairly self explanatory. Ive colour coded the buttons based on how likely they are to kill you. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELight blue buttons: should not cause any danger unless combined with outher commands\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGreen buttons: may cause problems if accidentally switched and not rectified over a long period of time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYellow buttons: may immediately cause problems if accidentally switched and may cause serious problems if not rectified over a long period of time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERed buttons: may cause immediate serious problems if accidentally switched and may be fatal if not rectified immediately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELight blue and covered by a red safety cover with black and orange danger stripes: may cause immediate serious problems if accidentally switched and cannot be rectified if accidentally activated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust tried it in V0.22 and it seems to work fine, have fun and remember no watching KTV during missions!\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny chance on a new download link?
