Higher stages often have some level of RCS system to help control them. Most US rockets don\u0027t seem to have verniers for example but take Orions launch, it had full three-axis control. The problem is only if you have a single centre-mounted engine. For first stages use fins(not too big, you want stability not an aeroplane or something you cant move from the airstream). In space or higher altitudes you can use RCS for roll control. Some rockets don\u0027t have roll control initially and I myself get away with that. It takes some extra skill piloting them but not too hard as long as you\u0027re not trying to pitch or yaw too rapidly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond stages often have small solid boosters that spin the spacecraft very fast or RCS, after which they do the burn.

A rocket like the Delta IV, that uses a RS-68(A), will not have any gimbal range on the actual motor nozzle. Instead it has a small vernier motor extruding from the combustion chamber to control roll and some attitude control. As the rocket will rise, it will nose it over slightly. From there on out, if the rocket has over a 1.0 TWR, it will stay pointing Pro-grade all the way to MECO. Aerodynamic forces pretty much keep all rockets pointing where they will need to go, that is why if you launch a rocket like in Stock KSP and nose it over 45 degrees at 10 kilometers, it will flip out and disintegrate, that is why rockets in the real world do not do that.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EIt takes me maybe two stages to get something about the size of a small satellite into Geosynchronous orbit. The goals you should look for, is 1.3 TWR for liftoff, around .8 to 1.0 TWR for the upper stage. As you will be close to vacuum, there is no need for any high TWRs here. I like to keep a goal to myself when I create a liquid booster that the booster itself should have a 1.7 TWR. That way, when I stack a upper stage and payload, I can adjust the thrust of the engine accordingly or the amount of fuel accordingly. I can post a download link to my Delta IV Common Booster Core for Realism Overhaul. You will need AIES, and Procedural Parts (I take it you will obviously have all the required mods for RO.)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EI sort have just answered this question. Most rockets will only allow a set amount of payload weight, that is the point to where they cannot achieve an efficient launch. I try to build my payloads as small and light as possible. Please refer back to my ideals for TWRs on this. Or you can go look at Farram\u0027s guides for RO on the first page of this thread.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EYes, you can use Transfer Window Planner, and Trajectories.
