Just an aside, but back when CC was released, a similar principle to that which the XKCD comic is describing was what sprung to my mind. It was announced that the reason for CC\u0027s development was to minimise the amount of time spent by modders responding to ghost bug reports based on outdated versions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI choose not to code publicly, so can\u0027t quantify the time spent on this activity (although personally, I\u0027d just ignore bad reports on general principle), but this reasoning always struck me as odd because it was almost inevitable that the dubious bug reports would be replaced with questions/complaints about compatability checker\u0027s behaviour and how to circumvent it or recompile.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t say for certain whether the questions around the appropriateness of using CC exceed or match the time spent reading crappy bug reports, but the fact that it\u0027s escalated to this point makes me suspect that the Y-axis gains of CC might be a little overstated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInteresting thread, nonetheless.
