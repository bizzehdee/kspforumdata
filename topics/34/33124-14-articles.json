This is a consequence of the physics model simulating stuff as mass points, if you add more parts at some distance from the center, then the moment of inertia should increase and make the circular arrow (that represents the angular acceleration, not torque) smaller. This is also the reason of why rockets can rotate longitudinally a lot easier than they should, since most of their mass doesn\u0027t factor in because their moment of inertia is cancelled out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond thing that probably is happening is that the RCS (or the fuel tank) don\u0027t have their colliders perfectly aligned so no matter how you place them there\u0027s always a slight misalignment that causes some torque, which paired with the zero MoI makes it rotate easily. Try if the same happens with the stock RCS or a stock tank. The angle snap might also be playing a role.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn any case, this shouldn\u0027t be a big issue with your complete vessel, since you\u0027re going to use more parts and hopefully not all with their masses aligned in the center.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-15T03:12:26Z\u0022 title=\u002209/15/2014 03:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 15, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by m4v\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AetherGoddess","CreatedById":115971,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-15T03:29:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022m4v\u0022 data-cite=\u0022m4v\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E[...] that is just one part, (the RCS don\u0027t count as they are massless) you have all the mass concentrated in the rotation axis, [...], so small amounts of torque translates in fast rotations.
