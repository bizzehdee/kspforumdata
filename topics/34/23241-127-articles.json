Bac9, your parts are stunningly beautiful and the best way to build heavy duty planes/SSTOs but getting them off the runway without spontaneous gear disassembly is a challenge. A heavy duty gear set would be awesome, especially if it had some additional ground clearance for large/long spaceplanes. I know, my 220t LKO refueling SSTO is probably a bit excessive but jeb really enjoys flying it... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/DqzZT\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

I had to lengthen my craft, sweap the wings back more(increased wing surface by 30%), add 2 more engines (may need 2 more:( ) and pull my hair out trying to get the mass in the right spot so that every twitch does not send it spinning out of control....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt takes time to do it, takes about 15-30 minutes to get to 30Km (Depends on load), the new FAR has made it far tougher.

Also the community is great with many creations and imaginations at work on what they believe Kerbals should be up to. While we wait for an update and since I\u0027ve seen a few nice planes while i was here i wanted to unveil my own creation using B9 Aerospace (with clever use of intakes and trailing edge placements) the 0.22 Version of the SFT - Acolyte MK II. Uses B9 Aerospace, Remote Tech, Kethane, Raomfarer Lazor System \u002B Sunbeam and Missle addons. I think its also using either Near Future propulsion or KSP interstellar for the glowing long batteries and Capacitors...or both!.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHarr it\u0027s a small plane, Mechjeb says it\u0027s 50 tons and 575 parts? Heavy Defense Fighter, Designed to land without power to the engines even with an approach as steep as 45 degrees, used a series of heavy struts to attach the landing gears to 2-3 different locations on the Hull. I don\u0027t remember how many struts it used..most radially attached component used at least 2-4 heavy struts, thus the plan CAN survive a moderate Crash landing. It\u0027s not SSTO but it\u0027s Sturdy and handles great.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i244.photobucket.com/albums/gg20/Darkangelexile/SFT-AcolyteMKII.png\u0022 alt=\u0022SFT-AcolyteMKII.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeen awhile since ive used photobucket so if the image isnt correctly displayed i will correct in a minute.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
