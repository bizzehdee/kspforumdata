I am, however, struggling with that many of my planes now have drastically increased drag, and almost 30% their original control, while also having only about 60% the lift. After wondering what was going on, I started wondering if it was the B9 Procedural wings, so I tested a craft that had stock wings and control surfaces. It worked better than ever... Then I took a craft that was made not long after that (though prior to the update), which was essentially the same, but with procedural control surfaces, and it was nearly un-flyable. I then decided to attach stock control surfaces to one of my B9-winged planes, and it handled fairly well compared to its original arrangement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis same plane went from having a mach wave drag area of ~0.29 in Goldstein to having one of ~.72 in Haack. However, if I adjust the wing down a couple degrees in Haack, the wave drag drops down to ~.27 in Haack, and up to ~.32 in Goldstein.
