I.e. a ground pylon \u0026gt; 2 x IR servos \u0026gt; 2 x Rovemax R1s, and a thruster block square in the middle of the pylon. When I Grab the pylon, all hell of explodey feces hits the CO2 scrubber fan. Net result is that the pylon, servos and wheels are now on Jeb\u0027s back, but the wheels are broken and the thruster block is paying a visit to the kraken. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn contrast, when I Grab one of the symmetry pylons (just a pylon with a thruster block) it attaches to Jeb\u0027s back as normal, then the block just slides off the pylon and promptly explodes on the ground, turning Bill and Jeb\u0027s excellent adventure into a most uncool and bogus journey.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-26T01:46:42Z\u0022 title=\u002207/26/2014 01:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 26, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by SirSnoopy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Emisquote\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Galane","CreatedById":77949,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-26T05:08:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne addition the bin contents window could use is a Close button.
