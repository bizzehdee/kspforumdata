I made a big Crane and welded the mais chassis mainly beams. Everytime i send it to mimus it just explodes on time warp or simply disappears after loading... Second time it happens.. I cant finish my new mimus base.. can only think the reason for this is the welded part... Kind tired of ksp.. Cant make big stuff without crazy bugs to creeply in\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"grim5000","CreatedById":58744,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-25T01:34:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethe equation for the drag coefficient of the parts is: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E(mass\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E1\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E*max_drag\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E1\u003C/span\u003E\u002Bmass\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E2\u003C/span\u003E*max_drag\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E2\u003C/span\u003E....)
