I\u0027d advise you to try to coordinate with the plugin authors best you can, keep your forks up to date, and submit pull requests with patches for the ultra-low-priority \u0022support win64\u0022 bug for each win64 bug you find.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI personally recommend you currently set Win64 as a separate buildarch for some of the more hackish workarounds. Any workaround that actually benefits other platforms (e.g. abstracting the memory location type to allow it to be 64bit or 32bit without affecting the plugin), such as x86-64 Linux, should probably be submitted for the main tree. However, other workarounds will have negative impact, so I would use compiler preprocessor scripts to enable them for now until better solutions can be found, either way they probably won\u0027t make it into the main tree for a while, because they might not be necessary in future versions of KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll in all, I strongly support what you are trying to do, and I understand if you couldn\u0027t get a hold of the plugin authors as fast as you needed to for making this available.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
