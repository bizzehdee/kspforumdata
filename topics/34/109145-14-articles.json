Even partially fueled, stuff only hovers at extremely high throttle settings.\n\nWhile this might be considered \u0022realistic\u0022 by some, it\u0027s not fun in any way that I know of.\n\nTwo of the engines are for making a plane that looks like the Harrier. Something is wrong if I make a plane that looks like a Harrier, and it refuses to take off vertically like a Harrier can.\n\nIn other words, the VTOL engines are grossly underpowered in the thrust department. The engines can barely get out of their own way, let alone lift a plane built around them.\n\nTo fix the thrust problem, I was forced to overlap two engines in the same place using the offset tool, and even then the thing only started to hover at 80% throttle.\n\nI think the real fix will be to double the thrust from at least the two Mk2 VTOL engines (the Pegasus and Siddley) Probably the PO-GO as well, but that might work with a 1.5x increase in thrust (currently 40, increased to 60).\n\nWhile I\u0027m at it, what\u0027s with the PO-GO engine having a lifting surface? That seems odd, and it can cause CoL issues when you\u0027re trying to get the CoT and CoM aligned.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-29T23:58:10Z\u0022 title=\u002208/29/2015 11:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SciMan**"},{"CreatedByName":"MaverickSawyer","CreatedById":11952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-30T05:33:29Z","Content":"Re: Balance: Use the RCS Build Aid plugin.
