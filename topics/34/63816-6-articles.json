The 3d printer seemed to loose its collision and caused an unplanned disassembly of all parts attached to that module of the station. Intrestingly its still sort of conected to the docking port as it springs back under time warp but flys off agian once it comes off rails. I loaded up a copy of that module on the launchpad and it just fell through the ship, and then the planet. Completely replacing the 3d printer with a fresh copy dragged out of the sidebar does not exhibit the abnormal behavior. Seems as if whatever happend is limited to preexisting craft, both saved and in flight. New construction shouldnt be an issue.

Seems like it was something in the conversion to 23.5 or one of the mod updates that somehow corrupted existing parts/ships but any new ones dont exibit the behavior. I\u0027ve seen a few other mods over the last few patches that had some weirdness with old parts but new ones worked fine. Mostly just reported it because it was so weird and thought you might like to know even if its not something you can do anything about.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mallock","CreatedById":107548,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-03T22:36:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022merendel\u0022 data-cite=\u0022merendel\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHad an intresting glitch probably as a result of 23.5 and various mod updates.
