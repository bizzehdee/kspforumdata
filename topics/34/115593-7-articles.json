I love it!\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Awesome!\n\nMany thanks. I think Orion looks much better than before. Hopefully other texture revamps will equally improve those parts.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Got it, I understand.\n\u003E Have you thought about making an Ares V?\n\nI have given some thought to the Ares V before. The biggest thing that has been keeping me from doing it so far is that, when you get right down to it, The SLS pretty much *is* the Ares V. The core stages are pretty much identical, though the Ares V did go through a re-engining from 5x RS-25s to 6x RS-68s. I could really just add another attachment node to the SLS Core Stage Engine mount to allow another SSME to be attached giving everyone an Ares V Core Stage.\n\nThe second stage of the Ares V is a bit of an issue. i did some cursory research today to refresh my memory on the specifics of the Ares V Earth Departure Stage (EDS) and I couldn\u0027t find much data, and what I could find didn\u0027t make much sense. The Wikipedia article doesn\u0027t give any real dimensions for the EDS, and Astronautix.com (if I was looking at the right thing) says that it was to have a 10.0m diameter, which would be 1.6m wider than the Core Stage. Images I have seen of the Ares V show either an EDS with a slightly smaller diameter than the Core Stage, or equal in diameter.\n\nReally, I think that the Block II SLS fills the role intended for the Ares V. I think I will add the extra node to the engine mount, then you could use 2x J-2X engines on the EUS, or use the 4X RL-10C. If I can find some better information on the Ares V EDS then it may come in the future, but I don\u0027t think its really needed."},{"CreatedByName":"TheShadow1138","CreatedById":53694,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-02T04:27:16Z","Content":"**Texturing Update:** I have completed the diffuse texture revamp of the Block I SLS, I still need to update the specular maps and update the normal map for the Core Stage.\n\nHere is a render:\n\n![fpNtrdu.png](http://i.imgur.com/fpNtrdu.png)\n\nEvery part in that image has had its texture updated including the Service Module and Spacecraft Adapter.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-02T04:49:17Z\u0022 title=\u002211/02/2015 04:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TheShadow1138**"},{"CreatedByName":"Phineas Freak","CreatedById":146521,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-02T09:28:57Z","Content":"If you ever find the will to make an Ares V / EDS, you can use the information from [this page](http://spacelaunchreport.com/ares5.html).

(RL-10 is around 460)\n\nThe reason the F-1B needs to be more efficient is that in real life RP-1 and LOX have a lower average specific impulse than LH2 and LOX. You get a higher average exhaust velocity from less propellant with an LH2/LOX mixture than with an RP-1/LOX mixture. Now, in KSP there is no difference in the fuel, so if I want the performance that is necessary to perform the missions these rockets are meant to perform, the efficiencies will not behave as they would in real life. Keep in mind also, that propellant consumption is a function of Isp and Thrust. For example, the SSME in my mod (at sea level) consumes about 425 kg of propellant per second, while the F-1B in the mod consumes about 1460 kg of propellant per second. For comparison, the real RS-25D (at sea level) consumes about 518 kg/s while the F-1 consumes about 2624 kg/s. So, the performance of the engines in the mod should be comparable to their comparative real-life performance."},{"CreatedByName":"davidy12","CreatedById":143411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-09T05:42:28Z","Content":"Also, the SAW sometimes doesn\u0027t deploy.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nWhat I meant was I\u0027ll just use the Trusses not the rest of the parts."},{"CreatedByName":"TheShadow1138","CreatedById":53694,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-09T16:41:08Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Also, the SAW sometimes doesn\u0027t deploy.\n\u003E - - - Updated - - -\n\u003E \n\u003E What I meant was I\u0027ll just use the Trusses not the rest of the parts.\n\nFor the SAW, you can either set an action group to toggle all seven, or you will have to extend all seven manually through the right-click menu.

This happens when you do not extend all seven panels (the truss, 4 solar arrays, and 2 radiators). Since the same animation is attached to all seven components it seems that the game is reverting to the stowed state because one or more of the components was never extended. **To prevent this from happening make sure you click all 7 \u0022Extend\u0022 buttons in the right-click menu for the part.** On another note, I discovered another slight quirk where if you leave the station to return to the space center, or another fight and time warp, the panels will flip immediately to the sun that could cause the panels to become mis aligned (they are no longer perpendicular to the truss). The panels still work, it may just look funny. To fix it simply retract all 7 and re-extend them and all will be well.  \n\nWhile performing the tests relating to the above issue, I discovered just how difficult to control the probe-core truss docking system is, leading me to change a few things. The next update will include the fixed docking system with new RCS thruster placement and a decreased RCS thrust. The next update will also include two ModuleManager patches for RealPlume and RealChute, as well as tweaks to the Orion pods and heat shields so that they perform better during re-entry and float more correctly with the new buoyancy. I have also added the new hydrolox effects for the stock \u0022Vector\u0022 SSME to my version of the SSME, which will also be included in the next update, which may come later tonight, or sometime in the next day or two.  \n\nI thought I\u0027d share my tentative plans for the v1.4 update to ShadowWorks.  \n  \n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETentative Plans for ShadowWorks v1.4\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\n\n- 5m Earth Departure Stage LF Tank (with bump map for forward and aft stringers)\n- 2x Engine Mount for J-2X (for 2 engined EDS)\n- Single Engine Mount for J-2X (for single engined EDS)\n- Shorter 5m Interstage Decoupler (for EDS)\n- Altair Descent Stage (5m diameter)\n- Altair Ascent Stage (prone cylinder version)\n- Altair Landing Leg\n- Jupiter Core Engine Mount (four mounting points)\n- Add at least 1 node to the top of the 5m fairing base to allow stacking of Orion above a concealed payload\n- Jupiter Upper Stage w/6x 1.25m mount points for RL-10B engines (May need another interstage decoupler)\n\nWhat I may do, since I\u0027d like to wait until KSP 1.1 releases to see what changes are made to how landing legs are handled, is that if I complete the other parts before 1.1 releases I\u0027ll release everything but the landing legs as version 1.4, and then release the landing legs with the first update after KSP 1.1 is released.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-01T02:25:45Z\u0022 title=\u002212/01/2015 02:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TheShadow1138**"}]}
