I build a rocket with 15kDv and got it to orbit. Later I wanted to start the same rocket again, but this time I use the corrected a part in the upper stages (used another thruster with the same propellant) and put the rest back on. Now for whatever reason kerbal engineer show only 13kDv, especially only 1.3kdV for the big first stage. I calculated it by hand and it was wrong. \u003Cp\u003EI copied the rocket and rebuild the first and second stage exactly, now it showed 15.kDv again. I saved both versions of the craft (attached).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I found that the incorrect version has only 44k of lqdHydorgen while the correct has 94k or something like that.
