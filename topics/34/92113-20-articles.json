You can work round it by unchecking \u0022full screen\u0022 in the settings menu and adding \u0022-popupwindow\u0022 (without quotes) as a command line argument. Then it will work fine if you set your monitor\u0027s native resolution.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it crashes on DirectX but not with OpenGL, that sounds like a memory issue. OpenGL uses much less memory than DirectX (about 1 Gb or more for me). The amount of RAM you have doesn\u0027t matter if you\u0027re running the 32-bit version of KSP - it\u0027s limited to about 3.5 Gb anyway. The 64-bit Windows version is very buggy and even Squad think its unstable (but the 64-bit Linux one seems mostly fine). You\u0027re better off running the 32-bit version in OpenGL. Performance may be the same, slightly worse, or much worse, depending on your hardware (it was fine for me, though).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre you using Active Texture Management? The aggressive version of that will save a fair bit of RAM at the expense of some visual quality - and an extremely long loading time on first run as it prepares its texture cache. Second and subsequent runs will be much faster, though. IIRC, it will also probably crash once or twice on loading anyway while ATM does its thing, but eventually it will create cached textures for everything and make it through to the main menu.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-05T20:48:19Z\u0022 title=\u002203/05/2015 08:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by UnanimousCoward\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"superm18","CreatedById":57755,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-05T21:10:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Synesthesia\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Synesthesia\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EKSP keeps crashing on launch when i try to use the mod.
