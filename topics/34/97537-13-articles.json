That is something I had in mind initially, when starting with the mod and that is also the reason why I removed the multiple resource feature I tried out some releases ago. And I promise it will stay that way! If you run OSE Workshop without MKS or EL you will be able to create everything you need in flight, even the second resource.

When you install MKS together with OSE Workshop you will still use the same resources, but the converter recipe\u0027s will be adjusted to use the more complex MKS system with multiple harvestable resources and several intermediate products.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: The introduction of a second resource is independant to the MKS integration, because I needed that anyways to remove the career mode exploits mentioned some posts before. I just thought, that while I change the system and the resources anyways, that I could contact Rover to ask him about some advice regarding the integration to MKS as I personally like to play with both mods installed, because they extend each other so well if you like a challanging end game. With my current install including DMagic\u0027s science mods I can unlock the complete tech tree without leaving Kerbins soi ;-).

I am not certain if the test allows experimental parts (I hope it does: it\u0027s whatever ShipConstruct.LoadShip() has to say about it). As far as I know, this was the last \u0022exploit\u0022 (of three: the others being kerbals spawning in the new vessel (fixed in KSP 0.21), and partially built vessels did not add their mass to the mother-ship (fixed in EL 4.1, Apr 2014)).

However, I am for putting tech limits on what workshops can produce just so long as those workshops can produce the requirements for the next level of workshop, possibly requiring multiple types of workshop to produce the new one, and/or high-level engineers and/or scientists (levels 3-4 for mid-tier workshops and maybe level 5 for top-tier workshops (those that can make \u003Cem\u003Eanything\u003C/em\u003E)).

Note that the ratio of hands to brains may be much greater than 2:1 (one good engineer, many workers). Also note that \u0022out there\u0022, much less time would be required for a bootstrap operation than was required here: we already know how to make everything, so the time would go only to making each step, not figuring out not only that there is a next step, but how to make that step (ok, some stuff may have been forgotten and there might be some head-scratching on how to get from step-A to step-B, but step-B itself is already known).
