The point isn\u0027t accuracy for the sake of realism, but how it changes things. The accuracy of the aerodynamics isn\u0027t a binary choice between magic and realistic simulation, and even the stock simulation is good enough for enjoyment. I don\u0027t know how accurate the simulation is, and I don\u0027t care. All I care is that a parachute works somehow in an atmosphere and there\u0027s a difference between using the parachute and not using it. The same happens with Deadly Reentry, for instance. I don\u0027t know how accurate it is, but I know that I need a careful reentry and a heatshield most of the time, and that makes it better than stock for me. The same happens with the life support mods. It\u0027s not accurate, but at least now I need some life support resource and resupply missions, I can\u0027t simply stay in space or on the surface of another world forever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand, the parachute disappearing by magic on touchdown completely changes the final steps of reentry and landing. I don\u0027t need to decouple from the parachute and make a powered descent or use airbags, like they do in the real world. I can simply land with one or several huge parachutes that would certainly fall over my lander and affect its mission, if they didn\u0027t disappeared on touchdown.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENo, I\u0027m literally asking what you would want it to do.

PhysX can do that, Unity can do that, so it\u0027s probably very much feasible in terms of processing power (especially that you shouldn\u0027t need too many parachutes with a plugin like this).
