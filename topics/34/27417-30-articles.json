I have a 64 bit machine, could that be an issue? I remember the engines working fine for me before an update (or two?) ago. Is anyone else having a similar issue? Perhaps I don\u0027t have the correct version of the files? (although like I said, I remember it working before) - I see TT is back, but none of the download links work, so I can\u0027t check if I have the latest version, though I am pretty sure I do, unless TT has made a newer one while away. Anyway, I am pretty sure something in the last kerbal update or two broke it for me (or maybe in one of the co-responding MJ updates)...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TouhouTorpedo","CreatedById":30603,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-27T15:54:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe engines are still powered by the stock engine module, and the only one at all that alters engine output is the scorpion engine. All the others use it as is. I\u0027d suggest reporting it to the mechjeb thread as this most likely occurs for other reasons and probably with other mods. If you wanted to figure out why more precisely, I\u0027d check if it occurs on the Pegasus (uses two instead of one thrust transforms, though some stock engines use up to four now so seems unlikely as a cause) or the Scorpion (modifies stock engine thrust-limiter on the fly) or if this occurs on all engines, but ultimately this is still a mechjeb issue to me, so feedback on which one went wrong and why should go to the mechjeb thread.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AerisPrime","CreatedById":117919,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-28T01:39:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would agree that its a MJ issue, except that MJ agrees with the thrust listed in part.cfg, but when actually on the runway (not the editor) the engines only produce half! I.e., the engine claims 120kN, mechjeb uses that to estimate from the vessel mass, a TWR of, say, 1.5, and once I click \u0022launch\u0022 I see the engine maxing out (full throttle) at 60kN, and needless to say don\u0027t take off with .75 for TWR... So something seems to be causing the engine (all 3 of them) to put out half the thrust... Last I checked I had only MJ and the engines, no other mods. I will try testing it again though, and maybe check to see what version of Pitch Vector engines I have. Though like I said before, I\u0027m guessing its the last one... Anyway, while I could arbitrarily double the thrusts of my engines, so they would go to normal, I am pretty sure MJ would still be screwed up, making it hard to balance mixed-engine vessels... And, while this is quite a silly reason for sure, not being able to use these epic engines (correctly anyway) has basically kept me from playing kerbal for the last month or so. Dumb reason, I know, but I really like those engines, and using them in conjunction with other engines in forward flight (out of vtol), which is a pain to compute when the engines put out 1/2 thrust in flight but MJ reports full in editor (I\u0027ve been doing that since thrust limiting became a thing in the editor, so you could turn some engines off and check balance). If only I knew enough to fix it I would totally try. I Will work up the patience to test it again, and post results, maybe the problem vanished as magically as it appeared (can only hope)...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS: Can I post images (screenshots) here?
