I do remember that I did have some major problems in a previous version of OPT with the wings not seeming to produce much lift, but that was a very short-lived thing, K.Yeon was updating stuff fairly rapidly at the time and the problem was quickly corrected. Or perhaps that was all during the 1.0, 1.0.1, 1.0.2 patch frenzy that was going on there for a couple weeks. Either way, if you\u0027re running KSP v1.0.4 and OPT v1.7 (again, I\u0027m not using 1.8 for other reasons), the only other reason you\u0027d be having problems with ONLY the wings from OPT would have to be because of a third party mod such as FAR or NEAR or something else that messes with stock aerodynamics.

I am not trying to point fingers, only trying to describe symptoms. Allow me to clarify: I downloaded OPT and Adjustable Gear during the same period, so I cannot say if one is the culprit or the other. I have several other mods besides, including Ferram Aerospace, and it is possible my laptop is simply running out of RAM. That said, since I have installed the two, I have built and attempted to fly several different craft, all OPT hulls with an assortment of engines and wing parts. However, the latest craft I have been trying is almost bare-bones. to try to remove as many variables as possible, the craft is a J-type cockpit followed by a j-tank and a long j-adapter. I have used the stock small landing gear in place of Adjustable Gear, and OPT wing parts for all but a pair of forward canards. For those I used B9 Procedural control surface (all-moving). Despite it\u0027s simplicity and outstanding assessments from Ferram, without fail the craft begins to wobble on the gear around 80 m/s before experiencing an abrupt yaw moment that rolls it over and destroys it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason I cited the attempt with a non-OPT craft was not to blame OPT, but to offer additional information. This behavior has been relatively uniform across any craft since I installed OPT and Gear. In the one instance, I tried going back to my career mode game and flying a supersonic craft that had been known to be very stable. With that craft, using no OPT parts, I experienced the same unexplained yaw moment, followed by it\u0027s destruction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI should mention that the vehicles have not been destroyed by aerodynamic forces but rather by colliding with the terrain after rolling uncontrollably.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ss8913","CreatedById":94747,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-06T20:02:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAdjustable landing gear does not cause this behavior, I use them all the time.
