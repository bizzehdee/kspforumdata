I have installed RO and all of the recommended mods. Since I installed this (on a clean copy of ksp), I\u0027ve not been able to load quicksaves, revert to launch (revert to vehicle assembly still works), or access a probe from the tracking center (meaning once I go back to KSC, I can no longer control my probes). The issue is that whenever I try to load one of these, only the probe core appears with what looks like it may be strange aerodynamic effects on the one side of it. It says \u0027No connection\u0027 (remote tech), even though the craft should have a reflectron dp-10 and a dish. In map view, it also doesn\u0027t appear as if the ship is selected. The example craft is using an explorer core, and is in Low Earth Orbit. I\u0027m running 32-bit with active texture management.
