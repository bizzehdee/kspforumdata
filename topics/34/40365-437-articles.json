They cant really have a runaway reaction that leads to a meltdown that spews radioactive crap all over the place. The only reason we are not operating off thorium fueled molten salt reactors now is 1 part economics and 1 part the hysteria that labels everything with nuclear in the name bad. And its not that they are too expensive, its just there was more money to be had in supplying proprietary fuel rods as an ongoing revenue stream for the traditional design. Well that and the military couldnt breed plutonium in the molten salt design that was built and tested around the same time. the ICBM killed that design in the end as it was being developed to power a nuclear bomber as a lighter alternative. Its not that fission is a bad power source its just alot of factors left humanity with a really crapy design and stagnant development for the last half century.
