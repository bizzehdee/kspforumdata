That tracks the orientation of the part. (Tracking every part to many digits after the decimal point is likely where some lag comes from on large ships.) What you want to edit is the attRot = line. Set those numbers to attRot = 0,0,0,1 for a port facing up. attRot appears to be a fixed value that carries over to persistent.cfg 0,0,0,1 is apparently the default \u0022straight up\u0022 orientation for any part. Seems weird but it worked on my rover, for the wheels on both sides!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it\u0027s not facing straight up, make a quickie craft of just a probe body with a port stuck on in the orientation you want, then open the saved craft file in a text editor and copy the attRot numbers to that part in your persistent file. Be aware that each part in the craft and other files has a long identifier number tag added to its name, and the names used in those files are often not the same as in the parts inventory in the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did that to correct some crooked wheels on a rover that was on Minmus. In the pos = line, the middle number in the craft file is the part\u0027s height above the VAB floor. If you need to vertically align some parts after launch, you can edit that middle number. I did that with the rover wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep in mind that that number is not a constant! If you move the craft up or down in VAB it changes for every part. Don\u0027t try making large changes, if you\u0027re vertically aligning several parts placed one at a time, pick the number of one and copy it to the others.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaking things more difficult is KSP apparently uses radians to track rotation instead of degrees. 1 radian is an arc of a circle with the same length as the radius, which makes the number of radians in 360 degrees = 6 and a bit or 2 times Pi.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince the craft, persistent and quicksave files are plain text, it should be possible to write an external program to do things like adjust part placement and orientation, swap one part for another (though for anything but parts in outer locations with nothing else attached that would be very difficult), aligning several parts to the same plane or even swapping complete crafts. Swapping a landed craft would require being able to copy and apply the rotation values and location/surface altitude correctly. Swapping a craft in space would be much safer, just pop it in there \u0027upright\u0027 then alter the rotation in-game. Swapping a docked craft is most likely right out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be much easier to fix a problem craft by correcting it in VAB or SPH then using an external program to swap the entire craft instead of editing in-situ for anything more complicated than a slight vertical position or attRot problem on a part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERenaming a craft or editing any other descriptive text, all you need for that is a text editor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve looked for such external craft and savegame editors but haven\u0027t found any yet.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-15T05:52:18Z\u0022 title=\u002211/15/2013 05:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 15, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Galane\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NicoH","CreatedById":66692,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-15T20:31:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs GitHub only says 404 if I try to report the bug, I\u0027ll report it here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I entered Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere, all objects in my game stopped moving.
