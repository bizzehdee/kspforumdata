If you place the CoL directly on the CoM, the plane will be \u0022twitchy\u0022 but flyable till the CoM changes due to tanks emptying. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe FAR plugin comes with the \u0022Help\u0022 option, just click on it and read the long technical discriptions. Trust me I don\u0027t even understand 3/4 of it but I can get a stock designed plane to break mach 6 in FAR, so you don\u0027t need to understand EVERYTHING, it would help but if you understand a 1/4 of it you will do fine.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ferram4","CreatedById":21328,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-07T05:22:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E@a1270: \u003C/strong\u003EThat would be because the projected area is marked \u0022private\u0022 in the current version.
