With that in mind, I\u0027m wondering if it\u0027s possible to opt for different size and resolution combinations so that I could find one that would allow for full planetary coverage at a reasonable resolution with multiple heightmaps without placing too much of a burden on the system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I also want to mention that I don\u0027t think the heightmap is mismade, but rather that manipulating the heightmap might allow a jury rigged way around it the limitations of the system.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-10T22:53:22Z\u0022 title=\u002204/10/2014 10:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 10, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by SpacedInvader\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ralathon","CreatedById":71537,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-10T22:59:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne thing that might help for the heightmap is to multiply it with some random noise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMountainranges on the current heightmap appear as white blobs.
