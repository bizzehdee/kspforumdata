The thing is KSP by default does NOT consume EC for vessels that are not loaded (IE: When you are not in flight mode or when you are in flight mode and the vessel is to far away (you are switched to another vessel more than 2.x KM away)). When you switch back to the vessel in flight mode DeepFreeze will CONSUME all the EC it would have used while you were away from the vessel. IF the amount of EC required at that time is \u003E the EC your vessel has stored then it will consume 95% of your EC only. This is a compromise that I built into the code to cater for the KSP limitation of not consuming EC when vessel is not focused.\n\nWhat I think you have discovered is in fact a bug, looking at your log when you have done your timewarp at the tracking station and then you loaded the vessel it did NOT consume 95% of your EC. If you run out of EC with frozen kerbals in your vessel a timer will start that lasts for 4 minutes. After 4 minutes either your kerbals start dying (if you have the fatal option on) or they will emergency thaw. But from your log you thawed them all out before the 4 minutes occurred. The bug seems to be how I am checking when your vessel is loaded. According to the KSP API documentation the gameevent I am checking is meant to fire when a vessel loads, switches, launches, but it looks like this is not true. At least it is not firing in all cases when the vessel loads which is the case here. So I have coded a fix for this and currently testing it.\n\nUntil I can publish the fix what you can do to get around this problem is one of the following:  \n\nEVA a kerbal from your vessel and have them re-board the vessel.   \n\nSwitch away from the DeepFreeze vessel to another vessel and then back to the DeepFreeze vessel using the map view in flight mode   \n\n(don\u0027t return to the KSC or Tracking station, just click another vessel in the mapview in flightmode and switch to it and then back again).  \n\nOr, switch back to the KSC and back to the vessel, which should trigger the emergency thaw/kill procedure.  \n**BEWARE:** If you have Fatal option ON and you have not dealt with the EC problem even with this bug your Kerbals will start to DIE after the 4 minute time limit unless you thaw them. If you have the fatal option OFF, then the worst that will happen is they will be emergency thawed and become tourists for 5 minutes then become active again.\n\nA better result/gameplay experience can be had by installing BackgroundProcessor mod with DeepFreeze (llnk in the OP as a recommended mod).  \n\nWith this mod installed your vessels WILL consume EC even when your vessels are not loaded. If you have this mod also installed, DeepFreeze won\u0027t predict the EC using, but will actually see the real EC (with backgroundprocessor consuming your EC in the background) and it won\u0027t consume all the EC when you switch back to your vessel. I recommend installing backgroundprocessor along with DeepFreeze if you are using the Consume EC option in DeepFreeze.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-15T00:26:02Z\u0022 title=\u002202/15/2016 12:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 15, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by JPLRepo**"},{"CreatedByName":"AlexSheFF","CreatedById":42312,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-15T07:14:34Z","Content":"Hello JPLRepo, it\u0027s me again!

Yes - LastUpd will remain ZERO all the time with BackgroundProcessing installed while in flight. As this time indicates the last time EC was taken. You might see it flicker between 1-2 seconds and back to zero. Depending on your PC. The fact that your EC is not increasing may be a bug with BackgroundProcessing as it is the mod doing the EC add/take when you are not switched to the vessel.  It looks like DeepFreeze is requesting and taking EC from your vessel but BackgrounProcessing is not adding EC from the solar panels. I will have to investigate. Not sure why the times are incorrect either. I will have to do some further testing to see if I can replicate the problems you have reported and report back.

I think it\u0027s because I have compiled my fixed TAC LS with DEBUG on and it\u0027s issuing all these info msgs. I\u0027ll take a look if you can turn it off in settings or if I have to recompile it with debug off and report back. That temperature gagues msg I\u0027m not sure is TAC or some other mod. I\u0027ll check through the TAC code to see if it\u0027s in there or not. If it\u0027s not I\u0027d say it\u0027s not TAC. Again I\u0027ll report back.\n\nEDIT/UPDATE: [@Deimos Rast](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/157420-deimos-rast/) ok all those INFO messages from TAC LS are normal log messages that TAC LS issues. Personally I\u0027d add a setting to turn them on/off (as all my mods do this via a debug option in their settings), but it appears there is no way to turn these off and are intended to spam your log. (I have not changed this behaviour from TAC LS for my modified version).  \n\nAlso, that message about gagues, Refer to **[this post](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/125360-revert-flight-broken/).** It\u0027s nothing to do with TAC or Deepfreeze.  \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-23T08:53:11Z\u0022 title=\u002202/23/2016 08:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 23, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by JPLRepo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Kielm","CreatedById":82247,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-26T00:50:06Z","Content":"Hello!\n\nI\u0027m using USI Life Support 0.3.12.0 (latest) and the latest version of this mod, and I\u0027m experiencing the same problem as is described for TAC-LS.

DeepFreeze is correctly triggering USI LS to stop tracking frozen kerbals, but when they are thawed USI LS is then consuming resources for the period they were away. There has been a lot of changes to USI LS lately. I\u0027m investigating.  \n\n[@Kielm](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/82247-kielm/) UPDATE: This is actually a bug in USI LS, not DeepFreeze.  \n\nYou can confirm this by doing one of the following:\n\nLaunch an empty vessel with USI LS 0.3.12.0 or empty a vessel (EVA all the crew) and leave the vessel for a while.  \n\nWhen a kerbal then enters the vessel after it has been empty for a period of time they start consuming supplies (with major munchies ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022:wink:\u0022)) for the entire period the vessel was empty. So I can easily reproduce the problem with no Freezer/DeepFreeze involved.  \n\nOf course, the same happens when you freeze ALL your kerbals on the vessel with the latest USI LS installed.  \n\nThe fix is to have at least one awake kerbal on board at all times, until Roverdude updates USI LS. I have sent him a fix and PM.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-26T23:44:56Z\u0022 title=\u002202/26/2016 11:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 26, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by JPLRepo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Kielm","CreatedById":82247,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-03T18:34:21Z","Content":"Allegedly the consumption bug has been fixed in the latest USI-LS, will test tonight ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"JPLRepo","CreatedById":114736,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-03T18:37:26Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 6 minutes ago, Kielm said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Allegedly the consumption bug has been fixed in the latest USI-LS, will test tonight ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\u003E \n\n[@Kielm](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/82247-kielm/)Well I was the one that submitted the fix, and when I tested it, it worked.  \n\nThere was another potential timewarp bug that has cropped up ..
