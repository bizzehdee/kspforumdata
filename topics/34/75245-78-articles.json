If I go back to the space center and then fly the vessel again, the timer changes a little bit - usually 5-20 seconds. I believe this is because the gametime pauses when loading and unloading the vessel, but RemoteTech continues counting so the timers get offset.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps you can link the delay to the gametime? So by setting the delay, it calculates time remaining based on a time in the future, rather than now \u002B 10 minutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope that all made sense...\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETime continues to move while at the space center.. are you accounting for that?
