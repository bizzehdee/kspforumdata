But with high levels of zoom image begins to shake very rapidly, as MechJeb is correcting direction of telescope - very small corrections, thanks to long distances between your telescope and its targets even small and quick correction make image shaken. You can somehow negate this effect using time warp, but you can\u0027t change direction your telescope is pointed in time warp... But in general, yes, it works, I belive there\u0027s a way how to mitigate corrections and their effect (heavier telescope? low-thrust rcs instead of SAS? field of experiments is wide open \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E but I had no time to experiment more, as I discovered this plugin just yesterday \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DChurchill","CreatedById":60282,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-23T12:09:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust FYI, the large telescope is more solid now with MJ doing the pointing that it was before the reaction wheels.
