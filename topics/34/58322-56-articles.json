Im awaiting the ICE but mostly for rovers my tow truck could use those diesel engines for sure!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Also is there anyway to add to auto track feature from the CIWS to the tank turrets? You may have read my earlier post but just thought id swing that by you again. Im a horrid shot and would love for my carrier to be the scourge of the stars but I cant hit the broad side of a star cruiser. And the auto track would let me use both cannon even at different symmetries.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kspbigginer","CreatedById":22514,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-02T12:54:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EADD THE BUNKER BUSTER,BIGGER AND MORE POWERFULL CLUSTER BOMB EXPLOSIONS WHILE BEING TIMED\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESrry, its the only way to get peoples attention\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave Fun and terrorize Jeb \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ryanedward","CreatedById":103837,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-02T16:21:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs there a section in the guide that explains how the cannon RNG works, if there is any at all?

For rockets the RNG seems to effect when they begin to track toward target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso are you using these in space or on kerbin.

I do not usually use the rockets, as they need a long range to work effectively and I do not want to drive 400m for one shot, especially when it is only one try. I am not really for splicing files and things, the most I do is edit .cfgs to make something recoil more or something. Although I am just lazy like that.... but still, I would like to know how the RNG works so I can edit the cannons to hit more.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
