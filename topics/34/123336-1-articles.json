That said I believe the license I picked (CC BY-NC-SA) allows you to make a copy and take it in any(with a few restrictions) direction you want (more choices for users is a good thing!). I would ask that any forks have a distinct name so as not to cause confusion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@Gaalidas: The code is fairly short and almost all of it is for the user interaction and fade in/out. Only three or four lines to cycle through the parts and set the opacity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@Azimech: One of the (few) things that I\u0027m considering adding is factoring ship mass into EC used. I think it should be simple - just, as you said, get the total mass. One thing I don\u0027t want to do is make this calculation heavy - but on second thought Unity needs to track mass anyway so the GetTotalMass method shouldn\u0027t be re-scanning the entire ship when called. Hmm - no promises but I think I\u0027ll give this a shot - Guessing it may be this weekend before I can get around to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@LitaAlto: Function already included!

Also the reason why max fade and fade time are in the right click menu and cost and tech are left over from what ever cfg file I modified for this part. To use in play I\u0027m thinking EC use, Fade limit and fade time should be set in the cfg file but I\u0027m not sure what would be reasonable values. My only thought is to set to play through values and provide a MM file for those that just want to play with it - thoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-20T02:29:05Z\u0022 title=\u002210/20/2015 02:29  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by wasml\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-20T13:36:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d recommend adding a window to control cloaking.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"129828","CreatedById":134053,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-20T14:28:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou could also not let it consume EC but let it use some kind of exotic photon bending power that you use to generate with a special generator and special tanks\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr you could let it use a single piece of resource once you activate it and let it have a couple of this resource on board so that it has a limited amount of uses\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-20T18:01:23Z\u0022 title=\u002210/20/2015 06:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by 129828\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Atatra","CreatedById":122338,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-20T16:46:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is really cool, i\u0027ve not seen it done before and i love the idea, but i was wondering, is it possible to cause vessels cloaked like this be invisible to BDA radars?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wasml","CreatedById":120438,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-21T04:40:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@CliftonM: I\u0027ll add it to the improvements list but no promises.
