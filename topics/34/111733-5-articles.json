The out of memory error just crops up sometimes, maybe one in 10-15 starts. And at 8\u002B minutes load time for each run, I was getting tired of trying different combos over the last few days. That\u0027s why I didn\u0027t do another complete test grid.\n\nBefore I ran across that post making note of the potential issue, I had tried a whole lot of different combos. (Sorry, I didn\u0027t keep the grid I used once I gave up and just did the Sandbox) Nothing I tried with different combos of the Configurator and packs fixed the issue.

You believe, since everything works when you remove that one file, it must be that on file. This is not necessarily so, however. If that one file is the proverbial drop that overfloweth the cup, it may be a more general problem. That is why I asked you to remove a different mod and see if things start working. If they do, it is definitely a resource problem, and not a problem with BAE.\n\nIf it *is* a genuine problem with BAE, I am surprised that you are the only one reporting it. There should be many others having the same experience. Since that does not seem to be the case, I am inclined to believe that it might be a mod incompatibility issue. That is, one or more of your 172 mods may somehow not play nice with BAE. Needless to say, it will be difficult to figure out exactly which one(s).\n\nPerhaps the easiest solution, if you can live without the BAE contracts, is to play the game like you are already doing - without them."},{"CreatedByName":"nightingale","CreatedById":119307,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T15:22:16Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I am aware of that, but it shouldn\u0027t affect contracts, as it is only used as a flag decal. Just so there\u0027s no confusion, I will make it a PNG in future versions.\n\nActually, that\u0027s incorrect. KSP will auto-create agents from flags.\n\nAnyway, the problem with agents and DDS needs a perfect storm, but when it fails, it fails hard:\n\n1. KSP will ignore scaled agent icons that are .DDS (they\u0027re below the minimum resolution for DDS, I believe)\n2. If it can\u0027t find a scaled agent icon, it\u0027ll convert from the unscaled version.\n3. If the unscaled version is DDS, it\u0027ll try to read it from memory, and fail with an exception. Due to bad stock code the agent loading process is to a halt. Which means a portion of the agents (presumably anything that sits in a directory alphabetically after the one it failed on) will never load. Contracts that are hardcoded to run for a certain agent that didn\u0027t get loaded will fail (World-First records in stock, almost every contract pack for Contract Configurator).\n\nIt is really quite obnoxious, but what this means is:\n\n1. If you have your main agent icon as DDS, you need a scaled one in PNG.\n2. If your main agent icon is PNG, you can optionally create a scaled one in PNG.\n3. No idea the implication (if any) for flags that KSP decides to auto-transform into agents.\n\nEDIT: That being said, I have no idea if this is Padrone\u0027s issue - since it sounds like he is also running out of memory, which is muddying the water. Anyway, that in a nutshull is the problem with DDS \u002B Agents, which may also affect normal flags (not 100% sure).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-16T16:11:19Z\u0022 title=\u002207/16/2015 04:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by nightingale**"},{"CreatedByName":"plague006","CreatedById":142570,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T19:49:59Z","Content":"Had someone pop up in CKAN chat with the same issue as Padrone.

Anyway, I am a bit weary of incorporating parts of existing mods into my own. If the Stanford Torus mod has been abandoned by its developer, it will undoubtedly be difficult to contact him/her and gain permission to adopt those parts. Doing so without permission is sort of an unwritten no-no in the mod community. I think I speak on behalf of most modders when I say that it is one thing to continue development on a mod that has been abandoned for a very long time, and doing so *in the spirit of its original scope*. However, picking it apart and stealing bits and pieces from it is something entirely different.\n\nThat said, I still owe the voters of my survey some kind of science experiment. Perhaps, if I get a bit more free time on my hands in the near future, I could be persuaded to research the finer points of IVAs and create a large science lab for BAE, although I can\u0027t promise it will be as large as 10 meters.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m still experiencing the contracts issue with Texture Replacer, unfortunately.
