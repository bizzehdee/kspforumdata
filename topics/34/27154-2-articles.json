I suggest editing all cfg files to add \u003Cstrong\u003ErescaleFactor = 1\u003C/strong\u003E. The Falcon isn\u0027t a really fat rocket, so a 2.5m diameter in KSP is ok.

I can\u0027t see any attach nodes in the VAB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) The file sizes are really excessive. Your whole mod is 900Mb uncompressed, so it simply won\u0027t run if people have other mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost other designers keep their part sizes below 1 or 2Mb for the most detailed parts. If it\u0027s because of the textures, there really is no need for such an excessive resolution. 40Mb of textures for a single engine is crazy. Nobody is going to be flying with their camera zoomed in on the Falcon 9 logo or an engine bell (which is all plain black anyway). You should never really need more than 256x256 textures, except maybe for the larger parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe models are very nice though. I\u0027m eagerly awaiting for an updated version.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, in the SpaceX video that showed upper stage reentry, the heatshield was on top in order to preserve the engine bell and the stage rotated for landing. I\u0027m guessing you didn\u0027t do this for mass reasons. My suggestion would be to use your MechJeb pod as a heatshield, change the texture from yellow to a black heatshield, and make it the same weight as the engine. This should allow MechJeb to keep it prograde for reentry and retrograde for landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe new 2.5m version should fix the problems you\u0027ve mentioned. The artist\u0027s concept that SpaceX has on their website does indeed have the upper stage reentering the atmosphere \u0022headfirst\u0022, which would occur after ejecting the secondary payload system, I would have to guess - the animation doesn\u0027t show that actual transition.
