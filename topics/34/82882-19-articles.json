The logistic portion isn\u0027t in, but the cost is significant. It\u0027s like 10x the cost of conventional rockets, which does a lot of heavy lifting as far as balance goes. You can throw away lower stages with stock parts and remain solvent, you\u0027d have a very difficult time doing so with kspil, so the idea is that they have a good but more performance, but they cost a lot more which means you also need to recover them. The idea is that it fits within a reusability niche.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich may not be the best design, and maybe they need to be nerfed more, but it wouldn\u0027t be a drastic nerf either way. I only have a few domains to work with and the parts would be impossible to balance without the addition of funds without completely neutering the fun out of thermal nozzles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just have to wonder if you\u0027ve actually played career with the current version. Finds can get tight. It has happened to me a couple of times in this playthrough. And I had to go to extra lengths to try and recover failed vessels just to get my funds back. (Which was what I was going for.) I can\u0027t really go much higher with costs especially on early tech without stepping outside the income rate of stock career. Nevermind if someone decides to use a funds nerf addon to make career more difficult which is a tweak I\u0027d like for players of kspil to be able to use for extra challenge if they desire.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-05T04:32:15Z\u0022 title=\u002209/05/2014 04:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 5, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by WaveFunctionP\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WaveFunctionP","CreatedById":104784,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-05T04:14:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022tygoo7\u0022 data-cite=\u0022tygoo7\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIs it normal some nodes in the back of the tech tree are just floating by themselves?
