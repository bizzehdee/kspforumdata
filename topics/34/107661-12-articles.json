One minor quibble, which probably counts more as a feature request than a bug report. It would sure be nice if it could pay attention to the KSP apps scale setting. I used to run KSP at a ludicrously low resolution, that being the only way I could get the text large enough for my aging eyes to read. I have a nice 30\u0022 2560x1440 monitor, but I was running KSP at something like 1280x720. In 1.2, enough stuff can be scaled up that I can run at a decent 1920x1200 and use UI scaling of 150%. That gives me decent resolution and most text is large enough to read, but the text [X] Science is almost unreadable, certainly needing me to strain and squint a lot to read it. Would be nice if it paid attention to the apps scale setting (or gave me a separate option to scale its text size).

I either got a bad download or that I somehow screwed up the install, which I find unlikely, since I\u0027ve done this a few times before. I\u0027ll try re-downloading and see if it makes a difference.\n\nEDIT: Fresh copy of the mod made no difference. I\u0027ll start removing other mods to check for conflicts.\n\nEDIT 2: I find myself confused. I rebuilt the mod list one by one, and it all worked. No problems. Then, I go to my old save (I tested in a new one) and it vanishes. So I go back to the testing one, and it\u0027s gone, but the GUI is still up and working. No clue here... but I wonder if there was a problem with the original save because it wasn\u0027t installed prior to the game start? Unlikely, I know, but I have no other explanation for it at the moment.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-16T16:29:39Z\u0022 title=\u002210/16/2016 04:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 16, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Shadriss**"},{"CreatedByName":"DMagic","CreatedById":57416,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-16T16:44:36Z","Content":"The Toolbar compatibility wrapper that just about every mod with a window uses is broken and needs to be updated.

I thought I\u0027d do a bit more bug hunting.\n\n- I have bunged in the **fix for nightingale\u0027s Contract Configurator/Toolbar problem**.  I added it to TAC Fuel Balancer too.  CC\u0027s download has been pulled so I can\u0027t really test it but I\u0027m pretty sure it\u0027s a good\u0027un.  Famous last words.\n- I ripped out a bit more Linq, quite a big bit from ScienceContext.UpdateExperiments( ).  Apart from being a generally good thing it also let me bung in a fix for the LTech SkyLab part.  **[x] Science! won\u0027t crash if you are using LTech.**  SkyLab and the External Camera had weird stub experiments with NULL values.  These are called \u0022WaitWhat\u0022 and \u0022Error\u0022 which made me giggle once they started being listed in the report window.\n- I\u0027ve **updated the science.cfg** I ship to add the bogus LTech experiments and took the opportunity to add some of the fake biome DMagic ones and also to restrict Sounding Rockets to the Home World.\n- I have added a routine to generate **\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E baby biomes for any Home World**.  I\u0027m looking up a Lat-Long for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E and then finding a single Biome for that position.

It seems the game didn\u0027t know which scene it was on.  Just too weird.\n\nI also didn\u0027t fix MUN\u0027s multiple lowlands.  Turns out it wasn\u0027t my problem.  Makes a change.  Really pleased for the post above because I was just getting stuck into that.\n\nI\u0027m going to release a TAC Fuel Balancer update and maybe do some triage on Protractor tomorrow.
