After releasing the boosters during ascent you should be able to maintain control with the 3 main engines and see the gimbal functioning. You should be in the \u0022coast to Apoapsis\u0022 stage now and you may want to have low or 0 throttle until you\u0027re in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) watch the fuel in the orange tank. When it hits 0, cut your throttle to 0 and release the tank. Toggle pitch trim on your main engines off. you can now thrust directly forward with them. However, the OMS thrusters are more efficient. You can shutdown the main engines and use the OMS instead. They should be at 14 on the pitch trim when you right click on them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW - you should not need RCS until you are pushing the shuttle away from the orange tank.
