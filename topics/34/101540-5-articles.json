Scaling of the root part is not recommended because it will trigger a bug in KSP aud cause bad things. Other than that, there is no known problem with scaling of mass and attachment positions. Part clipping or models reverting scale are usually just visual bugs, so they should not interfere with physics. What you describe sounds like it comes either from a scaled root part or from a problem with your install. Exceptions can also lead to TweakScale code being skipped, which would lead to symptoms like you describe.\n\nWell, there is no way around it for me, the part that I\u0027m making is a ring for making stations, it\u0027s 10 meter radius by default but you can scale it from 0.1 (1 meter radius) up to 10 (100 meter radius), but i noticed when i change the scale on it, the mass is not being changes, also, i looked into the JSI, the module that I\u0027m using has nothing special to do with nodes but it\u0027s a component enable / disable thing, at least, if the user add parts on the scale 1 and tweak nodes when it\u0027s scale 1, then he / she can change the scale of the ring to what he/she needs when the job is finished, but the mass is a problem, if the 10 meter ring is 4 tons, the 100 meter shouldn\u0027t be 4 tons !"},{"CreatedByName":"pellinor","CreatedById":85299,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T20:18:58Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Pellinor, have you ever tried TweakScale with BDArmory? I wrote a config for it with appropriate exponents for various values and everything, but it resulted in a glitchy nightmare (parts wouldn\u0027t attach in editor, exceptions thrown, stuff like that). Just curious if anyone has had it work - could be cool to scale up one of the BDArmory bombs to make a megabomb.\n\nI\u0027ve never tried BDArmoury. TweakScale only works out of the box if the other module can live with having its variables manipulated without notice. So I\u0027d suggest to start small and see which values can be changed without glitches. \n\nA second way is that BDArmoury can use the TweakScale API to get notified on rescale and update their module themselves. I know that IR and MFT/realFuels successfully use method.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027ve got a weird bug with this. I\u0027m using a number of different mods, and whenever I mouse over the reactors from the Interstellar mod in the parts menu, the thumbnail starts to expand, until I can no longer see it. I did hunt around in the forum, but didn\u0027t really see anything like this. Here\u0027s a list of the mods I have installed (I use CKAN, and it didn\u0027t SAY they were incompatible):\n\u003E Is this a known bug or incompatibility?\n\nNot known for TweakScale. But I\u0027ve seen this before, and I remember a comment that this symptom was fixed in some mod (don\u0027t remember which one). That was quite some time ago, so it should not affect anything CKAN distributes.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Well, there is no way around it for me, the part that I\u0027m making is a ring for making stations, it\u0027s 10 meter radius by default but you can scale it from 0.1 (1 meter radius) up to 10 (100 meter radius), but i noticed when i change the scale on it, the mass is not being changes, also, i looked into the JSI, the module that I\u0027m using has nothing special to do with nodes but it\u0027s a component enable / disable thing, at least, if the user add parts on the scale 1 and tweak nodes when it\u0027s scale 1, then he / she can change the scale of the ring to what he/she needs when the job is finished, but the mass is a problem, if the 10 meter ring is 4 tons, the 100 meter shouldn\u0027t be 4 tons !\n\nAs I told you, scaling of the root part is known to be buggy and not supported at the moment. Though I have some hope left that the problem will vanish next monday. \n\nEDIT: now I also see a mass issue! Still have to see if I broke that in my dev copy or in a published version.\n\nEDIT: found it! It seems that the stock info window does not update often enough, so it misses rescales (but probably displays the right number once it catches up). Detaching parts seems to update it. If I open a mechjeb info window mass changes as (and when) it should.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-23T22:17:07Z\u0022 title=\u002204/23/2015 10:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by pellinor**"},{"CreatedByName":"MarcAlain","CreatedById":141219,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-25T03:34:46Z","Content":"Will this work for scaling things like capsules?

Then I\u0027ll take a few days for discussing feedback and deciding on the new scaling behavior. \n\nThe main point where I need more feedback is mass/thrust of engines. My understanding is that 2 would be a physically reasonable exponent for thrust, and lead to engines that are useful in the game. \n\nThe old setting is exponent 2.5 for both, probably because my predecessor wanted to avoid part-specific mass exponents. Going as low as 2.5 already messes up the mass fraction of fuel tanks enough. So my guess is that the mass exponent was chosen as a compromise and the thrust exponent was chosen to preserve TWR. \n\nAt the moment the dev version uses exponent 2 for engine thrust and weight. So a 2.5m engine is equivalent to four 1.25m engines. In this scaling, a (KSP 0.90) 48-7s is reasonably close to a downscaled skipper (both thrust and bell size are a bit bigger for the 0.625m skipper).\n\nSo what do you think?"},{"CreatedByName":"DaniDE","CreatedById":130484,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T17:49:21Z","Content":"Thanks for keeping at it pellinor! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nIf its roughly the same performance, all is fine.

I actually scale for performance, and remember that for tiny things the best engine for the job often was smaller than what would look best. And at the moment the weight exponent for engines is not that easy to adjust, this is why I am thinking about writing a TWEAKSCALEBEHAVIOR for them too. \n\nFor mass/thrustExponent=2, the height of the fuel stack that an engine can lift is preserved. If a 2.5m engine can barely lift two orange tanks, its 1.25m version will lift the same height worth of 1.25m tanks. The typical 0.625m craft will be much smaller than that, so those crafts will typically call for a smaller/lighter engine. \n\nFor exponent 3, the stack an engine can lift will also scale linearly in length. This might be a bit much. \n\nFor exponent 2.5, the stack grows with sqrt(scale) in height. This is the old setting, which I kept for boosters (i.e. engines with a tank attached). So when a booster is scaled, the twr scales with exponent -0.5, and the burn time with \u002B0.5. This is also how TWR and burn time scales with length for the (0.90) stock boosters. This might actually be a good middle ground. I\u0027ll have to build a few tiny (and large) things to see how well it fits.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Yes, it\u0027s great, when you actioly know it\u0027s there.

Since both modes take their intervals from the scaleFactors, there are no small intervals anymore. and the slider increment is too small, you\u0027d usually need 25 or more clicks to get to the middle."},{"CreatedByName":"futrtrubl","CreatedById":77310,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T04:20:03Z","Content":"I think for engines mass should scale with 3 and thrust with 2.
