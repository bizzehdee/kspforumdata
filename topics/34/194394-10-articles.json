That said, I\u0027m starting to have some second thoughts about even setting the engines to false as I\u0027ve noticed some of what you\u0027ve mentioned already as I\u0027ve progressed through the tech tree in my career save with various engines being poor performing outliers because of their mass. Knowing that there are more issues to be had further down the line makes me think it might be better to start over and just deal with the fact that my rockets aren\u0027t going to be very big. I guess the worst case scenario is that I could add some structural segments to make things look better...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bright Universe","CreatedById":232648,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-04-04T00:06:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes this mod support waterfall?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwaster","CreatedById":71262,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-04-04T02:28:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224377394\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022194394\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221712189165\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022232648\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022bright Universe\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, bright Universe said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes this mod support waterfall?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot really a valid question.
