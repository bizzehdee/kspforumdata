However I imagine that it has to do the with surface attachment rules.

One of the new features of CLS was the ability to add custom parts to your vessels.  It does this by adding a module to the part and telling the part that it is passable.\n\nYou can replicate this by adding the module yourself to that part in that vessel.  Additionally, you will need to add a config for that part in your module manager configurations. Creating Module Manager configs are described in the Wiki here: [https://github.com/codepoetpbowden/ConnectedLivingSpace/wiki/3.0-Module-Manager-Configuration](https://github.com/codepoetpbowden/ConnectedLivingSpace/wiki/3.0-Module-Manager-Configuration), and the Configs folder has many examples.   Look there for sample configs. \n\nTo accomplish this, take a look at other parts that contain a module called \u0022ModuleConnectedLivingSpace\u0022. Example below:\n\n    \t\t\t\tMODULE\t\t\t{\t\t\t\tname = ModuleConnectedLivingSpace\t\t\t\tisEnabled = True\t\t\t\tspaceName = Mk1-2 Command Pod\t\t\t\tEVENTS\t\t\t\t{\t\t\t\t}\t\t\t\tACTIONS\t\t\t\t{\t\t\t\t}\t\t\t}\n\nIn this example, the spacename is there, but you can simply remove the spacename.\n\nCopy this code into your part where modules reside, and your module should now be passable. BE SURE to backup your savegame, should this edit not work.  I\u0027d hate for you to lose your work because of a hack.\n\nHope this helps.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-18T17:09:25Z\u0022 title=\u002206/18/2016 05:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 18, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Papa\\_Joe**"},{"CreatedByName":"Papa_Joe","CreatedById":10788,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-18T19:45:17Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 2 hours ago, codepoet said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I do not know the answer to your question for certain.

It appears the grapple nodes work as expected as demonstrated by the ball hub which is connected via the same method.  I had the radially attached ISRU part grappled and not the ball hub.  I ended up using the KAS/USI connection tubes and retrofitted the station.  Now my Kerbals can pass freely throughout the station, hooray.  It looks more aesthetically pleasing anyways since the parts are lined up correctly now, no gaps.  Thanks again for getting me on the right track.  Here\u0027s a shot of the station with a resupply lander bringing in more Kerbals to assist in operations.  Running a base with USI/MKS requires more Kerbals than I anticipated.\n\nThe mod feels like it\u0027s in great shape in 1.1.2.
