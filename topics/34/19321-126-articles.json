It might also explain why I find it so very hard to rotate off the end of the runway, since my craft are generally supersonic by 500m (or more accurately take so long to rotate that they are several klicks downrange while still being below 500m yet breaking 300ms).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis album shows one of the designs im having issues with. It does fly to orbit, yet needs constant TLC to keep it airborne. Is entirely stock other than some nosecones. It is almost impossible to launch, leaving the runway at 200ms without having achieved enough lift it gets catapaulted by the drop at the end of the runway and then rotates like a brick. (as said above its often supersonic before its finished rotating for a 45deg climb.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis one doesnt fall along the prograde in thin air, but it\u0027s window of acceptable AoA\u0027s shrinks drastically above 9km, it loves to stall out right around that transition. In addition, it doesnt like to hold pitch. I gave it lots of elevators and can get the nose up, but it has a tendancy to yoyo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe final image shows CoM and CoL. Bear in mind that the first tank to drain is the 1.25m nosetank, which shifts the CoM back noticeably whilst rolling down the runway, the SRB\u0027s are functioning as Jaydos here and get dropped on the runway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill could be mach tuck? I\u0027ve definately seen that on some of my planes so i\u0027ll keep an eye open for it. Looking back through these pictures makes me think my wing isnt Delta enough, so I might try and extend it forward toward th enose a bit more. I was trying to avoid pushing the CoL forward, but if its sliding back as I mach nyway then theres some tweaks can be done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/gwoHT\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

You\u0027d be amazed how much that didnt come up as a glider pilot, it\u0027d probably have torn my wings off. My designs are likely all encountering this immediately on launch then i\u0027d guess since it triggers while still sub-sonic. Infact i now realise i\u0027ve seen this in a couple of designs even as they accelerated to the runway end, where they \u0027tucked\u0027 right before I went to pull off. I\u0027d guess my CoM is a little too forward in several stages of flight, will play around later this evening and see if I can stabilise this.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-04T09:02:15Z\u0022 title=\u002202/04/2014 09:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 4, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by celem\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"taniwha","CreatedById":57176,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-04T09:38:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ecelem\u003C/strong\u003E: I\u0027m sorry, but that does not look like airplane (nor does it look like a space-plane).
