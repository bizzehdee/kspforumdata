I kind of have the sneaking suspicion that people ran out of memory before re-entry and that is why there is no atmosphere drag when they enter it again, because FAR has no free memory to work with. The reload then frees up just enough memory for the atmosphere to work again although when I was running out of memory a reload would cause my game to crash, but I have read that on a linux machine a crash won\u0027t happen instead ksp would be just very very slow.

There are also differences in heat tolerance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe simplest way to reduce the drag on your ship would be to get rid of the structural intakes at the back. You don\u0027t need them, and they\u0027re in the worst possible place for drag on that design.

If you have \u003Cem\u003EKerbal Flight Data \u003C/em\u003Eor something else that shows engine thrust, try to climb at an angle such that your engine power slowly increases rather than decreases. Thrust is a function of speed and altitude; you want the increasing speed to just outweigh the increasing altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
