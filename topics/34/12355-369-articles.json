Because I\u0027ve got a rocket-powered Spaceplane that according to MechJeb only has a starting TWR of .74, but I\u0027ve been able to fly it quite well since I first built it before even unlocking MechJeb. It\u0027s a pretty simple design using 3 AV-R8 winglets (2 for the canards, 1 for the tail), 2 Type B Wing Connectors (each with a lift rating of 2), the Mk 1 Cockpit, the Science Jr., two FL-T400s and a LV-909 with tricycle landing gear.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T02:50:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELift is not thrust, and shouldn\u0027t be included in TWR calculations.

I think I\u0027ve found the problem. Or at least something that will allow sarbian to track it down. The issue is that, for some reason, stock SAS is getting turned on, even though it doesn\u0027t show it. I turned off Smart ASS, toggled SAS on and back off, then tried using Smart ASS again, and it worked! Now, I haven\u0027t done any testing, so I don\u0027t know that that was it for sure, but it fixed it for me. Once I finish this flight I\u0027ll see if I can do some testing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Happened again during this flight, and I was able to fix it the same way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit edit: Don\u0027t even have to turn Smart ASS off.
