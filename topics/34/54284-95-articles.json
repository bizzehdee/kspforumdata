I designed a completely stock rocket but when I clicked \u0027finalize build\u0027 the rocket spawned slanted at some strange angle and under the surface (with ensuing explosions). Trying several more times led to it spawning almost horizontally and displaced in random directions at various distances. Renaming the vessel before building didn\u0027t help and nor did replacing all of the parts one by one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECuriously, what did fix it was building the rocket from scratch. Thinking of possible causes led me to think of only one difference between the two craft: on the first one I had used the root part re-flow in the VAB to change the root part and then back again. This bug has happened on two different vessels now with the same fix and they also had in common that root part re-flow was used during the first iteration design. Could this affect the surveyed build system somehow?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a related note, I\u0027ve experienced joint-breaking twists in the launch stabilizers on build if I\u0027ve angled the entire vessel using the root part.
