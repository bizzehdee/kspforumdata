It looks like the SCANsat module is not getting applied to the SpacePlane Plus cockpits, it does appear to be getting added to the stock and MKS pods though. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI see that you\u0027re crashing, but does it happen right away, or are you able to right click on the cockpit to check if it has an \u0022Open Map\u0022 button?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0027s supposed to happen here is that RPM will add the necessary modules to any parts with an IVA. Then SCANsat will come along and check to see if any parts have the RPM modules attached, and if so attach it\u0027s own module. From what I can tell SCANsat isn\u0027t seeing the SpacePlane parts and so doesn\u0027t add its module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve tested this with stock parts and it doesn\u0027t trigger a crash when I deliberately remove the SCANsat module from a command pod, so I\u0027m not sure why it\u0027s causing such severe problems with SpacePlane Plus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEither way a fix for this will have to be released so that even if the module doesn\u0027t get added it won\u0027t break or cause crashing. It\u0027s a simple thing to fix, I was just dumb in not being careful about assuming that the SCANsat module would always be present.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the meantime you can try adding a module manager config with this inside to just force the SCANsat module onto the part; just fill in whatever the actual part name is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E@PART[*SpacePlane Cockpit*]\u003Cbr\u003E{\u003Cbr\u003E\tMODULE\u003Cbr\u003E\t{\u003Cbr\u003E\t\tname = SCANsat\u003Cbr\u003E\t\tsensorType = 0\u003Cbr\u003E\t\tfov = 0\u003Cbr\u003E\t\tmin_alt = 0\u003Cbr\u003E\t\tmax_alt = 0\u003Cbr\u003E\t\tbest_alt = 0\u003Cbr\u003E\t\tscanName = Eyeball Scan\u003Cbr\u003E\t\tpower = 0.05\u003Cbr\u003E\t}\u003Cbr\u003E}\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DMagic","CreatedById":57416,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-21T19:47:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022xfrankie\u0022 data-cite=\u0022xfrankie\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHey guys, quick question.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou have a very old copy of SCANsat.dll in your GameData folder (just GameData/SCANsat.dll, not in any subfolder) so it\u0027s not actually loading the correct version of SCANsat.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xfrankie","CreatedById":93378,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-21T19:58:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow, it worked!
