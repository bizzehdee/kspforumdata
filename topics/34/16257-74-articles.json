To solve my issue, I decided to make a couple quick fixes for version 0.5.0.1 that address the most annoying compatibility problems with 0.21.1:\u003Cp\u003E- Flight computer now recognizes all new reaction wheel modules when calculating available torque. This will allow the flight controller to properly control your rockets without burning away all your RCS. Note that the flight computer does not actually calculate the available torque in the direction it plans to rotate, but rather it averages the pitch, yaw, and roll power of the reaction wheel module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- KSP default SAS and Flight Computer KillRot can now be toggled independently. Flight Computer KillRot is now only enabled by pressing the GUI button (SAS shortcut key will only toggle default KSP SAS).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe code is hosted on \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/alexcraig/RemoteTech\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EGitHub\u003C/a\u003E. I\u0027ve sent a pull request to the main repository, but I understand if you don\u0027t want to take on the responsibility of maintaining 0.21.1 compatibility with RemoteTech 2 so close and much work to be done. For people who\u0027d like to try out my fixes without compiling themselves, I\u0027ve hosted the modified \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.thecraigrepository.ca/files/RemoteTech.dll\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ERemoteTech.dll file here\u003C/a\u003E.
