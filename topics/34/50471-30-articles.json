That\u0027s because the mass of an object is proportional to its volume, but its drag is proportional to its surface area.

Turns out that solar panels that far out not only do not produce power as it should be, but they actually drain power. A gigantor panel in orbit around Laythe-Titan will drain approx 2 charge/second when properly oriented.

It has multiple antenna support (total omni range = strongest \u002B 1/4 * sum(all other omnis\u0027 ranges) ) and a new range model, where max range for a connection is shorter_range \u002B sqrt(shorter_range * longer_range). It\u0027s somewhat more complicated to use, but IMO leads to a much better feel--you can have a large base station antenna and only a few small ones on your satellite, for instance, or you can have a small dish on your Voyager-alike and a BIG dish at home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESure, I definitely like the sound of the new model.

Stock RT2 they have 3km range but it seems KSC is 15-20km away from where RT2 thinks it is. I think I read you moved KSC closer to the ocean so it\u0027s probably just that. I included the RT2 probe config in my dropbox link with their values moved up to 20km so that should fix any problems you might have had with your probe being uncontrollable on the pad without the passive antenna (DP-10). I also changed the launch clamp range to 20km so it should work as intended now too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/sh/v83igld8wmq33nc/G7n71gUkQn\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDropbox Link\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-16T03:53:16Z\u0022 title=\u002211/16/2013 03:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 16, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by li7in6\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"iVG","CreatedById":58021,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-16T07:24:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NathanKell\u0022 data-cite=\u0022NathanKell\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eferram: will do! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewasmic: as starwaster says everything is configurable.
