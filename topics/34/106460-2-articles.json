I think they\u0027re really cool (har har) and seem to make a lot of sense.\n\nThey do the perpendicular-sun-tracking thing, to utilize both sides of each panel. When you see the panels while in an umbra, you also see the glowing heat pipes. I\u0027m guessing the heat pipes are made of oxidized copper or anodized aluminum because of they\u0027re good at both radiating and conducting. For the purposes of texturing, the rest of the color of the radiator may not actually matter much, since we\u0027re mostly concerned with non-visible radiation.\n\nThe ISS, though, uses ammonia as coolant throughout the station modules as well as the radiators. You can\u0027t really see the ammonia channels, though, maybe the radiator panels are aluminum or something? I\u0027m not sure if the coloring is deliberate or coincidental.\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:STS-134_EVA4_view_to_the_Russian_Orbital_Segment.jpg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:STS-134_EVA4_view_to_the_Russian_Orbital_Segment.jpg)\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:EATCS.png](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:EATCS.png)\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nThis discussion also makes me think of the effectiveness of inline, stack-mounted radiators. It would be neat if their effectiveness changed when they\u0027re in an umbra, or even when they\u0027re tilted closer to perpendicular to the sun. When they\u0027re in sunlight, obviously one side wouldn\u0027t be able to radiate anything, but since the game is tracking heat on a per-part basis, the end result would be, ok radiation in the sun, better radiation in the shade."},{"CreatedByName":"Randazzo","CreatedById":136468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T02:02:46Z","Content":"Updated - Active Heat Management Systems introduced."},{"CreatedByName":"politas","CreatedById":119649,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T02:21:02Z","Content":"Still quite useful in 1.0.2:\n\n![2015-05-03_00002.jpg](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/10499401/2015-05-03_00002.jpg)\n\nEDIT: Note that this screenshot is using v0.20, as V0.21 hasn\u0027t shown up on CKAN yet.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nOne question, in KSP 1.0\u002B, many deployable parts are unable to be un-deployed.

They will suck your batteries dry though if you\u0027re not careful with the pump.\n\nThe idea is that they used a closed NH3 (ammonia) coolant system to absorb and dissipate heat, gradually becoming less effective over time as it absorbs heat. To counter this, it must be pumped through the unit to cool off and restore it\u0027s effectiveness. That\u0027s the idea.\n\nWhat\u0027s really happening is that I\u0027ve butchered the Heatshield ablation system and created a new resource for it. The initial idea had coolant tanks from which you had to pump coolant into the units, but it didn\u0027t make sense to have vanishing coolant (even though that\u0027s technically still happening), so I went with electric powered pumps operating on the above mentioned premise. In reality, once the units reach their ablation threshold, they are in fact consuming the NH3 resource which the \u0022pump\u0022 generates. The ablation module itself basically raises the thermal mass of the units the more resource it has available, and creates a huge internal flux that dumps the heat from the radiator. It does not directly affect the engine in this manner, only the unit itself, but it will ultimately hit a balance (still at pretty high temperatures) where the engine will lose more heat to the unit than it generates and stop heating (and possibly cool off a tiny bit), if you can maintain the proper level of NH3.\n\nThere, all the dirty secrets."},{"CreatedByName":"WoollyMittens","CreatedById":138628,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T04:10:25Z","Content":"Cheers @Randazzo, that\u0027s really helpful.
