I think all that\u0027s essentially happened is that the Minecraft community was much larger than KSP\u0027s ever has been (KSP\u0027s is growing rapidly now though) meaning there were more people with diverse viewpoints interacting, and that one side of that war has already declared victory here before any shots have been fired.\u003Cp\u003EBehavior like is being exhibited in this thread is essentially what caused the MC wars in the first place: some people want to do their own thing, and others want to force their view of what modding should be, and thus how those other people should spend their own recreational time, down their throats.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo my advice would be: if you don\u0027t want that kind of hostility between modders, then don\u0027t start it. Let people do their thing and if they want to collaborate, they\u0027ll do so, and if they won\u0027t, they won\u0027t. Otherwise it\u0027s only a matter of time before some of us start wearing kilts and shouting \u0022freedom!!!!\u0022 \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is no one right way to mod, and even if there were, I sincerely doubt it should be up to a single individual or a small group to say what it is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy apologies for the further off-topic silliness Yemo.

For example I just lumped many aircraft parts together and did not recheck everything (eg winglets).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FreeThinker","CreatedById":117389,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T21:14:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think the problem is that you potentially broke the CTT by switching a few nodes from location. Although it makes perfect sense to put Manned Pods much latter in the tech tree, some mods might actually require that you have early access to manned space craft or make it a whole lot easier. At least SETI has the advantage that is a total conversion, meaning it can actively anticipate these problems and give implement alternative solutions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"goldenpsp","CreatedById":113874,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T21:24:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile it may be a bad idea to jump into this train wreck, I\u0027m gonna anyhow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the one hand, I\u0027d throw out that I understand Rover\u0027s viewpoint. He has worked very hard with many modders in an attempt to make it so mods that may have similar components (such as resources) can play nice together. That way if someone wants to use KSPIE and MKS they can for example. I don\u0027t think it is fair to classify his argument as a \u0022my way or the highway\u0022 argument however.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat being said, on the other side of the coin, this SETI mod historically has only worked with mods that have first been cleansed to meet Yemo\u0027s vision of balance. So I would suspect whatever might be broken by this CTT issue would be moot, as Yemo\u0027s response would be \u0022that mod isn\u0027t on my supported list for SETI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck everyone.
