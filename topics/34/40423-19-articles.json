I think TMS is onto something with his comments, though I don\u0027t know if a simple crosshair would help against brilliant glare or medium-distance visual clutter. At risk of over-complicating the code, perhaps have several styles of indicators for the user to select from? A circle, a diamond, crosshairs, steady v. pulsing ... The Targetron mod calls attention to the targeted port this by highlighting but frankly that isn\u0027t nearly visible enough for me at any kind of distance over about 100m, and if you\u0027ve accidentally selected a port on the other side of your target ship/station, you won\u0027t see it at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I would like the HUD indicator to be relatively large and very visually distinctive. I\u0027d love to see a pulsing diamond overlay, something with both visual (pulsing) and spatial (shape; diamond of the indicator vs. circular port) distinction to draw my eye to the target. Heck, if it were up to me, I had an option for a diamond with four arrows pointing inwards one to each point of the diamond. Here\u0027s a poor mockup of what I mean. Note two things: first the diamond shape denoting the target is the standard KSP diamond, except colored orange to match the aesthetic of the indicator in DPAI. Second, this image is the first one I could find digging through my archive and isn\u0027t actually laid over the port, but at the station\u0027s center of mass; ideally the target would be overlaid on the actually targeted port.

Diomedea makes some good points about colors and visibility against cluttered backgrounds but at least for the initial step, the orange rotating diamond seems to work very well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne additional thought: what (if anything) shows if the targeted docking port is obscured?
