Have you seen all the ones on Spaceport? I am just going off the statistics on the poll here and on Spaceport - the bottom line, people don\u0027t really care for Star Wars ships in KSP and the numbers speak for themselves. That and the fact none of them work in the latest version of KSP might be something too. Nothing worse than relying on a plugin thats not updated, I don\u0027t know many people still using 0.18 anymore.Now, Star Trek perhaps, but the game doesn\u0027t really support those kinds of physics, so you might as well go play STO if you want to fly Enterprises. I want to spend 100 hours making a mod people enjoy and can expand on, not one that\u0027s a 5 minute fly-by ripped mesh that will provide all of 5 seconds of fun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sirkut","CreatedById":57229,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-06T11:27:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t bother trying those models out because they didn\u0027t even have sound and zero iva!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KhaosCorp","CreatedById":61149,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-06T12:52:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Knight123\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Knight123\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou should finish those ships pyrate ripped they are all made for .18 and in any new versions they explode on contact with anything including ground and its own parts\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eewww, no.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethose ships should be deleted, and never used or worked on by anyone. imho squad should take away that guys ability to post on spaceport....its just clutter.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-06T13:16:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERefreshing to see I\u0027m not the only one who feels this way. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Devo","CreatedById":22750,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-06T14:14:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ehmm seems the pyrate has dampened the mood in here again.... time to liven it up!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehere has some candy...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese are a work in progress but I don\u0027t mind giving people new stuff to try out, just dont break them and send it back to me...

At around 10-12k meters throttle back just a tiny bit (should be at about 85% throttle or so) and pitch nose DOWN by no more than 5degrees. At around 20-25k meters light the rear main engine up and burn hard, this will start to give you that gravity turn arc to your path, though not as pronounced as in a rocket. at 32k meters or so start pitching your nose down more and more, slowly as ya go up...with the thrust value on the rear engines once you light them you wont kill them till circulized.

The cockpit is made up of 100 parts in the model. Now, It\u0027s still a cockpit, and its still looks like 1 piece to most people, but usually that is made up of many pieces, many objects and unless you actually join parts of your mesh to cut down in the \u0027internal\u0027 part count, it will still have the same laggy result. So if I made the dropship one piece, and had all the animations in one right click menu, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyou would find its actually worse, as all the parts would still be combined into \u002Bone model, and loading the single piece dropship would feel very laggy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWelll Part tools .20 came out so i guess im gonna be really busy this weekend!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-07T23:17:17Z\u0022 title=\u002206/07/2013 11:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 7, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Devo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Devo","CreatedById":22750,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-08T01:14:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnyone wanna take these for a spin? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.devogeninteractive.com/picup/image.php?id=0A3A_51B28534\u0026amp;jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022image.php?id=0A3A_51B28534\u0026amp;jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WCOLE360","CreatedById":57227,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-08T01:26:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI do, lol.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KhaosCorp","CreatedById":61149,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-08T01:30:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWOW!! those are awesome!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Enow im gonna have to build a monster truck course it seems!!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Devo","CreatedById":22750,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-08T01:43:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KhaosCorp\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KhaosCorp\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWOW!! those are awesome!\u003Cp\u003Enow im gonna have to build a monster truck course it seems!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust watch the potholes on Duna....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.devogeninteractive.com/picup/image.php?id=AD9D_51B28C61\u0026amp;jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022image.php?id=AD9D_51B28C61\u0026amp;jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KhaosCorp","CreatedById":61149,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-08T01:47:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyour little captions are awesome! makes the pictures so much better lol\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tommygun","CreatedById":41293,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-08T01:59:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI can just hear the announcers voice:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u0022SUNDAY, SUNDAY, SUNDAY.....JEDIDIAH KERMAN DESTROYING THE COMPETITION WITH THE GRAVE DIGGER.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EONE DAY ONLY AT THE ANAHEIM FAIRGROUNDS................BE THERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\u0022\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
