Your CPU does not use decimals, it uses a binary system (there are actually some specific binary\u0026lt;\u0026gt;decimal instructions but I digress). Performing lots of calculations is not a problem for processors and they will easily perform millions of them every second. All consumer processors have a dedicated FPU (Floating Point Unit) for dealing with floats and doubles and modern processors have additional SIMD instruction sets such as MMX/3DNow/SSE/SSE2/SSE3/SSE4 (see \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_SIMD_Extensions\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_SIMD_Extensions\u003C/a\u003E) which allows several (identical) calculations to be performed in parallel on the same core.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFloating point variables do actually have a limit on their precision, in which doubles have enhanced precision but there is still a limit. This is what many people call the Kraken, caused by accumulation of errors as KSP uses very large numbers which always have low precision and a large amount of error. The KSP team has been trying hard to get rid of the Kraken by warping the coordinate system when values become too high, this works because floats and doubles are originally meant to describe values in the range of 0.0 to 1.0. I personally think it would be better to use fixed point arithmetic by using two 64-bit fixed point values (64 bits for fraction, 64 bits for integer) which would kill off the Kraken entirely by allowing both really small and really huge values to be represented accurately. It does come with its own problems though such as making arithmetic more complicated and demanding.\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/N7yePKJlhgw?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E (3D astronomy program, official site seems to be down) for example uses this method to represent positions. You\u0027d still perform physics calculations with floating points of course, but in a local coordinate system.\u003Cp\u003EThe loss of performance in KSP in regards to physics is not so much due to floating points being used but rather the large amount of calculations being performed. Performing proper physics on a single object requires quite a few formulas to be resolved. More importantly, when several connected objects require physics to be applied (ships, stations, bases) the number of calculations explode nearly exponentially. Additionally collision detection must also be performed and in regards to KSP, forces must be calculated to so that parts will break/explode when too much force is applied.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy welding parts together you shortcut these calculations by having a single physics-enabled object with one large rigid collision mesh. Truthfully, I don\u0027t quite understand why this is not being done by KSP already. Ships should not sway and oscillate all over the place like they do now, If objects were to be made rigid and only breaking forces were to be calculated it would not only make the game most aesthetically pleasing, it would also make struts obsolete and improve performance dramatically.
