The craft turn and respond correctly but the animation is reversed. Is this related to KSP or FAR?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 - It would be great to be able to adjust the control range from -85 to \u002B85 degrees. Currently we are limited to -30.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3 - Sometimes the craft as a tendency to roll to the right. All controls are centered, SAS is disabled as well as all FAR control \u0022helpers\u0022. Seems to be related somehow to spoilers/flaps settings or to some types of parts combinations. On a particular case, jettisoning the two external tanks (which where balanced: both filled and symmetrically positioned on each wing underside) would \u0022magically\u0022 solve the problem.

If you put a light decoupler between two very heavy 3.75m tanks, you\u0027re going to get wobble. Physicsless parts are essentially skipped for joints; the joints are created between the parts attached to the physicsless part (i.e. tank-tank, rather than tank-decoupler-tank).
