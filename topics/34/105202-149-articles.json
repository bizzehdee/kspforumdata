Maybe they could be \u0022buffed\u0022 a bit on the hab home times ?   IE if I\u0027m a kerbal colonist recruited, I\u0027m probably not looking to make a return to kerbin??

So you colony needs some time to get established before anyone starts feeling at home. Once you\u0027ve sent all the whiners home and brought in some new blood a strong community will take hold. Eventualy they\u0027ll rebel, throw away their hab timer chips and call themselves Dunians. (Once you get your kolonisation bonus up to 500% home timers will become irrelevant as long as they have at least 1 year hab time)"},{"CreatedByName":"TheRagingIrishman","CreatedById":165004,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-21T08:39:22Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 4 hours ago, Motokid600 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Is there a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E patch to incorporate supplies into stock command modules or any other by chance?\n\u003E \n\nI stole this from the sig of one of the mods (I think it was [@monstah](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/95210-monstah/)) but it has since been removed from their sig so impossible to find out who deserves credit.
