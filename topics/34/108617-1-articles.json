This sort of defeats the purpose of betterburntime.   \n\nSo I think this mod would be almost a solution. It currently does not work in 1.3.1, though the action groups are visible in editor. It would need to have a slightly different behavior too, the rather then setting the throttle to different points, it would be best if there was an action group for toggling the maxThrust to 0 and back. I\u0027m not sure, but I think the setLimit only affects the throttle position, and I need to have the actual thrust stop when the user desires (normally you would just zero your throttle, but when the minThrust is set to something other than 0 the engines keep firing at that minThrust value with the throttle at 0)\n\nHailing [@linuxgurugamer](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/129964-linuxgurugamer/); you had mentioned interest in pursuing a solution for this, perhaps something here is useful.   \n\nHere is a sample of my mm code so far:  \n\n    @PART[liquidEngine]\n    {@description ^= :(.)$:$0 Shallow throttle, minimum thrust down to 80% of maxThrust.:@MODULE[ModuleEngines*]{\t@minThrust = #$maxThrust$\t@minThrust *= 0.8}\n    }"},{"CreatedByName":"linuxgurugamer","CreatedById":129964,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-24T22:59:49Z","Content":"Easy enough to get this recompiled.\n\nHowever, I was thinking more of intercepting the engine shutdown key so that the throttle Keys would increase and decrease the throttle within the specified ranges, and the shutdown key would actually turn it off and set the limit to zero.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-12-25T07:27:05Z\u0022 title=\u002212/25/2017 07:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 25, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by linuxgurugamer**"},{"CreatedByName":"Errol","CreatedById":118622,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-24T23:04:46Z","Content":"If you can do that without too much difficulty, great, sounds good.
