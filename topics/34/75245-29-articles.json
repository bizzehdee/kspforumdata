So far I have seen a few posts about it on this forum, as well as the bug report forum on Github. However, no one has been able to answer definitively as to whether there is a fix, or explanation as to the root of this issue. I know for me it works fine in x32, but not in x64. 1st world problem I know, but it would be really nice to be able to use this mod on x64. I have tried 1.4.0, build-develop-32, and RC 1.4.1, all of them have the same issue on my x64 game. I have tried it with zero mods, and with a bunch of mods, all the same result.

You need to add an SPU module to the part (see the probe configs in the RT2 folder for examples).
