I\\\u0027ve made a very capable 2 stage to Mun 2m spacecraft with it and KW PLF mod. Five M-50s, 4 small 2m tanks, 3 large 2m tanks and 1 of my \u003Cem\u003ECentaur\u003C/em\u003E Command and Utility modules can easily do orbital exploration anywhere in Kerbin/Mun\\\u0027s SoI. I could launch a Centaur into an orbit synchronised with the Mun if I wanted to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did a little bit of calculating on the FWR of the 2m tanks and found it was more efficient than that of the stock tanks - 1:300 as opposed to 1:200. I suppose there\\\u0027s a good reason for this, but it made me wonder if the pack was balanced considering just how easily I designed a Munar rocket (2nd design with the 0.8a version worked out fine with some Decoupler tweaking.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact, the decoupler story is interesting. I spent about an hour launching my Skypiercer 1C (then SP-x01) rocket and wondering why I lost control of the engines on the core stage at drop tank decoupling. To give you an idea of the context, the Stage I of SP-x01 was a small 2m tank with a large one below it and two M-50 engines on a 2m-2x1 plate. Radially attached on the decoupler struts were two identical setups except with one M-50. Fuel lines meant that the core stage drained the outer stages and was still full at drop tank burnout @~50km. However despite this seemingly huge success, I found myself pulling my hair out when the engines seemed to stop listening to my input when the drop tanks were gone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter I had gone to the barber\\\u0027s to get my hair sorted out, I noticed the drop tanks, which were considerably heavier than your conventional boostars (and a LOT more efficient), were bumping the large fuel tank on their way out. Eventually after much Kerbal testing (doing it again to see if it fails again) I checked the logs and found the large tank was being smashed off the rocket by the dropping stages and locking the engines on their current throttle: 100% in this launch profile. That glued the rocket together and gave me no control over it. I tried retro boosters on the drop tanks but they still listed into the rocket. Some time later I gave up grafting. I modded the Decoupler Strut to have ejectionForce = 1 and now SP-1C is my favourite launcher of all time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough frustrating, the described episode was rather entertaining, a true Kerbal trial-and-error job at 50km.

I\\\u0027ll post some screenshots soon of my two rockets, including the one with the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I said I pinned down the problem, but I was wondering if it was intended; the decoupler strut puts a significant amount of torque on the stage it\\\u0027s decoupling, which can lead to it smashing into the rocket, with disastrous effects. Turning down the ejectionForce seemed to do the trick but, if possible, tweaking the direction the decoupler fires would be good.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tiberion","CreatedById":8356,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-01-09T00:21:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewell those are heavy decouplers, meant for BIG things to be decoupled, so if you are ejecting smallish things it can be pretty powerful. I didnt think it was suppose to apply any force to the main ship, just what is being decoupled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027ll note it and see if it can be tweaked, but I don\\\u0027t wanna break their usefulness on big stages.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Volt","CreatedById":4686,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-01-09T00:45:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETrue, I suppose, but my problem wasn\\\u0027t really with the force of decoupling.
