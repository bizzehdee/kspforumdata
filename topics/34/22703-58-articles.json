Now I can reliably land the Eagle almost anywhere. But I\u0027ll readily admit I would almost never dare doing so with manual throttle control. Mechjeb\u0027s translation and KEEPVERT is my best friend in the world. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s my procedure for landing: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore about 10,000 meter altitude you can make your descent speed and angle at about any speed that\u0027s appropriate for the world you\u0027re coming in to land on. If landing on a vacuum world, I\u0027d recommend orienting using Mechjeb to Retrograde and standing on the Eagle\u0027s tail until final approach. On worlds with atmosphere, you can aerobrake and turn off the rear engines and set up the VTOL engines for maneuvering. I\u0027ll often point pro-grade using Mechjeb and then take note of my heading and then set up SURF with that same heading and anywhere from a 45 degree to flat pitch depending on my angle of descent. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I\u0027ll do on approach from about 10-12,000 meter altitude is set the KEEPVERT number to -100 M/S down to about the 3000 meter level (just to be clear - dropping at 100 meters per second).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore I get to 3000 ALT I\u0027ll have typed in -75 in the KEEPVERT and then hit execute when passing 3000 Meter altitude. Important note - that\u0027s 3000 meters ON THE RADAR. Keep a Kerbal\u0027s eye on the IVA for the Radar gauge and flip back and forth. When the analog needle first dips to indicate the radar has got a lock on the ground - that\u0027s when you hit \u0022Execute\u0022 for your slowdown to -75. Immediately set up -50 on the KEEPVERT and wait for 1000 on the altimeter on the IVA. Then execute and set up for -25 and hit that at about 500 meters altitude. Then quickly set up for -10 and when you hit about 200 meters hit execute. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen set up a -1 meter per second on the KEEPVERT and wait until you\u0027re between 50 and 20 meters altitude. By this point you should be able to mostly judge your surroundings on the outside view. If things look dicey (such as maybe you look like you\u0027re landing on a steep incline), hit the execute for the -1 on the KEEPVERT and \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Eimmediately\u003C/span\u003E type in \u002200\u0022 and hit Execute again to hold altitude and use either your RCS/Roll/Pitch controls or your main engine to push you around and look for a better landing spot. (Alternately, you may want to do that in reverse - set up the \u0022hold altitude\u0022 to check your landing spot first and THEN when it looks good, go back to descending on -1 on the KEEPVERT)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf things look okay, just hit the execute for the -1 and use RCS to kill as much horizontal speed as possible. Note that the Eagle may want to pitch in opposition response to RCS used near the ground and it may make more sense just to use the Pitch and roll to maneuver. In either case - a very light touch on the controls is best. Try to do quick bursts on the RCS (Or pitch/roll) only. You may also want to switch to fine controls. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-1 on the KEEPVERT is safe vertical landing speed. But on Kerbin and other higher gravity worlds, I sometimes like to type in \u0022-0.5\u0022 for an even softer touchdown. Best judgement of course. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother note - it\u0027s always good to \u0022cycle\u0022 the gear shortly before touchdown. There\u0027s a \u0022landing gear bug\u0022 that likes to make the Eagle\u0027s landing gear pods splay out and go screwy sometimes and make the Eagle try and \u0022skitter\u0022 across the ground until it breaks something. Hit \u0022G\u0022 twice to bring the gear up and then back down sometime during the landing sequence. I do it at around the 100 meter altitude level myself. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope that helps!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Logan.Darklighter","CreatedById":7375,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-12T07:45:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022brandotherhymer\u0022 data-cite=\u0022brandotherhymer\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI don\u0027t know why my game was doing that, but i edited both parts out and threw on some new lights and MJ2 box.

The way I had mounted the thrusters before was adequate for VTOL operations. But it was off of the COG enough that it made the ship roll too much. And in orbit/zero-g this made it very hard to dock with anything. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I took a close look at where the most common Center of Gravity was for the Eagle. It changes a bit with different load-outs, but I found what I thought was a \u0022sweet spot\u0022 and did some more testing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe end result is that instead of mounting 4 RCS blocks tucked behind the truss on the sides, I was able to reduce it to 2 RCS blocks - 1 fore and 1 aft. Clipped into the top of the body. You can see below where they are (the small squares on the \u0022roof\u0022 of the fore and aft part of the main truss tank).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Vh6pRm1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Vh6pRm1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis change does two positive things - it makes for steady side-to-side translation with minimal roll, and it reduces the part count since I could get rid of the redundant RCS blocks. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn regards to further reducing part and mod count, I reduced the amount of struts I was using and used standard Squad struts instead of going overboard with the tougher and weightier B9 struts. Turns out not to have compromised the structural integrity at all. Apparently I was \u0022over-building\u0022. Overall I managed to reduce part count there as well. I love the B9 mod, but I try to use it sparingly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I don\u0027t use sparingly of course is the LLL parts. They make up the majority of the pod designs. Probably the most popular pod is going to be the passenger pod since that\u0027s close to the original show. I asked Lack if it was possible to create a single part pod that could replace the multi-part version that I was using before. He not only said yes, he did it himself. And I\u0027ve included it in my new mod pack above and in the craft file. It REALLY helps reduce the part count. I was using around 15 parts before to make those pods. Now it\u0027s down to 7-8 and the overall part count on a passenger Eagle is around 35. Down from nearly 50 before. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t remember if I did this on this version or the last one, but there was a slight tweak to the design of the Kethane pod. I put the crew hatches up near the front, gave them ladders for easier access, and added an extra set of solar panels. Also - I moved 2 of the 3 RTGs that this Eagle was using from the Eagle itself to the pod. That means the pod if it\u0027s dropped on its own somewhere is much better able to power itself. It has a total of 3 RTGs and 6 solar panels, with a pair of extra solar panels in the KAS boxes just in case they\u0027re needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly - here\u0027s that new pod I mentioned above: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NGwsHxP.png\u0022 alt=\u0022NGwsHxP.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vRUA5U9.png\u0022 alt=\u0022vRUA5U9.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are 4 of the SCANSAT style mapping probes on this carrier. They are self-powered with solar panels batteries, xenon tanks and Ion Engines for tweaking of orbits. They also have comm-dishes in case you want to use something like Remote-Tech. And if needed, they can re-dock with the Eagle. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImagine sending a pair of Eagles out to Jool. One could be the Kethane prospector, the other could be this one. The Kethane Eagle could keep itself, the second Eagle and even the probes topped off with fuel for an extended survey of the entire Jool moon system. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo there you go. Test and see what you think! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly - I want to talk about quantum struts. I tried to refrain from using them before because they seemed a bit of a \u0022cheat\u0022. But after banging my head on the \u0022Drop and pick up\u0022 problem all this time I decided to give in and try it out. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOH. MY. GOD. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4 Quantum struts placed on the truss bar and pointed straight down makes the pods totally stable - AND you can (with some deft piloting) dock with one and pick it up again and it won\u0027t fall off of one end or the other! It\u0027ll actually re-dock perfectly straight! And they can be placed very unobtrusively with hardly any of the \u0022beam\u0022 showing at all. Just the tiniest pinprick of light between the quantum strut part and the pod that\u0027s easily ignored. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t put quantum struts in my mod pack above. But if you want to use the Eagle for moving stuff around? SERIOUSLY consider getting the Quantum strut mod! It\u0027ll absolutely complete the Eagle experience! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell that\u0027s it for now. The next pod I design I think I\u0027m going to try for the classic winch pod.
