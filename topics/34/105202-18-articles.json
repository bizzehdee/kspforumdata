Most LS mods are set to dump waste products if there is no storage for them. After all why store the waste if you have no way to recycle it anyway? Its just extra mass on the rocket.\n\nAnd I agree with the 99% complete.

But you had quite a long and interesting list of things suggested. And the below is nothing negative or personal just my thoughts ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nWhile you certainly have some great and interesting ideas there, and of course everything up to Roverdude as far as what is implemented, I\u0027m going to have to vote against the stress implementation you brought up. Nothing against you or the concept, I just don\u0027t agree with it or think it really fits with this mods intended concept. From what I understand about ROverdudes explanation and implementation, In reality this life support is sort of intended to be a bit of a life support light. Not as limited as snacks is, but not as involved as TAC.\n\nTo me these ideas kind of start to make it more involved than TAC somewhat and kind of moves away from the whole \u0022light\u0022 life support it seemed to be. I also think the amount of work is too much, and taking too much time away from what seems to be the intended concept of this mod being created. You mentioned \u0022simplicity\u0022 then \u0022uncluttering simplified life support\u0022 not sure what you mean but this mod is simplified, that was the whole intent of this mod I thought. And simplicity itself tends to be uncluttered. I believe your stress aspect just starts to add clutter and less simplicity back into this mod.\n\nAs I understand it a big reasons why you brought up the stress was to prevent \u0022gaming the system\u0022 and starving kerbals. So I could see a function to maybe make kerbals require a bit of a recuperation period after starvation would be a much better and more acceptable way to fix the exploration opportunities that are there. But the reason I don\u0027t like the whole stress idea is that I really don\u0027t see it adding much more than headaches and such to the whole life support process, since it now seems you have a whole other resource that\u0027s not even tracked in a sense. And it also seems to overlap many functions of USI LS already in place.\n\nEC is already accounted for and causes supplies lost, if you want you can blame that on stress already and kerbals doing rash things resulting in the loss of supplies. \n\nOrange suits not striking doesnt need a \u0022sane explanation\u0022 neither does the kerbin safe zone. This is a game first and foremost. And a realistic simulation only in passing really. Orange suits are special, rationalize it however you want, but the non striking was a pretty conscious design decision and I don\u0027t see the need for any kind of explanation beyond what was given. The safe zone arises probably more due to the fact we only deal with \u0022supplies\u0022 and not 3 resources. Because on kerbin in the safe zone there is plenty of opportunities for breathable air. Also there are only 4? Orange suits. So they are limited and it also offers a bit of a helpful way for newer people to learn the ropes, as well as a couple kerbals to hold in reserve for rescue ops. \n\nMaking hungry and starving kerbals build up stress faster, then striking sooner because of it basically negates the whole starving mechanic, or is the whole starving mechanic really your whole stress idea being implemented in an easier more trackable function that can be controlled and dealt with better? Seems like it to me. \n\nThere are already severe consequences available as well, death is an option, as well as nothing really more severe than having a ghost ship of kerbals just floating around or away somewhere because they are all on strike or even worse dead. I don\u0027t see the need or any kind of realism being added by having them randomly activate or deactivate anything on a ship or bases. I don\u0027t see what this \u0022adds\u0022 to the whole concept of this mod.\n\nI know kerbals are all somewhat stupid if you will, and rush to space in junk and love explosions, but I really don\u0027t see how not eating adds stress, but my spaceship and sole protection falling apart around me is great and fun. I understand kerbals like explosions and all that, but why add stress and then not have them stressed out by their craft falling to pieces around them on reentry and such? Seems you wanted sane reasons for things and more realism in a way, but this seems counter to that. Also you really didn\u0027t add anything to help alleviate stress. I mean shouldn\u0027t there be a way to alleviate it other than supplies? There is already a use and penalty to supplies. \n\ndont take this as anything personal. You have some great ideas as I said. These are Just my feelings on the ideas brought up. But I do think that if people like this concept and want a hardcore mode and these things to deal with, that It eould make a great standalone mod that could integrate with any life support mod available. I think it would be much better as a separate mod though. And in reality if it\u0027s a hardcore mode, it really does become a separate mod in a sense anyways. I feel it\u0027s best served on it\u0027s own and allow the two mods to be tweaked and managed independently. \n\nIf Roverdude does feel like adding such things to this mod then I would absolutely ask that the whole stress part be completely optional as I do not want this at all. There is already enough micromanaging going on as far as multiple crafts, maneuver points and rendezvous windows, as well as mks bases if people use it like me. I don\u0027t really see any fun or addition to gameplay personally by now having to constantly check on my crews. \n\nI do think there should be some sort of recuperation period as far as starved kerbals though. Maybe a day or something to let them eat and get some strength back, that certainly solves a few of the issues as to why you seemed to want the stress thing and I think it\u0027s good to have a bit of a way to prevent kerbal torture and \u0022gaming the system\u0022 as I said earlier. \n\nAgain just my thoughts. If this stress idea was implemented as mandatory it would certainly make me revalute my use of this mod. Which I really like in it\u0027s current form. It could use some tweakings for sure. And I don\u0027t mean that to stop anything from being implemented, it just means I\u0027d have to find another mod or forget life support . But I kind of like this mods in it\u0027s sort of serious yet light hearted take on the whole life support gameplay. And I\u0027d hate to see this feature take away time from this an his other mods. As I don\u0027t see it adding much, and not sure many that use this particular life support would want it either. As it\u0027s meant to be a less involved life support mod. But Maybe many do want this, idk.\n\nAnd again sorry for the long post to any who try to read it all lol.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-15T20:20:54Z\u0022 title=\u002205/15/2015 08:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Hevak**"},{"CreatedByName":"Vorg","CreatedById":74652,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T20:16:13Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Are there any other parts that can hold NOMS?\n\nThe 4x mount from Universal storage looks like it works well holding 4 of the little green houses."},{"CreatedByName":"prog","CreatedById":139695,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T20:46:02Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \u0022uncluttering simplified life support\u0022\n\nSorry but I did not say that.

So, what really differs then so much that you may stop using this mod if such thing will be ever implemented, except some decorative things and less tolerance to prolonged starvation?\n\u003E \n\u003E Looks like that\u0027s you who took this small \u0022pack of ideas to think about in a free time\u0022 as personal insult.\n\ni took nothing as an insult, maybe you took my disagreement with your ideas as not part of what seems to be the purpose of this life supports intent as an insult. \n\nAnd copied directly from your write up..\n\nHardcore mode is meant to be used by players who want both simplicity and **uncluttering of simplified life support** and more challenging gameplay at the same time.\n\ni just personally as I said don\u0027t see it adding much to the gameplay of using this mod. Maybe you and others would love to have this and see it adding to gameplay. And like I said I could see this as a great stand alone mod that could easily integrate with any other life support mod, or even run on it\u0027s own.\n\nbut please forgive me for disagreeing with your ideas, and having my own as you do, and feeling I\u0027m insulted in anyway.\n\nalso by the way, this is not the first time this idea has been brought up in life support discussions. Even within TAC. And I believe there is a life support or other mod that does deal with stress or stress like variables as well, or else there was at one time. It just feels better suited to it\u0027s own mod that can integrate with them.\n\nEdited: also if nothing really changes as you state above then why add stress at all? It\u0027s just clutter then is it not? And again you mention prolonged starvation. Easily solved by a recuperation period, and not adding a stress mechanic which in the game sense becomes a resource. As it build and dissipates over time due to whatever constraints. Just like a resource. And most likely would be coded similar to a resource.\n\nAnd really the only thing that could be taken as an insult is you saying I\u0027m insulted and basically alluding to the fact that you can post your ideas for this mod, and someone can\u0027t post a disagreement to them, otherwise they are just insulted. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nthis is is a forum and a game that has 1,000s upon 1,000s of mods probably. So yeah I\u0027m not insulted by your ideas. I just don\u0027t agree with them fitting in this mod or my gameplay as well. And as I\u0027ve done many times I would decide on what mods I use based on that. Not because the modder or their ides or work Insults me lol. Just because I want different things in my gameplay as do you.\n\nwhen Roverdude first brought up the idea and concept of his Life support I disagreed with him too. We had a few posts back and forth, he explained and listened to mine and others ideas, I liked what he said and thought. He didn\u0027t feel I was insulted in any way lol. Why should you? Still wasn\u0027t sure I\u0027d like this mod until I tried it. I was completely civil and just posted my ideas contrary to yours. That\u0027s how things happen. We disagree that\u0027s life.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-15T21:31:57Z\u0022 title=\u002205/15/2015 09:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Hevak**"}]}
