Yeah, I think having access to the part prefab or the specific module within would be a minimum to make it useful in that context, and should still keep things relatively simple given the user wouldn\u0027t have to deal with parsing proto snapshots or worrying about the limited and sometimes dodgy initialization state of stuff within a background vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe context I was going to use it in for example was that I have replacement custom ModuleGenerators within my mod, once again to get around stock rounding errors in energy management. So, this essentially means that I have to handle my own background processing for them, but given they\u0027re just producing energy at a constant rate (defined in their .cfg file mind you), using GetBackgroundResource() seemed to be a better fit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGranted, it was super simple for me to just use FixedBackgroundUpdate() instead, especially given I had already written a bunch of helper functions for parsing background vessel data while working on the probe core stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpeaking of which, thought you might like to see this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/15BJ3dr.png\u0022 alt=\u002215BJ3dr.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProgress \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat one is mildly interesting in that I\u0027m actually modifying the damage state of the probe core within the part snapshot during a FixedBackgroundUpdate() and after running multiple tests, it appears that state is automatically successfully saved and loaded once the vessel becomes active again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERelevant code in case it\u0027s a useful reference to anyone:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E        public static void FixedBackgroundUpdate( Vessel vessel, uint uiPartFlightID, Func\u0026lt;Vessel, float, string, float\u0026gt; ResourceRequestFunc, ref System.Object customData )        \u003Cbr\u003E        {\u003Cbr\u003E            // Background Processing callback\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E            if ( customData != null )\u003Cbr\u003E            {\u003Cbr\u003E                BTSMModuleProbePowerBackgroundUpdateData probePowerCustomData = (BTSMModuleProbePowerBackgroundUpdateData)customData;\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E                if ( probePowerCustomData.m_bIsActive )\u003Cbr\u003E                {\u003Cbr\u003E                    float fResourceDesired = probePowerCustomData.m_fEnergyConsumedRate * TimeWarp.fixedDeltaTime;\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E                    float fResourceConsumed = ResourceRequestFunc( vessel, fResourceDesired, \u0022ElectricCharge\u0022 );\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E                    // Check energy consumed and damage probe core on lack of power if it\u0027s out for too long\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E                    if ( fResourceConsumed \u002B 0.01F * fResourceDesired \u0026lt; fResourceDesired )\u003Cbr\u003E                    {\u003Cbr\u003E                        probePowerCustomData.m_iOutOfResourceUpdateCount\u002B\u002B;\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E                        if ( probePowerCustomData.m_iOutOfResourceUpdateCount \u0026gt;= m_iNumOutOfEnergyUpdatesForDamage )\u003Cbr\u003E                        {\u003Cbr\u003E                            FixedBackgroundUpdateOnProbeCoreOutOfPower( vessel, uiPartFlightID, probePowerCustomData );\u003Cbr\u003E                        }\u003Cbr\u003E                    }\u003Cbr\u003E                    else\u003Cbr\u003E                    {\u003Cbr\u003E                        probePowerCustomData.m_iOutOfResourceUpdateCount = 0;\u003Cbr\u003E                    }\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E                }\u003Cbr\u003E            }\u003Cbr\u003E        }\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E        private static void FixedBackgroundUpdateOnProbeCoreOutOfPower( Vessel vessel, uint uiPartFlightID, BTSMModuleProbePowerBackgroundUpdateData probePowerCustomData )\u003Cbr\u003E        {\u003Cbr\u003E            // the core has been out of power for awhile.

If facing the sun and warping for a quarter orbit, it should then be on the left (using default orbital view). However, when performing that test, I found it was often behind the probe, or to it\u0027s right, or even still in front of it. NB: this is a stock game, without BP.
