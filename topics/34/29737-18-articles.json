A lot of people in fact. If you consider SSTO\u0027s as space planes, we have the Space Shuttle, Buran, SpaceShipOne, SpaceShipTwo and a few others.\u003Cp\u003EAs for 1Km/s, the Blackbird doesn\u0027t go even close to that, even though it holds the speed record for both altitude and fastest manned air breathing aircraft, with a speed of ~980.44 ms. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe North American X-15 is the fastest manned plane, with a top speed of 2 Km/s, but it uses rocket engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s also NASA\u0027s X-43A scramjet, that achieves speeds of a little above 3 Km/s, but they are unmanned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eso you named 4 planes, the buran, spaceship 1-2, the x-43 and the x-15.
