I\u0027ve spent a lot of time figuring it out and I think it\u0027s a really powerful system - I\u0027m using an Xbox 360 Controller so lots of possibilities with the multiple presets...I even managed to get Kerbals walking around with the controller which is really cool and impossible to do stock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like others here have had slowdown issues but I uninstalled completely and installed again through CKAN and it\u0027s been fine since.

I have them on Bumpers LB/RB and didn\u0027t like the way they responded using AFBW. They sort of respond slowly and looking at the guages, when I press RB for example, the marker begins to move slowly then picks up speed before hitting max, whereas other axis behaviours just go smoothly with consistent speed all the way to max if you see what I mean? Assigning bumpers through the stock options fixed this. Am I missing something in the AFBW options to change this behaviour?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Secondly I sorted all my presets on one save, exited and re-entered the game multiple times on the same save absolutely fine, but once going over to another save, all my presets had gone. Luckily I screenshotted the lot before exiting. Should the presets be persistent across saves? Surely they don\u0027t need to be done for each save?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther than these niggles (especially the second one) I would love to see this mod continue, add more buttons for things like the LIN/ROT switch in docking mode, the vessel switch, and iron out remaining bugs, keep it up man.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Triscus","CreatedById":134672,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-16T16:03:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethank you for making this mod, without this I wouldn\u0027t be able to play it with my new joystick, but:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DeadDerezzer\u0022 data-cite=\u0022DeadDerezzer\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...all my presets had gone...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a similar issue here, the config preset (advanced_flybywire_config_v21.xml) is overwritten with default file.

I need trim absolute, just like pitch, but less powerful (10-20% of normal pitch). I need it to use with my Saitek X45 witch has rotary switch exactly for this purpose. It is a little wheel witch can go in \u002B or -, and stays there; doesn\u0027t jump back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Triscus","CreatedById":134672,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-19T21:37:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Vectura\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Vectura\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI tried that UJR application with vjoy and it only recognised the roll axis, none of the others.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn UJR you have to guess the ID of the controller and the axes, also be sure to enable all your existing physical axes when you create the vjoy device.
