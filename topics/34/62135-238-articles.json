I\u0027ve watched a ton of the iKerbal STS mission, (badass btw) and Helldivers launch and landing videos, however the issue I\u0027m having is too much fuel. My LRBS don\u0027t run out to about 25,000m at the 15 degrees. I\u0027m getting a 150k\u002B Ap before I even jettison the LRBS. Ok, so thats not so much the problem, its losing the EFT. I can make my circulation burn with a 3rd of the EFT to spare, I\u0027m in orbit so fast that if I dump the tank, even before its empty, I\u0027m afraid I\u0027ll leave it in orbit. Can anyone clarify? I have MechJeb2 also, however I\u0027m still a bit puzzled as to its controls. I have Deadly Reentry and Ferram\u0027s Aerospace Research mods, which I know may effect certain dynamics, however it didn\u0027t seem to be much from watching videos of other people with the same setup.

Everything handles differently. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESide question; In an effort to create a more realistic launches I use about 3 FASA Launch Towers on my stack, the Cool Rockets mod, and I start and throttle up the KSO Main engines, as soon as they hit 100 the LRBS go and the tower releases. A little laggy but the way the game handles FPS drops is pretty smooth. It actually starts like a real shuttle launch, kinda\u0027 slow to clear the tower and then bang! Anywho, my launches have seemed to get progressively laggier.

I can make my circulation burn with a 3rd of the EFT to spare, I\u0027m in orbit so fast that if I dump the tank, even before its empty, I\u0027m afraid I\u0027ll leave it in orbit. Can anyone clarify? I have MechJeb2 also, however I\u0027m still a bit puzzled as to its controls. I have Deadly Reentry and Ferram\u0027s Aerospace Research mods, which I know may effect certain dynamics, however it didn\u0027t seem to be much from watching videos of other people with the same setup. Namely iKerbals STS program. (Around 25-35,000m is where Deadly Reentry effects start/stop.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo answer any questions about this, we\u0027d have to know more about your ascent profile. But seeing as you use FAR its likely that the more realistic aerodynamics are affecting how the stack flies on ascent. For reference, the KSOS was not meant to fly in FAR, and without FAR, on my MechJeb-assisted launches with my Energia booster (a few of which you can see in my sig), I get to orbit (100km x 100km) with around 1000lbs of fuel in my ET. I would imagine that the stock standard KSO EWBCL gets there with less, but its been a while since Ive flown the Block 4 standard. And even longer since Ive flown the Block 9 KSO, and the KSO was on a razor thin margin of error when I flew it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RandyRawgust\u0022 data-cite=\u0022RandyRawgust\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESide question; In an effort to create a more realistic launches I use about 3 FASA Launch Towers on my stack, the Cool Rockets mod, and I start and throttle up the KSO Main engines, as soon as they hit 100 the LRBS go and the tower releases. A little laggy but the way the game handles FPS drops is pretty smooth. It actually starts like a real shuttle launch, kinda\u0027 slow to clear the tower and then bang! Anywho, my launches have seemed to get progressively laggier. Curious if this is a game issue or just my CPU acting up.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELikely just KSP being dumb, could also be CoolRockets or any number of things being weird.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RandyRawgust\u0022 data-cite=\u0022RandyRawgust\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBTW, I read something a few pages back in this thread about no longer needing ATM?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EATM, AFAIK, is still required.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RandyRawgust","CreatedById":138402,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T12:05:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat more data do you need?
