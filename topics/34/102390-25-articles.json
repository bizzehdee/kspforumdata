This is what the FAQ says: \n\n- The Vessel type must be Station. This is the one people usually struggle with. Right click your command part and click \u0022Rename Vessel\u0022, then select Station. This is VERY important to make other missions generate. Keep your vessel as a station, even if the game tries to change it.\n\nWas this written in an earlier version of the game or something? I have tried to do this but I don\u0027t seem to have the option. Right clicking any command pod never gives me the option to rename my vessel. This is clearly the problem; using KER\u0027s rendezvous mechanic, it lets you chose different targets to potential rendezvous with. It does this by letting you chose which type of category you\u0027re looking for, whether it\u0027s a celestial body, a probe, a lander, a station, etc. The space station I just made for this contract is, like all other vessels that I seem to make that are manned missions, considered a \u0027ship\u0027 and not a \u0027station\u0027. This is of course confirmed when I look at the contract and see that this is the only part of the contract that isn\u0027t fulfilled.\n\nWhat am I doing wrong, and how exactly do you access this \u0027rename vessel\u0027 feature?\n\n**Edit**: I just solved my own problem by trying to find the answer outside of this thread/these forums. I don\u0027t know how you\u0027re supposed to rename the vessel to begin with, but I discovered you can rename it, and more importantly, reclassify the type of vessel that it is, after you have launched it in the tracking station. For anyone with this same problem, go to the tracking station, select your vessel, click the \u0027I\u0027 button (info), and click where the name of your station is. A window should popup allowing you to rename the ship and reclassify what type of vessel it is.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/36puah/psa_you_can_rename_and_reclassify_shipsdebris/](https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/36puah/psa_you_can_rename_and_reclassify_shipsdebris/)\n\nEdit2: Rename vessel is only found in-flight apparently?
