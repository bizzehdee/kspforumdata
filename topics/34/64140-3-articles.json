I will do more testing, but I do suggest increasing the volume or the Isp of the SRB at the moment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT 2: After a clean install, purely stock\u002Bprocedural parts, A procedural SRB of the same \u003Cstrong\u003Esize\u003C/strong\u003E as an RT-10 will run out of fuel ~3 seconds earlier than, while a procedural SRB with the same \u003Cstrong\u003Efuel\u003C/strong\u003E will cut off at the same point, but weighs 0.04t (very close, well done on that count) but is 0.725m (~27%) longer, which isn\u0027t \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E far off, but probably what triggered my underpowered reaction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT 3: The BACC edition. Firstly, three unrelated bugs I have discovered in my testing. A) With SAS on or off, and with gimbal on or off, a ship that is just Procedural SRB\u002BPayload will wobble around, while a stock SRB\u002BPayload rocket will stay perfectly straight SAS on or off. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E on occasion, if not using launch clamps, a stretched tank will occasionally spawn part way through the launch pad, and will promptly explode when the physics kicks in. IIRC stretchy tanks also had this issue, although I believe that was fixed somehow. C) I can now only change the SRB thrust tweakable in the hundreds using the \u0026lt;\u0026lt; or \u0026gt;\u0026gt; buttons, as the smaller ones do nothing, and the slider just always resets to the lower hundred.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, back to the BACC. So oddly enough a procedural SRB the size of the RT-10 will have about 20% less fuel than its stock counterpart, but when comparing the procedural SRB to the BACC, the procedural SRB has \u0026gt;30% \u003Cstrong\u003Emore\u003C/strong\u003E fuel. In flight testing, the procedural SRB (with a slightly lower thrust, 300-315) outperformed the stock SRB of the same \u003Cstrong\u003Esize\u003C/strong\u003E by ~16s (47-63). A procedural SRB with the same fuel as the BACC is a massive 1.625m shorter, and (still with a lower thrust, so its actually underperforming) outperformed the BACC by about 1 second.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf this is helpful/important, I\u0027m happy to do more testing. Otherwise I\u0027ll probably still do it (It\u0027s surprisingly fun) I just wont clog the forum with it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for making this awesome mod, btw.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-11T13:28:10Z\u0022 title=\u002203/11/2014 01:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 11, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by OtherBarry\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DasBananenbrot","CreatedById":70900,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-11T19:46:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NathanKell\u0022 data-cite=\u0022NathanKell\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EGuess I wasn\u0027t clear. :]\u003Cp\u003EThis isn\u0027t a, this is *the* stretchy successor, i.e. Stretchy v9\u002B, with a broader name since it\u0027s diversifying, and spearheaded by swamp_ig who\u0027s doing amazing stuff (and way more/better than I was!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh didn\u0027t quite get that \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E I thought something like that but I wasn\u0027t sure.

Right now with Strechy Tanks you have duplicate tanks to handle different types such as cryo, ballon. Currently the tank models are solid shapes. What if we determine the tank type (cryo, etc) by the thickness of the tank. Instead of a solid cylinder for example we have a larger radius and smaller radius which allows use to hollow out the cylinder. This can also be applied to SAS, decouplers, and space station cores. In fact looking at the circular stack decouplers gave me the idea. They tend to be a thin wheel. Besides cylinders we can apply this to the other shapes as well. This also will allow really fine control of the weight of a fuel tank. Besides weight we could even model true shearing forces which would enable us to simulate true stress failure of the tank. Thicker tanks would be harder to flatten on impact. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry I haven\u0027t contributed code. I\u0027m a software engineer by trade but I never worked with C# before.
