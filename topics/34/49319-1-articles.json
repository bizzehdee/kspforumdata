By Providing new ways to generate science.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAswell as experimenting with new Device types.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nModInfo: (May be outdated now)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\n* = Notes\n# = Doesnt have Custom Model yet.\n\nScience:\n\tSkyLab: The SkyLab is a space station module you launch into space, that allows you to use resources to generate science.\n\t\tThe SkyLab requires special resources for its science experiments. *More experiments to come.\n\t\tEach experiment requires a differnt resource, The resources can be loaded directly in the lab. Or from a loaded\n\t\tscience container.\n\n\t\t*I might rework the SkyLab to automaticly store experiments, and have settings to auto complete experiments then transmit them.\n\n\tExternal Camera: The External Camera is a Experimental Science Device that allows you to take pictures of items ingame,And Gain Science from them. \n\t\tIt can also just take pictures for you to save to look at.\n\t\tThe Camera comes in two flavours. Digital and Film-Based. Digital Cameras don\u0027t require film to take pictures, and are\n\t\tgenerally lighter. The Film-Based camera\u0027s use film to take their pictures, and are generally heavier. *But when cost is factored in\n\t\tthey will also be cheaper.\n\t        The pictures are saved in the \u0022Modfolder/Plugins/PluginData/LtScience\u0022 folder.\n\n\tRadio Reciever: Just a generic Science experiment you can run. Nothing special just yet.\n\t\t*In the future I might rework it to run over time and have a chance to pick up signals.\n\n\t#Radiation Sensor: Just a generic Science experiment you can run. Nothing special just yet.\n\nUtility:\n\tStorage Container: The L-Tech Science container is a all around storage device.\n\t\tIt is capable of storing Experiment Resources for the skylab, and storing completed\n\t\texperiments for later processing.\n\n\t#Sample Return Bin: The Sample Return Bin is a light inline storage container, capable of storing experiments.\n\n\t#AirBrake: The L-Tech AirBrake is a experimental Technology thats in develpment.\n\t\tThe AirBrake is a deployable Panel, that acts like a parachute. Carefull though,\n\t\tthe AirBrake doesnt supply a sudden change in drag like a parachute opening. It \n\t\tRequires time to unfold entirely. 100% Reusable. \n\n\t\t*Changes will happen till its balanced and fills its own role.\n\t\t*Warning I havent tested with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E, as it can cause unwanted reactions.
