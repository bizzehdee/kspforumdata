I have to say, I\u0027m not nearly as deeply disappointed as I was prepared to be from what I\u0027d heard, but I feel like most of the changes made to FractalUK\u0027s original version aside from compatibility fixes and such are a rather significant step in the wrong direction. One of the things I like(d) most about KSPI is how insanely complex it could be with all its different systems, resources, and options, and I can\u0027t say in any capacity that taking out a good chunk of them improved anything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy initial test was just a cursory examination and I didn\u0027t have time to do anything major or in-depth, so if I\u0027m completely wrong about anything I\u0027m about to say, I\u0027m sorry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThings I found disappointing:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Reactor power changes. I admit that I\u0027m not a nuclear engineer and don\u0027t know what the real-world power outputs of antimatter or fusion power could potentially be, but I feel that the nerfs on fusion at least (antimatter is a different story since theoretical power output is pretty much limited only by reactor structure, as far as I know) were driven by an attempt to \u0027balance\u0027 the game, rather than make it more realistic. The same goes for the fission reactors, which now seem pretty intense for their sizes. You mentioned that you wanted people to use fission more, which I\u0027m a little puzzled by- If you can build fusion reactors that don\u0027t make dangerous waste and use far more common fuels, why would you bother building fission reactors? The answer, of course, is cost and reliability, but I have a hard time believing that fission reactors will ever be serious contenders as far as power-to-mass ratio goes when compared to fusion devices. I\u0027m going to overlook the changes made to the antimatter-initiated reactor, because I have no clue how that works in real life and am not sure where to find someone who does, so I suppose I\u0027ll just assume you do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m also not a huge fan of how all the numbers for core temperature, power output etc. are all rounded off to nice round numbers with a bunch of zeros. I realize Kerbals appear to have remarkable precision skills, but having a reactor with a running temperature of \u003Cem\u003Eexactly\u003C/em\u003E 4000 Kelvins is just not realistic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Removed resources: Where did helium-3 go? What about thorium? Both of those were completely viable methods of powering reactors in terms of physics, and offered interesting tradeoffs. Frankly, I don\u0027t see why removing them was necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Removed power generation options: I guess I\u0027m a bit unfamiliar with the exact mechanics of how charge particles worked, but it seemed sound enough. The lack of KTEC solid-state generators disappointed me a lot too- I realize we haven\u0027t made thermoelectric generators with the same efficiency as Brayton-cycle systems \u003Cem\u003Eyet\u003C/em\u003E, but I have a hard time believing that we \u003Cem\u003Enever\u003C/em\u003E will. If I wanted to be limited to only what\u0027s just around the corner, I would probably have gone with Near-Future Technologies instead of KSPI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Different types of reactors have different thrust and ISP tradeoffs: To my knowledge, the ISP and thrust of a thermal rocket engine both are dependent on the core temperature of the reactor, and thrust is also affected by how much fuel you can pump through the reactor in a given time interval without lowering its temperature too much. Therefore it would seem that bigger reactors should give you more thrust, but the same core temperature should always give you the same ISP. This is what I\u0027m pretty sure was happening in FractalUK\u0027s version, but hardly what I saw in this one with the molten salt/particle bed configurations. Correct me if I\u0027m wrong (as I\u0027m fully expecting to be) on this one, but this seems like yet another game-balance thing that has very little, if any, background in physics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s all that jumped out at me at first look, so I\u0027ll finish with what I loved about this new version:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Tweakscale integration: Yes, yes, yes! I am officially in love with this feature. It makes shipbuilding so much smoother now that parts have variable sizes, not to mention the fact that it opens up the possibility for adorably tiny versions of everything I\u0027ve been building so far, as well as the truly colossal behemoths that I\u0027ve tried to build in the past, only this time without the same ludicrous part counts. The game loaded quite a lot faster than I expected it to as well, and I imagine that this feature is at least partially responsible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Small inline refinery now has resource extractors: This is actually a feature I\u0027ve been editing into the configs of KSPI\u0027s older versions. I like to be able to melt ice and electrolize it into fuel without carrying around something the size of my house. It may take me some time to get used to the new model since my brain now associates that shape and texture with antimatter bottles, but I think it\u0027s definitely an improvement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Tritium is now tweakable: This is another feature I used to add myself. DT Vista engines and the tiny fusion reactors used to come with their own supplies, yet you weren\u0027t allowed to fill the bottles before launch. The new system is much more logical. I didn\u0027t actually check to see if tritium breeding from lithium was still in the game, but I heard it was removed; if so, this would seem to be another example of a feature that I would have liked to hang on to in any case.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Radiator buffs: I guess I like this. It does seem like radiative heat loss to the vacuum would be a pretty slow process, but I don\u0027t really know what the performance of graphene would be like at very high temperatures, and would imagine that it would be pretty good. I would still prefer realism over game balance, but if this is at all realistic, I welcome the opportunity to make bigger ships with fewer giant wings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall impressions: Had this been the first version of KSPI I\u0027d ever played, I would probably think very little of it. Having seen the older versions, however, I don\u0027t think I can really bond with the simplified and \u0027balanced\u0027 nature of this one. A lot of the new features are leaps and bounds better than their previous arrangements, but I feel like the majority of the fun I\u0027ve been having with this mod has either been nerfed a little overzealously or removed from the game outright. I realize that it\u0027s called \u0022KSPI Lite\u0022 but I\u0027m kind of scratching my head about why all the simplification was necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDid someone say that there was a pre-Lite version that works on .24? If so, where is it? I\u0027d kind of like to move back to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
