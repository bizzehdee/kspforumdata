But I\u0027m saying it anyways. I think it was KAS somehow. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had one strut connected between my two \u0022buildings\u0022, and after some other flying around in the solar system and timewarps needed as a result of that, I start up KSP again a day later and find that my base is now named \u0022Base Beta Debris\u0022 in stead of \u0022Base Beta\u0022 so I switch to my base, see that my landing gear on my buildings have \u0022sunk\u0022 into the ground, half a sec before it all explodes and is launched 19500 meters into space, falls down and is smashed to the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomehow I locked my evil eye on that auspicious fuel connector pipe that stayed connected throughout the ordeal. And my theory goes that some weird time warp effect made the strut connector into an effective \u0022Base Beta Vibrator\u0022 and thus my base wobbled itself into oblivion. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny other hypothesis?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECause this disaster made me not want to play KSP for a week.

I encountered it myself on my own M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnar base and had the same reaction as you. What\u0027s happening is what you described - parts spawn below the ground and turns everything into firework (at least a bit entertaining?).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe solution in your end is unfortunately to make your base somewhere else, which must be more flat. I chose a frozen lake on Minmus (not harder to get to as landings are way easier), and carefully placed one module at a time and saved furiously between trips.
