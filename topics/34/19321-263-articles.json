A 90 degree AoA means you are slamming into atmosphere like a brick, killing velocity too quickly and leading to instantaneous stall and aerodynamic failure when you start getting down into atmosphere.

To help with this, use an asymmetric capsule with the CoM above capsule centerline (a good way to do this is to have two RCS tanks, and shift all the RCS fuel to the upper one): instead of fighting reentry to keep your pitch, the reentry keeps your pitch for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt will also help to have a lighter-weight reentry vehicle. Larger vehicles will have a greater inertia/drag ratio, which means they will take longer to slow down and have a higher terminal velocity. If you\u0027re dead-set on reentering a monster of a craft, you may have to either use a stack of Sepratrons (or similar mod parts) to slow you down to 250 m/s, or use the 6.25m inflatable heatshields as impromptu drogues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Also, if you do it right, it\u0027s not hard to do a reentry from almost arbitrarily high speeds which is only mildly harder than one from low orbit: the trick is to set up a skip reentry, where you \u0022bounce\u0022 off periapsis and then start settling back down again, having shed most of your excess velocity in upper atmosphere. That requires finely tuning your periapsis to manage reentry path: I strongly suggest the Trajectories mod (make sure to set the AoA setting! It assumes you fly nose-first).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-04T23:12:39Z\u0022 title=\u002211/04/2014 11:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 4, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Starman4308\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lei07","CreatedById":110324,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-04T23:18:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks Starman!
