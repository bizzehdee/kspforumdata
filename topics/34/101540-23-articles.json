But I now see that it is \\*four times as massive\\* (!), at 0.4t to the Advanced Inline Stabilizer\u0027s 0.1t. Perhaps the extra 0.3t balances out the additional torque per electricity, but it\u0027d also be nice if decisions like these had some rationale rather than being at the mercy of tiny differences getting blown up by the squared/cubed law.  \n\nNot to say that I\u0027m blaming you!
