I don\u0027t know why, but they were. The problem is that they were not programmed properly and they constantly revert back to being tied to the \u0022brakes\u0022 group, which is why I built the fix.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a similar note, the air brakes extend when the brakes are activated by default. What I forgot about is that action groups might take a bit to get unlocked. So now I understand your question/concern/feedback. So yes, in the next update, I will change the default action group to function such that when brakes are applied, the airbrakes extend. And when brakes are turned off, airbrakes retract.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I still don\u0027t think that gets down to your other question. You\u0027re asking about the wheel brakes resetting (turning off) when getting back into a vessel. I see what you are saying, since the brakes were on while out of the vessel, why should they turn off when getting back in? I will also take a look at that.
