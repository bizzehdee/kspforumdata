Meaning that they take time, usually several seconds in the case of KW Rocketry engines, to spool up or down from zero to full power. There\u0027s an alternate config folder in the latest KW archive that lets you go back to having \u0027instant\u0027 response times for the engines, you might try that to see if it solves your problem. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T22:14:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Griffon XX is apparently the only one that gives MJ issues, for me at least.

What is a problem is that it\u0027s usually using a gimbaled engine for that sudden shift. And then it shuts the engine off because it finished fine tuning its apoapsis. So you have a sudden shift in angular momentum initiated by an engine that is now no longer available to finish the course change leaving you with only RCS and reaction wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomeone else asked that question not long ago and I\u0027ll repeat what I said then: I submitted some minor changes to Sarbian that were accepted and they eliminate MOST of what you\u0027re describing by having MJ continue following its flight plan instead of shifting orientation to prograde. And that works fairly well except that I missed that one spot during the fine tuning phase.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m testing another minor change and if it fixes it and doesn\u0027t screw anything up then I\u0027ll submit that one too.
