Oh well, the game seems smoother than 1.0.4 and it looks like a lot of mods while updating to 1.0.5 have improved. Orbital visuals seem much better, and a sunset at the KSP view?

It\u0027s still possible to get to the Mun and back on roughly the same amount of delta V as in stock if you leave at the right time. It\u0027s even possible to do a fly-by of the Mun and head straight back to Kerbin *nearly* (had to do about 90 m/s burn*)* free.\n\nOne thing I would suggest is to put a small and inexpensive transfer window probe in orbit, something you can test various escape trajectories with by plotting maneuver nodes without having a ship sitting up there for days."},{"CreatedByName":"Astraph","CreatedById":80902,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-12T08:29:59Z","Content":"Has anyone managed to get system rescaling mods work with NH in 1.05?
