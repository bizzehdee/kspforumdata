The fuel-switching module from CryoTanks has an addedMass variable defined, so the check in SMURFF.cfg line 1020 passes, but when SMURFF tries to grab that variable in line 1022, it looks in Tundra\u0027s fuel-switching patch (since it was added first), which does not have addedMass defined, and so the error occurs.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Since none of the other TE fuel tanks have RESOURCE blocks like TE\\_F9\\_S1\\_Tank does, I think that\u0027s an error on the part of tygoo7 and/or damonvv.

From a game perspective, 0.05% loss per hour is a half-life of 58 Earth days, so it\u0027s not going to be a concern for missions to the Moon or with cryogenic Earth escape stages.\n\nTo get true zero-boil-off storage, for long-duration missions or depots, yeah, you\u0027re going to have to invest in infrastructure.
