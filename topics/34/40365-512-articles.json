Second I\u0027d wonder why this matters. Yes you could charge the thing up with another ship and then push what amounts to a half ton battery pack around for 13 days but you could also strap a half million batteries to it (which as I recall are considered physicly insignificant and therfore massless). Admitedly the later option would probably kill a computer but it would have better dV. In almost every case where someone straps a KSPI generator to a craft they\u0027ve paired it to a reactor. At that point weather or not the storage capacity of the generator is OP for stock parts is irrelevant because the reactor/generator produces more EC than you could ever use with stock parts. If that 1 guy out of 100 players decides to think outside the box and use it as a giant capacitor... well who am I to say his idea of fun in a single player game is wrong?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso correct me if I\u0027m wrong but I coulda sworn the MJ\u0026gt;EC conversion was a 1 time thing at the moment of generation. When the power is generated it fills up the EC first then puts the rest into MJ but if you turn off the reactor and depleate the EC bar you\u0027ll just have an empty EC bar and a full MJ bar. Cant say I\u0027ve tested that in a while as the situation never came up but I thought that was how it worked.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Atrius129","CreatedById":107132,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-06T23:02:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022FreeThinker\u0022 data-cite=\u0022FreeThinker\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell Everything else that doesn\u0027t use MJ can still use it, making it behave as a 5.000.000 ElectricCharge battery.

If you\u0027re using TechManager to load the Interstellar tree, the upgrades should work the same way they did with TreeLoader. I\u0027m still a few chapters of the Illustrated Guide away from unlocking any upgrades, but when I get there I\u0027ll be able to test upgrades in a TechManager/Unofficial KSPI tree career in detail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpeaking of the Guide, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/FractalUK/KSPInterstellar/wiki/Illustrated-Guide-Chapter-1%3A-Heat-and-Radiators\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EChapter 1: Heat and Radiators\u003C/a\u003E is up if anyone wants to critique or revise.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
