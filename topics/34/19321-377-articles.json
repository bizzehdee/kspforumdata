It normaly uses a a BDynamics Vector jet (gimbal off) limited to 78.5% thrust for realistic performance and TWR. The real F-104 was limited to fly Mach 2 not because of it\u0027s aerodynamics (in theory it could have flown much faster), but because its engine\u0027s compressor wasn\u0027t up for it and overheated at around Mach 2.1! So there was a warning in the cockpit which lit up (the word: SLOW) to get the pilot to pull the throttle back, otherwise engine explosion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe basic jet engine is a bit too weak for the task (unrealisticly weak for my starfighter replica), I could barely touch Mach 1.968.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENOTE: This F-104 wasn\u0027t built for minimal wave drag but to be a good replica.

These retained effectiveness at altitudes well below 100,000 feet (30.48 km). However, they lost effectiveness between 90,000 and 100,000 feet. The X-15 therefore incorporated reaction controls, which were small thrusters fueled with hydrogen peroxide. Nose-mounted units controlled pitch and yaw.

At that altitude, its aerodynamic controls were useless. Kincheloe flew a ballistic arc, experiencing near-weightlessness for close to a minute.

But I guess these effects are in range of a few percent of the speed because the instruments are generally calibrated to be precise. As you said already any significant disruption of accuracy is usually accounted for in the design of the instrument.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I see in game is still wrong though. It is different from the effect described.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example the plane is taxiing around the airfield. The groundspeed shown is around ten knots. At the same time the indicated airspeed shown is fifteen knots. That is a fifty percent difference. The speed is obviously too low to cause any aerodynamic effects. As you guess most real life airspeed indicators will not even work at this speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter takeoff the very same thing keeps happening with two hundred knots of groundspeed being shown as over three hundred knots of airspeed. And here comes the most interesting part.
