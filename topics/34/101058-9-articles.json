I am not getting all the stats when I click on a civilian module, just some of the basics. I am also not getting any population growth. And the movie theater doesn\u0027t generate any inspiration, and there is no option for me to play movies. I also don\u0027t seem to generate C02 or waste (though I do generate waste water), and when I turn on the air circulator and recycler in the Hydroponic Garden Biosphere, it says \u0022Missing Inputs.\u0022 Ill include some screenshots to show what I mean.[http://i.imgur.com/SF974Et.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/SF974Et.jpg)[http://i.imgur.com/SfZRyJa.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/SfZRyJa.jpg)[http://i.imgur.com/MzQXZ8x.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/MzQXZ8x.jpg)[http://imgur.com/CwD6L4n](http://imgur.com/CwD6L4n)[http://imgur.com/Aw7rXRz](http://imgur.com/Aw7rXRz)\n\nDo you have a command pod?

The surface attach resource pods except the fertilizer pod have storage for 1 week for 2 civilians each.
