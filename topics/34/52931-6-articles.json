Though I took other looks at the part, and I think it doesn\u0027t even seem have a parachute transform. Not sure how parachutes worked back then, but it\u0027s very different from now. To get this compatible we would have to rebuild the part from ground up. It would essentially be easier to make a new part that looks like it than update it \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rottielover","CreatedById":73403,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-21T06:38:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI thought of a mod with a chute...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe SpaceTech Escape Pod (one of the most popular mods on Spaceport).

It doesn\u0027t actually have that many ratings. But yeah, I\u0027ve messaged the owner months ago to update it with his permission, and I still haven\u0027t received an answer.
