What if a plugin uses a library (like Firespitter) and just puts this in his main folder? If a user changes the naming scheme and installs another plugin of this modder he will have two versions of the library installed. So changing the naming scheme can only be done by users with higher skill levels (they have to know about such dependencies). And user with this kind of skill level already know what todo, when changing the naming scheme fails. Any other user should never try to change naming schemes, install paths and something like this at all.

I earned him some ribbons doing that, and then revoked a few, played around changing all sorts of settings. I still couldn\u0027t recreate it. I\u0027ll continue playing as before, I suppose, just making sure to quicksave at the end of every mission, so that, should this bug occur again, I can revert. I did look at the log file while I still had the bug, and I thought it was curiouis that more than half of the entries in the log were \u0022FF\u0022. I know nothing of the code, so I couldn\u0027t exectly be sure of anything wrong. I should note that I did see a bunch of NullReferenceExceptions near the bottom, but, I don\u0027t know, were those caused by me force quitting the game with Alt-F4?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT 3: Turns out I left the Log text open all this time.
