Is this possible with Unity?

My suggestion is to build all new crafts so that you are 100% certain all the parts are updated.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe saving loading issue is slowly being conquered, parts are now saved independently, then benefit to this was 1) it was the easiest fix for me to do 2) with the parts being independent of the vessel, it matters not where the parts go or if they change vessels, they will maintain their stats. I have done numerous tests and have noted good results, there are a few isolated errors I\u0027ll have to track down but they don\u0027t spam and seem to be isolated incidents.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore updates to come.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also did some other tweaks here and there to address a few minor issues. I updated/changed the 3 included craft files, delete the older ones.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-19T18:05:25Z\u0022 title=\u002203/19/2014 06:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 19, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by InfiniteDice\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
