You can\u0027t remove autostrut from landing legs and it is possible that autostrut lines goes trough strut part making it hard to spot.\n\nYou got landing leg -\u003E structural part -\u003E washer. Try with one more part between, like this:  \n\nlanding leg -\u003E structural part -\u003E second structural part -\u003Ewasher\n\nYou can try it on launchpad with same crfaft, but instead of landing leg use structural parts that simulate legs. I\u0027m 99% sure that landing legs cause issue.\n\nEDIT:\n\nOn picture on the ground, it does not show landing legs, but engines are touching grounds and joints on washer might be too weak to support weight of whole craft. Try to use launching clamps or structural parts instead of landing legs to raise craft above ground. With some clearance from ground washer should work as intended, but joints on washer might be too weak.  \n\nThat is why KJR is recommended, but you should make sure that you use latest KJR that is known to work.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-08-13T10:33:31Z\u0022 title=\u002208/13/2017 10:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 13, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by kcs123**"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-13T11:57:21Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, kcs123 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E You got landing leg -\u003E structural part -\u003E washer.
