First, the format is different. You have to remove the TECHNOLOGY_TREE_DEFINITION header, so that only NODE\u0027s are in the file. Then name it tree.cfg and place it in your save game folder. Then go into the R\u0026amp;D building and press Alt-F7 to bring up the tree selection box and add tree.cfg to the list. If you get that far, you are set. Just hit Alt-F7 to reselect trees whenever you want to reload that one tree file. Unfortunately, there is no way (currently) to force a reload of the named tech trees. That is probably a feature that really needs to be added.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be a really useful feature for editing trees. It\u0027s been rather tedious since TreeEdit died.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve found an interesting issue. Kinda surprised this has not come up yet. I\u0027m sorting parts in a tree using the TED tree editor, but the parts do not move when I load the game. They all go to their default stock nodes... except for parts that aren\u0027t defined with underscores. I noticed that my old treeloader file used periods instead of underscores, but TED used underscores and the actual part .cfg used underscores. For example the part defined as \u0022name = B9_Engine_SABRE_M\u0022 is seen as \u0022B9_Engine_SABRE_M\u0022 by TED but will only load correctly with TechManager if it\u0027s written \u0022B9.Engine.SABRE.M\u0022 in the tree file. But when I write \u0022B9.Engine.SABRE.M\u0022 in the tree file, TED thinks the part is missing so it makes it nearly impossible to sort.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould you make TechManager handle both underscores and periods?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-01T08:18:37Z\u0022 title=\u002201/01/2015 08:18  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by cvod\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sherkaner","CreatedById":130303,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-03T02:00:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve run into a serious limitation in implementing my intended tech tree using TM that I mentioned a few posts back.

Hence these six parts fell back to the stock way of looking at the entry in their part.cfg files. They happened to find the name of the node you looked at there, and thus inserted themselves into that node.
