I will look Into this later. ~~I guess it can be done.~~\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E It\u0027s a bit more complicated:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E This mod changes the ScienceDfs, so even before you do a experiment the game knows there is only one option: Full bar.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E When you do a experiment the part with the experiment defines the \u0022xmitDataScalar\u0022 (the penalty for transmittig), and builds the report, wich you then can pass to the lab.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E There is nothing the lab could do to fix this :/ it\u0027s all done before.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I really love your idea but you\u0027ll need someone who can write plugins. I suggest you go over to the [addon discussions](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/forum/20-add-on-discussions/) and open a thread there. And if you do let me know I\u0027d like to know where this is going.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E What can be done with just module manager is the following:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Set \u0022xmitDataScalar\u0022 to 1 (100% transmission) and to compensate higher the transmission costs. The normal communication is unaffect by the transmission cost so technically one could rise the cost to abstruse levels wich require a really big generator and a lot of EC.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E It\u0027s also possible to change the need for EC to everything else. I keep thinking about this and maybe try some stuff when I got the time.\n\u003E \n\nCan you make the transmission cost \u0022mpl-data\u0022? So only a mpl would be able to transmit data at all, but with 100%. And for balance s1 could use the mk1 lab mod."}]}
