KM_Gimbal (and presumably your other assemblies) are compiled against .NET 4.0. However, KSP is written for (and ships with) 3.5, and any 4.0\u002B features will fail. (I did more research; I misremembered it as 3.0; it is in fact 3.5). Could you recompile for 3.5?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. KM_Gimbal force-activates engines, which messes with staging.
