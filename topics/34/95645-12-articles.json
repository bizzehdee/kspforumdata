May have to wait a few versions when introducing more probe core mods, so that I do not have to rebalance them twice. Moving the larger probe cores forward also leaves the problem of the 2 unmanned tech nodes being so far back in the CTT. Not sure what else would fit there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, the data transmission is a bit strange, but I generally feel the whole electric power concept could use a major rebalance. 1ec/s fulfills the life support needs of 20 kerbals or so... That is totally imbalanced. I understand where it comes from, the reason that solar panels do not generate electricity when the vessel is not in focus. But with the Background Processing mod, there is a solution at hand.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo that is definately on the agenda, but it is a major piece of work with massive balancing effects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI ll do the transmission costs in between, however after the 0.8.0 rebalance, I kind of want to primarily work on the accumulated backlog, mainly concerning part mod support.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe earlier fairings are a good idea, I shifted around some parts in the north-western corner of the tech tree for 0.8.1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SwGustav\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SwGustav\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThose are some great ideas and suggestions Lord Aurelius, I support them. I think that Stayputnik version is from SXT. \u003Cp\u003EBTW Yemo, Kerbonov Part Pack has a mini-jet. Could it be used as a model for the new 0.625 jet?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince I moved the Basic Jet back to Aerodynamics (or wanted to, somehow it ended up in flightControl, will be fixed in 0.8.1), I needed a Jet for stability, which does not depend on any mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the Kerbonov MiniTurboJet would be kind of redundant there. I therefore rebalanced it to be a small TurboJet instead of the small Basic Jet it was originally balanced as, despite its name.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe normal TurboJet was sent back to supersonicFlight in 0.8.0, while I intend to leave the Kerbonov MiniTurboJet at aerodynamics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact, that config is already in 0.8.0 (SETI-PartMod-SH_mods-Kerbonov.cfg), I just wanted to make configs for the other Kerbonov parts before announcing the support in the changelog.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Shaun\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Shaun\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYes I got specialised construction. I tried reloading the game twice. I realised the name was changed with a \u00270\u0027 at the front of the title, looking around and spotted SETI was the reason for this change. I duplicated the stock fuel line, renamed it to fuelline2 and it worked from there.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is odd, the Fuel Line is the the first part in my Fuel Tanks catalog in the VAB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI added the 0 for part catalog sorting, like I did for the procedural parts, launch clamps and so on. So that the basic parts are always at the start and users do not need to search for them after every tech unlock/mod install.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E@Lord Aurelius/SwGustav:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegarding the backlog, this is an implementation of the HybridRocketBooster concept based on Lord Aurelius Hybrid Booster concept and the ProceduralParts SRB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe code can just be copied into a .cfg file within the GameData folder of your SETI install. Any feedback appreciated, it is only rudimentary balanced for SETI. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are ok with that, I can include it into 0.8.1 for testing. Will post it into your Hybrid Rocket Booster thread as well, for exposure and of course if you want to distribute the config file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGiven the changes to procedural parts by SETI, especially now with the textures from SwGustav and the HybridBoosters from LordAurelius (and probably more coming), I m also thinking about a separate download.

In my mind a fancy folding dish like the DTS-M1 should be higher tech than a fixed dish, but currently the fixed dishes are unlocked later in the tech tree. Maybe things could be balanced where the fixed dishes are heavier but quite a bit cheaper and more efficient (right now there\u0027s really no reason to use the fixed dishes) and in the early game (until the EC use gets rebalanced) power is at a premium and a heavier dish isn\u0027t as much as an issue since we\u0027re not trying to go very far yet.
