Normally I just focus on the VSpeed controller, and use the AoA controller for any final tweaking. The altitude controller tuning is mostly just tweaking how it approaches the targets (limits set how fast it can move, kP how sharply it moves between the VSpeed limit and its target (eg. default 50m/s limit and 0.15 kP =\u0026gt; It starts flattening off at (50/0.15 = 333m) from the target altitude).
