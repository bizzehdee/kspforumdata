Making single stage landers and ships gets a lot more fun when you have a command pod at the top, a ton of fuel (or other heavy, dense things like reactors/SRUs) and no way to get down. Tons of ladders, or nacelle designs. I\u0027ve been trying to design my ships this way as a matter of course for a long time without this mod. The mod makes it a lot more fun though.\n\n[@Papa_Joe](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/10788-papa_joe/), I know you\u0027ve got  a list here of specific parts which can\u0027t be made passable through the right click options, but just starting to use the mod and I\u0027m noticing one of my common inline parts isn\u0027t passable, and it should at least be an option. This is the reaction wheels. By nature (unless they\u0027re tiny), they\u0027re hollow rings, so really there isn\u0027t any reason they shouldn\u0027t be passable, at the very least, have it an option. Now, there are some surface mount reaction wheels which probably wouldn\u0027t work, but at least the in-line ones should.However, In general, I tend to go by a simple rule: Anything large can probably have a crew-pass through, and in almost all certainly, would. Just like modern ocean ships, a remarkably large volume of the ship is accessible while underway. Areas you never dreamed of. This is complicated by space and pressurization requirements of course. Spacewalking for repairs is always an option in space, but I\u0027d think in most cases, if it\u0027s already enclosed, it\u0027d probably be passable. Maybe not nuclear reactors, SRUs, etc. But a 3.75m drone core or battery? Probably.\n\nI know you can\u0027t figure out all the minutia of which parts should be tweakable and which shouldn\u0027t but aside from your basics \u0027it\u0027s too small\u0027, should probably err on the side of letting people tweak it. Maybe something like 1.25m parts are just too small for your head, but parts *over* a certain size, like 3.75m, probably should have a way to be made passable. Save maybe open girders or other obvious things.\n\nGreat work!\n\nEdit: I\u0027m new to this mod, so still learning how things work with this.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-07-10T05:05:46Z\u0022 title=\u002207/10/2017 05:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 10, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by AmpCat**"},{"CreatedByName":"AmpCat","CreatedById":168141,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-10T04:38:51Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 6/18/2017 at 2:31 PM, Gordon Dry said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E @DStaal: the way of logic in case of text next to button differs from dev to dev - there is no common style.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Some mods let it say that the actual state is shown and you have to click to get the other state(s).  \n\u003E \n\u003E Other mods let it say \u0022it\u0027s this what\u0027s written next to the button when you click the button\u0022.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E In the case of checkboxes, like in settings UI windows of mods, it\u0027s often that the text next to the checkbox shows the current state - the text is dynamic.  \n\u003E \n\u003E When you check the checkbox, the text changes.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On first approach I always thought the text is static and when the box is not checked than the state is not what\u0027s written next to it but the logical counterpart - like back in the days in common software.\n\u003E \n\nTo me, when a button like that uses a colon, so it says \u0027CLS Passable: No\u0027, that indicates that the current state is \u0027No\u0027.

I originally thought it was because of the module: \u0022ModuleDockingNode\u0022 not having the property \u0022referenceAttachNode\u0022 set, but two of the Squad docking ports (Inline and shielded) seem fine and don\u0027t get picked up with this \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E.  \n\nWhat\u0027s the easiest way to exclude specific single parts from this \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E Patch?\n\nI get NRE\u0027s for when this patch tries against the mods/parts specifically for  \n\nOPT - [j_2m_crewDock \u0026 j_3m_largeDock](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/87956-130-opt-space-plane-v201-updated-29072017/)  \n\nREKT - [OTAVcore2](https://github.com/steedcrugeon/REKT/blob/master/SHED/REKT/Parts/OTAV/OTAVmain/OTAVcore2.cfg)  \n\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E - [ExpandingDockingPort](https://github.com/UmbraSpaceIndustries/Malemute/blob/master/FOR_RELEASE/GameData/UmbraSpaceIndustries/Malemute/Parts/ExpandingDockingPort.cfg) (for Malemute)  \n\nThe only other item I found is that that is in all the above parts list **nodeTransformName** under ModuleDockingNode.\n\n    Stock Mk2 Docking part:  nodeTransformName = dockingNode\n    Malemute: \t\t nodeTransformName = DockingNode\n    OTAV: \t\t\t nodeTransformName = dockPoint\n    OPT both use: \t\t nodeTransformName = DockingNode\n\nI have to guess that this might be something baked in the the module? I cna\u0027t work out why this \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E patch fails for these though. Apologies if this ends up not related to CLS other than the CLS \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E patch highlighting another mod issue.
