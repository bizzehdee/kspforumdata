As in, relay option would be still relay, transmitter would still send 100%, but the receiver would be limited. Even the transmitter power might be tweakable, but separately - for mothership/lander pairs in outer Kerbol system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReason being if you have some small probes/landers with scanners that use microwave only for SAS or instead of RTGs, you don\u0027t really need hundreds of GW there and they also don\u0027t have enough radiator capacity to dissipate 100sGW of WasteHeat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd on the other hand, if you launch heavy vessels using microwave, you would set that particular receiver to get 100% without having to worry that you have only a low-power network for your probes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECorrect me if I\u0027m talking nonsense, but I think such option would be useful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI disagree with a receiver limit. If you have some 5TW finger of God microwave beam and you fly into it, you better have the equipment to handle all 5TW or its going to be like a moth flying into a bonfire. I understand advanced network could adjust power transmitted to match the demand of a different vessel. Perhaps this could be simulated by limiting all vessels connected to a transmitter / relay to the same power, up to the max available for the network (to keep in line with conservation of energy). That way you couldn\u0027t have a craft with 5 DV vistas and a micro probe powered on the same link.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
