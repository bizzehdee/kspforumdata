Not sure if it\u0027d be possible to place a base plate, and then click on a part in the stack to indicate \u0022cover everything from the base plate to this part (inclusive)\u0022, but that would be the most flexible from a user perspective.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rasheed","CreatedById":29903,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-09T15:01:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI..........I..........\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EU beat DYI to the job O_O\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think fairings factory is taken out of production\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wetmelon","CreatedById":58216,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-09T15:03:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFAR should already work with it because FAR does its own raytracing.
