The second one was also unmanned, it was just a cargo flight containing as much life support as I could lift, so the kerbals would have enough for at least a year. The third flight was just command capsule for control and a survey station. The funnest part was getting everything down within 20m of each other. Built out a base using MKS, only thing I get from Kerbin now is the one way ferry flights of kerbals to the base, as all flights to other bodies now occurs from there.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-03T17:22:47Z\u0022 title=\u002212/03/2014 05:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 3, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Rebelgamer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerba Fett","CreatedById":62292,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-03T21:08:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust wanted to confirm that my system is now doing instant builds after editing my persistence file and ask another question.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERecycled ships just return scrap metal rather than rocket parts, right?
