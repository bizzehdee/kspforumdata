The rate at which parts can thus gain heat is modified above by atmospheric pressure, but the max value never is, so parts can get just as hot in the upper atmosphere as in the lower.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, the other part I\u0027ve been looking at is this in AdjustedHeat():\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E \t\t\t\t\tfloat ablation = (float) (dot \u003Cbr\u003E\t\t\t\t\t                           * loss.Evaluate((float) Math.Pow (shockwave, ReentryPhysics.temperatureExponent)) \u003Cbr\u003E \t\t\t\t\t                          * Math.Pow (vessel.atmDensity, ReentryPhysics.densityExponent) \u003Cbr\u003E \t\t\t\t\t                          * TimeWarp.fixedDeltaTime);\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere, the atmospheric density is applied as a straight multiplier to the rate of loss based on the shockwave value (i.e. the velocity - 275) to determine the rate of ablation, as opposed to the delta between the current part temperature and the shockwave value as it is above.
