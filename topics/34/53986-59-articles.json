Real vacuum engines have *gigantic* bell nozzles for efficiency in vacuum; KSP is hilariously wrong about just about every nozzle you see (and, of course, its engine have about 1/3 to 1/4 the TWR of real engines). It\u0027s also, of course, wrong about having a giant \u0022tank butt\u0022 at the top of most engines--that\u0027s actually the bottom dome of the stage\u0027s lower capsule tank, not anything to do with the engine itself. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:SNECMA_HM7B_rocket_engine.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHere\u003C/a\u003E is a real HM7B.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fact that KSP-looking engines look \u0022normal\u0022 to you is for the same reason that one might think waiting until 10km to start pitching over, and having pea-soup-level aerodynamic \u0022drag,\u0022 is normal: because KSP gets it hilario-tragically wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Epingopete: see above; use RftS with RPL, per the RPL instructions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERealism Overhaul is scaled 100% to real life.

That being said, the reason I said to do it that is because all radial RCS tanks match those search terms. They already all contain a reference to \u0022resourceName = monopropellant\u0022 in their configs, and I believe that you can also search for attachRule with the new MM release. In this way, any radial tank that is configured for stock monopropellant would have the crossfeedenable module attached to it at loading time without having to define each tank individually.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the trim weight, I frankensteined one together using one of the weights from LLL and then putting the NRAP adjustable weight module into it.
