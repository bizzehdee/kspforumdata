This one pretty much covers the core logic and basic supply stuff.  Recyclers will be next, but necessitate some new parts - note that when that hits, your consumption rate will jump to 15 supplies per day until you slap on a recycler (good) or get to a reliable water source (better).\n\u003E \n\nHey RoverDude, I have a few missions currently in planning. Does this change mean that it will cut all current mission durations by a factor of 15? Is there any way to prepare for that? Or is the only way to get all Kerbals back.\n\nAlso, is there a timeframe for this change?"},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-03T13:33:40Z","Content":"As always, all of this stuff can be tweaked via the settings file, so for folks using the mod now, they can plunk the values back down until they update their save.\n\n[@blu3wolf](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/107912-blu3wolf/) - let me know if your issue persists once Kerbals have a rest stop back at Kerbin to reset the clock.

My apologies if I\u0027m wrong on that.\n\nI noticed that, if there are no supplies on a vessel, the EVA time keeps going up, even while a kerbal is inside that vessel. Sending the kerbal back in the vessel and back out doesn\u0027t reset the number. This can be seen on [a previous post](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/105202-105-usi-life-support-020-20151229/\u0026do=findComment\u0026comment=2168677) of yours.  \n\nSo, right now the EVA duration number is acting the same as the \u0022supplies\u0022.  \n![7603aed0b2.png](http://puu.sh/milnr/7603aed0b2.png)\n\nThe EVAEffect isn\u0027t taking place either.

The DP is small enough to be carried on the Kerbal\u0027s back using KIS (status will say \u0022carried\u0022), so I don\u0027t have to lug around the SC-62 (which is big, bulky and heavy).\n\nThe steps for rescuing a kerbal who refuses to work due to USI-LS is now:\n\n1. EVA and slap the DERP supply bag on the stricken vessel.  Feeding frenzy ensues, but kerbal will still refuse to work.\n2. EVA and attach the Kerbitrail docking port.\n3. Return to rescue vessel and dock with Kerbitrail.  Since the Kerbitrail docking port is \u0022size1\u0022 and androgynous, the regular Clamp-o-tron variants (shielded, mk1, etc.) will work just fine.\n4. As soon as docking completes, kerbal in stricken craft will return to active duty\n5. In general, CLS will not allow transfer of the kerbal between vessels (not 100% sure why), so have to EVA to move the stranded kerbal over to the rescue vessel.\n6. If there was no existing crew hatch on the stricken vessel, then undock and move just far enough to allow stricken vessel kerbal to EVA via the newly attached Kerbitrail docking port\n7. EVA again and detach Kerbitrail from stricken vessel and stow in SC-62 container\n\nPretty sure that I\u0027m using USI-LS\\_0.2.1.0 when I last tested that."},{"CreatedByName":"goldenpsp","CreatedById":113874,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-07T14:27:42Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 12 minutes ago, WuphonsReach said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Ideas for homesickness / boredom\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E - Being in the same vessel ID for too long would increase it\n\u003E - Being in the same part type for too long would increase it, so you could move kerbals from part to part to provide a bit of variety, but only if you have different type parts\n\u003E - EVAs might reduce boredom by some amount (based on length?)\n\u003E - XP events reduce boredom (planting flag on new body, etc.)\n\u003E - Busy kerbals have less boredom\n\u003E - Some interiors are just more boring then others?\n\u003E \n\nMy only concern is having mechanics that require me to manually move kerbals around within a craft (or base etc).
