Hiding the empty nodes is just done with Module Manager, but the plugin\u0027s job is to make sure that non-empty nodes are only connected to other non-empty nodes as far back as they need to go. Each node is limited to three parents max though, but that\u0027s an edge case.\n2. Yep. But be aware that the parents would rearrange too, so for example you could get a situation where you have a newly unhidden and unresearched node with children that have already been researched.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-23T20:27:33Z\u0022 title=\u002204/23/2016 08:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 23, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by ev0**"},{"CreatedByName":"vardicd","CreatedById":75832,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-23T23:21:49Z","Content":"YAY update!

I tested it with a stock install of the game and it looks like it works again. Let me know. Be sure to manually delete your old HideEmptyTechTreeNodes folder too before trying this version! This version won\u0027t be put up on CKAN just yet, as I first want to find out why MM doesn\u0027t work with the Yonge Tech Tree plugin. But any future update on CKAN will include similar fixes for the ETT.\n\u003E \n\nHey, [@ev0](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/116691-ev0/), I tried your \u0022dirty update\u0022, as you called it, but it appears it is not working for ETT :/"},{"CreatedByName":"ev0","CreatedById":116691,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-20T01:57:25Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 6 hours ago, aluc24 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Hey, [@ev0](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/116691-ev0/), I tried your \u0022dirty update\u0022, as you called it, but it appears it is not working for ETT :/\n\u003E \n\nCan you see if it\u0027s working with a stock install?
