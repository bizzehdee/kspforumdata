In fact, it will be more easy to move containers if they are attached to the kerbal (like KAS). As container mass is addded to the kerbal, there is no problem about this afterall, moving heavy containers will realistically be more difficult and use more RCS fuel, and moving multiple containers once will always need some kind of vehicule.\n\nHowever, I\u0027m worried about carrying container on the ground.
