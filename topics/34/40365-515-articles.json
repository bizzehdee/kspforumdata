Those are some details I can work with. I replace Interstellar\u0027s argon resource with the CRP/NearFuture argon, and it looks like I left the old resource name in the ORS atmospheric configs. In KSPI_CRP_Pack/CRPResourcePack_Atmospheric.cfg, change all occurrences of \u0022resourceName = Argon\u0022 to \u0022resourceName = ArgonGas\u0022 and see if that makes a difference.
