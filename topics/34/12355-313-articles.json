Corrective steering tries to control the direction of your velocity so that you fly along the given ascent path. But should it use orbital velocity or surface velocity? It ends up using a weighted average of the two that shifts over the course of the flight, so that it starts out controlling surface velocity and gradually switches over to using orbital velocity.
