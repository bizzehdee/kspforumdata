A Kopernicus GUI cleanup was performed. Several options that only mod-makers would use were moved to be \u0022config file only\u0022 and no longer show in the GUI, which was getting messy. Those options are listed in entry 2, in no particular order.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.)

The logic in the \u0022real world scale\u0022 system has been updated, particularly in regards to gas giants. There is an option to use the old logic in the .cfg file (no it\u0027s not in the GUI).

At interstellar ranges, heat can sometimes behave strangely, sometimes related to map zoom (be careful zooming out). It is best to turn off part heating when traveling far far away.

When you uninstall a mod that had installed a Terrain Detail preset you were using, it may be listed still in the Graphics settings as \u0022New Text.\u0022 This is by design.

Multistar Solar panel support requires an additional config file, attached to release.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3.) As of release-107, scatter density underwent a bugfix on all bodies globally that results in densities acting more dense than before on some select configs. Some mods may need to adjust. Normally we\u0027d not change things like this, but this is technically the correct stock behavior of the node so... if you need the old behavior, see config option UseIncorrectScatterDensityLogic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4.) As of release-151, polar generation behavior has changed slightly. Though it will be safer overall for new missions, be careful loading existing craft there. This is probably not lethal but I don\u0027t want you to be unaware.

The \u0022collider fix\u0022 as it\u0027s called, which fixes the event in which you sink into the terrain on distant bodies, is now on by default.
