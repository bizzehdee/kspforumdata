Kudos to you! If you could add one more file, and that is the config.xml file in the plugins\\plugindata\\shipmanifest folder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, to address each question and concern,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u0022if CLS is not a requirement, how does the Crew Transfer work?\u0022\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShip Manifest is based on Crew Manifest, as described in my OP. With CLS off (or not installed), crew transfers are possible to any part that can contain a kerbal. No limitation. It does not distinguish contiguous spaces so you can move a kerbal anywhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith CLS installed and turned ON, the \u0022intention\u0022 is to be aware of spaces, and the path thru the vessel so as to simulate a more realistic experience. If your hatches are closed, or there is a non passable part between the source and target, then transfer is not possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow the rub. At this time, my implementation of CLS enabled crew transfers sucks. Highlighting is causing me headaches. I\u0027m scrapping my current method as we speak to rethink the process. So that is why I noted in my OP that it was a known issue. My apologies for the \u0022rough\u0022 experience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u0022Is there any benefit to using CLS, even if it is optional and what is it?\u0022\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe benefit is subjective. If you don\u0027t care whether or not it is possible for a kerbal to realistically move internally between parts or you simply choose not to EVA, then running without CLS is the way to go. However, if you want to have to EVA when it is not \u0022realistically\u0022 possible to move internally, then CLS will give you a greater sense of where your living spaces are (i like this ins a space station especially), then you really should take a good look at CLS. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain the rub. I need to fix it. This my top priority at this moment. My next feature, hatch management cannot be implemented until I get crew movement right. I\u0027m hard at work now. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo work around the issue at this moment, in the settings window, there is an option named \u0022Enable CLS\u0022. turn it off, save and restart the game. This will put it in standard mode and the errors should go away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will update as soon as I have addressed the crew movement issues with CLS enabled. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eback to work \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-03T21:16:47Z\u0022 title=\u002210/03/2014 09:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 3, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Papa_Joe\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Egrammer, clarifications.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"smunisto","CreatedById":57789,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-03T21:23:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/2rs5wh8dbmayexb/config.xml?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/2rs5wh8dbmayexb/config.xml?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s the config.
