My past way of proceeding was to make the area change exponantially over time. This would give it plenty of time to react, but the beginning was too \u0022smoot\u0022, and the ending a little too rough to my liking. Not only that, but after predeployment, deployment would start again with a rate of change of nearly nothing at first. Therefore I changed it to match a little more reality: instead now the diameter increases linearly. And given the area isgiven by \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/is1I0Rx.png\u0022 alt=\u0022is1I0Rx.png\u0022\u003E, this causes a quadratic rate of change for the area, which is generally smoother and less rough on the vessel. Given the diameter is already at a given value when deployment starts, this makes the predeployment and deployment curve line up nearly perfectly (it isn\u0027t exactly, but the large the difference between predeployment and deployment is in terms of area, the better it will line up. For example the image above is a predeployed area of 2.8m of diameter and 11.3m fully deployed).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall this should make it much smoother and more realistic on the vessels.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Honeybadga","CreatedById":64977,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-20T20:05:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen I customize the main chute and it tells me that the craft is too heavy, how do I balance several chutes together so I don\u0027t have either overkill or too little chutes on the vessel?

If you have your launcher and all the rest of the vessel attached to this, RealChute assumes you *also* wants to land that. If what you\u0027re actually trying to land really is too heavy for a single chute, you need to tell RealChute how many chutes you\u0027ll be using. In the part of the window that says \u0022calculations\u0022, where you input the landing speed, there is a field that says \u0022parachutes used\u0022. Set this to the number of parachutes you\u0027ll be using to land that craft. So for example for what you said, if you had a stack chute and four radials, you\u0027d put in 6. One for each radial, and two for both chutes on the stack chute. The secondary chute setting is for parachute that have a second chute on the part. There\u0027s virtually no limit to how many chutes you can have on one part. The editor window separates them so you can edit them separately, and the second chute appears after the \u0022secondary chute\u0022 demarkation.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Honeybadga","CreatedById":64977,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-21T01:36:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGreat!

The stack chute is not the cone chute (the pointy one). The stack chute is the inline chute you can, well, stack things on top of. Once this is cleared, I also need to point out that the maximum diameter is not set by the part, it\u0027s set by the parachute canopy itself. Single chutes have a 70m maximu diameter, while triple ones have a 121m maximum diameter (it\u0027s the exact equivalent of three 70m chutes). The stack chute has two single chutes, so they have the same maximum diameter as the radials. If you meant the cone chute which has a triple chute, then no it will not account for it\u0027s different max diameter as it\u0027s trying to split the charge evenly.
