ALSO, a realism factor is being applied to the ablation rate because in real life, a heat shield ablates a mere fraction of its total amount than would happen in stock KSP. In stock KSP, I\u0027m still trying to capture the basic essence of your ablator being sucked nearly dry. But IRL, an Apollo heat shield only ablated (IIRC) only 10%-ish of its total amount.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Because, overengineering)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe greatest heat loading ever experienced by a heat shield was by the\u00A0Galileo Jupiter Atmospheric Probe which ablated something like 50% of its heatshield. (might have been more/less, going by memory)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe easiest solution for you here is to use the Deadly Reentry menu to crank up reentry heating. (there\u0027s one in the stock KSP menus but it\u0027s clamped to 200%. The DR one overrides the KSP one and goes a lot higher)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat solution, while being easiest to execute will affect everything even supersonic aircraft, so you could instead use an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E config to make the ablation rate faster.
