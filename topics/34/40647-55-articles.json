Being a 32bit program KSP can only run with a limited amount of memory (something like 3.4gb of ram). Since the game loads all assets into memory on launch large textures eat into this very quickly. Everybody\u0027s computers spec\u0027s are unfortunately irrelevant to this problem. It gets worse with other mods that use textures. Sorry but your going to have to make a choice between high resolution textures and parts mods. Try removing textures your not likely to care about and/or parts you dont use very often. The trick is to find a balance that allows KSP to run without fps drops or crashes.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EI am aware of the memory limitations of KSP mate, however this is not the case.No crashes occur and KSP does not pass the threshold of 3.34 Gb.I stated that I have removed all textures and tried running KSP with just skybox, but to no avail.I am unconvinced loading up RAM memory can in any way affect FPS of the game.

Given that 99% of people will have a minimum of 2GB RAM, I\u0027d imagine that CPU is the most important part of a spec for KSP in its current form. The RAM factor can be managed - I have 2GB and run just about 1GB worth of mods (size of gamedaa folder, minus size of gamedata/Squad), I very rarely experience RAM related crashes, but one more mod over my current level puts me in crashville. Other than that it runs smooth as silk, with the framerate dropping as part no. goes up. Recently I was docking a 300 part spaceplane with a modest spacestation and that was about the limit of barability. Given that my CPU and graphics card (Core i3 and nVidia GTS 250) are fairly middle-of-the-road its unsurprising, I\u0027d wager a faster CPU would give me greatest benefit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Orphican","CreatedById":39466,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-02T18:30:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022smunisto\u0022 data-cite=\u0022smunisto\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI am aware of the memory limitations of KSP mate, however this is not the case.No crashes occur and KSP does not pass the threshold of 3.34 Gb.I stated that I have removed all textures and tried running KSP with just skybox, but to no avail.I am unconvinced loading up RAM memory can in any way affect FPS of the game.

I don\u0027t see any more layers and I\u0027m fairly confused, because the game uses it just fine as you said, but it doesn\u0027t help me when I try to do the same sort of thing for Eve...\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img829.imageshack.us/img829/8058/4oi7.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00224oi7.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EThis is sort of what I have going on for Eve, I\u0027m not really sure if the land mass is correct because I\u0027m basing it off of one of those textures where I can\u0027t see all the layers in photoshop. I assume it\u0027s right, but I don\u0027t have anything capable of landing there right now to check. Seems to look okay in game, but I was gonna launch a mission to Eve first to see how it actually works colorwise and land-wise.
