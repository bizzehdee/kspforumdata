When you add a part module with module manager, it happens at the start of the loading sequence before the code on the part modules has initialized so I can\u0027t check to see which parts have actions and which don\u0027t.

Currently I have joystick buttons mapped to action groups 1 through 10, which are keyboard keys alpha1 through alpha0.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am trying to make action groups 11 through 20 available. At first, I tried setting a modifier key in AGX, so that action group 11 would be left shift alpha1, 12 would be left shift alpha2 etc. But when I use autohotkey modifier syntax (eg, Send \u0026lt;\u002B1) KSP doesn\u0027t seem to recognise the modifier key.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI then saw that I can assign \u0022shifted\u0022 alpha keys (such as exclaim, ampersand, etc) in AGX. I thought this would be my way around the issue, but when I use autohotkey to Send {!} this isn\u0027t recognised either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that if I use the keyboard and type shift \u002B alpha1 when that is how AGX is bound, this works.
