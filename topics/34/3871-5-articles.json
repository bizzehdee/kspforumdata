I would rather say that the \u0027theoretical cost\u0027 should be our bar: there should be an agreed \u0027cost\u0027, which would be the drive for an equation agreed on which encompass many more stats. While more complicated, it also brings more possibilities: heavier engines with a small thrust but pretty small fuel consumption could be possible, which I find well-suited for lander engines, all while being balanced against a much more powerful engine that could be slightly lighter but gobbles more fuel for main stages. Of course, the costs would be different for every category of part (perhaps fitting to the original component of each category?)
