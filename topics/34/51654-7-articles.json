My qualm is the inverse. I would bet less than 5% of all experiments are run on Kerbin, yet currently 21% of logs are done on Kerbin. And atmosphere analysis being the most valuable (stock) experiment, getting 1000\u002B science in some cases with 90% retention for transmission, has only 6.4% of the logs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven if we didn\u0027t get a single additional entry from today on, we\u0027ve already tripled the count from the original file.

We probably cut less than 5% of entries but only after discussing the possibility of re-purposing them (moving to a different biome, using for a different experiment, rephrasing if confusing).
