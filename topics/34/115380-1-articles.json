If not, check here: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/104280-1-0-3-Outer-Planets-Mod-(1-7)-Tal-biomes-return-of-egg-shaped-Ovok-faster-loading-1-Jul](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/104280-1-0-3-Outer-Planets-Mod-%281-7%29-Tal-biomes-return-of-egg-shaped-Ovok-faster-loading-1-Jul)\n\nIt is a mod that adds three gas giants to the Kerbol system, each of them (except Neidon, Neidon\u0027s moons are still in development) has it\u0027s own moons.\n\nThe new planets are:\n\nSarnus, an orange gas giant with large rings.\n\nUrlum, a light blue ice giant with small rings.\n\nNeidon, a purple gas giant with no rings and (so far) no moons.\n\nPlock, a pluto-analog. Will eventually get at least one moon and it\u0027s own textures.\n\nSarnus being a Saturn analog, it, of course, has a Titan-analog orbiting it. Meet Tekto, a green, awkward world. It\u0027s surface is hidden from view by thick clouds. Or, well, it\u0027s supposed to. And that is what this small mod is for.\n\nIt is a version of Environmental Visual Enhancements that works with KSP 1.0.4, and it comes with the cloud configs of Sarnus, Urlum, Neidon, and Tekto. All you have to do is drag the contents of the .zip file into your KSP directory (the ZIP-file should have a folder named \u0027GameData\u0027. Merge this folder with the \u0027GameData\u0027 folder in your KSP directory).\n\nIf done correctly, you should now have clouds in KSP!\n\nWarning: we all know that KSP can have some serious bugs, though most, if not all, are fixed upon restarting the game. I\u0027d like to underline the fact that, if your KSP bugs during gameplay, it might and might not be because of this mod.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nPlease know that this mod is not made by me, I merely got it to work with 1.0.4.

It\u0027s just that I had the two versions installed at the same time when I got it to work, so, just to be sure, I included both of \u0027em.
