This tracks with EPL\u0027s folder size in GameData (46 MB), which is fairly large, but comparable to e.g. MKS/OKS (33 MB) and Karbonite (68 MB). It\u0027s only when several mods of this size are installed that KSP risks running into issues (a dozen megs here, a dozen megs there, and pretty soon, you\u0027re talking about real memory).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, this is with using OpenGL as the rendering engine; I don\u0027t know how much memory it occupies when using Direct3D, which is the default on Windows. EPL and Asteroid Recycling Technologies broke my camel\u0027s back (crash during loading, output_log.txt indicates out-of-memory errors), and even after removing those, other mods that I later installed were pushing me close to the edge again, so I tried using OpenGL by adding \u0022-force-opengl\u0022 to the shortcut\u0027s startup command in Steam. This has resulted in KSP\u0027s memory usage staying below 2.5 GB even though my GameData folder weighs in at 1.87 GB. (I\u0027ve also had to add the \u0022-popupwindow\u0022 command to the shortcut. This removes the border from around the window and puts it in front of my taskbar, so that I can run the game at full resolution without having to make my taskbar auto-hide itself, and it has had the unexpected but positive side effect of letting the game run even when I\u0027m focused on a different window, without putting graphics-device-invalid warnings in my output log. I\u0027m not sure why I didn\u0027t have to do this with Direct3D -- darn it, colin_in_space, I\u0027m a rocket scientist, not a graphics programmer...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe tradeoff, from what I understand of what others have said e.g. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/84203-Less-memory-usage-by-using-OpenGL\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E, is that OpenGL (compared to Direct3D) reduces memory usage (which is limited on KSP x86) by increasing the processing power usage. My computer\u0027s processor is plenty powerful, with four cores and a recent graphics; you you will have to decide for yourself if the trade is worthwhile.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etl;dr EPL is heavy, but not the heaviest mod out there, so if KSP is staying under 3 GB already, you probably won\u0027t have trouble, and if you do have trouble, consider using OpenGL to save on memory.

Or EPL just doesn\u0027t work in 0.25 64-bit even though it worked fine(for me) in 0.24 64-bit? Is there too much work involved to get it functional in 64bit? Can you throw me a bone here taniwha?\u003Cp\u003EEdit: I\u0027m not quite sure how this all works though, is there a compatibility check for EPL, and the mod then disables itself if it recognizes it\u0027s a 64bit game?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs zopper points out, EL disables itself. This is because 64-bit Windows KSP \u003Cstrong\u003Ecannot\u003C/strong\u003E be trusted and there is nothing any mod can do about it, and thus I refuse to support it. EL may well have worked just fine on 64-bit Windows KSP in 0.24, but things got worse in general for everyone, including Squad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain as zopper points out, it\u0027s simply a matter of disabling the checks. Do \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENOT\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E touch Checkers.cs as that is there to remind you that you are on your own. I have, however, made the checks scattered through EL\u0027s code easy to find and remove. However, \u003Cem\u003Ebuilding\u003C/em\u003E EL is not quite so simple for Windows users (I use Linux). Out of the box, even on Linux, you need mono, gnu make, git and bash (others might work). On windows, you will also need cygwin or msys, I imagine. On top of that, EL depends on KSP API Extensions (but you already have that if you dl the EL zip). As an alternative, you can use VS, but you will have to create the project file yourself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, I\u0027m helping a little bit, but I will not give you more details: if you are capable of building a 64-bit Windows KSP enabled EL yourself, you are capable of looking after yourself when KSP crashes or anything weird happens that cannot be reproduced in 32-bit Windows KSP (or Linux, or OSX). Essentially, this is a test. Pass and you get to (try to) use EL on 64-bit Windows KSP. Just remember that should you distribute it, the GPL requires that you make it clear that you have modified the code. EL makes this easy with its version display.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-11T10:13:57Z\u0022 title=\u002211/11/2014 10:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 11, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by taniwha\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kamuchi","CreatedById":110857,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-11T10:03:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGave 64bit another attempt and seeing EL not working made me cry abit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I\u0060m clueless to how to recompile, a question to anyone who is bored or still attempting to run 64.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI went from a horrible crashfest 0.25 64bit to a rock solid \u002B12 hours game play yesterday with 1 crash due to slamming a 200\u002B part into the runway (ksp exploded along)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing amd cards and CCC:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdd a standard profile for the 64bit executable: \u003Cstrong\u003Edisable crossfire\u003C/strong\u003E for it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKsp: disable full screen\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShortcut add after the path: -popupwindow \u003Cstrong\u003E-force-d3d11-no-singlethreaded\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdding the forced no-singlethreaded in windowed mode fixed all crashes, please note, \u003Cstrong\u003Efor me.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have posted it in several places but so for not a single reply.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also sent it to Rowsdower as *maybe* this might help finding the cause or underlying problems besides just saying \u0022it\u0060s Unity\u0022, if this *could* add to the crashfest, it would be simple for them to add it in the code for stability *if* it really helps improve it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have no idea what that command line argument does and why it works great with disabled crossfire, but it works \u003Cstrong\u003Efor me\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anyone has a clue where else to post where people are still looking for solutions I would gladly hear it, just want to share my personal findings for my system that seem to work so far \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SlimJim89","CreatedById":107281,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-12T01:14:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Etaniwha: Actively blocking EPL useage for 64-bit and not supporting it is two different things.

You\u0027re right, it wasn\u0027t EPL, sorry about that. Apparently it was lack luster labs SXT. Either that or I was getting errors due to using too much memory, which is the only explanation I can come up with for texture error.

The first factory i built had loads of smelters and ore storages and was an unflyable mess because i thought moar is better. The 2nd one I built had the bare minimum needed to keep a continuous, if slow, production going and I used warp to speed things up.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would actually say IMO timewarp is a necessary evil. I know that Taniwha is working on it, but the inability for building to occur while not in focus of the vessel can be highly annoying at times. Especially if you are trying to deal with LS mods, as well as juggling multiple missions. Sure I can timewarp to complete the build, but sometimes it isn\u0027t feasible as I may miss a window eslewhere.
