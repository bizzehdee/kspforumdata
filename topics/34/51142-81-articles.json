If you update it every frame, it will jerk arround alot, and it won\u0027t look like smooth rolling clouds. If you update it every minute or so, all of a sudden it would change speed. Again, not nicely. You would have to create some sort of \u0022speed-change\u0022 mechanism to make it work smoothly.
