These are by no means meant to be realistic or even efficient, and are by no means my first FAR craft, though they are my first real supersonics. I do like using them, they repurpose to be interplanetary shuttles quite well from orbit, with 5k dV, more if i arrange to lose the skippers. the crew capacity is something of a key in this design. I need to lift as many crew as feasible per launch, with enough \u0027living space\u0027 for them to go interplanet in the ssto after a refuel. When this does reach orbit its generally still holding 1.5k dV.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt weighs 220tonnes without the jaydo solids and relies on a TWR of \u0026gt;1 to \u0027fly\u0027. 3 jumbos, pair of 32\u0027s and then the 1.25m core is i think an 800 and a 200.

I have 2 others that will reach orbit from the runway, both considerably heavier, based on 3.75m and 5m cores. They dont really get more dV into orbit, but are awesomely useful once refueled at the station. My mod-shuttles are able to ditch their lift-surfaces once in orbit and become interplanetarys or hab sections. I just plain like the idea, all of these would launch better vertically, I just dont wanna since these can always re-enter if they want. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-04T09:59:03Z\u0022 title=\u002202/04/2014 09:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 4, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by celem\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Surefoot","CreatedById":89084,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-04T12:24:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@celem: your design has a lot of flaws.

But I must say, I always use FAR, too. Though, I don\u0027t think FAR changes anything in the way control surfaces move.\u003Cp\u003EActually, my need to tweak control surfaces is tied to spaceships, rather than planes. The control surfaces behaviour is mostly similar for both, but while right/left simmetry is enough for planes, then is often not the case for spaceships: up/down simmetry is required as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo show what I mean, please look at the winged spaceship on the pad. I have set the spoilers to max deflection (75\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0) to better show. All control surfaces move in the same direction, both on wings and tail. The only exception, the upside-down winglets below the wings. But, both winglets on the \u0022up\u0022 side of the wings have turned left (on both the right and left wing). The winglets on the \u0022down\u0022 side have turned opposite, instead (that is more in line with what I would).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe issue is (far more with FAR then in stock KSP) that using spoilers that way will generate asymetric forces. So, I want to be able to choose (as KSP can\u0027t do so correctly) the direction each control surface will move as a spoiler, and so doing keep aerodynamic forces balanced\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECorrect me if I\u0027m wrong, but just to be clear the behavior you\u0027re questioning is these two:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://toad.homelinux.net/pics/KSP/weird_spoiler_emphasis.png\u0022 alt=\u0022weird_spoiler_emphasis.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, correct this if I\u0027m wrong: you are currently only toggling the \u0022spoiler\u0022 control; you are not yawing, rolling, pitching, or flapping.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConsider this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://toad.homelinux.net/pics/KSP/weird_spoiler_axes.png\u0022 alt=\u0022weird_spoiler_axes.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think that\u0027s a control issue with FAR or something to be tweaked. The issue here is that those winglets are a single-axis control surface (like all/most of the control surfaces in the game), with a rotational axis pointing mostly along the yaw axis, or \u0022up\u0022 and slightly \u0022back\u0022 relative to the base of the part, as I\u0027ve indicated. The spoiler control commands surfaces to rotate in around the \u0022pitch\u0022 axis, with is nearly orthogonal to the control axis of the part. In KSP, control surfaces will rotate if they think they are capable of affecting the axis being commanded (and are allowed to rotate based on the current action). But, to determine that, they do some trigonometry based on their local transform vector and the commanded rotation vector and the center of inertia of the part, to decide if they can help and if so, which direction they should move to do so. So, because the rotation vector in question is pitch, and because they are both on the same side of the center of inertia relative to the pitch axis (\u0022forward\u0022 of it, probably), they both decide to turn the same way. What\u0027s strangest to me is that on the other side of the wing, they\u0027ve chosen opposite directions. This might be a 2nd/4th quadrant ambiguity or something like that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, I would question whether or not you actually want \u0022spoiler\u0022 behavior on those winglets. If looks like you\u0027re building a VTO spaceplane and those are your vertical stabilizers: you probably do not want them to actuate when you are trying to spoil your aerodynamics. Those are primarily for yaw stability, and I don\u0027t think you will get the behavior you want by commanding them on the spoiler controls.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, all of this to say: I could make a tweakable that, in theory, would reverse the direction of a part when commanded as a flap or a spoiler. But, that would not work well with your configuration above because the winglet that is \u0022correctly\u0022 turning opposite its mate on the \u0022bottom\u0022 of the craft would also reverse (thanks to symmetry).\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Surefoot","CreatedById":89084,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-04T23:15:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks to Ferram\u0027s suggestion, this beauty:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZCGZRZB.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ZCGZRZB.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eis now fully functional (as in, able to take off by herself).

I have been trying to readjust my orientation, as I thought it might have to do with my reentry angle, etc. I noticed that the S2 cockpit (as well as the part behind it) from b9 produces 150 units of drag during reentry, and the fuel tank at the rear of the shuttle in the same conditions produces 15 units of drag. Could anyone help me in determining the reasoning behind this?
