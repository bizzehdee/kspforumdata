Looking forward to seeing what you come up with for a flag (and I do understand about not being good with graphics design).\u003Cp\u003EAlso excited for the next update, this mod keeps getting better and better. Tweaking the girders and small landing legs sounds like a good compromise all around, it should prevent girder exploits while still providing a relatively durable part for small, early landers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI m not sure what to use as a logo in general and it is very low priority at the moment (due to needing lots of time because I m not good at it while only providing very little benefit), so it may take quite some time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout the girders, I m not sure I want ot tweak the IR rework parts yet and I also hesitate to change the landing gear stuff, so there is still plenty of opportunity for exploits.

Crzyrndm the author feels it is far enough along to be integrated if you wanted of course. Really helps balance RW by making their available torque depletable. It also opens the door to new way to design/balance RWs with bleed rate, the rate at which a RW regain torque after use has ceased a recharge rate if you will, and torque capacity, which is a function of the available torque, which is the amount of force over time that can be applied before the RW is depleted, like fuel for an engine. If that is confusing it is explained better in the thread.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Svm420\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Svm420\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYes they are still unlimited, but must regenerate over time to be useful again after being depleted. It feel like a nice balance between realism and stock. Though I dont think there is any other mod that attempt to bring RWs to reality levels. And it has made RCS much more important in my game. I hope to see the mod expanded with a variety of RWs to choose from. It would be even better to just be procedural and enter parameters you want for the RW. Then each wheel is tailored for the craft.
