It\u0027s directly under your rocket, often blocking a non-negligible chunk of whatever you\u0027re looking at. Vertical space is scarce on a widescreen, and the navball uses way too much of it. It should really be off to the side. So a few years back I made Draggable Navball, a mod that lets you drag it somewhere more convenient. While stock has added a settings slider for the navball position since then, it\u0027s still nice to be able to adjust it on the fly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome others found the altimeter\u0027s position irritating, so I made a similar mod for that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDraggable Controls merges the two, and is intended to supercede them. It\u0027s mostly useful to people with a multi-monitor setup, where there\u0027s lots of empty space to use.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCredit to LGG for the name and for staying on me to actually do this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ENotes\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDraggable Controls is intended to supercede navball/altimeter. The latter probably won\u0027t receive any more updates. Not that they needed many in the first place, but still.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nv1.0.0 is intentionally feature-identical to navball\u002Baltimeter, to minimize migration surprises.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nNow (august 2022) is a good time to propose additional features. Not promising to implement anything, but the project is fresh in my head at the moment.\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIn particular, while it\u0027s not supported yet because of the v1.0.0 note above, it\u0027s now technically possible to enable vertical dragging via a config file option. Not great, but functional.

My partially-implemented unlock just remembers the navball\u0027s vertical position at startup and snaps to that, but that doesn\u0027t work for the other screen edges. I can clamp an object\u0027s position to arbitrary values easily enough, but what I actually want to clamp is its *bounds relative to the screen*, and I\u0027m not sure how to get those.
