Your version works just fine. Also, the link in the first post comes with a mac OSX version and I\u0027ve never seen that before. Anyway, as there looks to be an editor overhaul coming in the next release, it\u0027s probably nothing to get excited about. This is a nice mod to have in the meantime.

If you put, say, 4 objects around a central object using VAB 4x symmetry, and then you swap to SPH mode with mirror symmetry in order to place mirrored parts on just two of those four objects, superficially it looks like it works, but it actually places FOUR instances of the object on the opposite side. You caninstantly see it\u0027s doing this with Z-fighting that\u0027s produced by the extra instances, and if you use a robotic piece from MSI it\u0027s even clearer when a whole bunch more pieces show up in the robotics editor window than there should be. This bug has been around forever, and perhaps due to the way I build stuff I\u0027m constantly having trouble with it.

I\u0027ve had problems with symmetry just in the SPH without even using EE, though, which is why I thought it might be a game limitation (even though you can\u0027t edit things with SPH symmetry in teh stock game unless you copy your VAB ships into your SPH folder). For example, say you want wings both on top of and underneath a fuel tank on either side of a plane - the smart thing to do is obviously to rotate your craft so the wing/tank is pointing up, then stick your wings on with mirror symmetry so you can put wings on one side and they will automatically be added to the other, then you can re-orient the tank and stick it back on the fuselage with symmetry on so you then have your four wings sections (one above and below the tank on each side of the craft.
