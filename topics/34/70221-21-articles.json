Eve looks sweet from the ground, orbit just doesn\u0027t convey it\u0027s turbulence though. Duna looks almost resorty from orbit, and while the ground shows much more in the way of sandstorms, it still isn\u0027t really intense enough. I can\u0027t wait to see stormy Laythe. Jool\u0027s rings seem to have lost any texture and basically are just a dark shader now? what happened to the particulate designs we saw back in May? The rest of the bodies for the most part just appear to be made sharper from orbit is all. I\u0027d love to see more down in the way that Minmus got the ground cover effects. I\u0027m not sure if you\u0027ve checked out the astronomers pack for EVE, but the way it added additional particulate even to places like pol was neat, and I\u0027d love to see that adapted here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOtherwise, Jumping to support EVE v8 beta\u0027s, even if it means not supporting 7.3 anymore would be great.
