Why is this happens is beyond my mind and imagination - it just happens, let\u0027s stop at this point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring my tests, I have noticed two things:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- First, SAS could really benefit from added weight - it can greatly increase stability under new joint system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Second, and most important: SAS rings from NovaPunch are underpowered. For example: we\u0027ve got stock Inline Reaction Wheel that has weight of 0.3, torque of 20 and energy consumption (ECon for short) of 0.3. Compare this to MPM-125, which stands at weight of 0.27, torque 5 and ECon of 0.5. A question arises: why use MPM-125, except of good looks?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I propose is: Turn NovaPunch SAS modules into \u0022high cost, high reward\u0022 parts. The following is results of my testing and some thoughts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFormat: Weight\\Torque\\ECon\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E1.

Heavy 1.25m ships could benefit from it - they won\u0027t notice slight weight increase, and they usually have some solar panels or RTGs to generate enough electricity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E2.

But people who doesn\u0027t like high amount of parts or just want their ships look good (and NP SAS rings looks cool, no doubt here) will use that part. It can be especially useful on space stations - they usually have huge amounts of electricity, and people tends to limit their part count because of possibly lag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E3.
