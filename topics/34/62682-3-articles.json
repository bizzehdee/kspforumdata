Now, say you want one of my systems. Go hit the download link on one of your choice, and You should open it to see the system name, open one folder deeper and you find gamedata. just copy and paste that into your KSP gamedata, and when it says overwrite for BoulderCo,(clouds mod) click all yes. I recommend you create a separate save file so you dot mess up your previous saves, but enabling the system is pretty straight forward. You will get a little box at the top left of you screen with system names, uncheck all but mine. That should be it!
