But here are some observations from my few launch tests with the Saturn S1C stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) The more launch clamps attached radially the worse the twist is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Using alternative engines of similar total thrust with bottom node attachments (RD-191/RD-170 from Soviet Engine Pack at .64 scale.) and using the 2.5m FASA launch clamp on the central RD-170, the roll was GREATLY reduced (4 total launch clamps, CL engine, and 3 of the SPACE-Y super clamps at every 120 degrees.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2a) Using only bottom attach launch clamps of the 1.25 and 2.5m FASA persuasion eliminated Launch twist to a non issue (It was so negligible that I couldn\u0027t see it under the low resolution NAV-BALL. However the Full Saturn V tries to tip over with just these. During the Test I was using a probe core on a parachute equipped and properly fared S1C stage only.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) issue is even worse with Nova sized 1st stage. Same test conditions as above\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Issue is mitigated with asparagus style launch of smaller diameter \u0022stages\u0022 until you get to about 10-15meter radius launch stacks then it can appear again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehypothesis: Radial launch clamps are staged sequentially. At a smaller radii it is not noticeable. But the higher number of clamps \u002B Greater radii cause enough lag for some radial clamps to release before others with a \u0022Physics calculation scene\u0022 in the middle of the release process. I believe this is tide in some way to the NODE SIZE and an internal calculation dealing with the greater radius than expected (EG 5m class instead of 3.75m class.) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENOTE: I have not tested this with any other 5m tanks or other 5m class engine/engine launch plates.
