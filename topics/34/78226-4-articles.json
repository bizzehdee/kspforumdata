The first is that since the periapsis was above ~22km the debris wasn\u0027t destroyed by the atmosphere (it will remain in orbit and won\u0027t ever aerobrake unless you switch to it in the tracking station). Therefore SR won\u0027t activate, since it wasn\u0027t destroyed. Secondly, even if it was destroyed there is a possibility it wouldn\u0027t get recovered by this as StageRecovery only recovers things that are \u0022Flying\u0022 or \u0022Sub-Orbital\u0022 but not things that are \u0022Orbiting\u0022. I don\u0027t know precisely what the cutoff is, but I believe the periapsis can be no higher than 18 km to be considered Sub-Orbital.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you aim to drop the stage with a periapsis of 18km or lower, it should be recovered just fine. You can check the status of debris by opening the map and clicking the debris icon at the top. Doing that lets you see the orbits and icons for debris.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magico13","CreatedById":73338,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-05T19:22:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENew version up! (Hopefully with less bugs off the bat than last time) This version required an almost total rewrite, or at least reorganization. There are two primary features and a bug fix.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E1st Feature: The Flight GUI.\u003C/strong\u003E This window, accessible by clicking the StageRecovery icon on the toolbar (Blizzy\u0027s or stock) shows a detailed, but simple to use, GUI for viewing ALL Stages recovered or destroyed since the Flight Scene was started (aka, starting a flight or switching to a vessel from the tracking station). This GUI is far less annoying and intrusive than the messages popping up for every single stage (with all the information crammed into a tiny space) so you will likely want to disable those, but they are still available if you want them. When you leave the flight scene (go to VAB/SPH or Space Center or Tracking Station) the lists get reset. To close it, just click the button that you used to open it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing it is simple. Just click on either \u0022Recovered\u0022 or \u0022Destroyed\u0022, then the name of the Stage you want to view information about. Then you can easily view information about the Parts recovered, Crew, Science, or additional Info like distance from KSC or terminal velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E2nd Feature: Editor Helper.\u003C/strong\u003E Clicking on the StageRecovery icon while in the editor will calculate the terminal velocity of the ENTIRE vessel (including fuel) with ALL of the parachutes deployed and display it in a stock message. Build a replica of the stage you want to drop, drain out the fuel with tweakables (unless you want to use the maximum mass), and click the button. If the message is red, no recovery, if it\u0027s blue then it at least partially recover. Click the message to see the terminal velocity and the percentage recovered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBug fix: I had a bug in calculating the terminal velocities of stages. I was missing a square root, which caused all the calculated velocities to be smaller than they really were. You likely will need more parachutes if you were only using this for determining a good mix of parachutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have questions, please feel free to ask!

I should be able to get around that by looking at the ConfigNode instead of the loaded module. Hopefully that\u0027s all the issue is. If so, it\u0027ll be fixed later today. That problem doesn\u0027t manifest with RealChute because of how I have to deal with that module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit2: Hmm, harder than I thought since the ConfigNode doesn\u0027t seem to store the fullyDeployedDrag (for some unknown reason).
