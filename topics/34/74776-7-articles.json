Right now, I\u0027m encountering a massive physics slowdown that seems to be related to the universe-shifting krackensbane above velocities of 750 m/s. I\u0027ve only encountered these when part counts are high, but lately I seem to get them all the time and it\u0027s been right annoying. I\u0027m going to pull your mod, kerbin-city, and kerbtown and see if I still get the same slowdown rate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I\u0027m right, there may indeed be a reason why Kerbin City was set up as huge blocks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Test One Complete.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBad news. I was right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore I removed Kerbin Side, Kerbin City, and Kerbtown, the degredation of my physics time rate dropped to 0.4 (40% of real time). Upon removal, I got a solid 1.0 on it. And I think I understand why...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Krakensbane works by capping a vessel\u0027s velocity off at 750 m/s, then removing any excess velocity values and dumping them into a master value. It applies these values to the rest of the universe and shifts it in accordance with these velocity values. Effectively, once you hit 750 m/s, Futurama physics start coming into play. The universe moves around the ship so the ship can remain at a \u0027low\u0027 velocity to keep numbers accurate in the physics engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat this means for you, is that the more static objects you have, the more the krakensbane has to process to move the universe. In the case of the static objects being placed, that means brutal physics slowdown.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT 2: Check 2 has been done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood news on this front, it\u0027s not the Kerbtown plugin in-and-of itself. So it\u0027s the number of static objects being added. If you want to keep adding things, I suggest you start trying to optimize the locations and merging independent objects into one huge mass.
