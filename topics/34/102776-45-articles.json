I estimate 220 m/s for landing/launch, and about 100 m/s to break orbit and return to Kerbin. Capture can bite you if you use an inefficient transfer but with an efficient flightpath that too can be around 100 m/s. What got me is the fuel used hovering, combined with the trouble finding flat terrain for landing, but then again Aptur\u0027s gravity is weak enough that when I did tip my lander (by bumping the Kerbal into it) I simply put it upright with the magic of reaction wheels.\n\nAptur ended up being my first Kerballed target and notwithstanding Bob\u0027s predicament I feel I made a good choice. Once I have him back I think I\u0027ll take on Serran next, because new worlds are more fun than the Mun, and I can unlock even more science gear ready for a Mun station or base with the lab."},{"CreatedByName":"ABZB","CreatedById":98947,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-26T19:36:24Z","Content":"Stupid question - at about what reputation level should I expect to start receiving explore-body contracts for out-of-Sonnah bodies?"},{"CreatedByName":"Tynrael","CreatedById":144990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-26T19:42:45Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Stupid question - at about what reputation level should I expect to start receiving explore-body contracts for out-of-Sonnah bodies?\n\nI had mine occur at about 74% reputation, which appears to fit with the distance from Kerbin speculation.
