Touching any part of the square would set the virtual joystick position to the appropriate angle, and it could be zeroed by sliding to the centre deadzone area, or releasing and touching the deadzone. The horizontal and vertical bars allowed accurate single-axis movements. It can be a bit tricky to set up as it\u0027s 9 individual cursor-sensitive areas, but it worked well.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo rather then press and hold to drag the virtual joystick around, where ever you tapped in the larger square was the joystick angle, with a finger sized square in the middle that when tapped zeroed the joystick?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could see that working. However, that would effectively disable SAS. When SAS is enabled it overrides all other inputs. When inputs are being entered, SAS is disabled for as long as the inputs are present (even though the SAS light stays on). So I tap slightly east (right) for my gravity turn. SAS is now disabled until I tap the center again to zero the joystick.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, a thought I had for touchscreens that are drag enabled (I\u0027m pretty sure most are these days) is to set the dead zone to where ever the finger first touches and interpolate from there. There would have to be a border around the edge that is simply \u0022max\u0022 to account for variations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Random numbers picked)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EControl area is 240 pixels wide, 20 pixel border that if touched maxed out the joystick. That leaves a 200 pixel wide area to drag the finger around in. So the finger touches at pixel 115,122, so 5 pixels off horizontally and 2 pixels off vertically, for this touch, 115,122 is my zero. Then for each pixel moved, the joystick moves 1% in that direction (200 pixels wide = 100 pixels in each direction from zero.) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe zero point would reset every time you touched the joystick control area. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe disadvantage to this is that when you reached the edge it would jump to 100%. On the 115,122 example, when the joystick crossed from 21,122 to 20,122 it would jump from 95% to 100% because it hits the \u0027max\u0027 border at the edge of the control area.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure, I like my second example of dragging the joystick around, but I\u0027m assuming all (or at least most) touchscreens are drag-enabled for that to work.

Of course that means you can\u0027t right-click anymore. The Surface has the pen which still works fine for right-click, but that\u0027s a special case. Ultimately though, it\u0027s probably better to leave it on, since turning it off doesn\u0027t seem to affect the click-and-drag, or the click-and-hold function. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the VAB you can build something using just the touchscreen. You can touch the object, then let go, then touch and hold and drag the object into place. This works ok, the problem is that the part description won\u0027t disappear after touching a part in the list. The description window just follows you around wherever you touch. You can get rid of it with the pen, but again, that\u0027s a special case. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI managed to get into orbit and land with the Kerbal X ok, though I did get stuck in IVA near the end. I found that touching and holding doesn\u0027t work, but if you touch then drag your finger a bit you can get the click-and-hold effect, making turning and throttling up easier. Maneuver nodes are tricky but it is possible to grab a vector and pull it out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also found that the standard pinch-to-zoom seems to be recognized. In flight it works like normal, zooming the camera in or out, but in the VAB it moves the camera up or down.
