He told us! Yay!\n\nApparently it was implemented in 0.24 but was never used (hence the word \u0022Test\u0022 in the module). It\u0027s a fully-developed motor-like module. It works fine, with tweakables too. No problems of any kind with the system, just that it was never coded into a part. So I coded it into a part, and now EVERYONE can use it! By the way, the module is ModuleJointMotorTest.\n\nSo basically it rotates the nodes connected to it. It has 3 modes: Park, where it stays still, Neutral, where it\u0027s neutral, and Drive, where it rotates. The speed and force can be changed w/ tweakables, and there\u0027s also a reverse. You can also set it to a throttle \u003E speed setting to, it\u0027s useful for planes and helicopters. When making helicopters, it is recommended to put a Neutral motor below the rotation systems, so it doesn\u0027t spin you. Uh, blah blah blah no \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E blah blah thank you for downloading blah.\n\nP.S. Struts and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E wires/pipes will in fact obstruct movement. Loss of life due to excessive spinning is not covered by warranty. Warranty will be voided if used to fling A-C-Class asteroids at things.\n\nThe thing about this is that, unlike InfernalRobotics, it doesn\u0027t use any added plugins, so RAM usage is minimized. MJMT is a fully stock module, so it shouldn\u0027t take up much memory.\n\nAction groups don\u0027t work, by the way. Sorry.\n\nCurseForge page: [http://kerbal.curseforge.com/ksp-mods/223357-spin-o-tron-motors](http://kerbal.curseforge.com/ksp-mods/223357-spin-o-tron-motors)\n\n**Download** **from** ***KerbalStuff*****:** *[removed link to defunct website]*\n\n***Known Issues***\n\n- Kerbal Joint Reinforcement\n\nIt seems to make the motors refuse to spin. Complain to ferram4 if you want this fixed.\n\n**Credits** -\n\n*Squad* - KSP, motor module (coding for it), docking ports of which the motors are based on\n\n***Yargnit*** **** - Motor module (or at least revealing it)\n\n**Me** - coding it, period\n\n**I completely do not own any part of this mod, other than nothing really. In fact, I don\u0027t even own the thumbnail of this mod (it\u0027s one of Squad\u0027s flags). I simply coded it to fit the requirements of a motor. Textures, model, KSP, and the motor module belong to Squad.**\n\nThe contents of this mod are distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License, found here:\n\n[http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)\n\nEDIT 5/21/15: Wow, I completely forgot I had this forum post.
