Plasma thrusters have the same power priority as the fusion reactor\u0027s input power. Plasma thrusters will take 100% of the produced power at 100% throttle, causing the tokamak power requirements to slowly drain your power reserves. If the priority could be adjusted so plasma thrusters take 100% of the power left after the fusion reactors get their cut, it would be easier to guarantee that things would work continuously (although it can run for quite some time as it is, given the fairly slow drain of the reactors compared to the reserves). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003EPlasma thrusters don\u0027t actually seem to respect their rated max power. Image below demonstrates this bug as well as the previous issue (1.25m plasma thruster with rated max power input of 25 GW is consuming over 32 GW, and net power is negative by the total reactor power input requirements).\u003C/span\u003E Disregard that. Apparently the figure listed in the tooltip is the maximum power \u003Cem\u003Eafter efficiency is taken into account\u003C/em\u003E, so LiquidFuel with an efficiency of 72% has a maximum power consumption of 25/0.72 = 34.7 GW. Was this documented anywhere? It should be.

Thermal generators were altered so they can consume ChargedParticles as if they were ThermalPower. This is nice if you only attach a thermal generator, preventing you from wasting 20% of your D-T fusion reactor\u0027s output. However, if you attach both types of generator, the thermal generator will still consume ChargedParticles simulataneously with the direct conversion generator. This effectively causes the reactor\u0027s ChargedParticle production to be counted twice in the maximum available power figures. You can, in fact, get that much power, but only for as long as your stockpile of ChargedParticles lasts, which is not very long at all. It also confuses the electrical engines- plasma thrusters at 100% will attempt to draw the maximum available power; since this is unsustainable due to the double-counting, this will cause the thrusters to rapidly drain your power reserves at 100% throttle.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-03T20:16:45Z\u0022 title=\u002205/03/2014 08:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 3, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by ArcFurnace\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Woodstar","CreatedById":99637,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-03T19:29:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI figured it out, I just had to turn down the beamed power level an tiny bit now it is running stable.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-03T19:37:32Z\u0022 title=\u002205/03/2014 07:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 3, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Woodstar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ArcFurnace","CreatedById":109240,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-03T19:31:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI suspect that\u0027s the issue with combined thermal\u002Bdirect conversion generators causing the \u0022theoretical supply\u0022 to be set to an unsustainable level (issue #3 in my most recent post).

With an upgraded 2.5m fusion they should be giving you 2000 kN on the runway and peak at about 2500 or so. I angle for about a 40 degree rise and run them on IntakeAir mode until about 15000 meters when they drop under about 600 kN, at which point I switch them to rocket mode burning LFO. Now they\u0027re doing about 720 kN. But the magic is that their ISP even in LFO mode is crazy high, ~4000 or so. So they\u0027ll do that 720 kN for a long long time.

I do have the yaw issue during takeoff as well, but if I pull the nose up quickly enough, it doesn\u0027t get to the rolling over stage.

Wide-stance landing gear also helps some for landing, gives you more restoring force when you touch down and helps prevent wingtip strikes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"phoenix_ca","CreatedById":50380,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-04T06:45:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks Arc.

I have posted this question three times now. I built four ships that are all using the 3.75 fusion reactor and generator in ktec mode. They are all upgraded parts. Three of them are beaming power and the third is a transfer stage using the DT Vista engine. They are all working as expected and have been running non-stop for several kerbal years.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem started day before yesterday I tried to build an updated transfer stage that I was to assemble in orbit with a pair of DT Vista engines. I assembled the ship and started the fusion reactor and it was fine. Then IU switched to another ship to do something and when I came back the reactor was offline. I restarted it then switched ships and immediately switched back and the reactor was offline again. I fiddled with this for hours trying everything I could think but I cannot keep the reactor online if I switch to another ship!!! I even warped time for a year with the ship active and the reactor ran non-stop just fine. Then I reverted back and switched ships and came back and the damn reactor was offline again! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo next I built a test bed with nothing but a reactor, a generator, 6 radiators, batteries, and a computer core and stuck it on the pad started the reactor switched away came back and the same thing happens - the reactor is offline!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I took one of the two ships that are working loaded them from the vab stuck one on the pad and started the reactor and switched away and come back and the reactor is still running?!?!?!?!? WTH? Why are the original ships working fine but every new ship I build with the same damn parts going offline as soon as they are not the active ship? I can link craft file if anyone cares to check them.
