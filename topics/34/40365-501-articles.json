The toroidal warp bubble the proposed drive used meant that it had to be with at least as big a. radius as the rest of the ship, and some more, so it could actually be contained within the torus bounds. In many Interstellar so designs, it\u0027s not uncommon to see huge ships with a measly ring at a corner, and it really doesn\u0027t make sense. If you don\u0027t want to add a crapload of parts just for the different sizes, you could use a procedural approach, like the Procedural Fairings mod. Also, integration to the tech tree would mean that, even if they reached that far into the tree, they would need to advance further for their success to be able to accommodate something practically (or unpractically- where the problem is most obvious \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E ) large in them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, an Alcubierre drive requires at least two warp rings, almost at the edges of the ship -once again, because of its own nature.

Now, 170 Mj is not much in this mod, and shows quite a discrepancy of energy densities between stock and Interstellar parts.
