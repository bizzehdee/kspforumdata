I had built a probe with plans to send it to Neidon. I burned from Kerbin to intercept Neidon (in 21 years \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E) but as soon as my probe left Kerbin\u0027s SOI, my screen would go black and my altimeter would sometimes also show NaN. The only way to fix the issue would be to shut down the game completely and revert from an old save. This would happen every time I tried again. The lame thing is that since KSP doesn\u0027t actually crash, I didn\u0027t have an error report to look over afterwards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI \u003Cem\u003Eam\u003C/em\u003E running a fair number of mods, so I did some research by uninstalling them one at a time to see if they were causing the issue. I tried it without Kerbal Alarm Clock, ScanSat, and Kerbal Engineer Redux (they seemed like the most likely culprits to me), but each time the issue would still occur.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I thought that maybe it was messing with KSP because I was sending the probe so far out. So I then tried reloading the probe and changing it\u0027s burn to instead intercept Jool. Strangely, the issue still occurred. I then reverted, deleted the probe, and changed my focus to one of my other ships that I had built and sent towards Jool. These ships were built prior to the problematic probe, but after installing the Outer Planets mod. Sadly, shifting my focus to these ships caused the same error.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo then I got really sad, and sat in my room in the dark to bemoan how unfair it should be that I am the only one who appears to be having this issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I realized that I couldn\u0027t just give up on it; not when there were still things I could try out. After doing some research on the \u0022NaN black screen Kraken\u0022 glitch, it seemed like it was usually brought about by mods that modify planet locations/sizes/orbits, specifically when a ship is unexpectedly in the SOI of more than one body... or something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I got back on my original, heavily-modded build of KSP and opened up a new game in sandbox mode. I built a big ol\u0027 probe and sent it directly to Sarnus. I left the SOI of Kerbin without any issues. I went back and forth between the space center and my ship, time warped, and did everything in my power to try and recreate the error, but luckily everything went fine. 4 in-game years later, my probe was orbiting Sarnus, flying through the rings, and making fly-bys of Hale. It was flippin\u0027 glorious!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL:DR - Installing this mod to an existing save \u003Cem\u003Emay\u003C/em\u003E cause black screen issues.

I burnt for an encounter with Sarnus from Kerbin and made a quicksave afterwards. When I leave Kerbins SOI with Kerbal Engineer installed the debugging log keeps spamming errors. When I focus Sarnus from map-view the screen turns black but the HUD is still visible and the game gets very slow. By pressing \u0022m\u0022 again I can see my vessel but no skybox or other bodys. I can go back to the SpaceCenter and everythings seems normal except there is still no skybox or other bodys. While time-warping I can see the day-night cycle by the brightness of the terrain around but no Kerbol at all. In the tracking station everything is black except the HUD. Back in the mainmenu I see the skybox but when I resume the game again no skybox.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a game-restart everything is normal again.
