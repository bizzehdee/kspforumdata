I still do not see the toolbar icon until I start to build a ship, then a new button appears (but it is just a blank white square), and the VOID windows open up as I have seen in screen shots. I also lose the ability to make maneuver nodes in the orbital map, but I am guessing it is a function you can use through void that isn\u0027t functioning correctly due to whatever problem I am having.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SilentBish\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SilentBish\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOk, I found out why the maneuvers weren\u0027t working. I am playing career mode and just needed to upgrade buildings.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis all seems like correct behavior; the toolbar icon does not and should not appear in the editor until you start building (or load) a ship. VOID doesn\u0027t change anything related to your building upgrades in career mode at this point, so if you can\u0027t make a maneuver node yet, you can\u0027t use VOID\u0027s maneuver node functionality.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe one thing that stands out is the blank white square; that seems to reflect an incorrectly-loaded texture, which isn\u0027t supported by the log you linked later on. Has that problem persisted? When you click on the blank white icon, does the VOID menu window open and close?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SilentBish\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SilentBish\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESorry for the triple post.
