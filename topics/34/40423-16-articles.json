It\u0027s absolutely indispensable for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, I really hope you\u0027re able to pull off a visual indicator for the target port cycler in a way that\u0027s useful. The handy Targetron mod tries to help with this by highlighting the target port in red. However, because it\u0027s merely changing the color of the part (just like mousing over a part), it is almost impossible to discern from more than about 50m away, especially if it\u0027s a cluttered visual environment. I don\u0027t know of any \u0022subtle\u0022 way that target highlighting is actually useful. It seems to me that a fairly large HUD-like visual overlay is necessary to make a visual indicator that actually works for a straight-in approach. Otherwise, we\u0027re forced to move in close (~50m) and stop with near-zero relative motion, ID the appropriate port - which might require some substantial moving around - then finish the approach and dock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, good luck with everything and thank you again for this excellent mod.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
