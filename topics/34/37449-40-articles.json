I have noticed that with an active vehicle that is undergoing time warp, electric consumption rates stop increasing after 50X.

Each time I switch back to them after a week or two doing other things I find an accumulations of CO2 and waste water and have to keep them focussed for a bit to get the recyclers to turn them (or rather 90% of them) back into O2 and water. Is this a known issue with TAC or have I found a mod incompatibility?

In my mind, the perfect setup would have the resource bar show number of kerbin days, and have each kerbal use 1 ration of each per day. Let the parts be the difference in how much they hold. Obviously we need more water than we need food, so maybe the water container holds less days worth of rations. This cuts the quick math down on a trip from calculating knowing how much you have divided by how many kerbals you have divided by knowing how much each kerbal uses per day, and lets you quickly see how many days you have of each if you had ONE kerbal, and then your math has to be devide that by how many kerbals you have and there\u0027s the number of days you\u0027ll go. But I\u0027m also not a hyper realist when it comes to KSP. it\u0027s a fun game, not a perfect real life simulator. So I like to be able to quickly piece things together, but still have the challenge of making sure it all goes right. So it comes back to altering how many days worth each part will hold. Yes, you can bundle an all-in-one pack to have 1 day\u0027s worth of each, but also have parts varried in size due to a days worth of water is going to take up more space than a days worth of snacks.

Imagine a Laythe base or space station that uses a craft to jump down into the water, soak up some oxygen and water, and then hopping back up to the station to refill it.
