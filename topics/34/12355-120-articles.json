Probably because of poor PID implementation You can mitigate it somewhat by playing with PID values, especially for D but in general, MJ can\u0027t do something as simple as a 180 degree rotation without a lot of unnecessary control input which manifests itself in a lot of unnecessary RCS usage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry doing something like ordering SmartASS to do a 180 degree rotation.

If you were in a hurry, worst case is you hold down the control so that RCS fires non-stop until up to halfway through, then fire in the opposite direction for exactly as how long as you were firing the first thruster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut you wouldn\u0027t sit there alternating keys rapidly nonstop... it\u0027s a wonder MJ2 can even do something as simple as orienting the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESarbian has gone a long way towards eliminating that behavior.

In 0.21, every vehicle needs some source of electricity to power the reaction wheels which now come by default in the command pods and probe cores. So slap an RTG or 2 on your rocket and see if that solves the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone have an idea what might be the cause?
