I took two kerbals one with a very low stat (the higher cost low stupid amount) and a high stat (lower cost high stupid) and the productivity was better with higher stupidity. Can someone help clear this up, I don\u0027t want to spend a ton of funds on the incorrect option and have low productivity.\n\nIn theory and in practice from what I can tell, stupidity is \u0027bad\u0027, so the higher it is the less efficient your kerbals should be. Be sure that you aren\u0027t comparing pilots and engineers at the same time. I know MKS/OKS gives a massive multiplier boost to Engineers over Pilots for example, a big enough boost that it would overcome any difference in stupidity I believe.\n\nI shall double check the source code on MKS/OKS and EPL tonight to make sure I have this right. If not I shall correct the mod ASAP.\n\nAlso hope to make a few other changes in the next day or two as streaming time allows. In particular I want to fix the VAB/SPH access bug (right now it goes to the old complex if you enter from there).\n\nI also really really want to get it so that the star rating of the available kerbals of that career type cap the level for that career (at -1) so that having a level 2 pilot would cap your new pilots to level 1 while the pilot trainer was there for them.\n\nOther things that have been mentioned is the ability to sort the active roster. I\u0027m looking into that but as I mentioned before that would require changing another core part of the complex. I may do it yet but it is lower priority.\n\nPlease note that as for names I have carefully set it so that if you remove my mod your kerbal careers will not change. The names match the career types, which is how KSP tests for some kerbal\u0027s career.\n\n-OakTree42\n\n[http://www.twitch.tv/oaktree42/](http://www.twitch.tv/oaktree42/)"},{"CreatedByName":"Herr Doktor Strangemember","CreatedById":107551,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T00:42:04Z","Content":"Awesome mod, perfect solution to those MKS problems of 30 pilots and one(!!) engineer. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"helaeon","CreatedById":101767,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T03:53:39Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Right now the kerbal name is tied to the career so there is no way to let the player \u0027choose\u0027 the name. I\u0027ll see if I can think of something here though. What about a system where you hit a button and it pulls up three kerbals with stats /near/ what you requested? So you can pick from say three (each name shown along with stats). So you don\u0027t get the exact stats you want but you get a range of things near your desired stats?\n\u003E I can also see the fearless trait being random again, not just a yes/no but I do think that you should be able to see it if it will effect some mods... as it does in some efficiency math.\n\nSounds perfectly fine to me. I knew the name was tied to the career, so some preview of the name would be more than sufficient. 3 to pick from would be awesome.\n\nThat system sounds great with the near but not exact stats .

Tourists provide no value.

You will very likely need multiple launches, as these can be bulky components.\n\nThis means that the profession of the Kerbals has an impact ratio on the module efficiency of 3:2:1 as for engineers:scientists:pilots. On the other hand there seems to be an impact of the Kerbals intelligence on the efficiency but the amount isn\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t clear. If someone could find a statement about how much the Kerbal\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s intelligence might affect module efficiency it would be very much appreciated.\n\nHowerver there is also an impact of the intelligence on EL productivity:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E [https://github.com/BobPalmer/MKS/wiki/FAQ](https://github.com/BobPalmer/MKS/wiki/FAQ)\n\u003E MKS/OKS currently does not utilize the Courage or Stupidity ratings, however EL does factor Stupidity and Skill in the Productivity and Vessel Productivity calculations.
