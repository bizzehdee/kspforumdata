So I think for the time you have the building blocks there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince this is about the generators and not the tanks. That is my opinion any way. I think you have a good idea and if you stay on track making a prototype of each generator and giving it unique and interesting qualities. Then you will have an exciting and winning mod. Hell may be you could even make a Nuclear Power Plant. They have launched those into space from time to time. And no, I am not talking about an RTG. If you stay the coarse and get advice from those that care, I think you can really be up there!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
