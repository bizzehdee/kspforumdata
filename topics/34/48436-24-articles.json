If I fill a standard tank with 100% H2 the mass ratio of just the tank turns out to be around 1.75 which gives dV = 4,390 at 800 ISP. For a tank filled with MMH/N2O4 you get a mass ratio of 11.1 which gives dV = 8,030 at 340 ISP. So yeah I think that in just Real Fuels w/o Real Mass it is best to just avoid the NTRs. (Note my version is 3.1 or 3.2 so slightly old and I apologize if this has somehow been changed) I don\u0027t know how this changes with Real Masses but I suspect it brings it more in favor of the NTRs. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps all!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AbeS","CreatedById":80644,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-18T01:39:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDid you check with the balloon cryo tanks? they have less mass, haven\u0027t used NTRs though so I don\u0027t know if they are good even with those tanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"gm537","CreatedById":66746,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-18T03:48:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy older version of MFS doesn\u0027t have the balloon tanks, though I checked the standard cryo and they aren\u0027t any better.
