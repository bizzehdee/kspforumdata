To better distinguish, my fork will be named \u0022Lafitte\u0022.\n\nI haven\u0027t touched the source yet, this is just a 1.0.4-compatible recompile of the mod, so kudos, reputation and thanks should be directed at jimji, who really put in quite some work into this plugin.\n\n![ChampagneScreenie.png](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/20690417/ChampagneScreenie.png)\n[**Download**](https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/1053/Champagne%20Bottle%20Lafitte)\n\n**Description**\n\nThe purpose of this plugin is to auto-generate some possibly interesting craft names.\n\nIt adds a button to Blizzy\u0027s Toolbar (which is a requirement for now), which you can use in the VAB/SHP/wherever to get some suggestions for a cool ship name. By clicking one of the suggestions, the new name gets applied to the currently active vessel.\n\n**Installation:**\n\n- Extract to your GameData folder\n\nSource code is included, under \\GameData\\Champagne\\Source\\. License is GPLv3 as defined by jimji.\n\n**Changelog:**\n\n03 Aug 2015: Recompiled for KSP 1.0.4, cleaned up zip file\n\n**Plans:**\n\n- Add to Stock toolbar (making Blizzy\u0027s Toolbar obsolete/optional)\n\n- If you have suggestions for some more ship name elements, you can simply edit the .txt files (nouns, peoples, titles etc.). You can also give lists of suggestions to me and I\u0027ll add them on the next releases so everyone can enjoy the variety!"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T16:32:23Z","Content":"Why all the complexity?

No need to do the work twice! Would be appreciated. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n@Gregrox, Zuthal: Prefix-Exclusion would be a nice addition. For now, you can edit the vessel name after it\u0027s been set using the regular means (Right-click -\u003E rename).\n\nIn terms of context-sensitivity: That has been already included by jimji: The plugin detects the type of vessel after launch (the ship type as in Probe, Ship, Station, Base, Rover, Flag, ...) and customizes the prefix (Appending a specific character, e.g. \u0022Col\u0022 for a base, \u0022SS\u0022 for space station etc.). It wouldn\u0027t be too hard to make it give context-sensitive names as well, but I would need a lot more cool and fitting names to make lists for each specific ship type.\n\n@Shurikeeen: Names are given as text lists, so only the selection is random. As such they will repeat sooner or later. Currently there\u0027s a mix of 45 names, 80 adjectives, 83 nouns and 20 titles. As there are five possible patterns to combine these, this makes for 18864 possible combinations if I got my math right. In addition, there are 6 possible prefixes (randomly chosen) plus aforementioned vessel type prefix."},{"CreatedByName":"abowl","CreatedById":110827,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T15:13:28Z","Content":"Stock toolbar integration would be great"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T01:14:06Z","Content":"Awesome.
