Now when trying to launch a rocket with a cost of 22561 (no kerbals, just a probe) it\u0027s taking out 67263, and if I hit rewind it gives me back 16815. I have no idea how these numbers are related, but I know the previous version wasn\u0027t doing this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Does MCE play nice with procedural fairings? Does the cost of the fairings change with their size?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-25T18:16:22Z\u0022 title=\u002209/25/2013 06:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 25, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by DoctorJon\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kalista","CreatedById":67544,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-28T21:53:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve also seen weird things with launching space planes. Most of the time it deducts the correct cost other times i can launch my planes at no cost at all (all these planes are atmospheric and aren\u0027t designed to go above 25km).

It really has helped me create a structure to my space program, since the pure sandbox environment of vanilla KSP hadn\u0027t been driving me to anything specific lately. So to you and the original mod maker: Thanks for making such an awesome mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do have another question though, which I wasn\u0027t able to find. How does the clientControlled parameter work when defined in a mission. Does it take away your ability to control the vessel when you finish the mission? I don\u0027t particularly understand what the documentation means when it states the client will take over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I have in mind for a mission is one that when you complete, you will be prevented from completing any other missions in the future. Is this currently possible at all?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
