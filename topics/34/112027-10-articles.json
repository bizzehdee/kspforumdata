Also ![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) Nertea\u0027s radiators have several things in their functionality that cannot be achieved with stock radiators and its part of what defines them. To take that away by using the stock module would be a crappy thing to do. and remove all the real advantages Nertea\u0027s radiators currently possess.\n\nTHe way I see it we have two options.\n\n**Option 1:**\n\nF the stock radiators. Fold all the Heat Control components back into NFE and make it one single download. The plugins can be separate for Nertea\u0027s convenience. This has the advantage of ignoring the problem, but has a whole laundry list of downsides, not including the fact that I imagine Nertea wouldn\u0027t be too thrilled about it.\n\n**Option 2:**\n\nMove the conformal radiators over to Heat Control (some model tweaks may be necessary to make them conform to the stack size, not the reactor specifically) and make sure NFE reactors are compatible with stock.\n\nDo not confuse compatibility with balance though, as I see no way to balance Heat Control against stock radiators well (it can be done, but it\u0027d end up being messy as hell). A disclaimer would need to be added to the effect of \u0022These reactors are recommended for use with Heat Control. While they will function with stock radiators, balance will not be great.\u0022\n\nThe reason I say I see no way to balance is that all of Nertea\u0027s radiators are (or at least should be in my understanding) balanced to the same heat rejection/mass ratio. This is so that the radiator mass is the same for a given quantity of heat rejection regardless of the type used. Additionally, this is balanced in tandem with NFE reactors so that every reactor hits a certain Ec/s/mass ratio when loaded with the necessary radiator mass.\n\nStock radiators do not respect the heat rejection/mass ratio, in addition to the largest one being 10x lighter per heat rejection. Heat Control will still need to address this in one of three ways to ensure when it is present, there is still a reason to use it.\n\n**Method A:**\n\nIgnore stock radiators.\n\nIgnoring them makes no balance changes necessary, and gives the player the arbitrary choice to use a highly abstract, less efficient, yet far lighter system, or a heavier, more efficient, high precision (and much better looking) system.\n\n**Method B:**\n\nRebalance stock radiators to respect the heat rejection/mass balancing with slightly better performance by mass than Nertea\u0027s radiators. This is to offset their disadvantages of no refrigeration capability, no undeployed function, poorer heat rejection/area performance comparatively, and (arguable advantage for some) lack of precision. This makes the arbitrary choice of Method A a much more balanced decision from a gameplay perspective.\n\n**Method C:**\n\nHide the stock radiators and force players to use the more precise system. It should be noted, though, that by effectively overriding the stock heat rejection parts, we take this pack very close to becoming a fork. While I do not personally believe this is a bad thing, it should be considered in all its pros and cons."},{"CreatedByName":"Jarin","CreatedById":71395,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T20:14:58Z","Content":"Would Method C there end up pushing it more towards being a fully optional \u0022heat management\u0022 mechanic mod?

This could be accomplished using the stock radiator module, by ratcheting up the emissivity of Nertea\u0027s radiators, which basically just compensates for the need to operate the radiators at lower (less emissive) temperatures.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Also ![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) Nertea\u0027s radiators have several things in their functionality that cannot be achieved with stock radiators and its part of what defines them.

I\u0027m not thrilled with Squad\u0027s decision to use vessel-global behavior for heat dissipation, though there is certainly precedent for it with ElectricCharge and Monoprop. It isn\u0027t crazy to assume that heat pipes are integrated into the ship \u0022behind the scenes\u0022 to move heat from heat-producing parts to radiators.

Seems pretty simple to me.\n\nAt some point people have to decide whether they want a Heat Control type of game mechanic or they don\u0027t. My problem with the way Squad seems to handle this stuff is that they try to add in complications like heat, and then they get worried about people who don\u0027t want to deal with it so they defang it to the point where they shouldn\u0027t have bothered with introducing it at all.\n\nFrankly, the reaction wheels fall into this category. Why do they have this whole RCS infrastructure in the game and then they make reaction wheels so powerful that you don\u0027t need the RCS? Heat management is the same thing, really. They introduce this heat mechanism into the game, and then they make it trivial to ignore it.\n\nI think if people like the stock radiators then that\u0027s just fine.

I do understand he doesn\u0027t want to fork the mod. But it would be a shame if he gave up a very interesting and well-thought-out system just because Squad decided to go with something more simplistic. It would be a regression, in many ways.

It\u0027s my basic design philosophy - everything I\u0027ve ever done for the game I\u0027ve tried to treat as if it were an extension to the game rather than something taken off in a different direction. There are many mods that operate in those spaces already, the most evident of them in reference to my own has always been KSPI. That is really not what I am here to do. I am not a plugin developer by desire, only by necessity. As shown by the existence of SSPX, MkIV and CryoRockets, not to mention the other parts of NFT, I really prefer making models. \n\nWe should really look at things historically - the last large revamp of NFE came about not because of the stock heat system, but because of a pre-0.90 desire to allow players to place radiators anywhere on their ship. To keep structural design constraints around reactors from going out the window, I decided to work on a heat modeling and simulation backend that everyone could use. Squad came along with 1.0 and a base heat system that I went for instead, because it makes things a lot simpler for me to use their work. It was also about 90% of what I wanted with mine. I\u0027m not afraid of throwing 100s of lines of code out the window if something more elegant comes along. So we worked with that to develop HeatControl and its supporting balance, resulting in a new gameplay element. However... what was the original goal here? Radiators wherever the player wants. Now, we have 1.03/4 with what? Radiators wherever the player wants. This is, really, what I wanted all along. We should not struggle and fight over maybe 4 hours of model work on a few things that won\u0027t be as useful, and really HC doesn\u0027t have much code in it. \n\nTherefore, the thing that I will be doing is finding a way to move NFE and the HC radiators into using the stock modules. You will still be able to get HC separately, but it will just be parts. This may require some rejiggering of a few parameters in NFE and I\u0027ll need to think about how to reconcile the balance. There is room in the future for this mod to evolve into something that \u0022restores\u0022 localized heat flow management in a fork type of way a la DRE or FAR or whatever, but really that\u0027s out of scope for me at the moment.

On the other hand, conductors will fade away. Heat pipe... I do not know. Maybe it would be the way to partially localize heat management.
