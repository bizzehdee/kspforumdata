KSP\u003Cem\u003Ei\u003C/em\u003E\u003Csub\u003Elite \u003C/sub\u003Ewent down the path of play-ability, and as such there are pretty dramatic changes to the way it operates, and there is a lot less game-play impacting complexity. a good example of this is the simplified reactor design: where KSP\u003Cem\u003Ei\u003C/em\u003E is concerned with getting the reactor design as close to real as possible, KSP\u003Cem\u003Ei\u003C/em\u003E\u003Csub\u003Elite\u003C/sub\u003E takes the tact that reactors are a game mechanic for converting nuclear fuels into power, and removes the complex fuel cycles and unclear part interactions that often causes unfun activities, like having to revert to editor because your space plane can\u0027t start it\u0027s reactor without it\u0027s reactor running. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei didn\u0027t realize what a problem for usability this was until recently, but way back in .22, i had to redo a complex space station servicing mission because i had chosen the wrong fuel mode for my fission-based station power module, and couldn\u0027t run the reactor i had just spent and hour ascending, orbiting, intercepting and docking with my station. after having messed with KSP\u003Cem\u003Ei\u003C/em\u003E for more then a year now, i think i have a good understanding of the various nuclear fuels and their cycles, but i was NOT happy at the time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehopefully this answered your question?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Fractal_UK\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Fractal_UK\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe difference is largely down to personal preference.

Personally I just manually went to the part cfg files and edited them to use stock techs. Now they show up at the stock nodes. I put most of the parts in nodes that don\u0027t see much traffic, like nanolithing, experimental science, and others that only had 1-2 parts to begin with that really weren\u0027t worth getting. I suppose if one knew how they could also edit the science cost of those nodes, since they are pretty much worthless nodes to begin with. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn terms of difficulty I know what you mean. I went a step further than hard and decreased it from 60% to 50% on all income. It does pose a bit of challenge as unlocking the nodes is not the only issue but also paying for the parts. I have like 30\u002B mods and thus far several nodes have had 100-400K worth of parts to unlock. So I have to choose wisely which ones to get. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen it comes to science though the ultimate problem, as I see it, is that the tech tree ends and you ultimately have no real need for science beyond that point. Having the really high cost of the Interstellar nodes only post pones the inevitable. It makes things feel longer by putting off that final part behind a rather high cost tech node, but once you reach it science becomes like reputation which is a fairly worthless commodity as far as I can tell. Strategies help reduce this issue when it comes to contracts, since you can convert them into funds, but science from science parts becomes worthless. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for cheapening the stock parts I haven\u0027t played KSPI Lite that long and only really glanced at them in an old save to ensure my cfg changes were done properly so they showed up in stock nodes. But one thing I did notice was some of the parts seemed rather cheap. The A-Drive for example only cost 25K while in KSPI it cost millions. In my old save before Difficulties I have 9M in the bank so building a couple of those wouldn\u0027t be too hard. In my new campaign I\u0027ve earned at least 1M but spent a large part of it on unlocking parts, however once the tech tree is done I imagine I will be rolling in the cash as more profitable contracts seem to appear later in the game. Combined with lot better parts being marginally cheaper that doesn\u0027t really put much choice into which way to go.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AetherGoddess","CreatedById":115971,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-25T05:32:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Spyre2000\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Spyre2000\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E[...]When it comes to science though the ultimate problem, as I see it, is that the tech tree ends and you ultimately have no real need for science beyond that point.
