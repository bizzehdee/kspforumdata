So the steps to install are 1-4 in the zip. So open step one and then you will see \u0022core mod\u0022 open core mod and you will see \u0022GameData\u0022 basically start with core mod then install the additional features you want till your game crashes. AVP is a very substantial pack, that\u0026#39;s why there are instructions to convert to x64. It\u0026#39;s not necessary for everyone.
