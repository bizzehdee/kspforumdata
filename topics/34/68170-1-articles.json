Power consumption is much more important, especially in the early game. That\u0027s why I moved the advantages and disadvantages around. The smallest antenna (the 16) is now the fastest, but requires more power to transmit. The largest one (88-88) is the slowest, but requires less power. The middle one (DTS-M1) is in between those two.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECovered Solar Panels*\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe solar panels that can fold up into their own compartments (SP-W/L) are never a better choice than their uncovered counterparts (OX-4W/L). The solution to this is to make the OX-4 line not retractable. In space this is not a problem, but if you want to reuse your solar panels after going through an atmosphere, the SP-W/L panels now have a use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESolar Panel Power*\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECompared to real-life solar panels are incredibly OP. With a single OX-STAT you\u0027re generally set electricity-wise wherever you are in the solar system. In real-life solar power reduces much more drastically with distance (inverse square law). The powerCurve I made for one of my mods approximates the inverse-square law and simulates the real-life consequences quite well. RTGs become more efficient around Jool\u0027s orbit (aka Jupiter) and are reduced to almost nothing once you get out to Eeloo (Pluto). This results in two interesting changes to solar panel use in KSP: RTGs are suddenly useful if you go to Jool or Eeloo where they can compete with solar panels and if you go beyond Kerbin you have to think more about which or how many solar panels you have to put on. Both offer much more interesting gameplay than the current situation offers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EShielded Docking Port*\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas the same drag as the normal docking port (0.25). If it was the same as other aerodynamic nosecone (0.1) it might be actually be a non-aesthetic choice to place it on the top of your spacecraft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHubMax and Micronode*\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey\u0027re not useless but would be more user-friendly if they have stack symmetry enabled.

My proposal would be to make the RoveMax the lighter, slower, power-conservative and more easily breakable of the two, while the Ruggedized Wheel would be the heavier, faster, more power-hungry and sturdier of the two.
