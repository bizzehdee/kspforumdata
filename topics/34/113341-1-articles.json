In this case kerbals\u0027 fitness will affect their ability to withstand over G effects (supported by G-Effects v0.2.3\u002B and KeepFit v0.8.3.3\u002B).\n\n**[Download from SpaceDock (for KSP 1.3.0)](http://spacedock.info/mod/140/G-Effects)**\n\n**[Download from SpaceDock (for KSP 1.2.2)](https://spacedock.info/mod/140/G-Effects/download/0.4.2-1.2.2)**\n\nIf you don\u0027t have a joystick it is recommended to use with [Analog Control Continued mod](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/155178-122-analog-control-continued) for the best aircraft experience\n\n**Installation:**\n\nSave the old G-Effects.cfg file if you have changed it. Delete previous version of the mod. Place contents of the zip into your KSP/GameData folder.\n\nYou\u0027ll have to enter the config params you have saved manually into the new version\u0027s configuration file because it has several important changes.\n\n**Stock integration:**\n\nStock g-meters and notifications correspond to the mod\u0027s state. If you don\u0027t need them you may disable \u0022Kerbal G limits\u0022 in the game\u0027s settings, the main mod\u0027s behaviour won\u0027t be affected.\n\nKerbal experience and other stock g stats are still ignored.\n\n**Configuration:**\n\nConfiguration of the mod is done via G-Effects.cfg file. Look through it to have an exhaustive description of its parameters.\n\nThe major parameters of those you can fine tune are:\n\nA common kerbal\u0027s ability to resist G effects\n\nRestrict video and audio effects to IVA mode only\n\nSeverity of effects of G forces applied from different directions\n\nHow much specialization help a kerbal to resist an over-G\n\nDisable G-deaths\n\nand more\n\n*The sounds are still a little WIP so you always have an option to disable them via config file if you find\u0027em too annoying.*\n\n*Anyway, after trying the mod please respond to the poll in this thread for I knew which way to move further. Would also appreciate any comments or suggestions.*\n\n**Known issues and limitations:**\n\nG-forces caused by a ship\u0027s rotation don\u0027t affect because they are not likely to be severe enough to induce any significant effects.\n\nEffects are calculated for the active vessel\u0027s crew only. You can switch to another vessel and back and have effects applied as if they have just started.\n\nPlanned features:\n\nSpoiler\n\nSimulate loss of orientation after G-LOC\n\nTake vessel rotation into account\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-06-25T19:22:48Z\u0022 title=\u002206/25/2017 07:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJune 25, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Ser**\n  \nUpdate 0.4.2 is out"},{"CreatedByName":"Deep silence","CreatedById":55089,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T17:34:55Z","Content":"Looks nice!

The commander is considered to be a kerbal that most likely is controlling the vessel: if you have a pilot, it is him. If you have several pilots then the first available pilot will be the commander. If you have none then it is a \u0022random\u0022 crew member. If a commander who is the most capable crew member has a G-LOC then you can be sure that all the rest of the crew have it as well.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-20T07:35:10Z\u0022 title=\u002206/20/2015 07:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Ser**"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T07:45:22Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E - G-LOC (G-induced loss of conscience)\n\nMy goodness.

When you are \u0022in\u0022 a probe you don\u0027t have any G effects but your scientist still suffers from over G inside your vessel (in the next version you\u0027ll be able even to kill him that way). If you switch to a pod with him (the quick way is just to press \u0022C\u0022) you may find him in the middle of a blackout or unconscious. But the sole fact that the probe is attached to a manned vessel does nothing: if you control it via a manned pod and the crew becomes unconscious then you\u0027ll lose control. Though there\u0027s still a few tricks to pass control to the probe in that case: if you use IVAonly option you can go to the 3rd person view and try to use \u0022Control from here\u0022 on the probe, or you may do it by a hotkey if an appropriate mod is installed that allows you to do so.
