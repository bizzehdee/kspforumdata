It gives them an improved drag system that fits in with stock behavior instead of simulating everything. It\u0027s been said that stock drag is based entirely on mass, which is not an accurate statement at all. Stock drag is actually based on the same thing FAR is, which real life drag calculations are based on: Velocity. The faster you\u0027re going, the more resistance you meet with from the medium you\u0027re traveling through. It uses the same computation but substitutes mass for cross section. Almost certainly to simplify things. The problem as I saw it wasn\u0027t that it was using mass (which is certainly wrong, but acceptable from a game design standpoint) but that they were using wet mass. In other words... it\u0027s actually ok to use mass. It\u0027s just a number. It might not be the right one but it still results in somewhat accurate behavior. As long as it\u0027s not wet mass. In stock KSP, if you take a full fuel tank and an empty fuel tank and drop them from the same height, the full fuel tank should hit the ground first. Its increased mass should give it inertia that overcomes drag more than the empty tank does. But by using wet mass, the full tank receives increased drag \u003Cem\u003Eexactly enough to offset its inertia\u003C/em\u003E and they both hit the ground at the same time (more or less). It also means that engines have to work harder to overcome drag than they should. This makes it harder to get to orbit in Real Solar System than they should. Experimental data is that I can get to orbit in RSS now with pretty close to the same delta-V that I would expend if I were using FAR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk, so in summary (the tl;dr), (I\u0027m rambling a bit because I was up late last night and am still a bit sleepy) The key differences are that FAR gives you a simulation of aerodynamics, with all the good and bad that may bring and Stock Drag Fixer only attempts to \u003Cem\u003Efix a problem with stock drag.\u003C/em\u003E If you want reality (or as close an approximation to it as FAR can give) then you shouldn\u0027t use this. You should stick with FAR. If you just want a better drag model that doesn\u0027t bring \u0027soup\u0027 to the table, then Stock Drag Fixer will do that for you with its simple, one assed schematic.

The linear proportion in stock leads to some unfortunate effects at very fast and very slow velocities.
