I like RT for realism of having to have satellites to relay the signal in order to control the craft, and I don\u0027t mind having to use the flight computer to give it commands to perform when out of radio contact, since I\u0027m the one giving it commands. Setting up a reentry with the current flight computer will take more time than I might have. Once I make my de-orbit burn I won\u0027t have 30 minutes to queue up commands. I may have at most a couple of minutes, and I\u0027ll be rushing to set the delay, send command 1, 2, 3, etc. and adjusting the delay between each command to account for the time passed since I last send a command. If I make a mistake, I\u0027m screwed.\u003Cp\u003EIt would be nice to be able to set it all up 30 minutes out by setting up a sequence of commands queued up but not sent to the craft yet. Then once I get ready for reentry, I can transmit the queue and shut down the antennas.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried this last night, and as I feared it was a mad scramble to get commands sent and retract the antenna before reentry. I sent a probe to Minmus, nearly identical to the one I sent to the Mun a few days ago. I setup the intercept so my orbit would swing out past Minmus and \u0022side swipe\u0022 it on the way back by having my Pe be on the side. After making my final adjustment, I put my Pe at 15km, and it looked like I would be facing Kerbin and still have radio contact as I passed by. I had the science equipment set on action groups and queued them up to go off around the time I would reach Pe just to be safe. It\u0027s a good thing I did because I didn\u0027t have LOS to Kerbin when I made the flyby, and the flight computer triggered the science equipment just in time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow it was time for reentry. I try to play somewhat realistic, for example I send unmanned probes to places before sending Kerbals. Although I quicksave often, I don\u0027t load the save if I crash a craft or make a mistake. I made an exception last night since I was experimenting with RT\u0027s flight computer for this reentry. The approach back to Kerbin had me coming in steep and fast. My first attempt was a complete disaster. I setup my Pe at 40k to aerobreak and burned the last of my fuel to help slow down. After that maneuver I was left with the Pe ~37k and I don\u0027t remember the Ap, but it was still pretty far out. I wasn\u0027t sure if it would reenter on the next pass if it would take another another trip or more around Kerbin to reenter, but it did reenter on the next pass. Once I saw reentry was going to happen, I wasn\u0027t sure what delay to use, so I waited for the Pe to drop below the surface and went for half the time to Pe. It was quite a shallow reentry, and the delay was 5 minutes. I set the delay, hit the action group key to activate the omni antenna, then the gear key. I closed the flight computer and was about to retract the antenna when realized I didn\u0027t drop the rocket stage for reentry. I pressed space and nothing happened. I mashed it a few more times, nothing. I thought I lost the antenna already, but it was still there showing a I was connected, so I tried to go ahead and retract it, and nope it wasn\u0027t going in. I then realized what was wrong. I didn\u0027t zero out the delay before closing the flight computer window, so it had put the several stage key presses in the queue and retract antenna command. I opened the flight computer, zeroed out the delay and tried to delete the extra commands and then drop the rocket stage, but it was too late, the antenna burned off just as I got the flight computer window up. Something on the bottom stage that I didn\u0027t drop exploded, broke off, hit a landing strut, destroyed the strut which caused the craft to wobble so the heat shield wasn\u0027t absorbing all of the reentry heat and the whole thing exploded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI reloaded and tried again. It took two more tries to get a successful reentry. By successful I mean one where the the antenna activated and gear deployed, and it was close. Once I make the deorbit burn and reentry begins, there\u0027s not much time to figure out the delay and get everything queued up on the fly. I already activated the parachute stage and had set them to deploy at a pressure that had them coming out at about 8000m, so that was one less thing to worry about. I was still having to figure out the delay, plug it in, queue an antenna activation and gear deployment, then zero out the delay, detach the rocket stage and retract the antenna. I had the antenna set come out first, then waited a bit and set the gear to deploy. I hoped the antenna would deploy first and I could cancel the flight computer queue and manually takeover, but I queued it in the flight computer to be safe in case the antenna deployed too soon and snapped off. The delay was almost too long though, and the antenna didn\u0027t deploy until a few seconds from touchdown. I had just enough time to manually lower the landing struts before it touched down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis particular probe doesn\u0027t need the landing struts and is capable of reentering and safely landing without control as long as I stage the parachutes before retracting the antenna or losing it, as it already landed successfully (although without the struts deployed) when I sent it to the Mun. I\u0027m using this as practice for when the time comes to send probes to land on other planets with atmospheres. Enhancements to the flight computer would be nice and help in this situation, but FAR compatibility would have prevented the antenna from snapping to begin with because aerodynamically it was in a position where it would have been shielded from the oncoming air and heat.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ModZero","CreatedById":89470,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-20T15:53:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs the next release planned to be savegame-compatible?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NJC2","CreatedById":83404,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-20T15:59:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile I\u0027m here, does anyone else find that their spacecraft start to pitch/yaw/roll when it goes out of radio contact and/or after using the flight computer?

Probably because of where in my satellite network this \u0022broken ID\u0027s\u0022 where present. Only the GX-128 equipped craft beyond the range of other dishes were likely to find that group of paths towards Mission Control. All other craft, and those closer, were more likely to find a different \u0027shortest\u0027 path to Mission Control, without passing by satellites which were targetting \u0022broken ID\u0027s\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this possible?
