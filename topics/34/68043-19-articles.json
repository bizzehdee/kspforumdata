That\u0027s about right to account for sweat not being recycled, food packaging ending up as non-recyclable, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW, when you upped the waste weight from 0.11 to 0.38 you forgot to apply the density. According to TE\u0027s numbers, it should be 0.1kg/l, roughly 1/2,5 that of food, resulting in 3,8 liters of waste/kerbal/day. This seems very off to me but it actually made your Waste calculation come out far more realistically than food \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, a few other correcting numbers: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.nasa.gov/audience/foreducators/stseducation/materials/Sustaining_Life.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ENASA says\u003C/a\u003E ISS-nauts use about 11,3liters of water/day as opposed to TE\u0027s 3,5 I\u0027m pretty sure he filled in gallons there by accident; and 1,83kg of food is right, though NASA has no density given, alas, but I think we can assume near-water levels for most foods rather than the 0.25 value TaranisElsu has. In the same vein, waste should be way more dense. Right now, at 100kg/m3 it is about 1.5x the density of EVE\u0027s atmosphere... I think it should probably be a *little* more densely packed than that, what with our space-age trash compactors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow though, for the big question: why are you actually using human numbers at all? These... are Kerbals. Why not just use the kerbal numbers? TE\u0027s calculations are just fine (barring the occasional odd number here and there). They\u0027re 40% of our mass, with a slightly higher metabolic rate... they should consume about half our resource requirements.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHonestly I\u0027m having doubts that it\u0027s worth all this to integrate TACLS and US. Why would the LqWater -\u0026gt; O2 \u002B H2 for use in the generator even use the same storage tanks as the crew\u0027s life support consumables? Hell, the real world Elektron uses almost exclusively filtered waste-water (astronauts dislike reprocessed urine, can\u0027t imagine why), with fresh water being flown in. Its kinda nice that resources can serve both purposes this way, to be sure, but it\u0027s giving some headaches... There are other mods and converters that use TAC\u0027s units. I dunno how they\u0027re going to react to these quantities yet, but I\u0027m guessing its not going to be a huge success without tracking down each individual converter \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-29T02:20:34Z\u0022 title=\u002206/29/2014 02:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 29, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by TurielD\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpacedInvader","CreatedById":106018,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-29T04:46:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TurielD\u0022 data-cite=\u0022TurielD\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYeeeeeees that\u0027s true.

TaranisElsu is using Kerbal values after all, he just included human values for completion. \u003Cstrong\u003E it should be 1.1, not 0.11.\u003C/strong\u003E Then everything fits \u003Cem\u003Eperfectly\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow as I\u0027ve explained wastewater and CO2 should be (and are) higher than water and O2 mass in accordance with carbohydrates (and fats) being consumed for energy. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELogically, waste should be less than food by the same amount, so let\u0027s look at the \u003Cstrong\u003Etotal numbers in\u003C/strong\u003E 3,52\u002B0,84\u002B1,8 = \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E6,16\u003C/span\u003E.

They are within 3% of eachother. That\u0027s about right to account for sweat not being recycled, food packaging ending up as non-recyclable, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW, when you upped the waste weight from 0.11 to 0.38 you forgot to apply the density. According to TE\u0027s numbers, it should be 0.1kg/l, roughly 1/2,5 that of food, resulting in 3,8 liters of waste/kerbal/day. This seems very off to me but it actually made your Waste calculation come out far more realistically than food \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, a few other correcting numbers: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.nasa.gov/audience/foreducators/stseducation/materials/Sustaining_Life.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ENASA says\u003C/a\u003E ISS-nauts use about 11,3liters of water/day as opposed to TE\u0027s 3,5 I\u0027m pretty sure he filled in gallons there by accident; and 1,83kg of food is right, though NASA has no density given, alas, but I think we can assume near-water levels for most foods rather than the 0.25 value TaranisElsu has. In the same vein, waste should be way more dense. Right now, at 100kg/m3 it is about 1.5x the density of EVE\u0027s atmosphere... I think it should probably be a *little* more densely packed than that, what with our space-age trash compactors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow though, for the big question: why are you actually using human numbers at all? These... are Kerbals. Why not just use the kerbal numbers? TE\u0027s calculations are just fine (barring the occasional odd number here and there). They\u0027re 40% of our mass, with a slightly higher metabolic rate... they should consume about half our resource requirements.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHonestly I\u0027m having doubts that it\u0027s worth all this to integrate TACLS and US. Why would the LqWater -\u0026gt; O2 \u002B H2 for use in the generator even use the same storage tanks as the crew\u0027s life support consumables? Hell, the real world Elektron uses almost exclusively filtered waste-water (astronauts dislike reprocessed urine, can\u0027t imagine why), with fresh water being flown in. Its kinda nice that resources can serve both purposes this way, to be sure, but it\u0027s giving some headaches... There are other mods and converters that use TAC\u0027s units. I dunno how they\u0027re going to react to these quantities yet, but I\u0027m guessing its not going to be a huge success without tracking down each individual converter \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst off, if we\u0027re correcting Kerbal waste to equal 51.07% of human waste, then the actual human waste value is ~1.29kg/CM-d.

If you look at the wikipedia source page he\u0027s using for many of these values, it indicates that the daily human metabolic need for water is 3.52kg @ 1kg/L. That being said, this number doesn\u0027t take into account the daily use needs beyond what a crew member needs to consume to survive whereas the NASA number includes things like bathing or hand washing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to why I\u0027m using human values rather than kerbal, this is because I feel the extra step of converting to smaller units actually unbalances the game if using realistic quantities and densities. For example, a single Universal Storage Oxygen Block, for which the volume and carrying capacity has been carefully worked out by Paul and Daishi, contains enough oxygen to support a three kerbal crew for 25.75 days. Converting that number to kerbal values expands the life of those tanks out to 50.65 days, meaning that a single block is enough to support that pod all the way to Eve with some to spare and without needing to recycle any. Also, despite all of the discussion on the subject, we have no real idea just how much of each resource a kerbal really would need to consume per day, so my thinking is that human values provide the most accurate assumption of what needs to be carried along for the ride. That being said, I\u0027m not opposed to using kerbal values if we can bring them into a better balance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis release isn\u0027t just about integrating TACLS and US anymore, though US features prominently in the files, but rather about updating TACLS to use real world units and consumption rates (another argument for using human values), which is something that Taranis is in the process of doing himself.
