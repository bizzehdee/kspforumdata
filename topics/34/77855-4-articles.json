Originally the regular and unbroken versions were 2 separate models because of the limitations of the stock animation module. I have moved over to firespitter and each piece has it\u0027s own animation and can be toggled independently, this eliminates the need for duplicate models as both versions of the station now share the same model. You can toggle the 2 different sunshades on and off independently, the mm shields and left solar panel can be left on the station for the \u0022intended\u0022 version. Also I included a thermal blanket cover for the space station freedom concept version of the station where it would have been refurbished in the early 80\u0027s. Also, the telescope is now a separate piece so shocks delivered to the main body of the station don\u0027t break the solar panels on the telescope, also this opens up the doorway to include a skylab-b version in a later update.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/m31SoDU.png\u0022 alt=\u0022m31SoDU.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"raidernick","CreatedById":97711,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T16:01:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022bjbeardse\u0022 data-cite=\u0022bjbeardse\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EGot a video now, FRAPS has really come along!\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/wN1FX9mlENg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://youtu.be/wN1FX9mlENg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan you send me a list of your mods and versions and your output_log.txt right after the fairings fall off.
