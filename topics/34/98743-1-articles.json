Functioning head/tail lights. Optional doors/hood/trunk that open and close. Fully collidable interiors, so you can put stuff in the trunk, under the hood, or inside the cabin, as well as seating kerbals inside the cabin. Drift handling that feels sorta-kinda like a muscle car. Modular construction, and strong connections with reinforced parts to handle stunting(YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO...).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E__________________________________________________ __________________________________________________ __________________________________________\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENotes: Due to the seriously stupid(imho) way wheelcolliders work, the wheels will fall through the ground if they are not oriented properly. As of now, there is no indicator of which way is the right orientation, so I made the wheels spawn in the correct rotation when created. If you happen to accidentally rotate one and can\u0027t find the correct orientation again, the general rule of thumb is as follows: Place the wheel and orient it so that setting rideheignt(in parts rightclick menu) to 0 pushes the wheel UP relative to the orientation of the rover. In other words, you will know that you have it in the correct orientation if changing Rideheight has the CORRECT effect on how the rover would sit on the groundlower values = lower to the ground, higher = higher off ground). I plan on adding some sort of orientation indicator later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis mod comes with its own partcategory, which can be accessed ingame by clicking on the \u0022extras\u0022 arrow up in the top left corner(same way you would access the subassemblies list).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPainting is as simple as changing the RGBA slider values for a section of a part in the rightclick menu. There are currently up to four different paintable regions supported per model. Some models dont have four regions, so some of the sliders will do nothing. Trial and error should help you learn the ropes if the semi-self-explanatory region names aren\u0027t enough. You can also hide any of the four sections via toggle button to avoid editing a section you have right, or to reduce clutter in the rightclick menu.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe wheels require TouhouTorpedo\u0027s Modular MultiWheels plugin, found here(\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/93205-0-24-2-TT-s-Modular-MultiWheels-7-2-Update-to-resolve-mass-bug-get-Roverpilot\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/93205-0-24-2-TT-s-Modular-MultiWheels-7-2-Update-to-resolve-mass-bug-get-Roverpilot\u003C/a\u003E). It does work in 0.90, so you should be fine. If you don\u0027t wan\u0027t it, you will just have to use regular electric wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe source is included.

I am the biggest issue with this mod, lol. I have little experience with KSP modding, am a middle-of-the-line modeller, and don\u0027t know the first thing about texturing or coding, really. If there\u0027s anything dumb that I did wrong, feel free to go to the release thread on the KSP forums and yell my ears off about how stupid (insert error here) was and how any intelligent person would have done it. If you want to improve on my models or plugin code(PRETTY PLEASE?), send me a PM on the forums or post that you would like to do so in the release thread.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-- the models look flat at night. probably because I suck at texturing. feel free to tell me how to fix this\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-- the wheel orientation issues outlined above. I know about this and have a fix planned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-- the rightclick menus for the parts are too cluttered.
