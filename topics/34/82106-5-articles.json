I tried doing the two LKO ones twice on polar orbits (on my scanning sat) below 200km. They did not complete. Since 70km - 200km is generally considered to be LKO, I assume there is a specific orbital altitude you are asking for. I cannot for the life of me understand why people are making contracts with vague parameters. It is really frustrating...

I don\u0027t have any contract packs made by you, so I am unsure where it comes from. The issue is with a contract wanting tests done in low or high kerbin orbit. I tried doing the two LKO ones twice on polar orbits (on my scanning sat) below 200km. They did not complete.
