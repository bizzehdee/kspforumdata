You will need an air intake (for jet engines), and the Air Filter part. The Air Filter will filter the oxygen out of the IntakeAir. This only works on planets with an oxygen-containing atmosphere like Kerbin and Laythe. Note that Kerbals will not consume Oxygen while on Kerbin under a reasonable altitude (pressure greater than 0.2 atmo, which is approximately 8km). They will consume Oxygen on Laythe because I am assuming the air is not the right mix for Kerbals to breathe, because of the EVA reports from the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kiwiak","CreatedById":82796,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-10T08:43:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for reply.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"federicoaa","CreatedById":94879,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-10T12:28:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAny idea to have greenhouses to generate food or recycle air?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
