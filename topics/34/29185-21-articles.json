I did have a save with a Minmus fueling op for a short bit, but ultimately ended up rarely using it. Min/maxing rockets for specific payloads is enough fun that I don\u0027t actually get out there and explore as much as I probably should. That being said, I did do a quick study of the Kethane numbers and they are not as crazy as I originally may have thought. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe algorithm that Kethane uses for computing output of fuel per unit of Kethane is inputDensity/outputDensity*outputRatio. The only values to set are the input units, energy expenditure, and the output ratio. Perhaps I am slightly masochistic but my first inclination in attempting to find the proper balance was to look at the chemical composition of each of the output fuels and come to some possible real world analog for Kethane. It did not take too long for me to realize how futile and yes stupid this approach was. Within the realm of the Realistic Fuels mod Kethane is a magical petrochemical slurry and Kerbins are crazy advanced in chemistry and chemical breakdown/assembly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo with realism mostly out of the door, my thought is that convenience may be the best way to balance the numbers. LH2/LOX mix ratio is 73/27 or some such right? Since Kethane allows you to convert to multiple fuels at once, why not set the input values so that the output is of at least roughly that ratio assuming LH2 and LOX conversion are running at the same time.
