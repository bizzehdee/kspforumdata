This would have one primary effect, and I\u0027m considering it for a specific reason.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, this would let you extend the range of a smaller but more distant antenna using a closer antenna. For example, you could send an orbital probe with a whip antenna to Mun as long as you had reasonably coverage over Kerbin with probes using medium dishes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would also let you send a mission to a distant planet, knowing that you won\u0027t be able to talk to it when it gets there... unless you get your science in gear and launch some Big Dish antennas before it finishes the trip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m considering this particularly for the latter reason, in view of the point at which Squad starts offering contracts to Duna. I basically always get contracts to Duna long before I actually have the Electronics tech you need for the big dish. This means I can\u0027t even start the mission -- at least not if I want to get science for it, or if the mission requires science from Duna, or if I\u0027m using \u0022no probe control without connection\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn general, because of the huge differences between the antennas (since there\u0027s only three), I don\u0027t think this would change gameplay very much. The primary play change I\u0027m thinking about is making the jump from medium dish to big dish less extreme, e.g.:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECommunotron 16 -- Increase range to half of Kerbin\u0027s SOI, so it can be used for Minmus probes if you put a comsat with at least another Communotron 16 in orbit first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComms DTS -- Increase range to half of Duna\u0027s SMA \u002B half of Kerbin\u0027s SMA. This would let the DTS be used for all \u0022inner system\u0022 missions -- again, if you put at least another DTS in orbit first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECommunotron 88-88 -- Change range to something like 3/4 of Eeloo\u0027s SMA. This will reduce the overall range (currently about 2\u00C3\u0192\u00E2\u20AC\u201D Eeloo\u0027s SMA) when used in conjunction with another, and will require you to use another 88-88 nearer Kerbin to relay the signal.

One is to link the Tracking Station upgrades with higher gain recievers, so you essentially add to the length of the kerbin reception distance as you upgrade the tracking station. The other way would be to give Kerbin the highest tech antenna that you have researched, implying that the KSP has a distributed network of listening posts with current technology. Either way would help, without the need to put comsats up, though you could reduce the effect for kerbin with the excuse of atmospheric attenuation.\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-06T18:21:31Z\u0022 title=\u002205/06/2015 06:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by dudecon\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"toadicus","CreatedById":67745,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T18:19:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Edudecon\u003C/strong\u003E, what would be the endpoint of such lines?
