The inline SIGINT dish has now been reduced to a 1.25m part (with a ~50m dish) and a new 2.5m part has been added. This part fits onto the end of a vessel and acts as a nosecone. It includes shrouds that can be manually jettisoned, activated through staging, or activated by deploying the dish. The old part is still included, but can\u0027t be researched or added to new vessels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere has also been a change to how the experiments for the recon instruments works. The SIGINT dishes share the same experiment and the two recon telescope experiments have been combined into a new experiment. The smaller instrument for each experiment is only able to collect 50% of the total science, regardless of how many samples you collect. If there is\u00A0100 science to be collected from Duna\u0027s northern hemisphere for the recon telescopes, then the small instrument will be able to collect 50 science if the sample is returned, and 25 science if it is transmitted (the part has a 50% transmission level); the big instrument will be able to collect the full 100 science if the sample is returned. The same applies to the two SIGINT dishes (but both transmit at 100%).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are also some changes to asteroid science.

There were several classified shuttle missions that supposedly dropped these off (and used the same type of booster as the Galileo probe to get into GSO), and more recently they seem to have made up most of the Delta IV Heavy launches (along with a few KH-11 telescopes).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGiven how open the NRO has been about their telescopes (they put a KH-9 on public display for one day a few years ago) it seems a little bit surprising that almost nothing has been released about the signals intelligence programs. As one of your pictures demonstrates, the basic technology behind really big satellite dishes doesn\u0027t seem to be a secret, it is used in communications and radar science satellites.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe actually do know lots about the big geostationary stuff.\u00A0 They use the same tech as the communications satellites.\u00A0 If you want to spy at a particular frequency, then you use an antenna very similar in construction to those communicating on that frequency.\u00A0 The spy sats for many years were simple \u0022bent pipe\u0022 rigs, exactly the same as any other com sat (they beamed down to either remote australia/canada). Now they are encrypted, but they still just bounce the signals back down.\u00A0 The shape of fairings also indicates a similar packing regime.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.isro.gov.in/gslv-d6/gslv-d6-gsat-6-gallery\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.isro.gov.in/gslv-d6/gslv-d6-gsat-6-gallery\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.boeing.com/space/boeing-satellite-family/#/gallery\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.boeing.com/space/boeing-satellite-family/#/gallery\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome of the stuff closer to earth has actually been imaged from the ground, note the asymmetry very similar to the Boeing say with the big antenna.\u00A0 (The lacrosse sats are interesting because only a spy agency would have any need for such an antenna so close to earth.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://leaksource.wordpress.com/category/nro/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://leaksource.wordpress.com/category/nro/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for the optical sats, I think it safe to assume that they are tubes, with a big mirror at one end, large enough to fit inside the shuttle and/or whatever fairing they launched in ... very Hubble-like.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for the nosecone version.\u00A0 The cfg appears correct, but it isn\u0027t appearing anywhere on my tech tree.\u00A0 I\u0027ll have a look around and try to figure it out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-19T19:11:12Z\u0022 title=\u002205/19/2016 07:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 19, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Sandworm\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"drhay53","CreatedById":150399,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-19T18:54:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom what I\u0027ve heard, the spy sats are very similar to JWST, as the DoD basically told NASA \u0022don\u0027t worry about the mirrors unfolding.
