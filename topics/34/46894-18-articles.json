It\u0027s one of the things we learned early on with KW v1, we could kick out engines and parts fast as hell but the quality wasn\u0027t too great (it also helped that we had more free time then). KW2 was mostly about redoing it all over to a much higher standard and not creating a mass of similar parts that are just underwhelming. I think one of the best things we managed to learn and advance on was to make all of the engines unique and yet fill a role and function.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStock batteries were on my pet peeve list, I loved the inline ones but the radial ones just irked me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Gryphorim\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Gryphorim\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIs this ever going to integrate/partner up with procedural fairings?

I\u0027ve been searching everywhere for 3 stock like pod designs, and will make a request, a 3.75m orion. (currently using resized bobcat orion, interior doesn\u0027t work if resized.) And another pair of pods, one soyuz reentry module shaped, 1.25m, and another sharing that mesh, but 2.5m shaped, for use as a base for a \u0022dragon\u0022 style pod. I realise these pods are around on these forums, but current examples tend toward modelling the realistic craft they are based on. I\u0027d just like to see a \u0022stock\u0022 reimagining of these base parts, in much the same way the mark 1-2 command pod is sorta-like-but-not-exactly the apollo command capsule.\u003Cp\u003EJust updated to 2.5.5, and i gotta say, I love the new battery packs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, Tiberion said something about a 3.75m Orion-style pod coming for NovaPunch, but it was supposedly a good deal down the road.
