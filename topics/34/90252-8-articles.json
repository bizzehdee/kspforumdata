Another thing i don\u0027t quite understand, is why disabling control automatically reverts to no SAS at all - even when before activation, i had SAS enabled. I understand this plugin basically overrides SAS, but from a user POV, the pilot assisant and SAS are two different things, so if he had SAS enabled, then enabled the PA, then disabled it, i think he expects things to revert to normal SAS, instead of SAS being entirely disabled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few other hints: AoA and yaw limits really shouldn\u0027t require to open the SAS limits....
