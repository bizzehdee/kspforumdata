I can use Mj for the Dv, but I need KER for the varying TWRs per planet. Im using StretchySRB and MFT.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like to chime in on this too. The staging can really break KER\u0027s readout. I\u0027ve gotten around it by building things in parts like the launch vehicle first and then the actual probe/manned vehicle since once I join them together and arrange my staging I get a lot of \u0022---\u0022 readings\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Padishar","CreatedById":97386,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-27T12:43:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve spent some time looking into this now and my conclusions are as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. The code that calculates the deltaV (runs a simulation of burning the rocket until completely out of fuel) was recently moved from running in the main thread to running in a worker thread.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. If there is a problem in the simulation code then it can get stuck in a state where the simulation didn\u0027t complete successfully and new simulations do not get run because the plugin thinks the previous simulation is still running.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. My problem where it hanged when displaying the vessel tab (in 0.6.1.5) is caused by the simulation code getting stuck in an infinite loop. When this was in the main thread the whole game locked up but now it is in a worker thread the rest of the game continues (but the simulation never finishes and never gets run again because it is already running).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. I believe that various issues where it stops updating or rendering the window properly are caused by an unhandled exception in the simulation code triggered by a race condition with the main game code. E.g. if the simulation is busy scanning the part tree to build its own data structures (in the background thread) when the main game code makes a change to the part tree then this could potentially cause all manner of horrible bugs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am currently in the process of fixing these issues:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Modify the recursive functions in the simulation code so they correctly track the parts that have already been visited so if there are cycles in the part tree (e.g. with my station where you have loops of parts docked together) then it doesn\u0027t get stuck. This will also improve the efficiency of the simulation code.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Move the initial phase of the simulation code that builds the data structure from the part tree to run in the main thread and only run the actual simulation (that only uses its own data structures) in the worker thread.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Modify the exception handling so that if there are exceptions in the simulation code (probably most likely with mods that create new types of engine and/or fuel resources) then the simulations won\u0027t be left in the disabled state.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully I will get these three bits done sometime over the weekend and they will fix most (if not all) of the major issues.
