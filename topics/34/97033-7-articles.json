I need to just package a .version file with it to avoid this issue in the future. I just submitted the pull request on GitHub, so you\u0027ll be able to update automatically within a few hours. Alternatively you can install MagiCore manually, or you might be able to by importing the following .ckan file into CKAN (save it into a text file).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\n{\n    \u0022spec_version\u0022: 1,\n    \u0022identifier\u0022: \u0022MagiCore\u0022,\n    \u0022name\u0022: \u0022MagiCore\u0022,\n    \u0022abstract\u0022: \u0022A common set of utilities for magico13\u0027s mods\u0022,\n    \u0022author\u0022: \u0022magico13\u0022,\n    \u0022license\u0022: \u0022MIT\u0022,\n    \u0022resources\u0022: {\n        \u0022homepage\u0022: \u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/97033-10x\u0022,\n        \u0022repository\u0022: \u0022https://github.com/magico13/MagiCore\u0022\n    },\n    \u0022version\u0022: \u00221.0.1\u0022,\n    \u0022ksp_version\u0022: \u00221.0.5\u0022,\n    \u0022install\u0022: [\n        {\n            \u0022file\u0022: \u0022GameData\u0022,\n            \u0022install_to\u0022: \u0022GameData\u0022\n        }\n    ],\n    \u0022download\u0022: \u0022https://github.com/magico13/MagiCore/releases/download/1.0.1/MagiCore.zip\u0022,\n    \u0022download_size\u0022: 4230,\n    \u0022x_generated_by\u0022: \u0022netkan\u0022\n}\u003C/pre\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceNomad","CreatedById":136195,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-22T11:02:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have an issue with \u003Cem\u003EFieldExperience\u003C/em\u003E 1.0.2 installed via CKAN on KSP 1.0.5 for Linux 64 bits: The experience of the current flight is not registered even after doing the usual \u0022go to spacecenter\u0022 or \u0022quicksave/quickload\u0022 dances (I also exited and restarted KSP).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy crew is currently in the SOI of Minmus (but not yet in orbit).
