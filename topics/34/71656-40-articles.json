While its again, low priority, i reccomend at least in the long term looking into CRC checking or something to make sure files are indeed identical between server and client. In pure snadbox mode, this is actually not an issue (as there is no competition/combat ect), but i will say, once stuff like combat mods become popular enough, this needs to be implemented to a certain extent to level the playing field (at the bare minimum on weapon properties, we dont want anyone making a gun be instakill).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-14T19:10:38Z\u0022 title=\u002212/14/2014 07:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 14, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by panzer1b\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"godarklight","CreatedById":92588,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-15T08:23:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@TurielD: What your asking for is a little overcomplicated - Allowing people to sync into any time (correctly) would require the server persisting old states, which isn\u0027t a path I want to go down - You\u0027d need to make 5 trips to the database per player per second and have an ever expanding database for such a small feature :-/.
