It is like a completed project which you can just forget about for a while and then come back to later if you want to. Might be a bit disappointing to find your base dying due to missing maintenance while you were focussing on an 8-year Eeloo round trip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way, I prefer the Duna modules over the Scout/Koala modules a lot. Sleeker looks, Karibou integration, choice of landing gear and I even think the MK-V modules look better on it. But hey, more incentive to upgrade to full MKS. Speaking of which, I think I might borrow the \u0022dirt\u0022 resource for some private modding. Making pilots the specialists as well, as shovelling dirt seems like a brawn over brains job. It is certainly not rocket science.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-12T21:14:55Z\u0022 title=\u002210/12/2015 09:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fat D\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
