Ive added and modified missions in this file. When the new versions comes out, my missions are deleted by the file that replaces it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suggest: rather than a single file with the missions, create a directory \u0022MCContracts\u0022. This directory will contain all the mission files, one mission (with sub-missions) per file. Whenever the player wants to select one of the missions in the directory, the app can parse each file for just the lines that contain the \u0022name\u0022, payment, and science points. When the player clicks a specific mission, the app can parse and display the info contained therein; this would use the same parsing algorithm it does currently. To simplify matter further, perhaps just do the name/payment/science parse just once when the game begins (when mods are loaded and initialized).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaking this construct would also allow other players to create contracts to share with the player community. Finally, when you (malkuth) create new versions of MCE and add missions, the new files will not clobber the player-created missions. You could implement a naming standard; all official MCE missions would start with MCE and a number: MCE_001.cfg . All player-created content could be named whatever they choose.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mkire","CreatedById":5836,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-19T05:42:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe KIS mission set for one, They\u0027ve got \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\tpassiveMission = true\u003Cbr\u003E\tpassiveReward = 100\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Stuff like that in them, and when i look at them with the game loaded it says that i should be getting that reward daily until a time period runs out.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"malkuth","CreatedById":57414,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-19T10:41:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022mkire\u0022 data-cite=\u0022mkire\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe KIS mission set for one, They\u0027ve got \u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\tpassiveMission = true\u003Cbr\u003E\tpassiveReward = 100\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Stuff like that in them, and when i look at them with the game loaded it says that i should be getting that reward daily until a time period runs out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPassive missions no longer work, and I was not aware of any missions that still used them.

KSP updates the Default values of all parts when the game starts up. But does not keep in mind any Research Updates that reduce fuel prices or Part Prices. So when your looking up parts in the list, its more then likely the price listed on the KSP default window when reading about it is wrong. (doesn\u0027t include updated prices).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the prices are updated in the MCE window with part breakdowns as listed in the picture, so its not a good idea to try to math out the price listed in the KSP Vanilla window and the MCE window..

MCE is correct.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll this is moot once .24 comes out and MCE starts using the Default Values again and not its own algorithms.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Apollo13","CreatedById":74572,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-24T02:50:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMalkuth, thanks for the explanation.
