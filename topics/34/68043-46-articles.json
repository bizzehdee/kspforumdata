I found a few minor problems with the resource convertors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Elektron water electrolyser produces hydrogen and oxygen in slightly (a little over 1%) disproportional amounts compared to TAC. It also violates conservation of mass. I tracked down the problem to oxygen density. TAC, US and Community Resource Pack all use oxygen density 1.41 g/L, while the actual value is 1.43 g/L. You also use different ways to calculate the result, which normally wouldn\u0027t matter, but now the imprecision makes a difference.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour two ways :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUS - two gasses under same conditions (pressure, temperature) have the same volume / mole, so electrolysis of water produces exactly twice as much volume of hydrogen as oxygen. Due to imprecise oxygen density this doesn\u0027t conserve mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETAC - convert moles into mass, then mass into volume using density. Mass is conserved, but hydrogen volume wouldn\u0027t be exactly twice the oxygen volume. Because TAC doesn\u0027t have hydrogen and instead uses solid waste, there is no visible discrepancy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI recommend switching to the TAC way. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Aioc9ek3XAvwdGNsRlh3OVhlbTFBR3M4RW0zLUNTRFE\u0026amp;usp=sharing#gid=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHere is his spreadsheet.\u003C/a\u003E The electrolysis is at row 319.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETAC also uses different amounts of charge (EC) for electrolysis.

The difference between 1.41 and 1.43 is not big enough to affect realism and there will be imprecision either way, because all densities have only 3 significant digits.
