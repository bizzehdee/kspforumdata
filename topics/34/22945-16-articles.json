I have a fork up on github, not integrated with nobles yet, but we will more than likely post all updates to github under some account. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe need to do a bit of organization to get everything straight, but, with permission, we should be able to publish some updates fairly quickly. We were both messing around with the code, but waiting for permission, now that we have it, we need permission to either edit the OP on the thread (don\u0027t know if that\u0027s possible) or release on a separate thread. I guess noble tried posting a new thread, but it was shot down by a mod. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far the features/improvements discussed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-(done) fix /sharecraft\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-(done) toggles for chat/screenshot view\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-(almost) GUI client /server (GUI client lacks chat capability *only GUI, KSP chat unaffected*).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-(working on) screen shot performance. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-(future) video / continuous low fps screenshot mode\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eany additional feature suggestions are welcomed, but please within reason. (\u0022add real multiplayer\u0022) ya that might take a minute or two\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: What we\u0027ve both posted already are compatible with the existing KLF servers. The changes I\u0027ve made deal with the clientside/plugin only to fix sharecraft and add toggles, and the client/server GUI\u0027s (noble) are independent and compatible. These will both be merged into one version and available very soon. (along with the source).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the meantime, if you really want to latest of the latest, my update (dll) is compatable with nobles (client/server gui) and are interchangeable, but again, these will be merged very soon.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-27T13:10:19Z\u0022 title=\u002210/27/2013 01:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 27, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by nevermoto\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
