And in that sense our sun would be considered yellow-green, as its intensity peaks at the wavelengths associated with yellow and green. Color however, in the more metaphysical sense of the word, is in the eye of the beholder (no pun untended), and is merely the interpretation of electrical signals created by our eyes. Our eyes are incapable of properly measuring light, and we therefore experience the sun to be white/yellow......well long story short....colours are weird...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mcviscount","CreatedById":82561,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-01T15:46:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve installed several mods into KSP 0.24.2 x64 bit but I\u0027ve been having a problem where upon launching a vessel onto the runway or launchpad, it launches it several 100 km into orbit.
