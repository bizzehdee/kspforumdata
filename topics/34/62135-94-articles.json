Back at Phase 1 an argument could have been made that the Habitat module or the science lab didn\u0027t fit in the cargo bay, however that is not true anymore. \u003Cem\u003ETherefore as of Phase II there is no reason the KSO should be 2.5m\u003C/em\u003E And it matches stock sizes just fine. Unless you mean the 2.5 components, are all the components in the VAB 2.5m? Going to double check.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd for the 2.5m components you have the EWBCL which is coming next. That\u0027s as far as I\u0027m taking it. I don\u0027t have anything written up for the moon lander and rover, but they will be 1.8m fitted to the KSO (not the EWBCL). The EWBCL is really made to cover some of the community mods that are 2.5 meters in size and the rest of the default 2.5 meter components. After the EWBCL, all other phases of my project will continue to target the KSO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaking cockpits takes a long time. That\u0027s because of all the text and then you have to plan it in a way to all fit in a single 2048x2048 texture. But the biggest issue is whether Nazari can make something work or not plus we\u0027re limited as to how many resources we can do based on the terrible default memory management of KSP (a huge thank you to rbray and the Active Texture Management mod).

Maybe a revised art asset for the \u0022CLAW\u0022 that would suit the SST or KSO\u0027s cargo bay better than Squad\u0027s stock model? That said, I\u0027m truly grateful for all you and Nazari have already given us. Feels selfish to ask... much less demand... anything more.

It\u0027s not in a state for me to post pics yet, but I\u0027m trying to shoot for Wednesday. A few hurdles to still do but aside from that it\u0027s almost there in terms of all its features. It can take me a while to finally \u0022engineer\u0022 everything that works. The wing took a few days since it\u0027s all complicated and has spoilers and actuators and such, but I think you guys (especially aviation buffs) will appreciate the details.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESadly (depending on how you look at it) it won\u0027t be using the KSO\u0027s rear end (*hears Nazari cringe*). I decided to make a new rear end to give it a sleek aerodynamic contour, but more importantly to have a more balanced RCS. It still follows the KSO design and you will see them side by side, but the KSO EWBCL definitely yells \u0022cargo plane\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m super excited about it, just kind of sad that it\u0027ll replace everyone\u0027s KSO pretty much. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deathsoul097","CreatedById":77396,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-31T08:35:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe only real use for the EWBCL in my mind would be using it to return a Class A to Class B asteroid to KSC for science.
