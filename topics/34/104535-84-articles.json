I realize the regular RoboStruts work like that but I guess that\u0027s where I fell down with this.  I thought the grappler and target worked differently.   I found a post on the Steam forums showing the RoboStrut Grappler in use between two separate craft:\n\n[http://steamcommunity.com/app/220200/discussions/0/412447331645950094/#c412447524178954836](http://steamcommunity.com/app/220200/discussions/0/412447331645950094/#c412447524178954836)\n\nQuoted:\n\n*So, here\u0027s something I threw together quickly...*  \n  \n![B591D9E2A58E6005596AD0D42E819A510F768B6D](https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/320123731823229160/B591D9E2A58E6005596AD0D42E819A510F768B6D/)http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=626476676\n\n*[RoboStrut to the rescue](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=626476676)*\n\n*[A Screenshot of Kerbal Space Program](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=626476676)*\n\n*[By: Manwith Noname](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=626476676)*\n\n*This is Infernal Robotics implimentation of reusable struts. I took the Mallard stock craft and modified it simply by placing one strut part in the floor of the cargo bays. Then I built a really simple rover...that made me realise just how small MK3 cargo bays are...and the rover had it\u0027s own strut receptor.I was able to drive the rover up the ramp...with a little brute force and ignorance...and into the cargo bay area where I could then right click on the floor strut to make it connect. I had to switch craft to do this but that\u0027s down to how I placed the parts and the parts I used.Then I could fly no problem, the craft remain seperate and so the wheels don\u0027t pass through the plane. That screenshot is actually while in flight.Infernal Robotics is an awesome mod by the way. I would install it before any other extra parts simply because it really does bring something that isn\u0027t otherwise available in the stock game...and I mean the robot parts more than these struts...but the struts are great too.* \n\nSo I\u0027m guessing this functionality was broken after some base game update?  Looks like it worked pretty cool though. \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-03-26T19:58:03Z\u0022 title=\u002203/26/2017 07:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 26, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by DoubleUU**\n  \nClarity"},{"CreatedByName":"Selrinn","CreatedById":165678,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-26T22:39:01Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 3/25/2017 at 7:07 AM, Hacki said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I patched the sourcecode and compiled my own version of the surface sampler dll. \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The code changes are already in the main branch on github, but theres no updated dll yet. \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E You can download my version here: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/w13dbasuoshjpqj/IRSurfaceSampler.dll?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/w13dbasuoshjpqj/IRSurfaceSampler.dll?dl=0)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Drop it into \u003Cyour path=\u0022\u0022 to=\u0022\u0022 ksp=\u0022\u0022\u003E\\GameData\\MagicSmokeIndustries\\Parts\\Rework_Utility\\Plugins\n\u003E \u003C/your\u003E\n\u003E \n\nI grabbed your copy and replaced the dll in there but it still has the same problems. im testing off the runway to the left on Gael"},{"CreatedByName":"DoubleUU","CreatedById":173389,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-27T16:51:22Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 3/25/2017 at 10:27 PM, V8jester said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I actually just inquired about this very thing in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E thread.
