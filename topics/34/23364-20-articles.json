I restarted playing KSP with 0.23 (Windows 7). After adding chatterer, i get frequently lag in KSP. About every 5-6 seconds the program lags for about 0,5 secs. I finally found a way to work around this phenomenon by unchecking the audio-sets for sts and russian sounds. Not sure what actually happens, but it appears that Chatterer iterates at least in my case every few seconds over the sound files to do whatever with them.

The volume is just so in consistent, one minute it is at a nice volume the other minute it is screaming in my ears. Only the beeps are consistent. I freakin love the mod, which is the only reason I put up with it. I came to the thread hoping there was a patch to fix it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI even have the application volume lowered to 10% in the window sound applet. KSP sound in general are inconsistent, but the mod is severely so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also run borderless window. The only way that \u0022seems\u0022 consistent is by changing the sliders each time I enter a ship.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-12T21:14:00Z\u0022 title=\u002203/12/2014 09:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 12, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by WaveFunctionP\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sidfu","CreatedById":70409,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-16T20:34:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ehopely next update can lower its ram usaage below the 100-120mb it currently uses\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"smunisto","CreatedById":57789,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-29T14:08:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAny words on Chatterer update with a fix for the volume issue?
