The fuel locking is in stock, but with IFS installed, it\u0027s status does not persist. I\u0027ll do some more testing and see if I can\u0027t confirm it is IFS. It could be the way CCC is configuring it. It\u0027s hard for me to tell.\n\u003E EDIT:\n\u003E \n\u003E Definitely somehow related to IFS. Here is what it looks like without IFS. If I save the craft and re-load it later, this tank stays locked (that tank is meant to be a refill tank for the lander so I want it not used, using IFS it is supposed to be the only one there with Oxidizer because it is a NERV stage).\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003E [http://i.imgur.com/zIlnRvP.png](http://i.imgur.com/zIlnRvP.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E However, if I install IFS again, saving and loading the craft results in the tanks being unlocked.
