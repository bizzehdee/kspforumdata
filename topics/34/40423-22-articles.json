Some folks have mentioned they do not like this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could click the toolbar button to hide the indicator, but I had it automatically re-appear whenever you changed targets (including deselecting and re-targeting your previous target). So, based on the feedback, I\u0027ve tweaked the behavior of the toolbar button slightly - now, if you click the toolbar button, it hides the indicator - and the indicator does NOT reappear, until you click the toolbar button again. My fear, however, is that this could lead to situations where folks are not sure why the DPAI isn\u0027t popping up, etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s late and I\u0027m tired, so it\u0027s entirely possible that I\u0027m scratching my head over a trivial issue that most folks won\u0027t think twice about.
