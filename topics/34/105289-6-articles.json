I\u0027ve always hated how I couldn\u0027t alter their thrust after I got that initial boost that I wanted causing me to hit mach 1.5 at 5 Km... Shortly after that I\u0027d end up with shock heating because you can\u0027t change the grain, grain amount, or pattern in stock to hold back from going an absolutely bat-excrements insane speed not 25 - 30 seconds after liftoff. Seriously, this is the type of feature that needs to be implemented into 1.1 whenever it\u0027s released. It\u0027s not a confusing element, it doesn\u0027t conform 100% to realism but it\u0027s way better than what we have now, and finally, it just flat out improves gameplay. I mean, why not, it\u0027s pretty much always a good decision to add a feature that allows the player even more freedom when designing his / her vehicle.\n\nYou should be be quite proud of that little plugin! I\u0027ve never seen another mod that attempts to reproduce what you\u0027ve done here.\n\nI\u0027d love to see some more development where, instead of just throttling down via percentage of fuel and the current thrust limiter, to where you could choose your own thrust curve after a given amount of time. Say I want 100% at liftoff, a slow decline of 1% or 2% per second for 10 or 15 seconds, and then after that have a steeper decline. That may not be the optimal thrust curve, but I\u0027m mainly just giving an example.\n\nI\u0027d love to see it implemented, but it\u0027s obviously not my plugin, nor is me that has to put the work in to figure out how to accomplish it in game. Anyways, sorry from the rambling! It\u0027s just such a great, small mod, but adds so much. \n\nThanks, [@Crzyrndm](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/92871-crzyrndm/)!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-04T13:29:41Z\u0022 title=\u002201/04/2016 01:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 4, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by FiiZzioN**"},{"CreatedByName":"Crzyrndm","CreatedById":92871,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-04T20:22:30Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 7 hours ago, FiiZzioN said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027d love to see some more development where, instead of just throttling down via percentage of fuel and the current thrust limiter, to where you could choose your own thrust curve after a given amount of time.

I know this isn\u0027t a common usage, but was curious if this could even be done. A small bonus of this is it would allow any RCS fuels to be used with Realfuels instead of 1, not sure if multiple are allowed, hardcoded fuel and Isp.

When I played with this mod previously, the first thing I noticed was that you lose that feature. Is that some how wrapped up in how the torque gets manipulated by this mod or are we just stuck with whatever is in the configs of the particular reaction wheel in question?

I see the plane spawn in, drop gently to the ground, and the moment the wheels hit, the screen freezes (thanks to the debug log getting spammed). On the off chance that the UI responds enough to go back to the space center, everything is gone or space, and the only remedy is killing KSP and restarting.\n\nI don\u0027t have any of the bits avaliable at the moment, working from memory it was an X1 cockpit, a couple of procedural tanks, B9 proc wings, and some adjustable landing gear bits, plus the engine. I want to say the small engine worked, but I\u0027m not 100% certain about that.\n\nThe logs show some NREs from ModuleDynamicGimbal.Update, followed by a ground offset error, and then the view direction being NaN. That NaN rips through all the transforms that touch it, and kerbin collapses into a black hole. Removing DynamicDeflection fixes that problem, but it\u0027s somewhat less than ideal, the flight after got ripped apart by some fatfingering on PilotAssistant.\n\nOther things I tried while diagnosing it:\n\nRemoved landing gear -- still happens when the fuselage hits the ground\n\nSwitching engines -- both of the afterburning engines explode it, don\u0027t recall on the small one. X1 engine works, but it\u0027s a rocket so it probably doesn\u0027t count.\n\nYanked wings -- still dies\n\nRemoving engine -- works"},{"CreatedByName":"Crzyrndm","CreatedById":92871,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-14T06:06:15Z","Content":"will investigate, might be an incompatibility with some of the other plugins RO uses"},{"CreatedByName":"Crzyrndm","CreatedById":92871,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-21T06:28:16Z","Content":"Dynamic Deflection updated for KSP 1.1, others following as I get to them\n\nEDIT\n\nAdd Semi Sat RW, and the SRB thrust limiter to that\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-21T07:34:22Z\u0022 title=\u002204/21/2016 07:34  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 21, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Crzyrndm**"},{"CreatedByName":"Crzyrndm","CreatedById":92871,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-22T07:20:37Z","Content":"All mods should now have 1.1 compatible release versions"},{"CreatedByName":"Kowgan","CreatedById":116874,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-22T08:23:59Z","Content":"Thank you so much, Crzyrndm! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"funk","CreatedById":118840,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-22T09:13:52Z","Content":"Thank you for updating.\n\nI have an issue with Variable Thrust Limiter.
