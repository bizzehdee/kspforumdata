The main one is the png files. I\u0027ve actually gone back to the med-res pack for the clouds and city lights, the clouds look fluffier and the city lights don\u0027t show too much differentiation. The best thing to do is get those Texture Replacer files into jpg. I took the Kerbin300 raw file down from 25MB to 3.5MB in jpg and I can\u0027t really see much of a difference, excpet now my game doesn\u0027t stutter in LKO. The same can be said for the EVE textures.
