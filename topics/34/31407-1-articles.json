If the previous plugin author wants to reclaim this he may do so and I will not object. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have tested it before and after save as well as before and after returning to space centre - both from orbit and at the launch pad to ensure that the state saves correctly. This feels like flimsy testing, so bug reports etc. are appreciated. The biggest problem I see is that the enable/disable button asks you for the command to change the state without showing you the state itself, which may be counter-intuitive but is a problem with the previous mod and many user interfaces of this kind. The only reasons I have not added a separate status line are simplicity and to keep in line with the original request... but I am not adverse to doing this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HoY","CreatedById":57294,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-05T00:58:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI wasn\u0027t aware that the previous Toggle ASAS didn\u0027t work anymore!
