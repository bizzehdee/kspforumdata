KSP is still very much in development itself and with all the wacky physics calculations it has to perform and the very poor memory management setup it currently has, it really needs a decent rig to play smoothly on. I get it, people can\u0027t afford decent gaming computers or prefer their laptops with integrated graphics cards. But remember it\u0027s not the mod community\u0027s fault. They didn\u0027t develop KSP with it\u0027s current flaws. So they really need to speak up and voice their frustrations to Squad if they expect them to go anywhere. Such quacking at the mod authors can be very grating and it saddens me that you may not continue after phase III. I have very much enjoyed following the development and release of this mod, watching it grow and mature. I believe you are very talented, you seem to really enjoy this game as much as we do, and hope that you may change your mind in the future. But I get it if you decide not to. Either way, I look forward to playing with phase II and thank you for your dedication and hard work.

Also, it\u0027s perhaps worth noting there are two duplicate menu items in the tweakable menu to disable this feature (I\u0027m presuming that\u0027s not intentional?). Ultimately I had to remove all RPM-related .dll files from my GameData folder to resolve this issue (which is a shame, as the integration into the ISA is really lovely). Also worth noting, the RPM files that were included with KSO are the *only* RPM files I\u0027ve ever installed (so conflicts with other, outdated .dll files shouldn\u0027t be an issue here). If this is an issue I can resolve myself with a ModuleManager .cfg file or something, please let me know!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly, the OA-850 Liquid Fuel Boosters. These look/sound great and with one relatively minor exception, perform great. The exception being they won\u0027t \u0022auto-stage\u0022 either with MechJeb or dtobi\u0027s Small Parts auto-staging device. I\u0027ll have to do more extensive testing, but I believe the issue might be related to onion staging or specifically the Thrustmax External Fuel Tank itself. For the time being, I\u0027m using dtobi\u0027s altimeter device to force them to stage at ~15km (which works fine).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly, and with full understanding KSO \u0022does not natively support MechJeb\u0022 and that \u0022compatibility was never intended\u0022 \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E , in the interest of trying to be helpful, I\u0027d like to bring to light another small quirk. Performing automated maneuvers works great... for about 90% of the maneuver execution. It\u0027s in the final 10% where things get a bit screwy. Specifically, the orbiter appears to lose its guidance as if S.A.S. was abruptly disabled (it\u0027s like it\u0027s \u0022oversteering\u0022 at the tail end of the operation). Mind you, this is in orbit-outside the influence of atmospheric drag-with only the Omnimax 40Ts engaged (the Thrustmax 200s perform markedly worse, as to be expected). I\u0027ve tried disabling/locking the gimbals as well as the trim, but that only seems to exacerbate the issue. I\u0027m presuming this may have something to do with the engines being slightly offset from the center of mass? I really have no idea. It\u0027s quite strange that it only affects such a small portion, and not the whole. My work-around is to simply disengage/re-engage the maneuver, or just ride it out and hope I don\u0027t expend too much deltaV or go too far off the intended course. It\u0027s not game breaking, just slightly frustrating when trying to perform complex operations like rendezvous.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyhow, I hope that was helpful. Again, I can\u0027t thank you enough for this wonderful addition to my KSP experience.
