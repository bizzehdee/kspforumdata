With just a stayputnik, a 0.5m x 1.8m stretchy tank, an engine, a communotron and some chutes, I end up with a rocket that weighs less than 0.7t full and less than 0.2t empty, but the smallest bottom-mounted engines (discounting the orbital maneuvering systems with their anemic 1.5 kN) are giving me around 28-30 kN of thrust even when choosing the worst possible fuel. That\u0027s a TWR of over 4 on a liftoff stage, rapidly increasing to over twice that before even leaving the lower atmosphere... and I cannot throttle them down (not even with the thrust limiter), and I can only ignite them once. As a result, my rockets are traveling upwards faster than they do while falling back down, giving me the choice between shutting the engines off early and thus not reaching the target altitude at all, or burning themselves up before getting high enough. Deadly reentry? Pah, reentry is a gentle caress compared to launch! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDidn\u0027t have very much time to experiment yesterday evening, but I\u0027m thinking about rigging something up with two of the 12 kN radial engines (I wish I could have one single inline 12 kN engine!) on a slightly shorter tank so they cut out early, and then another small tank on top with two radial OMS engines to ignite afterwards.
