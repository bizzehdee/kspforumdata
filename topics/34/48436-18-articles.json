I took a look through the part files and I see your point.

Do you get more dV, or less, for the same total mass (engine\u002Btank\u002Bfuel)? The answer for hydrolox is \u0022way more dV\u0022. Even if you\u0027re not using cryogenic tanks. If you are, then it\u0027s way, /way/ more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that just because a tank is the same size doesn\u0027t mean it\u0027ll mass the same; a jumbo-64 containing LH2/LOx will have lower dry mass than one containing RP-1/LOx. Even though the total tank volume is the same (LH2 tanks are lighter per unit of volume).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow you might think, jeez, all these giant tanks mean so much drag loss! Well, drag losses are very minimal, so you at most might lose 50m/s from switching your entire launcher from kerolox to hydrolox (WAG). On the other hand, you probably have 1.25x the delta V now, for the same mass. You do the math. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally another advantage of Hydrolox (in MFS) is that while the Isps ferram cites are available early on with Hydrolox (TL2/3), it takes until TL6 or so for kerolox to get those figures, so you\u0027re better off comparing hydrolox\u0027s 380-450s to kerolox\u0027s 270-340s. Much bigger increase then.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMAKC: Because MFS rounds fuel quantity, and ST rescales in itty-bitty chunks (1% at a time), rounding errors add up during scaling. When you have approximately the right size tank, go into the tank editor, and remove and re-add your MFS fuel tanks; that will correct the ratios. The way it works internally is this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMFS normally rounds fuel quantities (to 4 sig figures, or to the nearest integer if \u0026gt; 1000). When you start rescaling a ST, rounding is turned off, but the rounded ratio (not the correct ratio) is the starting point. When you move your cursor off the tank, quantities are rounded again. That means you get rounding errors twice, but it\u0027s the price you pay for nice numbers in MFS. I\u0027m considering turning rounding off entirely, however, since AFAIK most people who use MFS use ST, and does it really matter if your amount of fuel isn\u0027t a nice round number?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eerbmur: Ah, try changing the heat multiplier in MFS/RealFuels/RealSettings.cfg\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo that your engines don\u0027t overheat (who designs engines that overheat!?)

Great. The much lighter layout also means you can either use a smaller lifter rocket design, or by using the same for a heavier payload, could put you in a higher orbit and in the end sending you further and giving more D/V for the overall mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, even the heavier RP1 per m3 version, can be launched without so many overengineering in a single launch.

With a basic support structure and some piping included, such an LH2 tank can have a mass ratio of 30-50:1 or better, much better than the BOTs in KSP (9:1).
