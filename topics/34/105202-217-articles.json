For example, let\u0027s say that I would like to write the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E patch for my own personal needs, what should I do for converting one resource to the other?\n\nWe know that one kerbal uses 10.8 life support unit per day,\n\nthe nomomatics, use 1 fertilizer and 10 mulch, to produce 11 life support and\n\n1 life support gives 1 mulch\n\nNow looking into this equation, if I would like to use mulch and close the cycle?  How should be the converting ratio? we are going to use one mulch for example to produce 0.1 fertilizer ....... but.... with the above info, I am not sure if we really have closed the cycle truely or we just did a bad ratio convertions, that is why I am asking here and called for rover dude for help. I didn\u0027t meant for him to really change anything in the base mod, but maybe a new simple part mod with one or two parts that will barely need any maintenance in future? or at the very least help someone like me with information on a correct ratio to close the gap.\n\nI was thinking of using the same model Soylent mod is using (it\u0027s one of those old MIT parts that is circulating around) for 1 part per 1 kerbal base and the model from seti green house (another MIT part) for more than one kerbal per part. But again, I am not sure about the ratio of resources here and what to use as the base to produce the needed fertilizer."},{"CreatedByName":"goldenpsp","CreatedById":113874,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-12-23T15:22:45Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 6 minutes ago, Jiraiyah said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E that is why I am asking here and called for rover dude for help\n\u003E \n\nYes maybe however\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Quote\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Now \u0022YOU\u0022 tell me,\n\u003E \n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Quote\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E HOW THE HELL should I re-supply it\n\u003E \n\nWhen you use language like that, it sounds a wee bit more demanding than a simple ask.\n\nThat being said, again how is this [@RoverDude](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/105198-roverdude/)\u0027s responsibility.

It\u0027s why the recyclers work on reduced consumption, and the greenhouse takes what\u0027s left over (with a little help of external mass) to make supplies.
