For example, the part I showed in the video has been extended to recover other gasses from the atmosphere, such as methane(i.e. kethane), hydrogen, helium(i.e. xenon), etc. Most of these gasses are fractions of a percent of Earth\u0027s atmosphere, and since I assume Kerbin is the same, it take many hours to recover the rarer gasses. If you are patient, or if you make a gas recovery farm with lots of these devices, you can recover things fairly rapidly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt even recovers moisture, now. So now you, too, can be a moisture farmer.

The tricky bit is that, in the presence of O2, the Kethane will revert back to CO2 and H2. This means that if you want to recover Kethane, you need to run an O2 compressor to constantly remove the O2 and turn it into oxidizer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre people interested in more teaser videos, or would people rather we wait and make tutorial videos?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JeffreyCor","CreatedById":93167,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-08T16:31:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d prefer tutorial videos, the teasers just make me go nuts about having to wait for the update \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BigD145","CreatedById":417,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-08T17:04:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETutorials first.
