I have both Infernal Robotics and Action Groups Extended, both of which can add a button to your toolbar (but, by default they don\u0027t add a button, until you use the configure visible buttons option). When I originally went out to the launch pad (before I added any buttons to the toolbar), the toolbar showed up with that cute button with all the coloured boxes on it. I used the drop down button at the right end to add Infernal robotics. I went back to the VAB to make a change to my ship (to add a action group to agx). When I returned to the launchpad, the toolbar no longer showed up at all. There was no dropdown arrow to allow me to go in and configure the visible buttons. So I can\u0027t add AGX to your toolbar. I then went back to the vab, added an IR part to the ship. Went back to the vab, and the toolbar now appears (as IR has buttons it wanted to show)... Now there is a drop down button to allow me to configure the visuble buttons, so as to be able to add the AGX. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, the catch is, once you\u0027ve added buttons to the tool bar (via the dropdown that allows you to configure the visible buttons). If none of the buttons that you\u0027ve added happens to be relevant at that point in time, the toolbar doesn\u0027t appear at all, and hence you can no longer click the dropdown to configure the visible buttons, so as to add something else to the toolbar. In the version that I had running on .25, if there were no buttons to show, the toolbar would display that original button with the multicoloured boxes in it. A place holder if you wish, so that the bar would be there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PizzaMore","CreatedById":92544,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-19T18:00:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Apollo13\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Apollo13\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027ve responded to you via PM, as your (and my previous statements) are off-topic from blizzy\u0027s intent in this thread, i.e., to discuss the mod.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eagreed and sent. also agree with your community vote idea/statements; the new toolbar is a step down from blizzy78 contribution.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blizzy78","CreatedById":68543,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-19T18:05:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DaveS\u0022 data-cite=\u0022DaveS\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo, the catch is, once you\u0027ve added buttons to the tool bar (via the dropdown that allows you to configure the visible buttons).
