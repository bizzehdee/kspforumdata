This is particularly handy when doing transfers -- if you\u0027re going from Kerbin to the Mun, you can double-click to focus the Mun and then zoom in to get a better look at the situation/better place maneuver nodes.

Also handy to increase is CONIC_PATCH_LIMIT (probably to 5 or so), which determines the number of predicted orbits that will be displayed. For instance, if you\u0027re launching from Kerbin and slingshotting by the Mun to transfer to another planet, it\u0027d look something like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConic #1: Your current Hohmann transfer trajectory from Kerbin to the Mun\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConic #2: The Mun flyby trajectory.
