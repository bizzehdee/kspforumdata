I play with DRE and FAR and with how high you can pop your chutes as long as I don\u0027t come in at an extreme angle there\u0027s litterally nothing stopping me from releasing my main chute the second i go below 40km. The rate at which it slows me down by the time I hit the 32-30km range I\u0027m going slowly enough that theres no risk of the chutes catching fire making a heatshield redundant. \u003Cp\u003ECan you give thought to maybe asking nathan if you can \u0022borrow\u0022 his ablative shielding coding and apply it to chutes but name it somethin that has to do with how much of the chute is still intact and functioning. Such as either if the resource is gone your chutes are basicly shredded beon use and are automaticly cut or the ammount of drag they produce is equal to how much of the integrity resource is left? I know I can just house rule myself and not fire chutes litterally the first moment I can but having to think before I hit that button wouldn\u0027t be a bad thing especially if it can be disabled if someone didn\u0027t wish to bother with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeck you could even take it a step further and with all the new parachutes you have spread them across the tech tree denoting where parachute tech is increasing ( early chutes are barely a step above WW2 era tech later ones made of much stronger stuff able to take the higher reentry speeds).\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s more an issue about your own playthrough. If you play with FAR and DRE, you\u0027re looking for reality, and if you are doing so, you should not be deploying your chute so high, because you kind of know it shouldn\u0027t be deployed so high. You can either edit the altitude yourself, or use the new option I\u0027m introducing right now and create a deployment per pressure \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, good news folks, v0.3 is here!!!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EChangelog:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003EDecember 4th 2013\u003Cbr\u003Ev0.3\u003Cbr\u003E-Completely removed stock drag dependancy.

The number you plug in the configs is diameter, however the plugin transforms this diameter into area to correctly calculate drag. Not only that, but the plugin changes the mass of the parachute according to how large your parachute is. So having a larger parachute will result in your having a heavier part, as you would normally expect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen the drag coefficient is harder to define. It varies from material to material according to different caracteristics.

So the higher the drag coefficient, the more drag it will produce per square meter of area.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is why the material is important.

I ca assure you that it will be after my finals. I simply don\u0027t have enough time anymore. However, I have a free month after of vacation. So I wouldn\u0027t expect v1.0 before Christmas. It will be an extremely large update code speaking, so it will take some time.
