Thanks for the protip, I hadn\u0027t seen that post.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did have a look around but I couldn\u0027t see any options in any cfg files; does anyone know if you can change the power priority for each device? I would set the transmitter to 4, Engines to 3, and set the fusion reactor req\u0027s to 1, above all other operations barring DC power. That should in theory keep the fusion reactor going unattended, until the fission nukes ran out of fuel (and once the little fusion calc bug is fixed), right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do like the power priority system, but it would be great if the transceivers only sent power available after, say, priority 3\u002B. Anything 2 or higher could be deemed off-limits, so you don\u0027t bleed your ship power supplies dry. Anyone else think this would be good, possibly configurable, in-game, as a tweakable or using the current Power Management UI?

KSPI does not have a life support requirement. Asside from the near future tech aspect theres not really any reason to include it in this mod specifically as anything but a flavor item. If you\u0027d posted this in one of the various life support mod threads it would make much more sense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAsside from that this mod focuses alot on advanced propulsion.
