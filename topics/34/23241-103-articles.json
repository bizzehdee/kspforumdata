Memory footprint in the game is unchanged. The benefits include sliced by approximately half, the compressed archive size being slightly smaller, and mip maps being generated properly by the engine.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E* All parts are hooked into the tech tree. Parts aren\u0027t dumped to a single node, unlock gradually and, as possible, are arranged in a way that provides enough parts for you to build usable crafts at all stages of the tech tree progression. No SABREs at tier 3, no bizjets at tier 8, no shuttle control surfaces without shuttle wings and fuselages. All parts should also be compatible with the modded tech trees, as they usually preserve the original node names our configs are linked to.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E* Added new landing gear parts that blend into the parent parts and fit a huge variety of aircraft. Choose between twin-wheeled and single-wheeled configuration, two different clearances and two different colors (allowing them to blend perfectly with all-purpose gray or plated black pieces). All landing gears are equipped with togglable electric motors and can be steered.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E* Added new solid rocket separation boosters to replace the awkward stock one.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E* Added the shielded variety of A1 light. It is mostly intended for use as the landing light, as new gear models, in contrast with stock ones, have no light sources to avoid breaking through per-pixel light limits and improve performance. Comes in two colors, same as the landing gear set.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E* Added the 1.25m (MK1) aerodynamic junction part. Useful for nice transitions to radial engines, fancy boosters on rockets, and stylish UAV glider noses.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E* Added new struts to finally retire the stock ones from every single craft. First variety is functionally identical to the stock one, just a bit more sturdy \t* and quite better looking. Second variety is where it gets interesting: it\u0027s a strut part with an invisible middle piece. Exceptionally useful when you \t* want a clean design without all the messy cables: basically, you just place two very suble blocks and imagine how structural integrity was improved somewhere inside the craft. Clean and performance-friendly. Oh, those new parts have no shadow casting, - that might help with FPS on heavy crafts which typically use hundreds of struts.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E* Added MK2 cargoholds. Not very roomy, but they can still hold some useful payloads like 0.625m satellites or science modules, finally making the MK2 fuselage system useful for useful SSTO designs (!).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E* Added the smaller 5-port omnidirectional RCS blocks in line with already existing linear and 12-port varieties. Added dark-colored versions of RCS parts to allow them to blend with the shielded areas of the fuselages.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E* Added three new winglet sizes (2.3x1.6m, 3x2.2m, 3.2mx2.75m) and two new stabilator sizes (2.3x1.6m, 3x2.2m) to completely phase out any use of stock control surfaces from the crafts (2.3x1.6m is equivalent to the stock winglet in size). By the way, all 12 non-modular wing parts (stabilators, wingtips and winglets) in the mod are still using one single texture and maintain perfectly even texel density. No stretching, no duplicates, no distorted proportions.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E* Added new SH wing module (1x4m) to close the last remaining gap in the system. Added the static trailing edge parts that can be added to the backside of SH modular wings, for the first time in history making control surfaces look passable without forcing you to cover all trailing edges with them. Seriously, those a very nice looking. Oh, and control surfaces no longer have a weird orange cross sections on the side.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E* As separate ASAS/avionics parts became unnecessary since 0.21, all parts related to them (inline/radial/nosecones) are moved to the role of probe cores or sensor packages for the science system. Only exception is the plain MK2 nosecone, which is now decorative.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E*  Added few small parts, in particular: a green omnidirectional light (crafts can finally have proper colored pair of navlights on their wings), large radial DSI intake that\u0027s close in performance to the RBM intake, large air brake with roughly 3 times the surface area of the old one, \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E* All sample crafts completely updated to make use of new struts, lights, landing gears, wing pieces and other parts. Some were significantly redesigned. New crafts added, including a lightweight MK2 SSTO, three maneuverable UAVs and a subsonic glider.

Makes the engines less viable for prolonged gliding in the atmoshpere and more useful for space stuff different from barely circularizing in the LKO.\u003Cbr\u003E* Air consumption of the turbojet engine is increased.\u003Cbr\u003E* Action names on S2 crew part revised to fit into the fields.\u003Cbr\u003E* R1A air-powered RCS linear port ISP tweaked.\u003Cbr\u003E* VTOL engines rotation and steering inverted, enabled the velocity curve on VA1 and disabled the gimbal on it.\u003Cbr\u003E* Air brakes connection strength values added.\u003Cbr\u003E* Thrust vectoring engines are no longer trying to participate in roll control when they don\u0027t have a symmetrical counterpart.\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/0-20-2-b9-aerospace-pack-r3-1/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ejdZ2ZG.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ejdZ2ZG.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EVersion R4.0.\u003C/strong\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download/8hogzza9joulmkj/B9_Aerospace_Pack_R4-0.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMediafire.com mirror\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInspiration album:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/GGbuP\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/QUm7LAdm.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022QUm7LAdm.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlbum with new parts:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/jHFGa#0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3rfkIR1m.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00223rfkIR1m.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-20T16:25:44Z\u0022 title=\u002210/20/2013 04:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 20, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by bac9\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BNG","CreatedById":88942,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-20T16:09:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHnnnggg yessss!
