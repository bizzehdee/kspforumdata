I just don\u0027t know what. Nor is it related to FAR I don\u0027t think, because I switched off the option to enable aerodynamic failure and the part still went kaput on the runway. The F3 window said \u0022Cl-130 Cockpit was ripped off by strong airflow\u0022. I tried changing the root part from one of the fuselage pieces to the cockpit itself, which made the cockpit not fall off (even when the aircraft had lifted into the air) but I still got the message and effects (control loss) of the cockpit getting ripped off - and all my engines overheated.
