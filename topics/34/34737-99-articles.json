Anyway, point is that odd setup still works perfectly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is also a hinge that folds the walkway out of the way at lift off.

The first hinge has problems and seems to have a false pivot point. As it rotates it moves away from its base part.

So I attached the arm to another small cube (directly on the lander can, not to the rotator as before). The instant the craft loaded the arm jumped to one side and was embedded in the middle of the can, its base part still attached to the cube.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/OQtiSIt\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/OQtiSItl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022OQtiSItl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo confirm that the small cube was the cause of this I then attached the arm to an M-beam, this worked correctly, just like when the hinge was directly attached to the can.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/y7i5yVt\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/y7i5yVtl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022y7i5yVtl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next test was to mount the hinge directly to the rotator.

Neither does the octagonal strut so I tried that too. That has the same effect of making the arm jump into the middle of the lander can. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo at this point I was thinking that the lack of a physics significance might have something to do with the issues. But that isn\u0027t the whole story. I tried a number of other parts that do have a physics significance. The not-rockomax cube shows what I found the best. The closer to the rotator the hinge is mounted the more it distorts. When attached to the top of the cube it works fine, when attached to the side it is offset by a small amount.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/gjSUU4j\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gjSUU4jl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022gjSUU4jl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/848HeUQ\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/848HeUQl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022848HeUQl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo (again apols for being long winded) my conclusion; attaching hinges to parts that don\u0027t have a physics significant causes the hinge to malfunction. Directly attaching hinges to rotators also has issues and that the distance the hinge is from the rotator is a factor. With the same part between a hinge and a rotator, the hinge will malfunction when near the rotator and work correctly when its a certain distance away from it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother un-related observation about hinges is that quicksaving and loading does really bad things! the hinge gets distorted and is bent at a very different angle to how it was when the save was made. It\u0027s pivot point however seems to stay in the same place, but its notion of its central position will now be set to the angle it was at when the save was made.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know you know some of this already, but maybe this will add some light on something, possibly, maybe!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Legola","CreatedById":108896,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-18T00:02:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t even know if my previous posts are going to show up...
