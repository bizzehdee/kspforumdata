DR2 seems to aim to make atmosphere and heat a concern on re-entry. If you can avoid reentry burn up by some 20G nosedive into the atmosphere steeply then I think any problem with that should be addressed to the mod that occupies itself with accelerations and Kerbal comfort. If it takes two mods to define the upper and lower boundaries of reentry then so be it. If DR2 tackles the other boundary then we\u0027ll soon complain that life support needs to be implemented to prevent the quadruple atmo skip profile.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s keep the mods focused and modular to maximize the customizability and not overwhelm the authors.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"1096bimu","CreatedById":65460,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-31T00:32:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI just flew a plane at 2000m/s\u002B at about 30,000 meters for 10 minutes, no damage occurred and my engine didn\u0027t get any damage either despite running it at max heat for a few minutes.
