Basically from what I can see the Drills all only work when landed and in low-gravity the ship bobbles back and forth between a very low orbit and landed. I think that is behind it because if you anchor/damp (Not 100% sure which one causes the fix) it doesn\u0027t insta fill. Fix would be as straightforward as including the anchoring module into the drills so it activates when you extend the drill (I cant code at all or I\u0027d test it directly by modifying the code)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Astraph","CreatedById":80902,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-26T00:36:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RoverDude\u0022 data-cite=\u0022RoverDude\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe clever thing would be to use MKS\u0027s proxy logistics and have your drilling platform on the water, with a refinery and docking/transport mechanism on the beach.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the tip. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Although I do admit I\u0027ve never tried the logistics hub before...
