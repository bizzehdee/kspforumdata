It \u003Cem\u003Elooks\u003C/em\u003E like a radio button, and had I not been keeping up with the thread, I likely would not have thought to click it. Not sure what else you could do.

Can you put the vertical scrollbar in a deeper well that helps define it as separate from the initial toggle?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Threadsinger","CreatedById":100886,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-08T16:07:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022madlemur\u0022 data-cite=\u0022madlemur\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EPart of the problem is that it looks like a radio button, not a checkbox.
