I could simply blend the colors in shared cells, but that could be hard to read. I could split cells into sections, but that would require inserting additional vertices. Currently, every cell has exactly six vertices (pentagons have a center vertex) so cell\u0026lt;-\u0026gt;vertex conversions are fast integer operations. Additional vertices would mean using a lookup table and I\u0027d have to write in some way to adjust cells, preferably without rebuilding the entire mesh every time.

The last screenshots I linked showed Ore from the Extraplanetary Launchpads mod. The first release of the map won\u0027t do anything more than show resource scans, but I do have plans to add more. I wrote a custom shader for the grid renderer, so I can texture cells individually and shade those textures by the cell color.

That\u0027s a tricky problem and it\u0027s cool to know a bit more of the challenges, which you mentioned. In previous posts you mentioned a UI that showed up on mouse click in the bottom right corner. Would you be able to show easily in that info window the different resources at that hex location? (If you haven\u0027t already done it). Personally, that would be more than enough to satisfy my hunger for multiple resource crossover. It would allow players to visually toggle to get an approximation on the main map, then click hex\u0027s to confirm multiple resource locations.

The texture resolution setting also helps reduce the minimum amount of RAM that KSP needs to use while just idling at the Space Center screen, freeing up that RAM for use by KSP while you\u0027re trying to launch 300\u002B part rockets. It also helps stop the \u0022crashing on 2nd launch\u0022 type bugs, which occur when KSP is started with \u0022almost enough\u0022 ram.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: These settings changes don\u0027t just help \u0022low-end\u0022 computers run the game at a playable FPS either.
