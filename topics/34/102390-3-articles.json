It randomly picks X Kerbals and names the ones that need to return home in the contract - you could use something along those lines for your crew rotation to make it more obvious to the player what needs to be done (it wasn\u0027t obvious to me, but I only skimmed the .cfg file and didn\u0027t look at it in game)."},{"CreatedByName":"severedsolo","CreatedById":80345,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-12T05:31:34Z","Content":"Crew Rotation Missions should work like so - \n\n1) Check how many Kerbals the mission calls for (can be anything between 1 and 5).\n\n2) Check how many Kerbals you have on your station.\n\n3) Launch a vessel with a minmum Crew Capacity of 1, and a crew of at least (step 1 minus step 2) kerbals.\n\n4) Dock the vessel with the Space Station.

Not sure if this is related to the problem you\u0027re having, or is just background noise though (looking at that warning, it shouldn\u0027t break anything major)."},{"CreatedByName":"severedsolo","CreatedById":80345,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T10:25:17Z","Content":"The only thing I can think of from my end, did you update between accepting the contract and trying to complete it? \n\nIn my experience CC does not like that, and you have to cancel contracts and reaccept them to get them to work properly. (There are minor changes to CrewRotation in both updates).\n\nIf this is the case, just complete the mission through the debug menu, and better luck next time."},{"CreatedByName":"nightingale","CreatedById":119307,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T14:45:06Z","Content":"Generally speaking, with few exceptions, all the contract data for an offered or accepted contact is stored in the persistence file.
