You\u0027d be hard pressed to build an antimatter storage that \u003Cem\u003Ewould\u003C/em\u003E have an appreciable effect on Earth from 1 AU. Keep in mind that 1 AU is the next best thing to eight and a half \u003Cem\u003Elight minutes\u003C/em\u003E. Even from low orbit the danger of an exploding antimatter storage unit is pretty minimal, as long as you don\u0027t get large chunks of antimatter impacting the planet. That\u0027s a design issue. You can\u0027t subdivide a black hole to make it safer.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s a good point... Admittedly that was a verbatim quote from the linked article...

The black hole, as a single point [ok, so no quantum gravity yet, so maybe not \u003Cem\u003Eexactly\u003C/em\u003E a point] with charge will not do so. If the ship can be stopped accelerating instantly upon failure (and given that failure implies general power failure you likely will be (unless you are going with the parabolic mirror thing)) then the block hole will [hopefully] not be moving relative to the ship itself, giving at least some time to conduct repairs (that actually sounds like the start of a decent Hollywood plot - someone should link to Speilberg). One could presumably also have some permanent magnet fixture as a failsafe- as the black hole\u0027s charge and mass are going to be held more or less constant, and the feed will be [at least mainly] neutral material, such a set-up is presumably plausible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor safety, perhaps the black hole drive should be left in outer-system trajectories only (at no point should the instantaneous trajectory pass inside a [n important] plaentary orbit) so that it if there is a failure there is a great deal of time to deal with it (even if it ends up pointing too sunward, there are plausibly years to divert it (Hollywood plot #2)).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurthermore, with regard to subdivision, it is hard to see where that matters - except for an extremely large ship with multiple small containment sites, or for a spaceplane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the latter, the drive is obviously only intended for interstellar flight, and is in any case far too heavy to be useful for that. The safety measures I mentioned should be adequate. It is also worth mentioning that the whole point of the black hole is to convert matter to 100% energy (minus regular efficiency losses) - the antimatter is a storage medium unto itself. In deep space, there is not going to be a source for it. The black hole allows any matter one wishes to be converted into energy - space dust, stray asteroids, plutoids, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the former - The main safety gain I see now is as I just thought of above - that a collection of anti-protons tends to expand itself, while the black hole does not.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-01T18:44:14Z\u0022 title=\u002207/01/2014 06:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 1, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by ABZB\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xfrankie","CreatedById":93378,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-01T18:48:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022merendel\u0022 data-cite=\u0022merendel\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIntresting in therory but I\u0027m not sure I\u0027d want to be on the same planet as anybody first experimenting with creating one of those. I didnt see anything in those links in how you would move the thing either. you cant physicly push as it would just eat any material comeing in contact. The only way I could see it working is if droping bits of mater into the same spot on the BH caused it to release enough energy in a single direction that the BH would move itself. AT that point it would be a mater of building a structure around the BH in such a way that the gravitational forces were self balancing.

To be able to \u0022hitch a ride\u0022, you would have to be very close, because the gravitational acceleration at 1 meter around the BH would be roughly 4 cm/s^2 but at 1 centimeter, it would be 10000x stronger (beware the tidal forces). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy that point, most of the radiation would hit your ship, and becuase we already estabilished that it has to have some mass in order to move the BH, the impacts of the sub-atomic particles would push against the ship (sort of like a solar sail), canceling out any movement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFrom the wiki article: One potential method involves placing the hole at the focal point of a parabolic reflector attached to the ship, creating forward thrust.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne way it might work would be pulling and fixing the black hole in place with some strong magnetic field in an engine-like contraption behind your vessel.
