I point those out because plasma drives are an ultra-pain-in-the-ass without gigantic amounts of power, often producing less than that of a stock thermal nuclear rocket thingy of awesome. LV-N...or whatever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor 2, uhhhh...are you landing it? Because then you should be thinking about high thrust rockets (thermal turbojet thingy might do), and a \u003Cstrong\u003Elot\u003C/strong\u003E of chutes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TinyPirate","CreatedById":77813,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-18T08:28:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022phoenix_ca\u0022 data-cite=\u0022phoenix_ca\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFor 1...\u003Cp\u003EFor 2...\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOooh thanks! Now this is exactly the sort of info I need. Yes, Ions are efficient, but take. So. Long. and burning out of your interplanetary burn can be problematic as well, so a bit more power is ideal. It sounds like I should give a thermal rocket build a goo. As for landing - I was just going to chute the parts down (they would break into several sections on re-entry. I\u0027m using MKS). It was getting there and circularising I\u0027ve been most worried about. Yeah, an LV-thing would do the trick.. but I figure maybe my new toys are up to the job and so I should give them a go!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ABZB","CreatedById":98947,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-18T09:28:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat is the practical difference between an electrothermal propellant and a non-electrothermal propellant (looking at the electric engine cfg).?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
