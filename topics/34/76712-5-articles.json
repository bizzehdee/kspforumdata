Cap that stack with a nose cone and run it again in FAR and your drag losses are going to be within a few 10s of m/s worth of extra drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVery large diameter parts are probably getting more drag in SDF than they should but I\u0027m not actually sure about that. I have to sit down with some 5m and 10m parts and really give them a good going over. But my gut tells me that they\u0027re probably getting more drag than they should be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: On the subject of fairings, I have to write something up to detect if parts are enclosed in fairings. I don\u0027t want to do it the way FAR is doing it because parts very near the fairing wall tend to be missed. The way Procedural Fairings does it is better and I just need to take the time to sit down and write up code. (basically, find every part attached to the top node of the fairing base and call that the payload. If the fairings are attached to the base, the payload is marked as shielded)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough not asked, on the subject of cargo bays, it gets much easier. KSP 0.25 introduced a cargo bay module that checks for enclosed parts and exempts them from drag. That\u0027s easy enough to add to any animated cargo bay. Some other modders expressed concerns that the system would unbalance stock KSP but I consider those concerns to be grossly overblown.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-16T20:16:58Z\u0022 title=\u002212/16/2014 08:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 16, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Starwaster\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Galane","CreatedById":77949,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-16T22:46:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood to see lots of mods getting .90 updates. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Virtualgenius","CreatedById":67644,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-19T21:45:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like this drag fix much better than FAR or NEAR they are to complex to use this one is better the little tweaks you want to make sound really good\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-19T22:01:23Z\u0022 title=\u002212/19/2014 10:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 19, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Virtualgenius\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwaster","CreatedById":71262,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-19T22:00:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Virtualgenius\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Virtualgenius\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI like this drag fix much better than FAR or NEAR they are to complex to use this one is better\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlus it works with stock SAS and MechJeb because it doesn\u0027t replace control surfaces that both of them already know how to interpret\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerBlam","CreatedById":134309,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-04T16:34:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m running .90 in linux 64, and I like this much better than NEAR or FAR...
