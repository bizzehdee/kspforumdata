We need to brake into orbit at Pluto.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI checked the direct flight first. Standard porkchops show it\u0027s best to arrive at Pluto around October 2018 (when it crosses the ecliptic plane), since then you can use as much of Earth\u0027s orbital motion as possible. Lowest dV I found was Depart Earth Dec 30 1988 arrive at Pluto June 27 2018. Total dV expended (assuming you start in a 200km circular orbit around Earth) is 8183 (leave Earth)\u002B3610m/s (brake at Pluto) =11793m/s, trip time 10771 days. The Earth-Pluto synodic period is about 366 days, so there is a window every 366 days before and after this departure date. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext I searched Earth-Jupiter-Pluto. The Pluto-Jupiter synodic period is 4554 days, Earth-Jupiter is 398 days. It turns out that every 4554 days (~12.5 years) there are 4 or five windows (spaced about 400 days apart) for going E-J-P. I feel the best one before 1990 is to leave Earth Jul 16, 1976-Jupiter flyby Aug 26, 1978-Pluto arrival Aug 13, 1996. This is 7333 days for 6495\u002B4803=11299m/s. This saves 9.5 years over direct!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext I searched Earth-Jupiter-Saturn-Pluto. This got really complicated. You can get to Pluto really fast this way, less than 10 years for no greater start thrust than in the cases above, but you will arrive at Pluto at more than 14000m/s. Ouch! It gets to be a judgement call, is adding (for example) 200m/s to your total dV budget worth it to save 200 days on your trip? How about 400? In any case my favorite is: leave Earth Aug 30, 1977-flyby Jupiter Sep 16, 1979-Flyby Saturn Feb 13, 1982-Arrive Pluto Jun 12, 1996. This is 6860 days for 6833\u002B5197=12030m/s. Still almost 19 years in transit. I found only 4 E-J-S-P windows, all in the 1970\u0027s, and no others before 1990. I think there might be more starting around 2020 but I haven\u0027t checked yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are more complications, like the inclination of the optimal Earth starting orbit being less than the latitude of your launch site, but I\u0027ll put that aside for now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELord, I hope I didn\u0027t make a typo up there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wallygator","CreatedById":97357,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-06T10:18:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENathanKell, I bow in your general direction.
