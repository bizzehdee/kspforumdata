After the landing on the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn and returning to the tracking station at KSC, the lander didn\u0027t showed up in the list anymore (all icons activated). I had placed a flag after landing (which is still showing on the map), and went back to it but the lander next to it was gone. I quick loaded (where the lander is still there) and tried to go back to KSC to reproduce the behaviour. But regardless of what I try to do, the lander just disappears. Then I had the idea that the Gemini Lander Legs might be the problem, since they are from a plugin and indeed: I turned the lander upside down in the low gravity so the landing legs didn\u0027t touched the ground and the lander was still there after returning to KSC. Placing him back on his legs made him disappear again. Then I had another idea: Maybe it was because the Gemini Lander Legs were never \u0022officially\u0022 extended? Because I started with the lander on a carrier rocket from Kerbin with the landing legs already extended. So I retracted and extended the legs on the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn and voil\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A0: Now the game saves the lander correctly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know why this happens.
