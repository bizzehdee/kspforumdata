First of all rather doing all the achievements yourself you should provide the way for community to do it. You can make another folder called \u0022data\u0022 or \u0022awards\u0022 or whatever inside your achievements plug-in folder. In this folder there should be an ini files with the simple set of prerequisite for each achievement and the graphic file that will appear in the achievements menu. The rules may involve reaching some particular orbit, landing on some celestial body, reaching specific coordinates on specific celestial body, panting a flag, doing the EVA, loosing a kerbal, loosing a kerbal with name %, installing specific the part in the ship, getting specific part destroyed, bringing specific part to the specific celestial body\\orbit e.t.c. The plug-in it will then check the parameters in the ini files and if the player actions are fit the prerequisites the achievement will be awarded. By combining these sets of rules hundreds if not thousand achievements can be made by community and more importantly tested. It is fairly easy to create and test one or two achievements of your own, but create few hundreds and test all of them in game that would be serius effort. Let\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s not forget about the mods, maybe people would like to have some mod related achievements, you obviously have no manpower to sustain all of this alone so just let other to help you, providing community with achievement tools.

You mentioned some possible requirements that can be combined to form an achievement. Those requirements will only get you so far, meaning that the potential number of achievements is actually quite limited. For example, in the plugin there are already achievements for getting into a stable orbit around all bodies. I still need to add some more achievements of that type - in particular, getting into an eccentric orbit from a circular one (not sure about this one), and getting into a synchronous orbit. Those two don\u0027t really make sense having them for each and every body, so I will be leaving the \u0022body\u0022 requirement out of them, resulting in only 2 achievements instead of like 30.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe same goes for most of the requirements you mentioned where I just don\u0027t see multiple of them being in combination to form many achievements.

But they are not a priority for now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(There\u0027s also a practical problem with icons: If you have a number of achievements with icons having some sort of certain feel or look to them, you\u0027re practically stuck. If the artist who did the icons is no longer available, you\u0027re getting into problems, because new icons from a different artist would look and feel different.
