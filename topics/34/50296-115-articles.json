The maximum temps I can understand to a point (melting point of aluminum @ 660C being the primary structural component of hull bodies) however the heat transfer is really really off. I was getting fuselages and couplers overheating and exploding long before the engine began to overheat. Nothing showing in output_log error-wise. As well any and all AJE engines from 1.6.6 (Haven\u0027t tested 1.6.7 with 6.3.1 beta) generate far too much heat at any throttle setting causing near instant connected part failures due to overheating at any altitude. \u003Cp\u003EI can understand some of the aggressive heat transfer however without having that heat propagate to other parts there will always be a weak link at the connection point at the engine itself. As well having rocket engines overheat at 1000 celcius makes no sense (tested with multiple KW Rocketry engines primarily the 2.5 through 5 meter lifters; lower and upper stage). Other relevant mods are FAR, RealFuels, Stockalike config and 6.4x Kerbin w/ RSS class heatshields and NathanKell\u0027s MM patch specific to 6.4x Kerbin for the heatshields.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy only issues are: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Rocket motors transferring heat to other parts as quickly as they are (as my interpretation of the heat generation was always that the heat was at the bell not at the thrust plate) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Having AJE engines not being able to run at military thrust let alone afterburner at any altitude \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Not having heat propagate to other parts apart from the connection between the engine and whatever it first connects .\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the last issue can be resolved the first two will fix themselves as heat will transfer properly instead of soaking in one part and causing catastrophic failures on every launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe actual cap is 1250, not 660. Though depending on the part it could have been dropped lower than 1250 because of the config file issue that Persig mentions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as heat transfer between parts goes however, that hasn\u0027t been altered at all in the beta with heat shields being the sole exception. (heatConductivity reduced to ~8% of previous value)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll heat transfer between parts is handled by stock KSP so the only way your parts are exploding from the engines conducting heat into them is if they were already being heated up to levels that became lethal because said parts got capped at or below that level.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be helpful to know specifically what parts, what temperatures, altitude and speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit to include DeMichel\u0027s post\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DaMichel\u0022 data-cite=\u0022DaMichel\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHi everyone.

In stable the heat shields can kick up to 800-1200 degrees celcius while barely ablating in the upper atmosphere (50-60k). With the beta the heat is clamping to 300-350 degrees celcius and ablating much more material more quickly as well as shedding speed at higher altitudes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETesting with the Maverick V (KW\u0027s standard 2.5 meter lifter) with the beta cannot reach full throttle before overheating and exploding at around 1000 degrees celcius (using mechjeb to prevent overheats results in anywhere from 85%-75% throttle versus normal.

It might be Interstellar\u0027s Sabre Heating module causing undue heating as I just remembered all my tested designs did not include intake precoolers. What\u0027s odd though is that in a situation where I\u0027d expect a compressor overheat situation (CR2 Ramjet from TVPP @ 180 kN built on the most simple design I can think of that has no precooler attached to the shock cone intake. Thing runs at mach 4.5 at sea level without overheating in the stable build).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFar as altitudes and speeds are concerned. These are all at sea level. Leaving the launch pad with the Maverick V causes an overheat before 1kM of altitude and 150 m/s.

I especially like the part where engines run at ~250 degrees while bicoupler gets up to 1000.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESame goes for reentry: I see that shield already started ablating, and yet there is no \u0022DON\u0027T DEPLOY CHUTES IF YOU WANT TO LIVE\u0022 warning. Then in the lower atmosphere shield isn\u0027t ablating, everything seems to be cool, and yet it\u0027s unsafe to deploy chutes until I\u0027m slower than 300m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, there you go. It\u0027s the same nothing you\u0027ve got in my previous post, only with screenshot of exploded craft in it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s counterintuitive, I don\u0027t know what to report and what is intended behavior.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I know, it\u0027s a lot to ask, but for debug/tests it would be nice to have visual clues, like FAR AeroViz: part tinting when it closes to its temperature limit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat picture is actually quite helpful, but unfortunately a bit too late because I already know what the issue is. Heating there of that part is entirely from the engines behind it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDynamic pressure is totally irrelevant because that part is shielded from the airstream by the parts in front of it. That said, an SR71\u0027s maximum skin temperature is reached at Mach 3.2 at close to the altitudes you\u0027re seeing there. Think about that...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt any rate, you have two engines feeding heat into the bicoupler, which being a spaceplane part has heat shielding. One change I made is that heat shields now lower heat conductivity so that the parts they are attached to don\u0027t get roasted. So it couldn\u0027t get rid of the heat as fast as it was coming in. So the next version (sometime tonight) is going to see the default conductivity changed back to the stock value for Part.heatConductivity (which is 0.12). That \u003Cem\u003Eshould\u003C/em\u003E also take care of the AJE issue where AJE engines are roasting anything they\u0027re attached to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, chute failure is based on speed and air density. (really shockwave temperature and density, but shockwave temperature is based directly from velocity so... speed and density)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you don\u0027t see the warning then it\u0027s safe to deploy. That message is displayed by the same code that checks for and generates chute failure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Jarin\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Jarin\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EJust to clarify this, it\u0027s RSS that\u0027s the issue. DR should work with FAR just like stock. Check the bottom of the first post FAQ spoiler.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, more precisely, it\u0027s the higher velocities that are the issue. If you could somehow get up to those velocities in stock KSP then you\u0027d see that kind of heating easily. One of the goals of the next version is for that to be less of an issue on the grounds that the heat shield temperature should never go above (or even quite reach) the vaporization point of the ablator. (not even if the shockwave temperature is 3x higher).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"J.Random","CreatedById":63332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-26T01:17:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Starwaster\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Starwaster\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat said, an SR71\u0027s maximum skin temperature is reached at Mach 3.2 at close to the altitudes you\u0027re seeing there.
