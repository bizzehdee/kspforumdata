Not really practical for my basic first Duna-orbit-return mission in career mode.) \n\nSomething about these proportions had me feeling a little skeptical, so I decided to get my Google on and crunch some numbers.\n\nAccording to [an educational document from NASA (see pg. 5)](https://www.nasa.gov/pdf/146558main_RecyclingEDA%28final%29%204_10_06.pdf), an astronaut requires about 5.03 kg of supplies a day in the form of food, water, and oxygen (1.77kg, 2.42kg, and 0.84kg respectively). This is less than half the 10.8kg/day required by kerbonauts on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS default settings; if a kerbonaut consumed the same supplies in one Kerbin day as a huma-naut does in one earth-day, the above ship would look like this:\n\n![vfC2Vud.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/vfC2Vud.jpg)\n\nBut in fact, kerbals are smaller (and I think I can say hardier and sturdier) than humans, and kerbin-days are much shorter. Assuming that a kerbal consumes half the supplies a human does in the same amount of time, then the mass of supplies needed per Kerbin-day is further reduced, by a factor of eight in fact:\n\n![OEWcCz3.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/OEWcCz3.jpg)\n\n(It\u0027d be more practical to store these 2500 supplies in a single 2.5m can, but this is for visualization purposes.)\n\nThis may look like a small amount of supplies (if you\u0027re used to the massive quantities in the first pic), but in rocket design mass is usually more important than volume, and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS supplies are quite heavy. For example, with the containment area having an estimated radius of 1.25m and a measured height of 90cm (measured against the 26.6cm cubic family strut), the 2.5m Life Support Tank has a capacity of ~4.91m^3 and holds 4.5t of supplies, giving a density of 916 kg/m^3, not too far off from the density of water, and pretty darn close to the density of typical foodstuffs afik.\\* But if we assume that supplies also contain the kerbals\u0027 supply of oxygen, the density could be much lower. O2\u0027s density at NTP is 1.331 kg/m^3. Of course, it would be pressurized in storage; keeping temperature constant and raising the pressure to 200atm (2939.19psia),\\*\\* we get up to 266.2 kg/m^3. According to the above source, an astronaut\u0027s food/water/oxygen supply is 16.7% oxygen by mass, so 1t of supplies contains 167kg-\u003E0.627m3 of O2 and 833kg-\u003E0.833m^3 of food/water, for a total density of approximately 685 kg/m3.\\*\\*\\* (And lord I just spent WAY too much of my day working that out!) TLDR, if aesthetics are a concern and you just like looking at those huge cans, then decreasing the density of supplies by 30%-40% could help increase their volume footprint on a craft\u0027s design even if the mass/consumption rate is dropped to a more realistic level.\n\n\\*If my calculations are correct, then including the mass of the container, these food cans might not even float in water. Anyone care to test?\n\n\\*\\*3000psia seems to be a typical pressure for pure O2\n\n\\*\\*\\*Of course, there are more efficient ways of storing oxygen than with pressurized tanks, but that could be accounted for with recyclers and such.\n\nHere are some shots of the above ship at default settings, making use of recyclers:\n\n![6EqtnLP.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/6EqtnLP.jpg)\n\n^ This looks more reasonable from the outside, but has an ungodly ec requirement, especially early-game (and I do consider Duna a fairly early-game goal).\n\n![RIwmiyn.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/RIwmiyn.jpg)\n\nThese recyclers are a more economical choice, but the supplies still make up over half of the craft\u0027s mass, and the kerbals are still consuming supplies almost four times as quickly as a human would, considering that kerbin-days are only six hours long.\n\np.s.

For example, with the containment area having an estimated radius of 1.25m and a measured height of 90cm (measured against the 26.6cm cubic family strut), the 2.5m Life Support Tank has a capacity of ~4.91m^3 and holds 4.5t of supplies, giving a density of 916 kg/m^3, not too far off from the density of water, and pretty darn close to the density of typical foodstuffs afik.\\* But if we assume that supplies also contain the kerbals\u0027 supply of oxygen, the density could be much lower. O2\u0027s density at NTP is 1.331 kg/m^3. Of course, it would be pressurized in storage; keeping temperature constant and raising the pressure to 200atm (2939.19psia),\\*\\* we get up to 266.2 kg/m^3. According to the above source, an astronaut\u0027s food/water/oxygen supply is 16.7% oxygen by mass, so 1t of supplies contains 167kg-\u003E0.627m3 of O2 and 833kg-\u003E0.833m^3 of food/water, for a total density of approximately 685 kg/m3.\\*\\*\\* (And lord I just spent WAY too much of my day working that out!)

Smaller creatures tend to eat and consume more and have a faster metabolism than larger animals. I mean think about a Hobbit whom is, about as large as a human leg and they eat more than twice as much as a human, but weight less. So saying a Kerbal is smaller than a human should consume less than a human, can\u0027t totally be accurate, its all how a creature metabolizes their food. \n\nTo add on my comment above, I never saw Kerbals in my minds-eye as slow stocky people.

Last night as I dug around a little for more specific info, I happened across NASA\u0027s [Life Support: Baseline Values and Assumptions Document](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20150002905.pdf), which gives a set of starting-point estimates for pretty much every life-support-related thing you can think of, focusing on hypothetical Mars and Moon missions, for the benefit of their engineers and of random nerds on the internet (on account of it being publicly posted online). It\u0027s surprisingly easy to read considering the subject matter, and organized into neat sections and tables that make it easy to find and contextualize the information you\u0027re looking for - it\u0027s like the Dungeon Master\u0027s Guide to Space! Estimates for total water consumption/crew-member-day (CM-d) are given for short term flights (\u003C 30 days), a transit vehicle (to Mars), early planetary base, and mature planetary base, with a dramatic difference between the low and high ends. In that order and sparing the gory details,\\* the oxygen/water/food estimates total at 4.135 \u003E 4.605 \u003E 12.135 \u003E 29.515 kg/CM-d, with water being 65% of the mass at one extreme and 95% of it at the other. (Of course this is due mainly to such frivolities as brushing teeth, showers, and dishwashing.)\n\n[@therealcrow999](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/19331-therealcrow999/) made a good point that Kerbal biology/metabolism leaves a lot to the imagination, but personally I\u0027d still cut those numbers in half (~2.05 - 15/d), since I think that would roughly fit with the way Kerbals and their rockets are scaled-down in size from real life. In either case 10.8 supplies/day would fall somewhere between consumption at a brand-new base and a moderately mature one. I think the tight rations short missions can use are fairly well-approximated by the grace-period mechanic, no problems there; but unfortunately the difference between conservative and comfortable lifestyles on an interplanetary transfers versus a stable base is so huge, I\u0027m not sure a middle-ground value does either of them justice. Maybe it would be interesting if, beyond a certain vessel habitation rating, kerbals started scaling up their resource consumption? Using a Mars (read: Duna) mission as a reference point, it might start at four years; this would allow for there-and-back-again trips to the inner planets on a Spartan supply ration, but if the Kerbals feel any more comfortable in their vessel they might be tempted to settle into a more comfortable lifestyle and splurge on water. Supply use could continue to increase with habitation rating until maybe the ten-year mark; this would make Jool or Eeloo trips interesting to plan for, since the Kerbals would be using a lot more supplies and thus require a more sustainable life support system.
