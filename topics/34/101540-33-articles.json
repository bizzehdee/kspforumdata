I think the model transform of a part allows non-isotropic scaling.

Considering that the bug only occurs when the tanks start to empty means it\u0027s probably something with the mass going to 0.\n\nLooking at the offending tank in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E with engineer you can see [this is indeed the case](http://imgur.com/a/wuXPj)\n\nIn fact, testing it with several other tanks shows that many of the smaller tanks go negative mass when scaled down. Definitely something not working correctly here.\n\nEdit: Just tested with a completely barebones install. Only tweakscale as it comes out of the box, Realfuels as it comes out of the box (no engine configs) and Engineer to see masses. Negative mass problem persists when downscaling tanks.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-08-20T10:47:13Z\u0022 title=\u002208/20/2016 10:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 20, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Ralathon**"},{"CreatedByName":"Ralathon","CreatedById":71537,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-20T15:55:24Z","Content":"By the way, while we\u0027re on the subject of tweakscale bugs:\n\nI think you have some boundary condition error for the scaling.

So it appears the camera becomes inverted on all axes - ie, front is back, left is right,  so on.\n\nIm guessing that RPM has some configuration settings for camera position that get tweaked somehow or perhaps are not loaded properly with Tweakscale installed\n\nThanks for the great mod!
