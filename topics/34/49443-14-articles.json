Namely, things that float in stock KSP are now submarine missiles crashing for the bottom. Again, the submarine I designed, if you remove the the ballast part, will float quite easily. Even if the tanks I used were full of fuel, they float. This is actually realistic. Even with KSP\u0027s massively overbuilt fuel tanks they are still buoyant. The two main tanks I used building this sub were the Rockomax X200-16, and the FL-T800. The -16 has a diameter of 2.5 meters and a height of about 2.5 meters. It\u0027s total volume is therefore about 12.25 m^3. So even fully fueled with 8 tons of fuel and it\u0027s 1 ton empty weight the tank should float. Emptied liked I made it the thing should barely be kissing the water. The -T800 has a diameter of 1.25m and a total height of 5m (roughly). Total volume is about 6.1 m^3 so even with 4 tons of fuel and it\u0027s 0.5 ton empty weight it should float. By virtue of being tanks they are by design water tight. This, in generalities, meshes with how these tanks behave on the water in KSP, they float. Prior to this mod the only way to get something to sink was to attach it to a Jumbo 64 which for some reason was unnaturally non-buoyant. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, coming from a position of someone who\u0027s spent more than a few hours messing around with buoyancy in KSP my assumption, and yes I assumed because my normal method of dealing with mods is to just start playing with parts and see what happens, was that I would attach the buoyancy parts to an otherwise floating vessel and be able to increase the apparent mass of the vessel until it would sink and then tweak the part until it was applying the right amount of extra mass to keep the ship under. This is the inverse of what worked with the balloon mod. It followed logically from how things behave in KSP and the real world. Something is too heavy to float in the air so you artificially lower it\u0027s density via balloon until the total vehicle is low enough density to rise into the air. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now the way the submarine parts work would be like if putting a balloon part on your ship would cause it to rocket into the sky and you have to adjust the buoyancy to hold the ship down. It\u0027s highly counter intuitive. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow there are a lot of oddities with KSP\u0027s water which is attributable to it being a rocket game that for some reason has people wanting to build boats and submarines out of rocket and airplane parts. I don\u0027t know how the game is coded in the back end or what you have to do to make your parts work. Maybe this is the way it\u0027s gotta be to work, I don\u0027t know. Just saying, it\u0027s not working like you\u0027d expect it to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn another note, would the part I used in my sub, the cylindrical 2.5m ballast tank be editable to give it enough buoyancy to make my sub work as is? A suggestion, with the buoyancy tanks you might also want to consider reusing some stock parts to make buoyancy tanks that mesh well with the look of the game.
