Consider the following scenario:\n\u003E You successfully dock and exchange crew, and successfully recover Soyuz 4, completing the contract. Unfortunately, the second vessel experiences an anomaly during re-entry that results in loss of mission. But since you already completed Soyuz 4, you can no longer complete Soyuz 5!\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m going to give it a shot and it\u0027ll be on my github if i get it working.\n\nunfortunately, it is still happening it took me almost 2 hours to get soyuz 4 to work, and then soyuz 5 needed soyuz 4! if you put both in one contract, it would work a lot better! I ended up cheat completing. Also although it said i completed 4, i never got a verification with how much I earned from finishing it. ( which was ONLY 1k)........\n\nAlso The first contracts totaled many $$, I could usually make 20-50 thousand per contract. So far in the soyuz and Gemini, the TOTAL amount is 30-31.5 thousand for each contract! I can barely make a 2 person Gemini for less then 45k! Luckily I use stage recovery, so on average I only lose about 2k. All I can say, is that I am lucky that I have millions of $$ saved and Sentinel contracts which give outrageous amounts! Otherwise my program would be in the hole."},{"CreatedByName":"Rokanov","CreatedById":149722,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-19T02:09:38Z","Content":"Great job with these missions. It\u0027s huge!\n\nI\u0027m playing with Kerbal Construction Time, and my build times are quite high so I found the deadlines to be a bit on the short side. So instead of doing the sensible thing and using Contract Reward Modifier (I wasn\u0027t happy with how it worked out) I went and edited all the configs in the pack. Now all missions have a minimum deadline of 1 year (except shuttle missions, they\u0027re still 30 days) and as a consequence I completely rearranged the folder hierarchy, merging likewise missions into single config files. This should make it really easy to balance (e.g. using find and replace) if desired, though gaps in missions are obscured.\n\nIt\u0027s just intended for my own use, but I thought I\u0027d share the results ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nBefore I upload, wanted to check permissions.

As I said I would fix this but at the moment this is a low priority in comparison to Rokanov\u0027s new version! (No pressure Rokanov ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)) \n\nSo yes, development for me has stopped due to honestly some lack of interest and IRL things getting in the way, luckily Rokanov has made some massive and brilliant changes/additions to the pack and I will soon be releasing that version as the main release, I will continue development with the 2.0.0 version, however if there are issues with the new version I will patch things up for a 1.5.0 release."},{"CreatedByName":"Rokanov","CreatedById":149722,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-28T16:40:46Z","Content":"Yep, I\u0027m currently going through and tweaking all the contracts which will improve RSS compatibility among other things.
