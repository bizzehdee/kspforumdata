You just want your satellites to be well distributed around the globe. Real world GPS satellites are in circular orbits with an orbital period of 12 hours (half the Earth\u0027s mean solar day). They are located in 6 orbital planes, spaced 60\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA apart and inclined at 55\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA from the equator. The Kerbin equivalent orbital period would be 3 hours and 25 seconds (because Kerbin\u0027s solar day is 6 hours and 50 seconds long). A 1588 km high circular orbit has about the right orbital period.

I put my station at 180km and keosync sats at 2,864 km high - which is practicall half way to the mun. A semi sync constellation of greater than 1,000km would be easier than trying to put enough satilites down at just 100km as each one would lose contact in less than 5 minutes rather than 5 hours.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat kind of launchers/sattilite combinations are you running an on what kind of gravity turn?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3 probe fuel tanks and 2 orange radial rockets or probe engine would suffice is pushing it up to medium orbit from low.
