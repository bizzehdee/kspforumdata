The crew cabin ejects kerbals if you hit the EVA button and I\u0027m investigating that as well.

I\u0027m not a modder and know very little about programming, but could these wheels be the cause of the now-again-silent rovers?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMind you, everything works and looks perfectly, and probably nobody has noticed this, unless they happen to have installed the sound mod (which I gather is not quite as popular as others). My suggestion is: it would be great if the Buffalo was compatible with the wheel sounds. It would make an already awesome vehicle even better. Now everything is silent it became very evident to me that Squad just plainly ignored many opportunities to make the game more immersive via the sounds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks again \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the suggestion. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E The reason you don\u0027t hear the sounds is because WheelSounds doesn\u0027t know about the Buffalo wheels.

The stock-based RoveMax M1A1 wheels were always interim placeholders, but now the Buffalo has its real wheels. The new M1A1 Mountain Goat is inspired by the wheels found on NASA\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s MMSEV but they have been brought inline with the KSP art style. The current stock-based wheel will be going away. They are deprecated in this release (existing craft won\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t break but you won\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t find the wheels in the catalog) and it will be removed at a later date, so be sure to retrofit or retire your rovers that have the older wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENew Parts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Added the M1A1 Mountain Goat. The M1A1 can switch between a wide wheelbase for normal driving, and a narrow wheelbase to get in and out of cargo bays. And to top it off, it has sound effects if you have the Wheel Sounds mod installed.
