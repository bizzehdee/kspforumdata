I suppose I was thinking more of berthing an undocked capsule back into the cradle - which I suppose would be possible in real life unless the lockdown is damaged in decoupling.

After the fact, I have to engineer the best way of getting them up there and mating them to ports on my station, without making them too heavy. I thought I had enough dV to get one there from the ground on a Proton second stage alone - and I came damn close to a direct rendezvous before I ran out of fuel. But, on the bright side, I did get to evaluate whether the pod could land safely from that altitude, and it passed that test with flying colors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the advice and I\u0027m looking forward to more cool stuff like this. My second build that started out as stock-only has turned into 1.5GB of the Russian space program - and basically that\u0027s just between BobCat\u0027s Soviet Pack, Kosmos, and the obligatory B9 Aerospace for the spaceplanes.

Your post has motivated me to speak about the pack in general for a bit. I have been working to create concept sketches for a replacement to the \u0022Drotik\u0022 runabout package we released for the VA during the days of SSPPv2. Cardboard updated it at one point to match the rapidly improving quality of our parts, but I believe it has since disappeared because it arrived between generations of parts and doesn\u0027t match his current output. This is my current proposal:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Q2wP31w.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Q2wP31w.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe new design would be based partially on the Fregat engine used to propel Soviet lunar landers and such, but in this design is entirely monopropellant. It would contain a central crew tunnel (green in the concept), meaning that a docking ring could be attached to the underside as shown in the picture. Two rendezvous engines would be mounted at diagonals, nozzles facing toward the nose of the craft. This means the new Drotik would fly in the same fashion as the TKS- with the docking side prograde. Four surface panels (blue in concept) would be placed across the RCS tanks to allow for equipment to be mounted to the part, such as RCS blocks and solar panels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the moment, the Drotik is currently on low priority though, since other parts are closer toward completion. The state of development is such:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Improved Strut (release candidate ready)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. RD-275K (formerly proposed as RD-210, currently being reworked and is nearing completion)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Improved Fuel Line (not ready yet)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. N1 Block A (Flight testing and configuration complete, but model is far from completion)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Drotik (concept stage)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeyond these five projects are literally tons of other ideas we\u0027d love to implement but must wait while we ensure maximum polish on what we release. I would imagine that after our next update, which is slated to contain the first two items, and possibly the third, Cardboard will begin work on Block B and V of the N1, which might supplant Drotik development. We also have an interest in reviving LK station-landing capabilities, but our concepts are not currently feasible and are sitting on the backburner. Cardboard and I spent the last three hours debating what paint job to give to the N1, you can imagine how difficult it will be to reach a decision on the method of landing station parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"intidragon","CreatedById":67643,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-16T07:30:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ED\u0027oh~!
