If I use the All in one pack, and the newest Konstructs I lose camera controls in flight. I have installed a couple of the individual packs and those are working correctly. The first time I installed it I forgot to remove Konstructs from the all in one pack and it changed Konstructs back to the .24.2 build. removing Konstructs and reinstalling the correct version did not fix that, not sure why but I had to start over installing all my mods so I could get this working. So, im thinking if peeps are having the same kind of problems i was having... just install the packs not the all in one. Its a bummer too cuz I add one modification at a time and it will take all day to get everything I want back lol BTW AWESOME MOD, its nice to have something to fly over or drive around.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlphaAsh","CreatedById":105348,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-03T15:34:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the best way to do it:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 - Delete KerbinSide directory\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 - Delete medsouz directory\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3 - Install All in 1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4 - Install latest Kerbal Konstructs\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s no reason to do anything with any other mod.
