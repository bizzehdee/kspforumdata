If you timewarp without SAS your spacecraft will now keep spinning, instead of SQUAD\u0027s instant stop.\n\nThe GUI is to select what body you want to co-rotate with. So say you\u0027re in LKO and you select Kerbin in the GUI. This means that with SAS on, your spacecraft will keep pointing the same way relative to the surface of Kerbin. So if you point your nose towards the ground, half an orbit later it\u0027ll still point towards the ground."},{"CreatedByName":"curiousepic","CreatedById":60039,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T14:34:41Z","Content":"It would be really nice to know your rate of rotation on each axis (and maybe even acceleration).

I believe this to be true, because manually activating timewarp during a Mechjeb automated maneuver does not create the same drifting (all the time).\n\nMechjeb needs to be modded to not disable sas in timewarp, or Persistent Rotation needs to be modded to detect Mechjeb (or just menu option), and create a \u0022dead zone\u0022 where some small amount of drift in an axis will be considered perfectly zeroed during timewarp.\n\nThis might be a good idea anyway, regardless of the Mechjeb oddities.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-20T03:45:32Z\u0022 title=\u002205/20/2015 03:45  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by bgeery**"},{"CreatedByName":"nathan1","CreatedById":144486,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T05:55:37Z","Content":"I found a bug with v0.5.3: Persistent Rotation is preserving some amount of rotation when choosing \u0022revert to launch.\u0022 I\u0027ve removed all other mods and narrowed down that it\u0027s definitely this one.\n\nThe craft I did my testing with is as listed below: (not a good design, but that\u0027s a different issue)\n\nMk1 Command Pod\n\nFL-T200 Fuel Tank\n\nLV-N \u0022Nerv\u0022 Atomic Rocket Motor\n\nTR-18A Stack Decoupler\n\nFL-T800 Fuel Tank (x2)\n\nLV-T30 \u0022Reliant\u0022 Liquid Fuel Engine\n\nTo reproduce:\n\nEnable SAS and throttle to full on the launchpad, then stage. Let the craft go straight up without touching any controls. Since the engine has no gimballing the craft will tip over around 330m/s. When the craft hits about a 45 degree angle hit escape and revert to launch. The craft will \u0022jump\u0022 a little to the side.\n\nThe extent of the bug seems to depend indirectly on how many other mods I have installed. If I have removed everything but Persistent Rotation there is a small \u0022twitch\u0022 in the rocket and that\u0027s it (the rocket stabilizes), but when I have more mods there is a short loading delay immediately after reverting before physics kicks in and the rocket jumps more. With enough mods installed the rocket is completely knocked over on the launchpad after choosing \u0022revert to launch.\u0022\n\nWith all my other mods enabled and Persistent Rotation removed there is no \u0022twitch\u0022 or \u0022jump\u0022 when reverting to launch.\n\nReverting to the VAB and re-launching does not encounter the issue."},{"CreatedByName":"Epoxide","CreatedById":103564,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T13:56:55Z","Content":"What\u0027s the music in the teaser?
