First, the new SAS modes are being used. So you have the old \u0022I won\u0027t rotate while warping\u0022 with Stability Assist and a new \u0022ISS mode\u0022 which is being triggered by every other SAS mode. The vessel will then point in the same direction relatively to the Center of the Celestial Body it is orbiting. That\u0027s what Sashan was talking about. How those two modes are triggered is still subject to change, but both work. Also, I threw out a ton of calculation for when the SAS should stop rotation (relatively to the torque, and the available ressources for Reaction Wheels and RCS) and how it should drain those ressources because that seemed to make some trouble. (eg mass lowering while warping etc.) There is still one little problem, when returning to Space Center and going back to a rotating vessel, it automatically spins faster by ~60% as far as I realized. I will fix this soon.

Maybe it should just automatically point the vessel at the \u0022targeted rotation\u0022 (e.g. prograde) as long as the rotation of the vessel when entering timewarp differs only by some degrees. (Otherwise you could just select a SAS mode and turn TW on for a short moment and it would point in the wished direction).
