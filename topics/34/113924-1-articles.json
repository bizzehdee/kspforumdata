View full album](//imgur.com/a/cwu1N)\n\n**About the Tech Tree**\n\nThe goal for this tech tree is to group similar parts together and remove dependencies on unrelated parts. To that end the tree is much wider than the stock tree, but total cost are a little bit less.\n\nThis tech tree starts with uncrewed solid rockets without steering, landing, or recovery capability. The first 5 tech nodes provide choices on how to control and recover science from the rocket, and are cheap enough to unlock several just from a temperature reading on the launch pad.\n\n**Installation**\n\nCopy the contents of GameData into the Kerbal GameData folder.\n\nRequirements\n\nThis mod requires the [YongeTech Tech Trees Plugin](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/125338-YongeTech-Tech-Trees-Plugin).\n\nPrevious Versions\n\nIf replacing a version before 1.0 you will have to remove the old version manually.

Well not all of them, Joemore knows what he did. The tree is supposed to start with a new part, the CONE probe core, to avoid pointless deaths until the discovery of parachutes. The Mk1 Pod is should be in the Command Pods tech, which requires Recovery first.\n\nHere is the CONE core, it might be mistaken for the Mk1 Pod in thumbnails. The other possibility is there is something broken with the Tech Trees Plugin. In which case any additional information on what is appearing broken would be most helpful.\n\n[![l0rGElft.png](http://i.imgur.com/l0rGElft.png)](http://imgur.com/l0rGElf)\n\nWith the solar panels, I don\u0027t think there\u0027s a reason to worry about difficulty. The static solar panels are actually at about the same level as stock (141 total science vs 155 for stock), so the real change is the fuel cell is available significantly earlier. I will admit I don\u0027t use the fuel cell, so I don\u0027t really know if having them there fits with how people do use them.
