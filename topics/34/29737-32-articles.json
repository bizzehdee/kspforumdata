Make sure the heatshield is in front of, and shields, everything you would like to survive reentry. The heatshield doesn\u0027t just protect from heat, it also protects from the aerodynamic forces generated by DR and FAR. The heatshield doesn\u0027t have to be one of the included DR heatshields. Anything that is shaped properly(curved bottom of a cone) and can withstand the amount of heat you expect(700-900, I\u0027d say) should work. I recommend the older Planetes inflatable shields when side mounted objects need to be protected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Consider your periapsis as an indicator of your descent\u0027s severity.
