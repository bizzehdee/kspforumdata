But you\u0027re right, at the moment it\u0027d cost in the trillions to fuel an interstellar mission. Even a 1,000x increase in efficiency would still make antimatter 10,000x as expensive as equivalent fusion fuel, but fusion will never get you beyond 10% of lightspeed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing water as the fuel of our AM rocket would get expensive rather quickly. a single ounce of antimatter annihilating an once of matter has a destructive force of 1.22 megatons. You\u0027ll need a lot of water, like an iceberg a second.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadoworgon","CreatedById":5032,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-15T13:11:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022seanDNRC\u0022 data-cite=\u0022seanDNRC\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E but fusion will never get you beyond 10% of lightspeed. \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethats not necessarily true, if you had enough fuel to keep any engine accelerating in space you will eventually reach .99c, it just might take a few years.
