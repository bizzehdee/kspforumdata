In fact, with a \u0022perfect\u0022 launch window, you can actually put a long-range dish antenna into a co-orbit with Minmus (or fairly close to it - actually getting just the right \u0022spin\u0022 from the pair of gravity assists is almost entirely based on luck on your first burn leaving Kerbin orbit due to the floating point inaccuracies) for cheaper dV than is required for a geostationary sat. This is not as useful with this set of tweaks due to the power requirements of the longer range antennas and limited early power generation, but you might take a look into what sorts of interesting gravity assist profiles you can find for wider coverage of the Kerbin system for your initial Mun/Minmus missions. You\u0027ll likely only be able to get 1-2 sats out there at best, and probably won\u0027t get full coverage, but they should give you a shot at getting a \u0022far side\u0022 landing site to stay in comms.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MedievalNerd","CreatedById":84735,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-23T23:47:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHowdy everyone,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo with a few fixes and changes, with some light reorganization, I present you RPL Version 18:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EV18a - Change Log\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETech Tree:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Created a Realism MiniPack to minimize confusion/downloads.

I agree that I find myself with no real use for the stock SRBs just because liquid boosters are far more controllable and customizable (especially for burn times and thrust values) but the stretchy SRBs solve both of those problems. They still have poor ISPs (as expected from solid fuels), but they DO have good TWR ratios in comparison to the earlier available liquid rockets...very useful for your first atmospheric stage (either as designed to boost an existing stage, or even to be the entirety of the first stage itself). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@Aazard: Not sure about the tech levels required in the new version under RSS, but the dV number you have there seems a tad low. I seem to recall needing 20-21k dV for a Mun mission under RSS with FAR and DR (the latter especially makes it more difficult because you usually need an extra ~500 m/s in comparison to without DR to fly a safe return insertion - at least, to do it in a single pass without spending \u0022months\u0022 in space doing repeated aerobraking). Then again, I generally go for lower-than-average TWR on my rockets (especially manned ones) under the combination of FAR and DR for safety and control reasons.
