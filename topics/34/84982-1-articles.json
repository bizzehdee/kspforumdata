It gives you more flexibility and believability in how you want to do things. It offer possibilities to start with planes without researching rocket tech first, or rockets from the beginning, or probes at the beginning, or you can get even simple wheels as a starter technology, so you can start with Rovers without even lifting off. Just as you feel fitting to your playstyle and how you feel what should come first. It offers much more flexibility at the start and makes the start more believable for everyone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E But near the end it becomes much more expensive than the normal stock Tree, and so gives your Missions a more Science related purpose. If you\u0027re really patient you can still unlock all stock parts in Kerbins SOI (it requires exactly 14860 SP), but its near the maximum Value of Kerbins SOI, so it would become really tedious, encouraging for missions into deeper space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E And it also offers the stock-mod-nodes (aka Tier9), although some of them wont unlock anything new, they are shown and can be researched, giving you at least something to spend your Science Points on. Finishing the Tree including all the non-part-nodes requires over 40860 Points, which is close to the maximum of the over all available Science in hard mode. So if you unlock all of the Nodes you can proudly say, you have researched everything KSP has to see. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://cdn.mediacru.sh//zXaUwqbrXcFs.png\u0022 alt=\u0022zXaUwqbrXcFs.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Made using ATC-Mod: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis project includes the \u0022Alternative Tree Configurator\u0022 plugin to modify the tech tree.
