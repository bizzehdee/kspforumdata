I\u0027d been running Edge of Oblivion for awhile now, and didn\u0027t even realize it had auroras since I wasn\u0027t seeing them. Apparently, EVE is only loading a single cloud layer regardless of what\u0027s in the config that ships with the visual pack (and has been for awhile without me noticing). I have to manually add the other layers ingame, by hand. Very tedious, and I\u0027m not even certain whether I\u0027ll have to do it each time I load up KSP. Wonder if there\u0027s a setting somewhere I have to change...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m running EVE 7-4. Hopefully the author hasn\u0027t updated it without also incrementing the version number...
