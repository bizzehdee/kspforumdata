Overall I\u0027ve got plenty of juice.\u003Cp\u003EThe big booster is a standard component I\u0027ve used over and over and never had any problem with it, and I did an Apollo-style mission once with the interstage adapter and it worked flawlessly (Congratulations on an amazing piece of work, by the way).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe odd part is that I\u0027ve tried adding as many as 50 RTGs to the orange tanks, and it didn\u0027t seem to help. I\u0027m only using PF and Mechjeb, and the problem occurs whether I include MJ components or not. I\u0027ve googled this until my googler is sore and haven\u0027t found anything similar. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs anyone on the thread familiar with this kind of problem or have any ideas where to start troubleshooting?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance for any assistance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E**EDIT: I worked around the problem by adding a lot of batteries to the lower section, but either I\u0027m missing something fundamental about how electric charge propagates, or the interstage fairing is failing to conduct properly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHmmm, batteries for what?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Electricity for what*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022K3|Chris\u0022 data-cite=\u0022K3|Chris\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027ve found a bug, the interstage adapter tries to wrap around launch clamps, both stock and FASA ones.\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/eBgXK\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/eBgXK\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENoticed it because I wanted to add a launch tower for kerbals to the door of that ALCOR pod, and the interstage adapter went a bit bonkers in that fashion, would be nice if the interstage adapters could be adjusted to ignore the stock and FASA towers/clamps etc, I wonder if the normal fairings also do the same thing if you put clamps on the outside of them... hmm...\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPress L to the fairings in issue (all of them) then try again.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-18T16:18:11Z\u0022 title=\u002202/18/2014 04:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 18, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by blackheart612\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K3-Chris","CreatedById":61664,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-18T18:40:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah that\u0027s a working work-around, but it would be nice to have a \u0022proper\u0022 fix.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
