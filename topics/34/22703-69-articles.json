Place them just fore and aft of where the current nodes are. Touching even. That way I think any twisting might be damped out, especially if you\u0027re using Kerbal Joint Reinforcement. (And I do - and highly recommend it). \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#0000ff;\u0022\u003EOne of my pet hates has been attachment nodes, pretty much from day one.

But... I don\u0027t know. Does anyone else feel like it would be \u0022cheating\u0022 to do it that way? Plus there\u0027s always the fact that those landing pods work really well on other types of ships other than Eagles! Or using the main truss tank without the pods for a purely orbital ship not meant to land at all.
