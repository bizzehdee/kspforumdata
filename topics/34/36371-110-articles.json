Isn\u0027t it more likely that it\u0027s the DRAG from incidence of the air on the underside of the fairings that is pushing it further nose-up and increasing AoA more until something gives.

This is especially important for players like me who use RealFuels and Real Solar System (6.4x scale in my case), because I need extremely large rockets just to get small payloads to orbit with the higher Delta-V requirements and reduced fuel-density...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile I\u0027m at it, I would also very much like to relax the max diameter a bit once players unlock Experimental Rocketry (which is an extra node beyond the stock tech tree anyways- and certainly represents slightly futuristic technology). Currently the fairings and thrust plates are limited to 10 meters- the same base diameter as the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_V\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESaturn V\u003C/a\u003E in real life. However, Saturn V was 1960\u0027s technology, and substantially larger rockets were proposed that could have been built even back then (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_Dragon_%28rocket%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESea Dragon\u003C/a\u003E, for instance- a design which was validated by NASA engineers and could have been built if there had been any mission requiring such a large payload- was 23 meters in diameter at the base...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn Sandbox fairings and thrust plates go up to 50 meters in diameter, and I would like to see them go up to 25 or 30 meters in diameter in Career Mode (so I can build Sea Dragon sized rockets in Career Mode- which will still be insanely expensive) instead of being limited to 10 meters max... If the tech-limits earlier in the tree were loosened like I suggest (so players can at least build interstage fairings wide enough for their largest Novapunch2 or KW Rocketry launch-stages), than having a higher limit at the end of the tree would help maintain a sense of continuous progress. It would also help prevent Procedural Fairings from being as much of a limiting-factor on the maximum size of procedural rockets once players have unlocked the whole tech tree- Procedural Parts already removes all size restrictions once players unlock Meta-Materials...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003Ee-dog, if you\u0027d like, I could write up a new tech-limits file for Procedural Fairings just like I did for Procedural Parts. Would that be helpful?\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, one last issue- the fairing bases (particularly for the Interstage Fairings) don\u0027t currently scale in a manner that would be very mass-efficient for rocket design. Rather than scaling mostly in two dimensions, with at most a small increase in height with increasing width, they seem to scale at or close to a simple linear scale-up of the base in all directions. The result is that when you use very wide fairing bases (say the 50 meter bases that are possible in Sandbox) you even up with very, very tall fairing bases as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is unrealistic (the thing that really matters in determining is the ratio of base height to total fairing height- a 2 meter tall fairing shouldn\u0027t magically require twice as tall a base just because you increased the diameter from 3 meters to 6 meters...) and drives up the physical size of the bases (and if I\u0027m not mistaken the mass and cost as well) with the cube of the diameter instead of at or close to the square of the diameter as would be realistic... Also, taller bases means you require a taller fairing just to clear the base at all, which adds additional mass and cost to the rocket beyond the increased mass/cost of the fairing relative to the diameter. I would like to eventually see this issue fixed if it\u0027s possible so that fairing bases remain of an approximately constant height (perhaps with a *slight* increase in height with increasing diameter) and scale in two dimensions instead of three... The sooner this could be implemented, the better- but I understand if due to the complexity of coding/modeling something like this you didn\u0027t want to tackle it for quite a while... I wanted to make sure you were aware of the issue- and encourage you to fix it sooner rather than later...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EP.S.\u003C/strong\u003E Feel free to let me know here, or by Private Message, if you would like to have me draw up a new set of tech-limits.
