Notice the stage # in the lower left next time. When the LFE fires, it\u0027ll say 4 (for example); when the separatrons fire immediately afterward it\u0027ll say 3 (again for example).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt happens *only* when:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMJ finds a stage above the current stage, the activation of which will not decrease the current stage\u0027s dV.
