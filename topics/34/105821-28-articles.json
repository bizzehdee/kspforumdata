It uses the camera transform to create its own scene, so there is no panorama view.  I would have to shrink the picture to make it panoramic, which makes it harder to see the image.\n\n-RPM can play sounds for buttons and switches, and it can play ambient noise in IVA (such as machinery and life support sounds).  I do not think a music player fits the idea of RPM.\n\n-Some IVA have a heads-up display that displays horizon information while looking out a window.
