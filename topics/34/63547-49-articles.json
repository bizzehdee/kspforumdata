However that alone will not make jet engine (or any air-breathing engine) performance more realistic. They need to fix two things 1) IntakeAir as a resource counts as fuel 2) Isp instead of thrust does not change with altitude.

I use Realism Overhaul (along with RP-0) and the mods that surround it. All the parts work fine, but for some reason, the engine models textures are are all bugged for me. I believe the main cause is ATM caching the parts even though I changed the AJE ATM config to false, so they shouldn\u0027t be getting cached. The weirdest thing is that the parts aren\u0027t showing up as all white (which is what usually happens when there is an issue loading the models).
