I launched the Gemini aboard a Titan IIIc. MechJeb controlled the ascent to an orbit of 80km, then performed the TMI burn, mid-course correction to adjust the closest pass at 150km, then circularised the orbit at 105km. I manually input the landing coordinates, being careful to put the lander down just off to the side of the one already on the surface in order to avoid the messy \u0022Hey! You got your Gemini in my Altair!\u0022 scenario. Mechjeb controlled the burns and descent profile, all the way to the surface.
