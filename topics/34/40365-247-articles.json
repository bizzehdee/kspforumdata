As a result during a trip to Duna all nuclear fuel was used up and in turn the generator stopped producing. Being so far away the game was at high time warp for well over 100 days. After returning time to normal the nasty problem first appeared, in that case constantly demanding 66MW of power dispute the actual demand being only a few kW.

KSP saves resource totals inside the craft files rather than looking up fresh totals and although there are mechanics in place to auto-upgrade reactors, it\u0027s difficult to distinguish between one on a saved craft and one that has just been placed in the VAB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince both the amount of fuel on the reactors and the consumption rate has been increased by 1000x, you will run out of fuel very quickly if you have a reactor with an old resource total.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"komodo","CreatedById":102065,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-04T16:37:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DavidHunter\u0022 data-cite=\u0022DavidHunter\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately the texture reduction mods don\u0027t work on Mac. :/\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is simply incorrect.
