One, because I never trust things to work properly (nor do I trust myself to set the parts correctly pre-launch). Two, because I want the deploy and retract altitudes to be different (ie, I want the logic to be fuzzy).\u003Cp\u003ENeither of these are really adequate to justify my original request, but I figured I\u0027d ask anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHey technogeeky. Dtobi and I had a discussion about this when I first created the new altimeter logic. I considered adding an option to do ascent only, and really, the only reason I didn\u0027t is because it\u0027s going to be a bugbear to get the GUI to work properly with the three way toggle. That, combined with the lack of good use case scenarios is the reason that feature was originally dropped.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll see if I can\u0027t upgrade the altimeter to support it though, since it\u0027s now been requested. I\u0027m just going to need to figure out an elegant way of doing it, since I don\u0027t necessarily like the idea of a 3 way toggle, which isn\u0027t at all intuitive to the end user... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHmm. Actually, I just had an idea on that. I\u0027ll need to do some tests but I think I can make it so we can have our cake and eat it too. I\u0027ll just split out the \u0022Both\u0022 mode into a separate \u0022bidirectional/unidirectional\u0022 toggle button that hides the direction buttons when it\u0027s in bidirectional mode.
