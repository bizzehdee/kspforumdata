KSPI engines have variable thrust AND ISP in atmo, unlike stock engines that only change ISP. I believe that is why MJ and KE have issues predicting TWR and DV in the VAB and at launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlasma thruster has issues still because of the complexity of the engine. It too scales in thrust and ISP in addition to using a mod custom resource (megajoules). KSPI has its own resource manager for its resources, and I\u0027m not sure if MJ and KE are able to hook into that very well. I do know that whenever the engine is running, MJ and KE should be accurate for whatever throttle % you are currently running at. I think. I haven\u0027t looked at plasma thruster\u0027s much since 0.8 came out. Also keep in mind that with the last research node, the plasma thruster is upgraded to be able to use quantum vacuum as fuel and thus eliminates the need for fuel. So as long as provide it with power (MW), you have infinite DV (assuming you can continue powering the drive).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"forsaken1111","CreatedById":2703,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-07T20:17:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Donziboy2\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Donziboy2\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOk fellas.\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/u15wn4gxy9aolge/KSPI%20For%20DummiesV02.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKSPI for Dummies V0.2\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts far from perfect, but thats why im posting it.

Apparently it affects parts where the attachment points aren\u0027t vertical. It helps if you place the refinery on top of something first, then attach other parts to it. I recommend using the Select Root mod to let you build things like this; first build the leg with the refinery on it, change the root to the connector you\u0027ve attached to the refinery, then pick up the leg by the connector and attach it with radial symmetry.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"inferno4200","CreatedById":83218,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-07T23:26:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo I\u0027m having a little bit of a problem.
