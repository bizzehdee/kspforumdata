I don\u0027t think they can be scaled with a config, so they need their own code. IR is already notified on rescale, we can limit the node sizes there. This extra manipulation will not break TweakScale because it reads the original sizes from the prefab part. \n\u003E So is there a consensus that nodes on IR parts should globally be limited to size 2? (i.e. the standard node size on 2.5m parts)\n\nJust out of curiosity - what is it that makes IR parts not function if node sizes are changed? Could that phenomenon be fixed to address the cause rather than the symptom, so to speak?\n\nOn the other hand, if the node size isn\u0027t terribly important for joint strength, then that wouldn\u0027t really matter and might not be worth it. Does node size make a particularly important difference, or is it just a visual thing?"},{"CreatedByName":"endl","CreatedById":119320,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T23:42:17Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I have one last idea. Look at your nav ball. you are controlling from a command pod pointing straight down. and by pressing (w) you are driving the wheels as well as any reaction wheels you may have added or what is already equipped in your command pod. This could be adding torque to the legs bending them and altering your intended path.\n\u003E Edit: I just looked at a larger version of your picture, I should have led with that. Each arm is attached to a separate structural panel. this could be a lot of your issue. Try attaching all the arms to one common part using symmetry and then see what happens.\n\nnone of those issues are the problem.\n\nive tested it with control module oriented correctly on the navball.\n\nive tested it with disabled torque on all applicable parts\n\nthe wheels are 100% parallel to the ground\n\nnone of these are the source of the drift\n\nfurther more the rover is very light weight so i doubt its leg flex causing the wheels to reorient, all the wheels are attached to same base part, therefore i dont think its nessary to strut the wheels to the fuel ring"},{"CreatedByName":"ZodiusInfuser","CreatedById":76163,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T00:09:07Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E none of those issues are the problem.\n\u003E ive tested it with control module oriented correctly on the navball.\n\u003E \n\u003E ive tested it with disabled torque on all applicable parts\n\u003E \n\u003E the wheels are 100% parallel to the ground\n\u003E \n\u003E none of these are the source of the drift\n\u003E \n\u003E further more the rover is very light weight so i doubt its leg flex causing the wheels to reorient, all the wheels are attached to same base part, therefore i dont think its nessary to strut the wheels to the fuel ring\n\nSorry, I don\u0027t have any more suggestions, but as I say, I don\u0027t experience it on my latest test crafts.
