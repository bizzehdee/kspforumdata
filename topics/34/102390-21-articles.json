Go to the flight scene, right-click on the controlling pod, select the \u0022Rename vessel\u0022 option.  In there you will see section called \u0022Vessel Type\u0022, and under there a number of different icons.  Select the one for Station and hit OK.\n\nRegarding the power generator, are you using stock solar panels?\n\nFinally, there is an update to this mod, I suggest you get it since it fixes a lot of bugs.  The update just came out.\n\nLGG\n\nhey Severdsolo,\n\nAny ETA on when the base construction will be merged with this?  No pressure just curious, I know you are working on merging it, I\u0027m slowly updating my new install with the mods that I want, and I keep seeing that mod in my list of missing mods.\n\nThanks"},{"CreatedByName":"severedsolo","CreatedById":80345,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-07T13:56:47Z","Content":"[@Conventia](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/143229-conventia/) I think you are nearly there, just right click your command part, click Rename vessel and select station.

I don\u0027t know if I should be asking Severedsolo the next question.\n\nDoing a version check for two reasons...\n\nI have 1.7.8 on CKAN. Just checking if it will throw out a higher version number. It should not because it should be set to version strict as per your pull request. Have seen the max KSP ver shows 1.0.5 (With version 1.9.0). So had to double check that 1.7.8 was the latest compatible build for KSP 1.0.4. Seems everything has worked out. It will only update to 1.9.0 if it detects KSP 1.0.5\n\nSorry that sounds clear a mud ![:blush:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif \u0022:blush:\u0022). Short answer is it working fine. It is loading the right version thanks to your pull request.\n\nThe second reason is I have a warning from AVC on initial menu about using Severedsolo\u0027s contract pack Useful space stations. It says that I need contract configurer 1.8.0. The really interesting thing about this warning is I actually have the other similar contract pack called Kerbin Space Station. Which is version 3.0.2.

However, he didn\u0027t mark his version file as requiring KSP 1.0.5.  So you can either hack the .cfg file to bump the CC version down, or downgrade KSS.  I don\u0027t know what the actual required version of Contract Configurator is for the different versions of KSS, I added a number of features in 1.9.0, and I\u0027m not sure if severedsolo has taken advantage of any of those yet.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Oh and KSS and USS are now the same thing (they used to be different).\n\u003E \n\nSo any advice on this Serveredsolo?"},{"CreatedByName":"severedsolo","CreatedById":80345,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-09T18:17:45Z","Content":"Mobile forum, excuse the formatting \n\nI messed up the 3.0.2 release.
