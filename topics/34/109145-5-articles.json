If you need a picture to understand what I mean I would be happy to make one for you.\n\nreasons for this are on a long space plane if you want to balance your RCS you have to place all your RCS ports on the upper or lower surface as the wings will be attached to the sides. however it would be more efficient on the thrust to have the rcs ports facing vertically, so a side placed RCS port is needed. as of now I just place them on the upper and lower surface on the angle just as you show in your pictures, but I have always wanted them in a small cutout between the body and the wing.\n\nJust looking at your parts closer and a Combo RCS/Reaction wheel part is the ideal place for this side notch. just make it slightly narrower to accommodate an RCS port between it and the wing.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-29T00:22:22Z\u0022 title=\u002205/29/2015 12:22  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Bit Fiddler**"},{"CreatedByName":"biohazard15","CreatedById":91655,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T12:46:26Z","Content":"Some ideas for the next update...\n\n1) 1-seat Mk2 cockpit, Blackbird-style, with integrated nosecone.
