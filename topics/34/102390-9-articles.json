Let me explain briefly how it works:\n\nEach maintenance mission has a \u0022random\u0022 cooldown (anywhere between 30 kerbin days, and 120 days) built into it. The thing is, each time a maintenance mission completes, that cooldown is reset for ALL of them. The contracts are weighted so that certain contracts are more likely to appear than others. If you are seeing mainly Crew Rotations, that\u0027s exactly how it should be. Now that\u0027s not to say the weighting doesn\u0027t need fiddling with, it may well need a rebalance. You\u0027ll have to wait until I get that far in my career though (nearly there) so I can do a proper balancing pass.\n\nThe weighting works as follows - as mentioned, any time one of these missions are completed the cooldown resets. All times are in Kerbin days.\n\nMost Likely: Resupply and Crew Rotation - cooldown 30-120d - weighting 0.8 - if you\u0027ve done a crew rotation and have never seen resupply, then you won\u0027t. It only shows up if you have a supported life support mod installed.\n\nNext Most likely: Repair/Replace a faulty power module \u0026 Do science. (this last one was originally in the \u0022most likely\u0022 - may go back there one day.) cooldown 60-120d weighting 0.4\n\nVery rare: Evacuate the station - cooldown 100-120d weighting 0.2\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Might i suggest the initial \u0022core\u0022 be split up into a few seperate missions?\n\nYou people are never happy! Originally it was like this, but some people wanted to be able to launch basically working stations in one go, so I made it how it is so you can still do it modularly if you like (as I do).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E If you added a simple part, \u0022civilian science box\u0022 you could have another mission that simply asked you to ferry this experiement to the station, wait X hours and bring it back safely.\n\nStation Science already has this one covered, not to mention the \u0022do science on the station\u0022 mission.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Fuel tank - Add an orange tank to your station for refueling purposes. Optional: empty tank\n\u003E \n\u003E Refuel station - Add 1000 LF\u002BO to your station\n\nYour the second person in as many posts who has asked for this, so let me explain why I\u0027m inclined not to do it.\n\nThe problem I have, is that not all stations are refuelling outposts. Now, I can use CC to get the amount of a said resource on a vessel (such as LF). So maybe I could tell it to only generate contracts if it finds LF on a vessel (even if it\u0027s just a little), so it knows it\u0027s a refuelling station. but what happens if you run it dry? A false negative (ie contract won\u0027t generate). What happens if you dock a shuttle, which has LF on it? false positive (contract will generate but shouldn\u0027t.).\n\nWhat I really need is a way of detecting resource *capacity*. So I could say \u0022generate a contract if x vessel has more than x capacity AND less than y resource on board\u0022 I might ask nightingale for it at some point, but I hassle him enough, and it\u0027s really not a high priority for me.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I really wan\u0027t to build awesome space stations, but the current career mode isn\u0027t very fixated around it. Building stations nets very little science and apart from the initial mission rarely makes you any money what so ever. I hope this contract pack can help bring that aspect into KSP\n\nIf you want science download Station Science. (seriously, go download it, it\u0027s a great mod). \n\nThe point of this pack is not to make stations profitable, it\u0027s to make them useful! (lets face it, by the time you are in a position to build station, you usually are ok for cash) I hate putting stations into orbit and then forgetting about them, I wanted something to keep me vested in my station.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-14T17:50:08Z\u0022 title=\u002205/14/2015 05:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by severedsolo**"},{"CreatedByName":"nightingale","CreatedById":119307,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T17:38:02Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E What I really need is a way of detecting resouce *capacity*.
