Maybe add these to the readme and first post?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut if people out there are still having trouble, I wouldn\u0027t sweat it too much, you can take your time, keep trying and get creative with FAR. You might be surprised what you can launch even with lots of forces acting against you, especially wobble-physics with massive loads. I launched a pretty big DEMV rover packed with all kinds of surface attached gear with no fairing (and plenty of people have, because there weren\u0027t as many options at the time) on a maybe needlessly big rocket , and was able to get it into out of the atmosphere by being very gentle. I try to generally keep the G-force meter below two G\u0027s and for extra questionable loads, do several test launches first to see where the stress will cause problems. For that rover payload I had to keep it near 1.3-1.5 G\u0027s for a lot of the pre-orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn FAR I learned to be careful of near mach 1 (and trans/supersonic speeds). The idea is that there are tremendously powerful shockwaves/vibrations going around and through your vehicle through those speeds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAvionics packages can be gentler than ASAS if you need help with unstable launches. They don\u0027t guarantee stability but If you notice what ASAS does with the controls, it is rarely gentle, so that\u0027s why you might notice quick direction change followed immediately by tearing apart or loss of control. There are lots avionics part types to choose from between stock, B9 and Firespitter. Depending on the vehicle sometimes it\u0027s best to use none of them or FAR flight assistance, and I think those options are fun if confusing at first. It\u0027s a good game balance in my opinion, until there\u0027s a better balance anyway..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomething new I have been tinkering with are the CMG gyros by a modder (esentially they give you the same forces of a command pod and use a little energy to operate), and somewhere I think there was a mod for finer RCS control.. Gyros can help sometimes with gravity turns, though sometimes just the engine gimbal is plenty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit : Oh but to answer weatherman : \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t really tell as much as I would like from the picture, but especially with large fuel tanks, as they empty the shifting center of mass can cause the (center of) thrust (as it changes also due to jettisoned engines) to react weirdly to the changed CoM. I guess you have different length and capacity of tanks and if they all burn at once, some will run out sooner than others, leaving some heavy fuel in some tanks and some still heavy but lighter empty fuel tanks and engines (until they are jettisoned - but that may not necessarily be better, because the center of mass shifts again, to where who knows!). The picture makes it look like there are only tanks on about half of the side of the whole rocket, kudos to you if you can launch it but i would think it would be very unstable even though the gimballing engines can help, they are also very heavy , and heavier stuff is also less effected by the torque in the command pod that you\u0027d use to help manuever compared to lighter stuff. The thrust and gimbal from mainsails is very strong though so you\u0027d have to turn them off to see only what the command pod is able to do, which at ground level can be hard to determine since you lose so much fuel so fast with mainsails.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-10T00:25:51Z\u0022 title=\u002206/10/2013 12:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 10, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by localSol\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Queue","CreatedById":62262,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-10T01:09:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ehey guys i love the mod but i have a few questions.
