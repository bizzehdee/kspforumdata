One, they\u0027re clunky and boxy and just really don\u0027t go with anything else in the game visually. Two, they don\u0027t extend far enough away from the hull to be very useful, especially the side mounted ones.

Ahem, anyway, three, most landing legs are very flimsy, causing the ship to wobble and tip over if landing on any kind of slope, even if they\u0027re mounted in a wide stance, they just bend on their attachment point until they break off or the ship falls over. There are two excellent designs in the NovaPunch pack, both in the \u0027Science\u0027 category for some strange reason: the Thor (or is it Odin? One of the Norse gods anyway) legs.

By that I mean that I can already tell that when I DL the new folding Warp Drive ring I\u0027ll probably sit and watch it fold and unfold for 10 minutes straight the first time I launch a ship with the part, lol. Anyway, hopefully we\u0027d get some bottom mount, side mount, maybe even inline stack versions like Devo\u0027s Wayland \u0027Mechpod\u0027 arachnid legs, except, well, you know... better looking.

I know you don\u0027t tend to like it when people request specific parts from you, I just see what appears to be a gaping hole in the choices available for one particular kind of part, and I think that you could probably come up with 5 or 6 really great designs if you really wanted to, so just think about it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is all, as you were, carry on. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENeutrinovore out. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the correct solution is to not land on slopes that are steep enough for you to topple over or damage your landing legs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s how it would be handled in real life.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Neutrinovore","CreatedById":72520,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-09T23:06:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Starwaster\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Starwaster\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI think the correct solution is to not land on slopes that are steep enough for you to topple over or damage your landing legs.\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s how it would be handled in real life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, how stupid of me. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, ZZZ, disregard all of my previous request, I just won\u0027t land on slopes anymore. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t believe I never thought of that, derp!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PlasmaDynamics","CreatedById":76935,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-10T20:05:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELanding Gear would be nice.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"automcdonough","CreatedById":12249,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-10T20:37:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like the idea. some badass looking lander legs would be neat.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StEligius","CreatedById":81789,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-11T04:34:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnyone have a CFG to turn the radiators into solar panels?
