Or was it lower? I always forget... anyway, point is that if it\u0027s got a lot of mass then its inertia might be overcoming its drag. I have landed space planes using nothing more than the standard 25% reflection that their heat shields had; no ablative. Landed the smaller KSO the same way. Then the KSO25 came out and suddenly I was extremely challenged to come up with a non-ablative config that could protect it. Which, bottom line, is the heart of the problem.

My re-entires use the large control surface to keep the craft at about 30-40 AoA until some serious aero forces kick in - the procedural wings and control surfaces are tweaked in FAR to have a mass/strength of under 0.5 for all surfaces so they can\u0027t take huge amounts of abuse.
