To be honest tho, I like it. Using the flight computer to position the craft to take photos with an onboard camera is simply a pain in the rear, especially since the position/orientation of the camera differs from craft to craft so writing a tool to help you point would be difficult. Plus, depending on how the control unit on some craft are oriented the commands you send won\u0027t be what you think. For example I can tell it to hold 90, 90, 90 and it will send a command to hold 0, 270, 180.

I\u0027m saying I would also gladly use the mod w/signal delay to point my craft, it\u0027s just the mod is not able to give you an effective means to do so. That\u0027s why unlocking the WASDQE controls from signal delay is such a nice thing. Every other aspect of the mod when using signal delay is well done. But when it comes to pointing craft the \u0022realism\u0022 of the mod makes things more difficult than they should ever be for general-purpose use on any space craft. It\u0027s one of those gameplay vs. realism balance things. Sure, people can say \u0022well then if you can WASDQE at will why even bother having the flight computer and signal delay?\u0022 to which I respond that using the Flight Computer is now a choice rather than a requirement.
