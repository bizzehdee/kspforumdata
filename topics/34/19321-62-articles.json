But, probably, i have not stated my goal properly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, control surfaces are angled downward and center of lift is in front of center of mass, because they are set as flaps and are in the 3rd position (fully lowered)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETail-wings will definitely solve the problem, I\u0027ve already tested it. But the goal of this model is to understand how FAR\u0027s aerodynamic works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know, that:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - we have no lift at all with zero angle of attack, only increasing drag. It is realistic and rather expected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - for the plane to be stable, the center of lift should be behind center of mass (but that does not mean it will fly)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - to increase lift should use flaps. Lift is proportional to flaps deflection, but deflection should not exceed stall angle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, i can\u0027t understand why when the center of lift is ahead of center of mass, the tail is in the air first. As i understand, in that case we should have a clockwise torque (and this is really what i need to increase angle of attack and take off, gain speed and fully retract the flaps). With the center of mass in front of center of lift we should have counter clockwise torque.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow i have only 1 explanation - when using flaps lift force is applied to control surfaces themselves (not to the point where blue vector is drawn) so that actual center of lift is slightly (or even more) shifted back. As a result the actual center of lift appears to be behind center of mass and causes tail in the air first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr am i missing the meaning of center of lift arrow?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact there is another question. As I\u0027ve noticed lowered flaps push center of lift forward to the nose of the plane. In many cases it was true, but on some designs it was more complicated. Position 1 pushed center of lift forward to the nose, however remaining 2 pushed center of lift back to the tail (sometimes even further than with flaps fully retracted). In all cases the main wings surfaces were not angled.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ferram4","CreatedById":21328,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-30T22:44:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E@ozligia: \u003C/strong\u003EThe difference is the simple difference between the slope and y-intercept of a line.

You can read it off of where the yellow line crosses the vertical axis, which for your design is negative; this means that your plane is going to try to pitch downwards if it is at zero angle of attack. Ideally, C\u003Csub\u003Em0\u003C/sub\u003E is positive, which causes the plane to naturally hold a small positive angle of attack without any control inputs; if C\u003Csub\u003Em0\u003C/sub\u003E is 0, then the plane is essentially just a lawn dart until a pitch-up input is added to keep in on course. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe long story short is that your plane wants to start pitching downwards due to the camber on the only lifting surface; the plane\u0027s pitch instability causes it to be even less stable.

Something of an advanced topic though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA good rule of thumb would be that you need a certain length of lifting surface to be longditudinally stable as well; whether that\u0027s one long delta wing or a wing and a tail or canard, or tandem wings or whatever other crazy combination you want to try. Pure mechanics would also say that control surfaces further away from the centres are more effective. If you think of the lift centres of lifting surfaces as ... trestles, or wedges, or something equally thin you rest things on, you can see that resting your plane on two points is considerably more stable than one single one.

My suggestion would be to put a liquid-fuel-only fuel tank in between the cockpit and the rest of the ship and use the extra length to put the canards further forward. Adding small control surfaces to the back of your wings (right by the jet engines) and setting those to add pitch authority should help a bit; angling them to produce a slight pitch-up tendency at no pitch input is also probably a good idea. There\u0027s also the possibility that the canards are interfering with each other / the wings and producing less lift than you expect in their current position, so you may not need two sets of canards if you make the plane longer.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-02T21:51:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor now you can use DRE\u0027s g-force damage.
