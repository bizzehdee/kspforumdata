I can\u0027t be more specific than that since I am finding it hard to stay motivated enough. The work I have planned for the 1.1 update is not hard but it is tedious and there\u0027s a lot of it to do. I will be adding about a dozen or so new payload fairing bits so that your payload options are expanded. I\u0027ve also done some re-texturing of the existing parts to make the whole rocket more consistent looking. You probably wont notice the difference but I do. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as bugs are concerned I resolved the clipping issues for small radially attached parts (such as a radial decoupler). I have not been able to determine why I can not radially attach my fuel tanks though so I fear I will have to design a special radial decoupler to make it all work. I\u0027ll keep playing around with it. Lastly I have not had time to look into enabling symmetry for the fairings yet but it is on the to do list.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, thank you all for your time and I look forward to continue serving your space launch needs!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Absolution\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"macintux","CreatedById":12804,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-17T00:21:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like this rocket , it looks like a soviet SS-18 ICBM.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Absolution","CreatedById":4156,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-31T02:51:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUpdate on the next update:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am now anticipating a release in a \u0022couple of days\u0022. I\u0027ve been working hard on all these minor parts and I am almost complete. Just some texturing and testing and I should be good to go. As stated previously this will be a simple expansion of your payload options. You will be able to safely encapsulate a much wider variety of oddly shaped and over-sized parts. Future updates will include re-balancing parts (as necessary) and the addition of new parts. As KSP expands I will develop heavier rockets that can take enough delta-V into orbit so you can get out to new and exciting destinations.

How are you controlling the rocket (keyboard? gamepad?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is a known issue that the rocket becomes twitchy right as the first stage burns out but I haven\u0027t noticed any other unstable behavior. In fact my experience is that the rocket is almost too stable. If you watch my intro video on the first post you can see the control input I am giving it to nudge it along the right path. It does require a slight touch and if you try and force it you are not likely to correct it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt doesn\u0027t surprise me that pre-existing SAS modules don\u0027t help.

Perhaps I\u0027m just used to easier parts but still I believe I\u0027m competent enough to solve most problems on my own. The issue is that even if I stabilize the first stage, after decoupling the second and desperately getting it going the way I need it, it still has a tendency to just start flipping around and changing direction without literally constant manual intervention. Even with my full attention it is a chore to maintain it, enough so that I just want to cheat, but I like your system too much to do that. I\u0027ve tried empty payloads and launching with various Dynasat configs and the Noyuz Ship so far. I almost got the latter into a perfect orbit but I lost control at the last moment to the point where my patience and fuel levels were just not there. I\u0027m not trying to be a whining asshole as I really like the simplicity and functionality of your parts. It\u0027s probably as much pilot error as it is subpar performance of the rocket.
