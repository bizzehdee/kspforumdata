I\u0027m working on a low-Kerbol microwave power network using the Balka solar wings from the KOSMOS pack, but it appears that they aren\u0027t affected by the KSPI inverse square law? In a ~1500 Mm Kerbol orbit, the stock Gigantors produce about 50 times what they do at Kerbin (i.e., ~1000 rather than ~20 charge/sec), whereas the Balkas produce only 10 times what they do at Kerbin (~4000 rather than ~400 charge/sec). So it seems that the stock panels are obeying KSPI\u0027s inverse square law, but the Balkas are obeying the stock distance mechanic.

Its soposed to reserve enough power to maintain the reactor and send the rest to the transmiter but there are several situations where this fails to happen. Notably if you have more than one generator on a reactor it seems to think both run at full output and trys to take that double full output minus runing costs which is more than the total output so you run outa power and it shuts down. Timewarp can also do weird things to it. The long and the short of it is dont use fusion for transmited power. Use fission nukes for transmission and use fusion where you need high power for lower weight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn tritium decay in the background.
