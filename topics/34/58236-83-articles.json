Then go the engines all the first stage blocks separation things and the battery with avionics dummy which is a couple of tonnes. At this point the stack weighs about twelve tonnes meaning it should be twice as heavy at this point. Then goes the interesting part. After adding the payload and stuff and finally the fuel the weight is well over three hundred tonnes so it is carrying way more fuel than the real life thing.
