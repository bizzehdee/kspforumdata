Thanks for the update and bug fixes!\n\nCan anyone confirm if this is still an issue? Reported in 0.5.3 and I haven\u0027t tested it myself (probably will) but figured I could ask if others know?\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I am having trouble keeping my satellite rotating. I start the rotation and switch to another vessel. When I come back the first craft is not rotating anymore. It also is not saving the body-relative rotation. Hence, it seems it is not saving settings when switching vessels or going back to the Space Center. Installed via Ckan, version 0.5.3. Any ideas?\n\u003E Edit: Checking the PersistentRotation\\_\u0027Savename\u0027.cfg, it seems to write the values except for the relative body rotation, but isn\u0027t picking it up after switching back to the vessel. Rotation during timewarp is working just fine.\n\u003E \n\u003E Edit: Don\u0027t know if relevant but I am seeing this error(?) in the KSP.cfg after switching to the vessel: [LOG 23:13:00.275] [PR] No key! 6\n\u003E \n\u003E Edit: Found the bug causing this: It saves the persistent rotation state correctly when going to the space center via ESC --\u003E Space Center. It does not, however, save the persistent state when going to the space center via the blue button at the top of the screen in vessel view or when switching to another vessel from the map view."},{"CreatedByName":"BLUAV8R","CreatedById":83302,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T23:41:44Z","Content":"I love this mod! It makes my ISS build feel so much more realistic in it\u0027s rotation! However, is there anyway for me to have say only part of the spacecraft rotate based on the body I choose?\n\nFor example, the ISS will have its main body always rotating with the earth, yet the large solar arrays rotate based on the sun so the panels always aim at the light and this is achieved via motors on the S3/P3 truss segments. I know panels will rotate to face the sun (blue axis below) but the whole truss needs to move and my ISS Panels don\u0027t rotate in that axis (red axis below)\n\nimage for reference:\n\n![nasa-iss-longeron.jpg](http://www.topcoder.com/contest/problem/ISS/nasa-iss-longeron.jpg)\n\nBasically, I wanna know if I can have my trusses on the outside of the SARJs not rotate with the rest of the craft, I tried using free-rotating parts from infernal robotics but the rotation in those doesn\u0027t persist through warping :/\n\nEDIT: Also, infernal robotics parts will not move in time-warp, so even if the motor is selected and stuck on \u0022on\u0022, it doesn\u0027t move, it just snaps to where it should be when you exit time warp\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-09T23:47:56Z\u0022 title=\u002208/09/2015 11:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sippyfrog**"},{"CreatedByName":"MarkusA380","CreatedById":45759,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T09:12:57Z","Content":"@Black Talon: I am afraid this bug still exists.

They should be modelled in a special way tho, and obviously connector nodes won\u0027t rotate.\n\nFrom the point of view of setup in 3ds max/blender/unity - basically you have first solar panel that is modelled as rotating truss, with its own suncatcher and energy generation set to 0, and second one - a real solar panel, attached to first, again set up like it should be.\n\nAlso, I have a big request. Can the mod disable itself for crafts that are in thick atmosphere, as well as for landed crafts? Currently it frequently spins up the landed crafts when they are loaded or unpacked, destroying them, and spins up airplanes that fly without SAS when you quickload as well, leading to FAR destroying or stalling them.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-10T10:25:57Z\u0022 title=\u002208/10/2015 10:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by sashan**"},{"CreatedByName":"MK3424","CreatedById":19932,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T20:55:54Z","Content":"Nice!

I like the idea of maintaining a BBQ roll on my way to the Mun.\n\nHowever, I ran into this problem: When I use Mechjeb to \u0022Execute next node\u0022, it rotates to the maneuver marker, then warps. However, the craft quickly leaves the maneuver marker, so Mechjeb has to constantly stop warping, realign, rewarp, and repeat. I have not selected a reference body, so I\u0027m not sure why the craft is rotating off of the maneuver vector so quickly. Is it tracking some body, or is it simply that a craft is never really perfectly fixed orientation, and now that reality is biting me?\n\nThanks."},{"CreatedByName":"Poodmund","CreatedById":128643,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T20:37:54Z","Content":"Are you using the latest version of MechJeb as I think a fix was implemented to solve exactly this problem?
