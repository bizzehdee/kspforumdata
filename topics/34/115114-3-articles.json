It all makes sense at the end ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nThe purpose of this mod is simple:\n\nsome gamers absolutely want barycenters, some other gamers hate barycenters. So every choice you make seems to be the wrong one.\n\nWith this mod you have an easy way out:\n\ndesign your system to work fine with stock mechanics (so gamers who hate barycenters are happy)\n\nbut at the same time, add compatibility with SigmaBarycenter so gamers who love barycenters are happy as well.\n\nNow, regarding the actual questions:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E yes you can add planets to barycenters, make your planet like always (in ***@Kopernicus:FINAL***) then use the following code to move it around a barycenter\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E @Kopernicus:BEFORE[Squad]  \n\u003E {  \n\u003E  @Body[[COLOR=#00ff00][B]NewPlanet[/B][/COLOR]]  \n\u003E  {  \n\u003E  @Orbit  \n\u003E  {  \n\u003E  @referenceBody = [B][COLOR=#00ff00]barycentername[/COLOR][/B]  \n\u003E  }  \n\u003E  }  \n\u003E }\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E     \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E where\n\u003E \n\u003E **NewPlanet** is the name of the planet you want to move in orbit around the barycenter\n\u003E \n\u003E and\n\u003E \n\u003E **barycentername** is the name of the barycenter, which my mod creates by putting together the names of the two main bodies (example: YogSawob )\n\u003E \n\u003E **Disclaimer**: keep in mind that I\u0027ve never tried this so, even if the planets will show up in the correct place I don\u0027t really know if going there with probes will have any problem\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n\u003E \n\u003E yes it is possible, but have some limitation.\n\u003E \n\u003E the template.cfg only handles binaries. you can bypass this by nesting binary systems one inside the other (like in the example linked in the first post)\n\u003E \n\u003E but if you are sure you want to get binary systems (and don\u0027t support the possibility of having \u0022no-barycenters\u0022) then maybe it would be easier for you to just use the kopernicus feature barycenter and don\u0027t bother with the limitations of my mod\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nanyways, if you need any kind of support from my part, don\u0027t esitate to ask. both here and by PM"},{"CreatedByName":"Sigma88","CreatedById":113260,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-12T00:33:46Z","Content":"moved the download from dropbox to kerbalstuff\n\n[TABLE=width: 100]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]\n\n[![2I2mqzY.png](http://i.imgur.com/2I2mqzY.png)](https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/992)\n**@KERBALSTUFF**\n\n[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[/TABLE]"},{"CreatedByName":"loki130","CreatedById":64492,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-12T06:53:08Z","Content":"Kerbal Construction Time, Contract Configurator, and Science Alert all have major bugs with this.
