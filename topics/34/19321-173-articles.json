It took some effort to be able to figure out how to interpret just the static analysis, and it\u0027s literally the only thing I use in the VAB because the data\u002Bstability derivatives and simulation tabs I have no idea how to set up, and even if I did get it set up right, the results are just meaningless numbers to me. I\u0027ve glanced at the explanations for what they are, and could probably figure out what the numbers mean if I really wanted to, but I didn\u0027t see a thing that indicated that I\u0027d gain any understanding of how to do anything with them other than interpret them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMatter of fact, for the data\u002Bstability derivatives tab\u0027s help, the longitudinal and lateral motion tabs... I honestly don\u0027t know why 3/4ths of the stuff in those help tabs is even there. It\u0027s a lot of stuff about different aerodynamic motion modes (most of which I\u0027ve heard of), but no indication at all of how that relates to the data. Only about a quarter of each of those tabs actually mentions anything that\u0027s included in the data itself, and that\u0027s just a key, with no indication of how to apply it. Explanations of Dutch Roll, the Spiral mode, Short Period Motion, and Phugoids are well and good, but not really all that helpful when trying to figure out which of the derivatives relates to the problem in question, let alone how to fix it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a lot of general information, when what\u0027s needed is specific information. What types of things cause problems with particular things, how to correct common problems, what numbers to plug in to the various fields in order to get useful results.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way most of it\u0027s set up presumes that the person using it already understands aerodynamics at a fairly advanced level. And if, like the majority of people you don\u0027t know squat about aerodynamics (or even if you know a small bit coming in), there\u0027s nothing to help you learn enough of it to be able to actually USE most of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou seem to spend a lot of time diagnosing problems with individual people\u0027s planes: most of this thread seems to be composed of such. Hell, that tip about the anhedral helped my planes a fair bit. There\u0027s probably a bunch more stupid things like that I could do to make them less annoying to fly (\u0027annoying\u0027 is the extent of it. They\u0027re a TINY bit unstable, not enough to cause crashes unless I do something really stupid, but enough to require some regular tweaking to keep them at a reasonably steady altitude and heading.)

If this is wrong, the plane is going to want to do back-flips or front-flips.\u003Cp\u003EYb and Nb tell you if the plane is yaw-stable (it\u0027s side force due to sideslip and yawing tendency due to sideslip, respectively). These will almost always be the correct sign at the same time (unless you add a massive dorsal fin), and if correct basically make sure that the plane wants to fly straight rather than skate sideways.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELb tells you if the plane is stable in roll due to sideslip. Roll angle itself doesn\u0027t directly cause a roll instability, but roll angle does cause some sideslip (plane\u0027s lift and gravity end up in slightly different directions, and this induces a sideslip velocity), and that sideslip can cause the plane to roll like mad. A lot of people who build planes with these afterthought-like vertical tails end up running into issues with this not being large enough compared to the other values.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EZw and Xu are basically just the effects of lift and drag, respectively (Z is positive down) as you increase downwards vertical velocity (increasing angle of attack) the plane makes more lift. As you increase your forwards velocity, the plane makes more drag. If Zw is incorrect, you\u0027re plane is very badly designed. If Xu is incorrect, you have summoned the Kraken and should file a bug report.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMq, Lp and Nr determine whether pure rotation in pitch, roll and yaw (respectively) will damp out. It really shouldn\u0027t be possible to get them into the wrong sign without something else being unstable, but I suppose it\u0027s possible for very strange configurations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B4e derivatives all tell you the effect of how the elevators and canards perform. If that\u0027s wrong, then somehow you\u0027ve gotten your controls backwards; you want M\u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B4e as large as possible while X\u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B4e is as small as possible, since that means the most control authority possible with the least additional drag. Z\u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B4e is assumed to be correct for a standard tailplane design, so for canard designs it will be wrong (I\u0027ll make a change in FAR v0.13 to remove the coloring due to that reason).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EZq and Xq aren\u0027t really all that important, but they can make minor changes to the way a plane behaves under very large amounts of pitching.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGenerally, Zu and Xw can be disregarded if their magnitudes are much less than the other ones. They basically consider how much additional velocity affects lift and how much additional angle of attack affects velocity, respectively; they can be the \u0022wrong\u0022 sign at some angles of attack and Mach numbers due to Mach effects or nonlinear body drag\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:sans-serif;\u0022\u003E.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-21T13:01:08Z\u0022 title=\u002205/21/2014 01:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 21, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by thorfinn\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"taniwha","CreatedById":57176,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-21T13:22:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ethorfinn\u003C/strong\u003E: how about copying that to the wiki \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"phoenix_ca","CreatedById":50380,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-21T13:56:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEugh.
