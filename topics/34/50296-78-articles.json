Large changes in the slope of the graph indicate the boundaries of regions primarily affected by one or only a few real gas effects (such as dissociation of gases, ionization of monatomic gases, changing specific heats with temperature).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake note of the huge difference between the new and old models for Jool / Jupiter, because hydrogen and helium are very different from air. Also, note that if somehow you enter Jupiter\u0027s atmosphere above ~60 km/s, you\u0027re in for a really fun time, since that\u0027s about where my model has completely ionized the hydrogen and helium and there\u0027s not really any way to absorb more energy short of reacting the atmosphere with the heat shield.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wbkCVbJ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022wbkCVbJ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETemperature in K vs. Velocity in m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a closeup of the range from 0 - 3 km/s, where stock KSP flight tends to occur.

So here\u0027s what I\u0027ve got so far:\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0pakuED.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/0pakuED.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETemperature in K vs. Velocity in m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese are graphs of temperature due to velocity, assuming that the ambient temperature is 273 K = 0 C. In each case, the blue line is the curve that has been calculated according to the model, while the red line is the T in K = V in m/s rule that DRE has been following so far. Kerbin / Earth\u0027s atmosphere is modeled using 0.21 O\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E and 0.79 N\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E, Duna / Mars\u0027s is modeled using 0.96 CO\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E and 0.04 N\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E (Eve / Venus\u0027s atmosphere is very similar, and so is not shown), and Jool / Jupiter\u0027s atmosphere is 0.9 H\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E and 0.1 He. Large changes in the slope of the graph indicate the boundaries of regions primarily affected by one or only a few real gas effects (such as dissociation of gases, ionization of monatomic gases, changing specific heats with temperature).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake note of the huge difference between the new and old models for Jool / Jupiter, because hydrogen and helium are very different from air. Also, note that if somehow you enter Jupiter\u0027s atmosphere above ~60 km/s, you\u0027re in for a really fun time, since that\u0027s about where my model has completely ionized the hydrogen and helium and there\u0027s not really any way to absorb more energy short of reacting the atmosphere with the heat shield.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wbkCVbJ.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/wbkCVbJ.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETemperature in K vs. Velocity in m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a closeup of the range from 0 - 3 km/s, where stock KSP flight tends to occur. The temperatures end up being lower, but that can be easily compensated with lower max temperatures for parts (seriously, 1500 degrees is \u003Cem\u003Ea little\u003C/em\u003E high for pretty much anything that needs structural rigidity).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anyone\u0027s got any data on about what temperatures various elements ionize at (particularly the lighter gases), I\u0027d be happy to hear about it. The upper ends of the graphs are a little bit questionable due to incomplete information on that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis should end up in a version of DRE soon; so far all it does is calculate the curves in game (these were actually exported from KSP as .csv files), but doesn\u0027t use them yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooks very sweet. How about atm density? Is that factored in? I would suggest a default gas composition and cfg configurable system since there will be a lot of new planet packs because of kopernicus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope i didnt miss something.
