This being one of the most important parts of the mod, I\u0027d really like to know how I can get it working, thanks.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks. one or possibly two pages back I posted a few possible solutions. 1) the ship starts too high, you simply need to re-tune the launch coordinates. 2) the ship explodes on the beach and never makes it to the water. You can try adding a few trusses to the bottom of the ship \u0027balance it on a pole\u0027. I will update the download later on tonight which has further implementations to counteract bad launches.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for using the mod.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"InfiniteDice","CreatedById":57451,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-19T05:49:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWolfpack!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i44.tinypic.com/1073s0k.png\u0022 alt=\u00221073s0k.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ranger22550","CreatedById":79549,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-19T16:58:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eum slight problem with my download i see no ships file with pre-made ships all the parts are there and every part moves. just no prefab carriers, I\u0027m bad at making my own boats all the ones i tried well somehow a part got on the moon \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-19T17:08:38Z\u0022 title=\u002208/19/2013 05:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 19, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by ranger22550\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
