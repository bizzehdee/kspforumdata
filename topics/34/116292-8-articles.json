I use that addon a lot so I would love to see your plumes on those engines. The way they are configured now...the engines with the exception of the SRBs burn too \u0022cleanly\u0022 so there isn\u0027t much in the way of smoke/condensation trails. Also, the CMES rockets do not vent exhaust from the launchpad\u0027s exhaust trenches but I noticed that when I use engines that do have RealPlume configs like FASA, SpaceY, etc, they do show the trench plumes.\n\nThat\u0027s something in the config files, the engines are missing a field like:\n\n    \tMODULE\t{\t\tname = ModuleSurfaceFX\t\tthrustProviderModuleIndex = 0\t\tfxMax = 0.8\t\tmaxDistance = 50\t\tfalloff = 1.8\t\tthrustTransformName = thrustTransform\t}\n\nYou could add it pretty easily to every single engine that uses either RealPlume or the new stock FX module (might not look right for everything) with a MM patch in a config file like so:\n\n    @PART[*]:HAS[@MODULE[ModuleEnginesFX],!MODULE[ModuleSurfaceFX]]:FINAL{\tMODULE\t{\t\tname = ModuleSurfaceFX\t\tthrustProviderModuleIndex = 0\t\tfxMax = 0.8\t\tmaxDistance = 50\t\tfalloff = 1.8\t\tthrustTransformName = #$../MODULE[ModuleEnginesFX]/thrustVectorTransformName$\t}}\n\nPulled that from the Mainsail, so it might be overkill for smaller engines. But it should work.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Hey Felger you couldn\u0027t get in touch with Nertea to see if you could adapt the particles that come with the Cryogenic engines to realplume-ify them could you? Those particles are amazing and I\u0027d love to see them available to use here.\n\nAs a matter of fact I have! It\u0027s on my to-do list, if you check it out, I\u0027ve already got screenshots of the effects:\n\n[https://github.com/KSP-RO/RealPlume/tree/master/Screenshots/NerteaCryoFX](https://github.com/KSP-RO/RealPlume/tree/master/Screenshots/NerteaCryoFX)\n\nJust need to sit down and add them to the available generics.

Messy, but simpler in the long run.
