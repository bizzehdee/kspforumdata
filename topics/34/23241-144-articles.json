The engine still show the particle effects on both horizontal and vertical axis from the center of the engine. And when I\u0027m on the runway I would start with 174 m/s surface speed and the craft would just stuck in the midair. Also, I have tested using the B9 part with a stock engine and the same problem occurs but I\u0027m not sure whether it is directly related to B9 or not for this problem (stuck mid air on the runway after the craft is loaded) since I have this problem once with stock part too but with only the cockpit stuck midair.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sir_Tramalot","CreatedById":62713,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-16T16:56:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat plane? the one on the previous page?
