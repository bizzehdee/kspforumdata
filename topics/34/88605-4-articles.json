It\u0027s smaller size is made up for by the fact that you can reconfigure it. The mechanics aren\u0027t in place yet but you\u0027ll be able to reconfigure the stuff it stores while out in the field so long as you empty it first. There will be a button that lets you do that. It shows up in the tech tree when the MCM does. Later on you\u0027ll get the MBU, which doesn\u0027t hold as much as the MSM, and doesn\u0027t let you reconfigure it until much later in the tech tree, but you get landing legs. Even further out you\u0027ll get a large inflatable module (I haven\u0027t built it yet) that supports both storage and colony module types. At this point the MCM can be reconfigured in the field too. You \u0027ll also get the IMW, and the reconfigurable MBU will be unlocked. Eventually you\u0027ll get the Skydock 250, and at the top of the tech chain, you\u0027ll get the Skydock 375 and the Ponderosa Inflatable Multipurpose Colony Module. There might be other parts too that are designed to help you set up a colony (I\u0027m slowly pondering through how to attach the PackRat rover system to the MBU), but that\u0027s the basic gist of where I\u0027m going with this...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext release will not use a MM config on the Skydock and without EL, it\u0027ll just be a decorative piece.
