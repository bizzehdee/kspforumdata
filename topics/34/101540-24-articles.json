I\u0027m not sure why I originally thought that, I did do some experiments a while back when trying to understand how tweakscale interpreted reaction wheel torque but I didn\u0027t know that the mass of a 0.625m reaction wheel scaled to 1.25m didn\u0027t have the same mass as the 1.25m reaction wheel.\n\u003E \n\nThe way I would test this is to compare two things of equal mass. Size is most obvious but not much less gameplay-relevant as mass. A stock large reaction wheel is less powerful than the same volume filled with small wheels because it has the typical amount of torque needed by a 2.5m craft, packaged in a form factor that looks good on such a craft.\n\nBy the way, it is good to have a few people who don\u0027t just trust my words because someone needs to find the bugs I introduce."},{"CreatedByName":"Tekener","CreatedById":117427,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-23T16:17:55Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 2 hours ago, pellinor said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Sounds like a problem with your install.
