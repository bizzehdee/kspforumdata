I understand if this is part of the communications delay, but the bigger issue is erratic throttle behavior when sending the kill engines command (x). I will order a remote unmanned ship to kill thrust and the throttle will just start bouncing all over the place uncontrollably. It gets much worse the farther away from a node I am.

I put a command center up (6 kerbals and a large stack pod) and point the dish at Moho at that one. Shows connected now. Redirect at the mission comms and no-connection. Though the mission comms sat it would have had a max of 3 legs back to KSC. Is that the issue?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpdate: Bah! Fixed it. Didn\u0027t have proper alignments on kerbin network so the mission comms had connection only so long as it was the active vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-01T22:11:40Z\u0022 title=\u002212/01/2013 10:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 1, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by rosenkranz\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"123nick","CreatedById":27488,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-01T22:26:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ehelp! i have a AIES communication dish pointed at mission control from the mun, i have direct line of sight, but when i try to transmit it says theres no communication devices. what is the problem!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"babbos","CreatedById":91911,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-01T23:29:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KerbMav\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KerbMav\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDoes your ship have the big round probe core too?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes!
