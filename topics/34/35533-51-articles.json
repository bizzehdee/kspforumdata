You figured it out, I was welding after the cockpit. When I think about it, I don\u0027t see any reason why I shouldn\u0027t use the cockpit as the root part. For some reason I felt like I would be messing it up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the part that upsets me...these are all problems I know! I do historical recreations and strive to get accuracy (\u003Ca href=\u0022www.ksphistory.com\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ewww.ksphistory.com\u003C/a\u003E). The real shuttle\u0027s bay doors opened one at a time so I have trouble finding cargo bays I can do that with. In addition, this lets me customize the size and everything. I solved the door problem by placing a rotatron at the front, and a free-moving docking washer at the end of the door, then strutted the washer to the rear frame. It works awesome, check out this example: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/lTjbmk6\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/lTjbmk6\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t use FAR so it\u0027s all good.
