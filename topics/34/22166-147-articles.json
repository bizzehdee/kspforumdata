While it\u0027s true that the total amount of Kethane is extremely large, the total amount of ACCESSIBLE Kethane is quite a bit smaller. A polar deposit is unlikely to get tapped (especially if the terrain is like Mun\u0027s poles), and the deposits on Kerbin, Eve, etc. are similarly inaccessible; sure, you CAN land on these bodies, but would you? (Why would you drill on Kerbin to get a resource that refines into fuels you could just launch from KSC instead?) Kerbin, Eve, and Laythe also have the problem of oceans; a deposit doesn\u0027t do you any good if you can\u0027t drill at that location, and nearly all of Laythe is ocean.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in practice, the more-or-less-equatorial deposits on the lower-gravity airless bodies are the ones you\u0027ll be building a resource network around. And that cuts the practical amounts down quite a bit. For instance, my Joolian fuel depots refuel off Pol, due to its low gravity, although I\u0027ve occasionally refueled from all of the others (yes, even Tylo). My 300-ton depot arrived near Pol with about 30% fuel onboard after the trip from Kerbin, and refueling it required almost 100k Kethane, which knocked a big chunk off the largest deposit on Pol (440k originally). Sure, that Kethane turned into a lot of fuel, so I won\u0027t need to refill it very often, but if this were a non-beta campaign I\u0027d eventually run into serious fuel problems after a couple dozen refills.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHonestly, it boils down to a really simple question: if resources are intended to be effectively infinite, then what\u0027s the point of having finite quantities in the first place? But if you\u0027re intended to eventually run out, then that\u0027ll kill the gameplay once it happens. Not only that it\u0027ll make some mission types impossible, but that it\u0027ll discourage you from trying risky things that might waste your precious fuel; risky experimentation that often results in Kerbonauts exploding is a big part of this game, and I\u0027d hate to see that end out of fear of lost resources. I complained about this back when the official resource system was first announced, as well. It\u0027s also horribly unrealistic; the quantities of resources on planets are incalculably large compared to what any sort of small drill can extract in a few hours, so it SHOULD be treated as effectively infinite in practice, even if you define the amounts as being what can easily be reached with a shallow drill.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe solution, to me, is something like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt; Each deposit has a size, just like now, but quite a bit smaller. Say, current size divided by 5, so the biggest deposits will approach 100k units of resource.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt; That size affects extraction rate. That is, a deposit currently at 50,000 or more units of Kethane might extract at 100% of the listed rate, but as you go below that threshold the rate scales down linearly, to a minimum rate at ~10k units. (This\u0027d encourage you to prefer the richer deposits even if you don\u0027t need that much at any one time.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt; Additionally, all deposits slowly recharge over time, at a rate proportional to their maximum sizes. The rate wouldn\u0027t be fast enough that you could just leave a single extractor parked on the richest deposit; instead, you\u0027d be forced to periodically change where you fill your landers (or possibly move your bases). It\u0027d also fix the long-term shortage issue; if you\u0027ve tapped out the good deposits on Pol, just go mess around with spaceplanes on Kerbin or something for a while, and when you get around to returning to Pol there\u0027ll be enough regeneration to make things playable again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt; Scanning with the large scanner (not the tiny little one suitable for your small probes) has a chance of generating a new deposit, with the chance depending on the amount of unextracted Kethane on the body, or increasing the amounts contained in the existing deposits. Effectively, the small scanners only map out easily spotted surface deposits, but the big ones find the deeper stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could easily make this a two- or three-variable system, where the recharge and extraction rates are decoupled from the deposit size, but I\u0027m trying to keep it simple.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m hoping that once the official resource system is in place, something like this will show up in a mod. I\u0027d hate to have to either hack save files or restart my campaigns just to keep things playable in the long term.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BigD145","CreatedById":417,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-27T01:32:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYour third and fourth combined = kethane in every hex, eventually.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KhaosCorp","CreatedById":61149,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-27T01:44:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKethane can be harvested from the water...its not even that hard to do.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spatzimaus","CreatedById":57215,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-27T01:53:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022BigD145\u0022 data-cite=\u0022BigD145\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYour third and fourth combined = kethane in every hex, eventually.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot quite. Read the fourth one again... \u0022with the chance depending on the amount of unextracted Kethane\u0022. In other words, if you haven\u0027t mined any Kethane at all, then it won\u0027t spawn any new deposits. If you HAVE mined Kethane, then it\u0027d spawn new, small deposits (or increase the size of some existing ones)... but implicit in the statement was the assumption that this would be done at the expense of recharging the now-depleted deposit, to keep the total maximum on the planet at a constant level. Really, the third and fourth are intended to be complementary; while they can both be in there, increasing one would be at the expense of the other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThink of it like this. You\u0027ve got a 100k-unit deposit. You mine 20k from it. You can do two things:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1\u0026gt; Recharge 20k over time to that deposit. (Point 3 in the previous post.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2\u0026gt; Create a new 20k deposit or add 20k to some existing deposit other than the one you depleted. (Point 4 in the previous post.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIdeally, you\u0027d mix and match. Say, recharge 10k over time (making the depleted deposit\u0027s maximum now only 90k) while adding a new 10k deposit or adding 10k to some other existing one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem with options 2 and 3 are that in the long term, this\u0027d put all of the resources in the most inaccessible areas. Everything on Laythe would end up under the oceans, for instance, and other planets/moons would end up with everything at the poles. So there have to be a number of practical limits, which I didn\u0027t feel like spelling out in that previous post but I assumed the modders would recognize as inherent in the concept. For instance, the ratio between options 1 and 2 could depend on the deposit size, with smaller deposits purely recharging and large deposits mostly spawning/adding. Or, you could add a more complex redistribution logic, where all unused deposits slowly deplete THEMSELVES over time to create new ones, often in more accessible locations.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Galane","CreatedById":77949,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-27T03:38:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy last landing on Ike was in a green hex but the drills wouldn\u0027t bring up any Kethane, so I had to reload my save and land elsewhere.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wuz314159","CreatedById":94575,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-27T04:44:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022BigD145\u0022 data-cite=\u0022BigD145\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EReinstall if interface disappears.
