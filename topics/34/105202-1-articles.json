I\u0027ve been playing with it and minus a few refinements am very happy with the result.\n\nWith that, I am pleased to introduce \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E Life Support.\n\n![IO1fsne.png](http://i.imgur.com/IO1fsne.png)\n\n![n7QWMRG.png](http://i.imgur.com/n7QWMRG.png)\n\n**Basic overview stuff.**\n\nMechanics wise, it\u0027s pretty simple.\n\nKerbals require supplies. Kerbals also require EC. these are both on the same timer, so I just check supplies for the status window. When Kerbals are done consuming supplies, leftovers, scraps, and \u0027anything else\u0027 is either tossed overboard, or (if storage is available) tossed into a \u0027mulcher\u0027. The resulting organic slurry is called \u0027mulch\u0027 and can be used to feed greenhouses, etc. at the player\u0027s discretion (or in the case of MKS, converted into Organics at varying levels of efficiency).\n\n15 days out, the visuals go yellow (sorry, no auto-warp-slowdown-thingie, use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Alarm Clock (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Alarm Clock (mod)\u0022\u003EKAC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E). When supplies run out, things go into the red. If you leave them unsupplied for 15 days...\n\nwell, they just say \u0027screw it\u0027, get grouchy, and quit.\n\nThey are still in the pod. they still take up a seat. But they can\u0027t fly, can\u0027t EVA, and essentially do the Kerbal equivelant of spinning around in their office chairs, refusing to work, until resupplied. This is a design consideration in that all of us, at least once, has just flat out done goofed, and lost a whole colony of Kerbals via glich or other sadness. Yes, death/despawn will be an option. Not the default one tho. Mechanics wise, they are transformed into tourists, as they are essentially on a self-imposed vacation ![:wink:](//s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kerbal-forum-uploads/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nOnce resupplied, they are happy as clams and will return to work.\n\nWhile on EVA, they will not quit. But if they are brought back aboard a ship and have been starved (and can\u0027t find a hot meal waiting) they will promptly go in strike, and begin their self imposed vacation immediately.\n\nOrange suited Kerbals (Jeb, Bill, Bob, and Val) are immune to the ill effects of life support. They will still consume supplies if given, but do not leave the job, because they are just that awesome. This always gives a player (especially a new one) an \u0027out\u0027 to test out a manned mission before actually committing your other kerbals, etc. to a horrible fate of snack deprivation.\n\nYes, it\u0027s a bit more \u0027Kerbal\u0027 than TAC-LS, but also a lot more predictable and with harder consequences than \u0027Snacks\u0027. It does, however, feel \u0027right\u0027 (at least to me) from a design standpoint.\n\nParts wise: Three inline storage compartments.\n\nNo extra recyclers needed. No resourced added to pods (the 15 day window covers all of the Kerbin \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E so no point). No random contracts.\n\n**MKS/OKS Changes**\n\nMKS wise, closed loop just got a lot harder/more interesting (depending on your point of view).\n\nThe old C3 (now renamed to the Pioneer Module) will have a basic mulcher and greenhouse and can do recycling at 50% efficiency for up to four Kerbals.\n\nKerbitats operate at 75% efficiency.\n\nMk-IV modules (once released) will operate at 90% efficiency off-world, 100% efficiency on the surface (pulling in of local material is inferred, no extra drills required).\n\nSupplies come from organics. Organics come either from mulched supply waste, or from a combo of water/substrate. So surface bases are easier to get to self sufficiency - if they are on water/substrate deposits. Orbital will always be a pain - so you will need to fly up fresh organics or keep large stores. And since organics creation is not tied to the life support loop, building large surface farms is also pretty easy now.\n\n**Dealing with hungry Kerbals**\n\nSo you can do some very interesting things. Run a command pod to dock reviving supplies/snacks to a starved out colony ship. Use one of your orange-suits to lead a mission and conserve supplies. Note that Kerbals are pretty damn aggressive about getting their snacks - the only way to lock them out of the biscuit tin is to click that little feed button by the resource on a part (same way we reserve some battery power for a probe).\n\nNote that a Kerbal about to starve (i.e. no supplies for 15 days) will in fact happily break open said biscuit tin. witty screen message included ![:wink:](//s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kerbal-forum-uploads/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\n**Design side note:**\n\nSo \u0027Mulch\u0027.\n\nWaste was used, and too generic. And I wanted something that showed that the stuff was kinda useful, not edible, and felt more \u0027kerbal\u0027 (and less like poo!) if that makes sense.\n\nThe idea of Kerbals tossing all of the spare bits and scraps into a contraption and getting out a semi-useful generic organic slurry had a certain appeal, hence the abstracted mulchers and mulch resource.\n\nThe resource itself is just \u0027supplies\u0027 and has the visual representation of a translucent, semi-rounded green cube. What are they? Well... leave that to the imagination. But the labeling will read \u0027N.O.M.S. - (Nutritional Organic Meal Substitute)\u0027 on the tins\n\nLICENSE:\n\nConfiguration files and code are licensed under the GPL v3 license.\n\nAssets, including Models (\\*.mu) and Textures \\*.png/\\*.dds) are All Rights Reserved.
