Adding some option to the IR config.xml file?\n\nCurrently, when adding any IR part to a vessel, my KSP log gets spammed with the following exception inside the VAB (we\u0027re talking as many exceptions as my CPU can spew per second): \n\n    [EXC 16:41:30.815] NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object\tInfernalRobotics.Gui.ControlsGUI.OnGUI ()\n\nLaunching the vessel (it\u0027s a command pod with a rotatatron on top), there is still no IR button and no way to control the parts.\n\nReverting to the VAB, and once again the exception spam continues.\n\nThere is no option to add the IR button to blizzy\u0027s toolbar (it\u0027s simply not in the list), the stock AppLauncher icon is also not visible.\n\nIt appears as though IR cannot find the toolbar object instance to add it\u0027s button to, as made apparent by the following exception that appears on the main KSP start screen, and anytime I change scene (from what i can tell):\n\n    [LOG 16:35:42.539] IR: [GUI] awake[EXC 16:35:42.555] TargetException: Non-static method requires a target.\tSystem.Reflection.MonoMethod.Invoke (System.Object obj, BindingFlags invokeAttr, System.Reflection.Binder binder, System.Object[] parameters, System.Globalization.CultureInfo culture)\tSystem.Reflection.MethodBase.Invoke (System.Object obj, System.Object[] parameters)\tInfernalRobotics.Gui.ToolbarManager.add (System.String ns, System.String id)\tInfernalRobotics.Gui.ControlsGUI.Awake ()\tUnityEngine.GameObject:AddComponent(Type)\tAddonLoader:StartAddon(LoadedAssembly, Type, KSPAddon, Startup)\tAddonLoader:StartAddons(Startup)\t:MoveNext()\tUnityEngine.MonoBehaviour:StartCoroutine(IEnumerator)\t:MoveNext()\tUnityEngine.MonoBehaviour:StartCoroutine(IEnumerator)\tGameDatabase:StartLoad()\t:MoveNext()\tUnityEngine.MonoBehaviour:StartCoroutine(IEnumerator)\tLoadingScreen:Start()\n\nFrom my understanding looking at the IR source, the add() function is being called on a null object ( ToolbarManager == null ) , not clear on how this is happening.\n\nThese exceptions are thrown every time Awake() or OnDestroy() is being called (because the button / toolbar / GUI hasn\u0027t been created?) and although it may not be directly related (we all know how crashy KSP can get with mods) whenever my game crashes, this is always the only recent exception in the game log.\n\nIf possible, please either add an exception handler to the toolbar handling code and fallback to the standard AppLauncher toolbar if the ToolbarManager instance is null?\n\nFailing that, can anyone provide a copy of their GameData\\toolbar-settings.dat file to see if manually adding the IR button into the config will fix the exception?\n\nI have performed both a fresh install of IR, and a fresh install of KSP to no avail. Removing blizzy\u0027s toolbar mod, fixes the problem, but IR is supposed to be compatible with blizzy\u0027s toolbar and I don\u0027t really want to lose it, but may just have to bite the bullet.\n\nI\u0027ve searched on these forums, on reddit, and across the mighty google, and either the problem goes unresolved, or the user mysteriously fixes the issue without any insight (in the cases where it\u0027s the same problem, i suspect they no longer have the toolbar mod installed, as that\u0027s the only way i\u0027ve found to fix this issue)\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated, I love your mod and appreciate the hard work that has gone into it\u0027s development and is a shame to be plagued by what would seem to be such a simple issue.\n\nI have uploaded a copy of my KSP.log file (I truncated a lot of the repeated exceptions as the log file was over 50MB)\n\n[http://www.megafileupload.com/9h5i/KSP.txt](http://www.megafileupload.com/9h5i/KSP.txt)\n\nThese are the mods I currently have installed ouput from AVC:\n\nKSP: 1.0.4 (Win32) - Unity: 4.6.4f1 - OS: Windows 7 Service Pack 1 (6.1.7601) 64bit\n\nChatterer - 0.9.6.86\n\nChuteSafetyIndicator - 1.0.2\n\nContract Pack: Base Construction - 0.2.1\n\nContract Pack: Field Research - 1.1\n\nContract Pack: Kerbal Space Station - 2.2.1\n\nContract Pack: RemoteTech - 2.0\n\nContract Pack: Grand Tour Contracts - 0.1.7\n\nContract Pack: Unmanned Contracts - 0.3.10\n\nContract Pack: Tourism Plus - 1.2\n\nContract Pack: Anomaly Surveyor - 1.4\n\nCC-CP-SCANSat - 0.5.2.1\n\nContracts Window Plus - 1.0.5.3\n\nDocking Port Alignment Indicator - 6.2\n\nInfernal Robots - 0.21.3\n\nKerbal Attachment System - 0.5.4\n\nKerbal Alarm Clock - 3.4\n\nAlternate Resource Panel - 2.7.3\n\nKerbal Engineer Redux - 1.0.18\n\nKerbal Inventory System - 1.2.2\n\nKSP-AVC Plugin - 1.1.5\n\nSCANsat - 1.1.4.2\n\nWaypoint Manager - 2.4.2\n\nTAC Fuel Balancer - 2.5.1.7\n\nQuickGoTo - 1.2\n\nQuickScroll - 1.3.1\n\nQuickSearch - 1.1.3\n\nRCS Build Aid - 0.7.2\n\nRemoteTech - 1.6.7\n\nTweakScale - 2.2.1\n\n[x] Science! - 4.8\n\nMKS - 0.31.6\n\nFreight Transport Tech - 0.4.1\n\nEVAHandrailsPackContinued - 0.2\n\nKW-Rocketry-Community-Fixes - 0.2\n\nFirespitter - 7.1.4\n\nUbioWeldingLtd - 2.1.2\n\nTAC Life Support - 0.11.1.20\n\nOlympic1\u0027s Icon Packs - 0.6\n\nNear Future Electrical - 0.5.2\n\nKSP Interstellar Extended - 1.4.9\n\nSpaceY Lifters - 1.0.3\n\nUSI Tools - 0.4.2\n\nFilter Extensions - 2.4.1\n\nDMagic Orbital Science - 1.0.8\n\nUniversal Storage - 1.1.0.7\n\nInterstellar Fuel Switch - 1.15\n\nSpaceTux: Shared Assets - 0.3.6\n\nCommunity Resource Pack - 0.4.4\n\nContract Configurator - 1.7.2\n\nStageRecovery - 1.5.7"},{"CreatedByName":"phoenix2004uk","CreatedById":150586,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-05T01:36:07Z","Content":"Regarding my previous post, after spending a few hours more scouring over google for solutions, I have proven Einstein\u0027s definition of madness wrong (trying the same thing over and over and expecting different results).\n\nI have no idea, what has happened, but the IR button is now available in the toolbar.\n\nI have just deleted and redownloaded both the toolbar mod, and IR.

I haven\u0027t changed anything since I re-installed the mods (and it wasn\u0027t working), i had simply moved the toolbar DLL out of my game folder, and had now moved the file back again, to let me change settings.\n\nI\u0027m stumped as to what has actually happened, and why, on the moment of giving up, it is now working.

So...... incase anyone else who has been having this problem stumbles back to this post - try that. If not. Then try adding and removing both mods. Creating new save games.

Unless you want to use it for non symmetric things ,even then it is buggy as hell, then it would be OKAY.\n\nThere are definitely some frustrating challenges to overcome when using this mod, but that\u0027s because this mod is very complex. I don\u0027t mean complex to use, I mean the functionality it provides is inherently complex. If you\u0027ve used other mods of equivalent complexity, you might realize they\u0027ll have the same kinds of issues. Seriously, try working with KOS. This is true of everything in the world, in fact. The higher the complexity, the more frustrating you\u0027ll find it.\n\nI understand your pain. Sometimes with KOS and IR (and even BD Armory to some extent) I feel like I\u0027m fighting the system, like it\u0027s specifically designed to make my life difficult. But that\u0027s because I\u0027m using complex stuff to do complex things, and the base game that is KSP just doesn\u0027t work the way you might think it does. Don\u0027t let that fool you into thinking that these mods are somehow poorly constructed.\n\nSolutions \\*can\\* be found, even if they\u0027re not always the most elegant.
