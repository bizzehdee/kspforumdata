Infinite fuel was enabled, as was thermal debug colors and right-click data.\n\nTest ship 1:\n\n[![IdbYwcLm.png](http://i.imgur.com/IdbYwcLm.png)](http://imgur.com/IdbYwcL)\n\nThis is what I would assume is sufficient based on past experience.\n\n[![GaoCEmhm.png](http://i.imgur.com/GaoCEmhm.png)](http://imgur.com/GaoCEmh)\n\nIt failed to stabilize at all (resulting in exploding reactor) lead alone below nominal temperature.\n\nTest ship 2:\n\n[![2xICPbwm.png](http://i.imgur.com/2xICPbwm.png)](http://imgur.com/2xICPbw)\n\nI went massively overkill to ensure I could stabilize the reactor.\n\nInterestingly enough, both ships stabilize the reactor at ~700k for a time until it hits about 400Ec/s power generation. At this point reactor temp begins to climb above nominal temperature.\n\n[![eV6J8hEm.png](http://i.imgur.com/eV6J8hEm.png)](http://imgur.com/eV6J8hE)\n\nThis particular ship stabilized the reactor just over 1000k.\n\n[![86JaFnrm.png](http://i.imgur.com/86JaFnrm.png)](http://imgur.com/86JaFnr)\n\nOnce the engine was ignited and burned for several minutes, it too reached a high temperature threshold. Now the radiators had to cool both the reactor and engine. This task proved too much even for this mass of radiator area and eventually the reactor went bang, followed shortly by the engine which somehow remained on even after losing power (infinite fuel at work perhaps; this behavior did not occur pre-1.0 and is perhaps new).\n\nIt had been suggested previously that increasing reactor operating temperature would allow for the radiators to stabilize at their critical operating temperature before the reactors pass nominal. Below is my test with the same ship, but with the reactor modified to be over 80% hotter.\n\nNominal temp: 1400\n\nCritical temp: 1900\n\nPart max temp: 2200\n\n60% additional heat generation from reactor\n\nAll of these are to help the radiators stabilize (the radiators reach equilibrium at over 1500k).\n\nThe results of this are below.\n\nTest ship 3:\n\n[![2MsjWenm.png](http://i.imgur.com/2MsjWenm.png)](http://imgur.com/2MsjWen)\n\nThe reactor stabilizes at 850k as the radiators warm up.\n\n[![6kXVUszm.png](http://i.imgur.com/6kXVUszm.png)](http://imgur.com/6kXVUsz)\n\nThe radiators reach the same temperature as the reactor, and it all goes downhill from here.\n\n[![xbACtf5m.png](http://i.imgur.com/xbACtf5m.png)](http://imgur.com/xbACtf5)\n\nThis is right before the thing goes bang. It failed to stabilize below max temp.\n\n**The results:**\n\n-The stock radiators cannot stabilize the reactor because the reactor\u0027s operating temperature is far below the radiators\u0027 thermal equilibrium temperature. Even with a max heat tolerance of 2200k on the modified reactor, it could not stabilize. The lack of refrigeration prevents stock radiators from being effective with NFE reactors without beyond-ridiculous quantities of radiator panels.\n\n-The addition of multiple heat sources disrupts the stock radiators after reaching stability, as they did on test ship 2. Adding a hot engine to the mix causes them to pay less attention to the reactor, failing to keep it stabilized, resulting in cooling failure.\n\nP.S. All of these images are clickable for full resolution. I downsized them due to the sheer number contained in this post.\n\nIn light of these results, I make my appeal again.\n\nNertea, please do not convert to the stock radiator module.\n\nEDIT: It should also be noted that I did edit the reactors to include the necessary parameters so the radiators would kick in when the reactor reached ~200k below nominal temperature.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-25T22:07:25Z\u0022 title=\u002206/25/2015 10:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Captain Sierra**"},{"CreatedByName":"Gribbleshnibit8","CreatedById":113278,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T22:03:08Z","Content":"IMO global heat removal makes more sense than localized.

These two ideas are conflicting heavily.\n\n**A possible solution:**\n\nRight now, Heat Control is defining a custom part module for active radiators. Stock now has a part module for active radiators. Is it possible to extend the existing stock module to be capable of replicating the current Heat Control radiator function (or close to it) without defining a whole new module? By leveraging stock instead of ignoring it, Nertea gets to take the mod closer to stock than it is now, those of us desperately wanting the precision heat management still get that, and retaining refrigeration capabilities prevents the need to overhaul the NFE reactors.\n\nMinimal work, minimal plugin code, same popular functionality."},{"CreatedByName":"Fraz86","CreatedById":90101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T23:15:52Z","Content":"Captain Sierra \u0026 Mikegarrison,\n\nThere are plenty of variables that can be tweaked to balance the reactors.

I used the \u0022advanced radiators\u0022 concept that I mentioned in previous posts for conformal radiators, giving them increased emissivity at the expense of retaining their higher mass and cost relative to the stock radiators.

You cannot reliably test the expected behavior with the setups and systematic you chose. You\u0027ll notice that I haven\u0027t done any testing myself yet, and instead asked for an official test build with proper reactor stats, and that\u0027s for a reason.\n\n- The reactors you tested with have no (or bogus) values for skin conductivity under 1.0.4. Therefore the reactors don\u0027t handle heat as they should; they have the wrong thermal mass and radiate the wrong amount of heat. The self-radiation in particular can make or break a stability point, and without it, you cannot reasonably conclude that a reactor stabilizes or fails to stabilize at a certain temperature. Conductivity is another factor; 1.0.2, reactors weren\u0027t very good conductors, but that may change because it\u0027s no longer necessary to keep heat confined to a single part. Or it may change the other way, making them conduct even less, because the reactors might aim for a higher nominal temperature in the future. Until these values are intentionally defined with 1.0.4 in mind, no test can give more than a rough indication.\n\n- In your second test, you mounted the engine with the second-highest heat output in all of NF Propulsion. It outputs waste heat equal to some of the larger reactors, and even in 1.0.2, it would cause temperature issues for ships without additional radiators dedicated to it (just ask Darth Lazarus!). The fact that it destabilizes the equilibirium between reactor and radiators is not a problem, it is expected behavior if the radiators are sized for the reactor alone. (Also: yes, 1.0 made infinite fuel also provide infinite Ec. It was very useful during NFP testing.)\n\n- In your third test, with the elevated maxTemp values, you increased the reactor\u0027s heat output by 60%. Why? There\u0027s no reason to expect this value to change in any way for this update; you should have tested at default heat output. The unnecessary increase is single-handedly responsible for the test to fail. From a scientific standpoint, this is a serious systematic error and could be interpretated in... certain ways. Just saying.\n\n@Nertea: since we\u0027re most discussing NF Electrical right now, do you think it would make sense to move the discussion over to the Near Future thread? Or maybe your dev thread, but there it might derail the mk4 development discussion.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-26T11:33:44Z\u0022 title=\u002206/26/2015 11:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind**"},{"CreatedByName":"Fraz86","CreatedById":90101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T15:53:12Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E you increased the reactor\u0027s heat output by 60%. Why? There\u0027s no reason to expect this value to change in any way for this update\n\nI wouldn\u0027t rule out a change in reactor heat output, though obviously the direction of change would be a decrease rather than increase. Compensating for the lack of refrigeration behavior may prove challenging if we don\u0027t decrease reactor heat output. Yes, nominal \u0026 critical temps can be increased as you suggested, but it may not be enough.\n\nKeep in mind, we actually *doubled* reactor heat production late during testing for the recent NFE release. I had advocated for that increase, primarily due to concerns regarding structural parts being overly capable of dissipating reactor heat. I think it would be reasonable to revert to the prior heat output if needed, and the issue of excessive structural heat dissipation could be addressed by other means (e.g., by giving reactors very low conductivity).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-26T18:27:55Z\u0022 title=\u002206/26/2015 06:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fraz86**"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T18:07:16Z","Content":"That\u0027s a change that ripples through all of Nertea\u0027s heat-related parts (including NFP engines), though. It seems to me that there are other, less intrusive changes that can be made first, and gut feeling says that they\u0027re probably enough to make things playable.\n\nThe heat loads we have on reactors now are also more believable in terms of comparison to the LV-N. Even after all the adjustments it\u0027s seen.

I share your opinion that reactor heat output is currently in a good place. If we can balance everything without decreasing reactor heat output, I will be happy. I\u0027m only saying that I\u0027m not confident we can take it off the table.\n\nAnyway, I would love to hear if you have any thoughts regarding my proposal to give Nertea\u0027s radiators high emissivity (probably \u003E4) as a means of allowing them to retain their ability to provide sufficient cooling for their corresponding reactors, as well as justifying their high mass and cost (relative to stock radiators)."},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T20:07:12Z","Content":"Honestly? I\u0027m not a fan of \u0022fudging physics\u0022, as it were, even if it works ingame. That\u0027s not to say I will argue against it if it turns out to be useful, but you won\u0027t see me calling for it, sorry ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) It just feels counterintuitive to me to take this incredibly complex thermodynamics simulation that we have and then go and make it behave in an unrealistic fashion. Yes, I know the stock game does it all over the place, but that doesn\u0027t make it better.\n\nThe thing to keep in mind here is that doing this wouldn\u0027t have to be done to make the Near Future radiators work with the stock modules. They would work perfectly fine with no changes other than perhaps price and mass, and they\u0027d in fact be minimally better per area offered because they *already* have the highest possible (realistic) emissiveConstant, higher than what the stock radiators offer. But they would not truly offer anything new besides fancy emissives. (Which are, admittedly, one of my favorite things.)\n\nIt\u0027s precisely that which irks me. Build a part that does something novel and useful, and it requires fudging physics? Okay, may be acceptable. I eventually went with advocating fudging the physics on the DS01 Charon MPDT because it turned out that the size-0-to-size-0 bulkhead connection arbitrarily limits thermal conductivity to a huge degree. But build a part that is redundant, then fudge physics in order to justify its existence? That just feels contrived... Now of course, Nertea\u0027s parts came first and the new stock radiators merely sniped their reason to exist, so nobody can blame anyone for seeking new and novel ways to keep them relevant. I just think that fudging physics should be a last resort, not a weapon of choice.\n\nPerhaps we might even get away without fudging physics. I have some vague ideas, but they\u0027re all pointless to discuss as long as I don\u0027t properly understand how NF reactors will run with stock radiators and proper skin stats. Once there is a test build available, this will certainly be the focus of my testing activities."}]}
