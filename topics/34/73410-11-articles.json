Most likely this would be a 3.75m engine with those thrust numbers (or at least closer). Probably will do a part-copy alternate config for a NovaPunch or KW engine to do so, or maybe the KX-2 stock one. Most engines in this class don\u0027t even come close to 8000 kN, and the only ones that do are boosters from NovaPunch (which I might nerf a bit). If you want a straight Raptor clone, I imagine the RO thread has that somewhere.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHey Raptor, I saw this a few (almost 3) weeks back when you posted it, but then haven\u0027t heard anything more about it since, or seen any related commits in the dev version of Stockalike.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would \u003Cstrong\u003ELOVE\u003C/strong\u003E it if you did include a 3.75 meter version of the Meth/LOx engine that actually did clone the real-world specs (or something closer to them) like you suggested to fulfill the heavy-lift role. A 2.5 meter engine simply isn\u0027t powerful enough to lift a 3.75 meter rocket... (unless you use the real-world Raptor stats for the 2.5 meter version)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s worth noting that there were a couple reasons the Raptor stats are way out of line with the XLS for 2.5 meter engines. One is because almost all the engines in KSP produce less thrust than their real-world analogs, and have inferior TWR values (real rockets are much taller, and thus require much better engines, due to the greater Delta-V requirements to reach orbit).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other is because the Full Flow Staged Combustion cycle used in the Raptor is a MUCH more advanced engine design that almost any other engine out there. I think there were ever only 2 other engines that were designed to use it, and neither of them made it off the test stand (although they DID work as expected in testing) as there was no need for an engine that powerful (its greatest advantage is that it makes re-usable rocket stages much easier when you have an engine that powerful- but nobody ever seriously attempted reusables until Space-X) and it is significantly more expensive to engineer in the first place (but not to build- a higher but-in cost in the tech tree is the best representation for this)- something that also deterred its development until Space-X\u0027s efforts at reusability...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, that engine design doesn\u0027t offer very substantial benefits when using LH2/LOX- so most rocket designers preferred to just stick with LH2/LOX for high-performance launch stages, rather than move to Kero/LOX or Meth/LOX engines with a Full Flow Staged Combustion Engine (I should note that LH2/LOX is a poor choice for reusable launch stages, due to its low fuel density- it makes it difficult to build a launch stage with a low enough Center of Mass that it won\u0027t tip over after touch-down, an issue Space-X is currently struggling with despite using Kero/LOX- they already lost one launch stage in a recovery test to it tipping over in the sea and the fuel tank rupturing...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI should note I launch almost all my rockets Space-X style in KSP, so I would LOVE to have a Full Flow Staged Cumbustion engine at my disposal, even if its tech tree buy-in costs (I play with those enabled) were considerably higher than other chemical rocket engines... (the per-unit cost shouldn\u0027t be, however- the engines aren\u0027t actually harder to manufacture, only design)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, enough tangents about the performance aside. I deeply hope you\u0027ll follow up on this idea you mentioned before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, some investigation reveals the KSP-Interstellar Al-Hybrid TWR and ISP are, surprisingly, perfectly accurate already. Several design limitations about how the Aluminum can be packed in (in such a way that the Aluminum can be replaced via ISRU, as it can be in the KSP-I version) tend to increase its dry mass substantially (leading to a rather low TWR compared to what can theoretically be achieved with this propulsion system...) Thus the current TWR is spot-on with design projections, as far as I can tell...

Didn\u0027t you say you already fixed that (in the same post I quoted before) some time ago?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact, the current GitHub and Release versions of \u0022Stockalike\u0022 don\u0027t have MM patches for the engine at all as far as I can tell! (meaning the engine won\u0027t work in RealFuels at all, as the engine uses Oxidizer without a MM patch...) I\u0027m using an older version of \u0022Stockalike\u0022 still until this issues is resolved, but I also need to update so that my RAPIER and NovaPunch2 M2 engines won\u0027t burn Oxidizer as well- so please update soon!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-22T02:40:57Z\u0022 title=\u002211/22/2014 02:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 22, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Raptor831","CreatedById":68286,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-22T05:41:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELink for SpaceY: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100408\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100408\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yeah, the KSPI Methane Engine is included in the Stockalike config.
