The only way I could see it working is if droping bits of mater into the same spot on the BH caused it to release enough energy in a single direction that the BH would move itself.

I didnt see anything in those links in how you would move the thing either. you cant physicly push as it would just eat any material comeing in contact.

This would not pose a launch issue - it could be formed once already launched. In terms of danger, although smashing it into a planet would be bad, the comparative danger is arguably less than the antimatter source - a black hole in the final stages of Hawking decay exploding 1 AU from earth would have no appreciable effect. A disabled ship\u0027s antimatter containment failing could be far worse (varying on amoun, of course) the main point is that antimatter is potentially deadly in a wider range of cases, while the black hole device is deadly exactly if it hits the planet (and lacks sufficient velocity to smash through it and exit the other side (think neutronium) (giving opportunity to re-capture it before return).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith regard to containment - it trivial, given antimatter containment tech. Simply give the black hole a charge (feed it lots of electrons or lots of protons (maybe consume that chargedparticle resource directly to do so)).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce created the black hole has to be fed (any, neutrally charged to preserve charge) matter to maintain its mass (and energy release rate).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the biggest advantage of the black hole drive - once created, one can harvest \u003Cem\u003Eany\u003C/em\u003E resource planetside for this. This can also harvest interstellar dust and gas (once we have actual multiple star systems this will be much more important. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor extreme long-distance travel (the real world one seems to be able to make the one-way alpha centauri run in 3.5 years (from reference frame of traveler, assuming accel to .1\u003Cem\u003Ec\u003C/em\u003E then decelerate [ie fastest trip]) one could even send a fleet of asteroid-mounted probes alongside kerbals, each with its own black hole, and consume first the asteroids, and then combine the black holes [although that might be horribly messy, might be better to have them go to trajectories where they won\u0027t hit anything before they evaporate] themselves if the interstellar media is insufficiently dense.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"VaporTrail","CreatedById":83184,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-01T18:19:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ABZB\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ABZB\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ethe comparative danger is arguably less than the antimatter source - a black hole in the final stages of Hawking decay exploding 1 AU from earth would have no appreciable effect.
