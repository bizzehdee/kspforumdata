However, there is hardly ever a reason not to have a container or two, especially on manned missions. These hold a variety of bits and bobs for repair, resource transfer, and the occasional rocketbike assembly. Having a few cable anchors present is a more lightweight alternative to a full winch, and requires no power - ultimately allowing, for instance, a Kerbal, to pull something, either in space or on the ground.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout this, here is what I thought : \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/KospY/KAS/issues/52\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/KospY/KAS/issues/52\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KhaosCorp\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KhaosCorp\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI been trying to tell yall...it matters how the connectors face each other....\u003Cp\u003EI have stuff on the moon connected by pipes (and each craft connected to ground with struts) and its on a good slope...no issues.

I flew up a supply ship full of parts, then a tank, and got to work hooking it all up. I used 3-4 pylons, 1 every 25m or so, and when I linked the final pipe, the empty tank and a few of the pylons started to float away and mangle up (see Ratzap\u0027s pictures from 10 or so pages ago). Luckily I saved so no real damage was done, but for some reason I am unable to accomplish my goal. \u003Cp\u003EI did try to strut the tank and miner to their nearest pylon (no help) and also changed the pipeline so it wasn\u0027t a straight line, which also didn\u0027t work. I had some pretty ambitious plans to build a mega-refinery on Minmus, hopefully someone can help! Also of note: I was connecting the pipe fittings to the upper/diagonal portion of the pylon, not the part near/perpendicular to the ground. Can add photos when I get off work.

Pylons sit on the ground as if it were level which forces tension into the pipes. How can you connect craft to the ground with struts? The KAS struts function only on the same craft, you can tie a base together with them but not the base or ships to each other. And if high pipe angles are causing issues that needs to be addressed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe yellow time clock means the game is artificially slowing time down in order to get a better frame rate due to the high part count.
