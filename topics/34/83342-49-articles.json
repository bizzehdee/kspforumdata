The only time I\u0027ve seen similar occurrences were when launching from the Tracking Station. Does this happen every time with this ship? The way KCT launches is by saving the ship to a file, then calling the same function that KSP uses when launching from the launchpad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf that ship has the issue all the time, please launch it, revert to editor, then go into the KSP/saves/{Your Save Name}/Ships folder and find the \u0022temp.craft\u0022 file and move it into the VAB folder. Then, launch that ship by clicking on the launchpad and selecting it (make sure it\u0027s the right one, not one that you\u0027ve saved previously in the editor. It might be easiest to temporarily move all other craft files out of the VAB folder). That\u0027ll start a simulation, but KCT won\u0027t handle the launch at all. If it still has issues, but launching one that you\u0027ve saved previously in the editor (same method, but use a craft file that you\u0027ve saved in the editor rather than the temp.craft) doesn\u0027t have that issue, let me know.
