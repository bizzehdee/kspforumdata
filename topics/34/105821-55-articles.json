If you get kicked out of IVA, that\u0027s because the vessel you were flying ceased to exist - when it docked with the other vessel / station, KSP decided to add clones of the parts from your vessel to the other vessel.  It might be possible to add a feature like that, but any such effort will be in my Avionics Systems mod, not RPM.\n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Along the same lines, it would be nice to be able to remain inside IVA (reliably) when un-docking from the Target screen.

I\u0027ve measured the mod\u0027s update performance, and it\u0027s in the sub-millisecond range on my desktop computer, which means it\u0027s using less than 5% of the FixedUpdate budget.  There are parts of it that are not extensively optimized (extra allocations that lead to garbage collection), but even in the complex IVAs I\u0027ve used, such as the ALCOR lander, I don\u0027t get much more than a flicker of yellow due to garbage collection every few seconds.  You may check the config file where the mod was installed and make sure DebugLogging is set to \u0027false\u0027 (it should be by default)."},{"CreatedByName":"Fwiffo","CreatedById":148084,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-30T20:01:26Z","Content":"Just to confirm: hullcam-models-as-external-cameras.cfg from Beta2 is no longer needed?"},{"CreatedByName":"MOARdV","CreatedById":60950,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-30T21:03:08Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, Fwiffo said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Just to confirm: hullcam-models-as-external-cameras.cfg from Beta2 is no longer needed?\n\u003E \n\nIf you have the updated version of Hullcam VDS then it is no longer needed."},{"CreatedByName":"Not Sure","CreatedById":165210,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-01T01:50:04Z","Content":"Alright, after 2 reinstalls and removal of(not) all mods it changes a small bit: ERROR: RastorPropMonitor.dll must be in GameData/JSI/RasterPropMonitor/plugins but its in GameData/RasterPropMonitor.028.0beta4/.

The autopilot menu defaults to the mechjeb version. Players who don\u0027t have mechjeb installed will have to press the button twice to get the stock \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003Esas\u003C/abbr\u003E menu to show. I looked through your mod\u0027s cfg files, and found I could make it default to the stock \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003Esas\u003C/abbr\u003E by opening the MFD40x20.cfg file in JSI/RPMPodPatches/BasicMFD and switching the following:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Hide contents\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The file usually has:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Reveal hidden contents\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E // -------------------- Page \u0027D\u0027  SmartASS/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E control -----------------------------------  \n\u003E \n\u003E       \n\u003E \n\u003E               \n\u003E \n\u003E     PAGE  \n\u003E \n\u003E     {  \n\u003E \n\u003E         name = smartass  \n\u003E \n\u003E         button = button\\_D  \n\u003E \n\u003E         text = MechJeb software not installed.  \n\u003E \n\u003E         PAGEHANDLER  \n\u003E \n\u003E         {  \n\u003E \n\u003E             name = MechJebRPM  \n\u003E \n\u003E             method = ShowMenu  \n\u003E \n\u003E             pageActiveMethod = PageActive  \n\u003E \n\u003E             buttonClickMethod = ClickProcessor  \n\u003E \n\u003E             pageTitle = ----------- Autopilot control -----------  \n\u003E \n\u003E         }  \n\u003E \n\u003E         textureURL = JSI/RasterPropMonitor/Library/Textures/bg01  \n\u003E \n\u003E     }            PAGE  \n\u003E \n\u003E     {  \n\u003E \n\u003E         name = \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003Esas\u003C/abbr\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E         button = button\\_D  \n\u003E \n\u003E         text = Autopilot software not installed.  \n\u003E \n\u003E         PAGEHANDLER  \n\u003E \n\u003E         {  \n\u003E \n\u003E             name = JSISASMenu  \n\u003E \n\u003E             method = ShowMenu  \n\u003E \n\u003E             pageActiveMethod = PageActive  \n\u003E \n\u003E             buttonClickMethod = ClickProcessor  \n\u003E \n\u003E             pageTitle = ----------- Autopilot control -----------  \n\u003E \n\u003E         }  \n\u003E \n\u003E         textureURL = JSI/RasterPropMonitor/Library/Textures/bg01  \n\u003E \n\u003E     }\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E mechjeb is listed first, but it will show the stock \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003Esas\u003C/abbr\u003E menu first if you switch them, like this:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Reveal hidden contents\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E // -------------------- Page \u0027D\u0027  SmartASS/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E control -----------------------------------  \n\u003E \n\u003E       \n\u003E \n\u003E               \n\u003E \n\u003E     PAGE  \n\u003E \n\u003E     {  \n\u003E \n\u003E         name = \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003Esas\u003C/abbr\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E         button = button\\_D  \n\u003E \n\u003E         text = Autopilot software not installed.  \n\u003E \n\u003E         PAGEHANDLER  \n\u003E \n\u003E         {  \n\u003E \n\u003E             name = JSISASMenu  \n\u003E \n\u003E             method = ShowMenu  \n\u003E \n\u003E             pageActiveMethod = PageActive  \n\u003E \n\u003E             buttonClickMethod = ClickProcessor  \n\u003E \n\u003E             pageTitle = ----------- Autopilot control -----------  \n\u003E \n\u003E         }  \n\u003E \n\u003E         textureURL = JSI/RasterPropMonitor/Library/Textures/bg01  \n\u003E \n\u003E     }  \n\u003E \n\u003E     PAGE  \n\u003E \n\u003E     {  \n\u003E \n\u003E         name = smartass  \n\u003E \n\u003E         button = button\\_D  \n\u003E \n\u003E         text = MechJeb software not installed.  \n\u003E \n\u003E         PAGEHANDLER  \n\u003E \n\u003E         {  \n\u003E \n\u003E             name = MechJebRPM  \n\u003E \n\u003E             method = ShowMenu  \n\u003E \n\u003E             pageActiveMethod = PageActive  \n\u003E \n\u003E             buttonClickMethod = ClickProcessor  \n\u003E \n\u003E             pageTitle = ----------- Autopilot control -----------  \n\u003E \n\u003E         }  \n\u003E \n\u003E         textureURL = JSI/RasterPropMonitor/Library/Textures/bg01  \n\u003E \n\u003E     }\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I think the stock \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003Esas\u003C/abbr\u003E should be the default because not all players will have mechjeb installed.
