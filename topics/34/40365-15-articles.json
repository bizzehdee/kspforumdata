Make sure that if you plan on retroburning that you\u0027re using the antimatter reactors rather than the nuclear ones, since nuclear thrusters are pitifully weak.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother option is to warp so that the planet is in your trajectory when you come out(Don\u0027t even try to warp directly into the atmosphere), so that you\u0027re heading straight in to its atmosphere for an aerocapture, this is probably the most fun and the quickest method, although obviously you need an atmosphere and a ship that can handle aerobraking at that speed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally you can use gravity to slow your ship down, the method is simple, but time consuming. What you need to do after coming out of warp is to wait until you reach apoapsis (when your ship is at it\u0027s slowest) then warp back to where you started. This method can take weeks or months (in game obviously) but has the advantage in that it uses no fuel and doesn\u0027t carry the risks of aerobraking.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fractal_UK","CreatedById":61595,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-31T01:47:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022theSpeare\u0022 data-cite=\u0022theSpeare\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ECan someone please upload a simple tutorial for setting up a warp drive, warping to another planet and then setting up orbit?

First of all, warping to a planet on the opposite side of the star is a big no-no if you want to save on delta-v to enter orbit.
