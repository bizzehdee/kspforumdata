I Think they are part of CP:Field Research?\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E They are either from the [SCANsat](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/108097-1-02-Contract-Pack-SCANSat-v0-5-2-2015-01-22) or [SCANsat Lite](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/120127-1-0-4-Contract-Pack-ScanSat-Lite-1-1-1-%2828-06-15%29) contract packs.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E Here is the problem: The Kerbin contract is working correctly. Its at 50% and going up, but the Mun Contract is stuck at 1% and I dont know why. its orbit is correct (30x95km) and it has batts and solar panels so it has plenty of power. and it already did the Biome experiment.\n\u003E \u003E And Ideas how I can figure out why its not working?\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Anyway, wrong thread, but the first thing I\u0027d check is if what\u0027s reported on the contract matches what SCANsat reports (if you have the whole thing mapped but it says 1% on the contract, then it\u0027s a Contract Configurator issue). If they\u0027re in alignment, then it\u0027s a SCANsat issue. In that case you\u0027d be best off asking in the SCANsat thread, although the most obvious things to me would be out of power (you said it\u0027s not the case), orbital inclination (how polar is it?), and altitude (30 km and 95 km both seem really low to me, but it\u0027s been a while since I\u0027ve personally used it)."},{"CreatedByName":"BlackHat","CreatedById":138278,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T21:28:30Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The Field Research ones all start with a title of \u0022Field Research: \u0022.\n\u003E They are either from the [SCANsat](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/108097-1-02-Contract-Pack-SCANSat-v0-5-2-2015-01-22) or [SCANsat Lite](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/120127-1-0-4-Contract-Pack-ScanSat-Lite-1-1-1-%2828-06-15%29) contract packs.\n\u003E \n\u003E Anyway, wrong thread, but the first thing I\u0027d check is if what\u0027s reported on the contract matches what SCANsat reports (if you have the whole thing mapped but it says 1% on the contract, then it\u0027s a Contract Configurator issue).

(among other things) So when I got the missions I assumed it wanted the M700, Because the contract does not specify a part for the spacecraft. (That\u0027s the 3rd time I have had a mission wasted because I sent the wrong part into orbit because the contract did not specify which part it wanted, but DID want a specific part to complete the mission.)\n\nAs it turns out the Kerbin Sat does have DMagics Multispectal Imaging platform on it and its running, and the Mun Sat does not have one. So mystery solved.\n\n[On the other hand nothing in the contract indicated which part was needed, not does the part indicate it can used for the Biome Scan Contract]\n\nThanks for your assistance and pointers to aid my figuring out the problem."},{"CreatedByName":"nightingale","CreatedById":119307,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-05T04:57:05Z","Content":"New release, mostly a few minor bug fixes.
