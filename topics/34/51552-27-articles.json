(again).\u003Cp\u003EI have an array of satellites each equipped with four KR-14 dishes, one of which (on each satellite) is targeted at \u0022Active Vessel\u0022. The array is in constant contact with Mission Control, and each bird has sufficient power. I send a probe equipped with two KR-14\u0027s and fully powered on a Kerbin escape trajectory.... and I lose contact just past the Mun\u0027s orbit at a miniscule fraction of the KR-14\u0027s rated range. (Even with one of the two KR-14\u0027s set to target Kerbin.) Send a similar probe out past Minmus yields the same result and an interesting observation - it regains communication just before it crosses the Mun\u0027s orbit inbound.

With two dishes onboard of the ship, it would be safer to point to two of the Kerbin satellites individually, two that are about 180\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA appart from each other, to have one of them permanently in sight. Pointing to Kerbin points yout ship dish to the center of Kerbin planet, while your satellites are Km away from there, and a slight orbit inclination may make them not go though your dish cone. That said, once your ship goes far enough the dish coverage cone as narrow as it is, gets to be big enough to see the satellites around Kerbin and you get connection. I use the active vessel/Kerbin as you and usually I get connection about one quarter orbit away from Kerbin, when in trajectory to Eve or Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LORDPrometheus","CreatedById":61414,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-19T14:27:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBeep...

If you\u0027re a second off on your kerbostationary you\u0027ll be 10% off after 540 days, if I didn\u0027t muck up my math too badly.(looking at the numbers I probably did) however being 1s off on a ~420km orbit (~57\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BD minute orbit) will be noticeable in under two weeks as I\u0027ve discovered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you have fine control enabled for your RCS adjustments? Anyway, instead of RCS, use the flight computer and burn with your main engine. Doing 0.68% thrust for 0.01s burn time makes for some tiny adjustments in orbit. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E That burn addition to SASS is absolute grade-A 100% pure awesomesauce for matching orbital period/semimajor axis of satellite constellations. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, that spectacular crash with 1.2.0 isn\u0027t happening, I can\u0027t make it misbehave too badly so I shall update. Flight computer delays seemed to be a bit buggy when out of contact, but I might have just been out of power as well as out of contact so can\u0027t confirm. One issue I found was that a satellite around kerbin with a dish pointed at minmus, and a satellite in orbit of minmus with a dish pointed at kerbin, can\u0027t communicate to each other. If one of them then changes their target from the Celestial Body to the Satellite, it works just fine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E[edit]\u003C/strong\u003E Nevermind, I was being stupid, the satellite I was trying to catch wasn\u0027t actually at minmus, it was in Kerbin SOI right next to minmus at the same orbit, which is why aiming at Mun didn\u0027t link it despite it being in the cone. Next bit is still valid though:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso a dish at minmus pointed at kerbin, with a cone wider than the orbit of the Mun, doesn\u0027t catch objects inside Muns SOI despite them being in LOS and range of the dish, though this might be an engine limitation?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf those have been fixed after 1.2.0 or are WaI, nevermind.

Viewed from the ground, the target will drift back and forth and return home each day. With some inclination it\u0027ll drift in an ellipse. You\u0027d need quite large variations (hundreds of kilometers) to lose contact with the ground. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENow, how close do you have to be to the orbit period for a good grid? I\u0027m asking since using RCS for orbit corrections jump my numbers 5s per push or so and getting exactly 6hrs is very difficult with my current design. If you are one or two seconds off, how much is it going to bother you in a couple of years of game time?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 second per 6 hours is .004%. So you\u0027ll drift about 7 degrees per year (if I have that math right). After about 12 years you may no longer be in contact with KSC if the satellite was stationed directly above it. A bit worse, it depends on your error. If you have two adjoining satellites and they\u0027re each off by a second \u003Cem\u003Ein different directions\u003C/em\u003E, then you may lose coverage even faster - or wind up with both satellites in shadow for extended periods. So at the very least, get all of your error either fast or slow. If they\u0027re all off by a second in the same direction, then your array will remain intact but slowly rotate around the planet, which is much more acceptable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are some low-power RCS ports in some of the mods. AIES has a small 1/6th power one. A single linear RCS pusher is also handy for this, though you\u0027ll need to rotate the craft for direction. You can also use an ion drive for this, which is quite low power. If you use MJ, it has a handy feature under the \u0027Utilities\u0027 panel to limit throttle. Limit it to 1% and you can get thrust down to .005 which is much lower than you can usually get with RCS. You can get a little lower with a mod ion engine. Roemi-Lemdum Atomics has a .25 thrust mini ion engine which is handy for this. I can usually get my orbits within .1s. Kerbal Engineer Redux will give you orbital periods to .1s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnd a second question. I see that dishes have a cone variant. Does that mean that the dish has to orient itself with the target so that it works? When you choose a target is it done automatically, or do you have to point the sat to the correct location?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe dish doesn\u0027t need to orient, but it does need to be given a target. It does this automatically, and if the antenna is physically pointed away from the target, it still works fine. The cone only really matters (from what I can see) when you point it at a body, rather than a spacecraft. If you are around Duna and select Kerbin as your target, the narrowest cone dishes won\u0027t be wide enough to paint your geosync array. In fact, it might fire right between two of your sats and if KCS is on the other side of the planet, you\u0027ll lose connection. So there\u0027s a tradeoff between distance and cone angle. A long range, narrow dish used at short range will target individual satellites fine (until they orbit behind the planet), but will probably miss most or all of your array if you point it at the planet unless you have a low altitude array.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWithin the Kerbin system, you want a nice wide angle because your geosync array will be dozens of degrees wide from Mun, and maybe 10deg from Minmus. Personally, I think the angles set by RT2 are a bit too narrow for the long range dishes. I can\u0027t imagine designing a dish for Jool that couldn\u0027t cover the angle of a geosync network (no need for more, though) and the current settings are just a bit shy for that. They\u0027ll definitely fire through a 4 sat network from Dres.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
