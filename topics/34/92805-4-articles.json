Having to wait \u003Cem\u003EX\u003C/em\u003E days between payments seems reasonable. However, time limits may not be quite right. We\u0027re looking at a situation where players go from first launch to multiple Mun/Minmus missions in a few days. Perhaps any delay should be built around getting \u003Cem\u003EY\u003C/em\u003E science before triggering the payout. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d love to see it tied to each mission, where you don\u0027t get the payout until you\u0027ve completed the mission. The problem with that is everyone\u0027s definition of \u0022mission\u0022 is different, and automatically detecting the end of a mission would be problematic. The best I can think of right now is triggering the payout when the vessel/Kerbal that generated the science is recovered. The issue with that is things like bases and stations that aren\u0027t meant to be recovered, or probes that don\u0027t return.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the best solution at this point is to leave it as-is, unless there\u0027s some way to work around those problems. If you wish to add a time delayed \u0022summary\u0022, I think making it no more than a day between payouts might be best.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Clythoris","CreatedById":116254,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T19:53:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI really like this mod.
