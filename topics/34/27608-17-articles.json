But on the other side of the coin, the DG-800 Glider, has LONG shallow wings that generate a GREAT deal of lift and have very little actual drag. But the Boeing 747, has big deep long wings that generate a great deal of lift, at a decent speed, but would fly off at supersonic speeds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat craft is 85T, one of my other version was almost 200....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is one of my SSTO\u0027s that I wanted to replace the wings on...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/u1KitL6.png\u0022 alt=\u0022u1KitL6.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-30T02:17:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Donziboy2\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Donziboy2\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat craft is 85T, one of my other version was almost 200....\u003Cp\u003EThis is one of my SSTO\u0027s that I wanted to replace the wings on...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is one of my heavy lift SSTOs, SP-406.
