I vaguely remember some numerical analysis from uni. I rather liked it at the time.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI think I see where the slip appears. I wonder if it might be possible to correct the slip though. Yes the simulation is poor, which results in the slip. But would it not be possible to reduce the slip? The idea would be something like this. Initially no slip. Simulation takes place. If no slip then no reduction in slip. If slip is less than x then set slip to zero. If slip is greater than x let slip remain unchanged. The thought would be that unless we have significant slip set the slip back to zero. My thought is that once slip begins then it rapidly increases. If we set x to be a reasonable value we might be able to make sure we retain full control despite the simulation \u003C/span\u003Etelling us that slip has happened. This might give the impression that we have more grip in that slip only occurs if for example we yank the steering-wheel. Does this make sense? More importantly might it provide a solution to the \u0027tires/tracks are not grippy enough\u0027 problem? It is simple and avoids the need to manipulate the simulation itself or increase the frequency at which the simulation runs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlthough my suggestion would dampen the slip, I do not mean to dampen the simulation in the sense that I do not mean to change the spring/mass/dampener model. Just manipulate when we accept that slip occurs.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe result would seem like a mockery of all the good work done with physics simulation. What is important though is what appears to be happening in game from the players point of view when trying to move and control a craft with wheels/tracks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-10-10T03:58:13Z\u0022 title=\u002210/10/2018 03:58  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 10, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Apaseall\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-10-10T05:30:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/176515-apaseall/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022176515\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/176515-apaseall/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Apaseall\u003C/a\u003E \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0 No worries, I\u0027m always up for a discussion on ways to fix some of the areas the simulation is lacking.\u003C/span\u003E\u00A0 Your approach would more than likely work if I had access to the accumulated physics forces for a frame, and could manipulate them prior to them being applied to the rigid body(ies).\u00A0 Notably, right now, I can\u0027t simply \u0027set slip to zero\u0027 -- I have no knowledge of how much \u0027force\u0027 it will take to accomplish that, nor if it would even have the desired outcome once Unity\u0027s unreliable joint system gets involved..\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe relevant information that is available at the simulation are:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nCurrent position, surface normal/tangent, and world velocity of the wheel collider hit position -- the contact patch\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nCurrent/previous spring (and damper) output forces, calculated from wheel hit\u00A0 --\u00A0 this becomes the \u0027down-force\u0027 used in friction.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIndependent X and Z slip ratios, calculated from world velocity and wheel rpm\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nInput states for motor-torque and brake-torque\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOther info under control of the simulation, like wheel rpm, wheel radius, wheel mass, spring coeff and damper ratio, friction curve, tire friction coeff (always 1.0, but available...), surface friction coeff(always 1.0, but available..), a few other sundry config settings...\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only output that should realistically be done is to apply a force to the rigidbody for the suspension and friction forces.\u00A0 I already cheat a bit and also apply a \u0027holding\u0027 force to prevent the slow sliding movements that would otherwise occur on hills (basically an implementation of static friction).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe simulation is purely reactive; as the wheel collider is forced downward by gravity, the simulated spring reacts by outputting more upward force, this spring value is also used to drive the friction simulation (down-force, carried weight, etc).\u00A0 This is why \u0027zero length\u0027 suspension does not work -- if there is no spring compression, there is no \u0027down-force\u0027 in the simulation, and nothing to derive friction from.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt currently has no knowledge of total vessel mass, number of wheels or arrangement, or really anything outside of the single wheel collider -- they each operate as an independent entity.

I hope you do or did not take offense by my suggestion that whilst being pure is wonderful, being able to use a wheel in game is more enjoyable. Yes I know if I took the time to sit down and look at speeds/masses involved I would totally agree with the realism. But I am talking about this being a game and enjoying being able to put wheels on something. Then drive it away without it spinning out of control at a whiff of turn. One is realistic, the other is playing a game for fun. I do enjoy the realism and challenges of KSP. It is one of the things that keeps me coming back for more. But if there is a possibility of a little blurring between realism and game play, in order to make things a little easier, I am afraid I will take a little less realism for more fun, over realism and hours of tweaking, everyday.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThus I keep suggesting ways of increasing grip.
