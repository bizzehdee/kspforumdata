The combination delivered 542 s specific impulse in a vacuum, equivalent to an exhaust velocity of 5320 m/s. The impracticality of this chemistry highlights why exotic propellants are not actually used: to make all three components liquids, the hydrogen must be kept below -252\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C (just 21 K) and the lithium must be kept above 180\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C (453 K). Lithium and fluorine are both extremely corrosive, lithium ignites on contact with air, fluorine ignites on contact with most fuels, including hydrogen. Fluorine and the hydrogen fluoride (HF) in the exhaust are very toxic, which makes working around the launch pad difficult, damages the environment, and makes getting a launch license that much more difficult. The rocket exhaust is also ionized, which would interfere with radio communication with the rocket. Finally, both lithium and fluorine are expensive and rare, enough to actually matter. This combination has therefore never flown.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dimovski","CreatedById":53976,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-17T12:26:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI know, but LF2/LH2 is much more reasonable then this one,really.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cardajowol","CreatedById":71101,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-17T13:46:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m having an issue with the mod, I\u0027ve reinstalled the new mod like 2-3 times now and it keeps saying that all the tanks only have options for Oxidizers and LF and 2 lots of LF/LH2 it won\u0027t show the options for LF and LOX...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ialdabaoth","CreatedById":57270,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-17T14:38:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022cardajowol\u0022 data-cite=\u0022cardajowol\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m having an issue with the mod, I\u0027ve reinstalled the new mod like 2-3 times now and it keeps saying that all the tanks only have options for Oxidizers and LF and 2 lots of LF/LH2 it won\u0027t show the options for LF and LOX...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGah, ok...
