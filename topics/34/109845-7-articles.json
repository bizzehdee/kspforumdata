I\u0027m not sure, but it may be caused either by floating point precision problems, or by the \u0022clip planes\u0022 of the main camera. I believe it\u0027s the last one, as you can see planets from far away (possibly more than a million kilometers), the \u0022far clipping plane\u0022 is really huge. As far as i know, it causes issues with lighting, and shaking.

As you can see, shadows mess up. In KSP shadows are not really rendered far away, you can\u0027t actually see shadows from 200 meters or so, that\u0027s why shadows are not shaking. \nI don\u0027t have an idea why lights are rendered that far at first, but who knows.\n\nIt may also be Krakensbane changing your location before/after the actual rendering happens, messing stuff up.\n\nIt may be interesting to disable lights during the frame Krakensbane fixes stuff, will make a little test to see if that fixes anything ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nCheers!"},{"CreatedByName":"Svm420","CreatedById":136047,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-19T21:17:14Z","Content":"Did you ever figure out compatibility with Realfuel?
