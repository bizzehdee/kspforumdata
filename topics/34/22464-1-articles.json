I\u0027ve been running these for quite some time inspired by wave bounce sounding rockets; recently I noticed a lot of folks requesting smaller parts with less animation (ie: for folks like me with crappy computers, KSP can be quite a memory muncher!) and realized I should probably share these recycled bits and pieces. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EISA MapSat is an essential to know wtf you are, and MechJeb, well, let\u0027s face it, 90% of players would have rage quit KSP without it, these two are plugins I and most folks cannot live without. Props go to the creators of those mods, and NovaSilisko for the sat pack from whence the remapped old parts came (with minor collision node changes, actually, major, as I desperately wanted realism for my space station and have undiagnosed obsessive compulsive disorder).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have tweaked the impact tolerance for use on DEMV rovers, which are notorious for spontaneous inexplicable peripheral destroying barrel rolls. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDepending on the outcome of replies to the following note, I may be developing additional peripherals and reimaginings of existing plugins, remaps, and minor mods that don\u0027t require messing with nodes.

I haven\u0027t had to map a planet for a while, in the interim it appears that I can no longer map using the antenna for ISA, so it\u0027s currently just a geolocation device. I don\u0027t mind this as it is far more realistic (besides wave bounce mapping) but have contacted the mod to see if we can work something out. At present his plugin actually uses the CODE to animate rather than the animation mesh. This means that when using something without the animated pivots it breaks the entire code and the mapsat plugin just eats a dick and dies. :\u0027(\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maxpanic","CreatedById":3930,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-19T07:09:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEr, OK, what exactly is this mod?
