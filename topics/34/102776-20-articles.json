In our solar system planet rings have \u0022shepherd\u0022 satellites which orbit near the inner or outer edges of rings or within gaps in the rings. \n\u003E \n\u003E I am also waiting for the other stuff you are working on.\n\nI want a few more tbh, I was thinking of doing a small sub-mod for NH with just asteroids across the system to tie up all the loose parts like ring systems etc.....but I\u0027m pretty hesitant of adding more planets. This mod is already pretty RAM hungry! What i was hoping was that other planet packs can fill the gaps with NH, once the new packs come out compatibility patches are pretty easy to make so they will be available in the OP\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Are there any dmagic sciencedefs for this mod?\n\nunfortunately no...I\u0027ve had enough trouble with my own science defs, writers block is a pain in the ass!

Additionally, despite the sun being overhead, the entire area was bathed in darkness.
