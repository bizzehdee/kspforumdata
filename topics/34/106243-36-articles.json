KSP 1.4.4 and IFS 3.6.1\n\nAnother issue I encountered with IFS was some kind of problem with the texture switcher on the liquid fuel tanks. I wanted liquid hydrogen tanks set up radially but every time I would go to launch (and sometimes when I loaded them in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E) they would be in this weird state where they were configured for liquid hydrogen but also held fusion pellets. The fusion pellets texture was in use but everything about the craft file and in the tweakables menu said liquid hydrogen. Main problem was that the craft would be extremely heavy and expensive. Had to avoid using radial symmetry (seemed to only happen to one tank in each 2R set). I also saved and loaded the design a few times to make sure it wasn\u0027t switching anymore but I\u0027m not positive this was important.\n\nUpdate:\n\nIn looking at the code, the exception is caught at line 563 of InterstellarFuelSwitch.cs within PreviousTankSetupEvent. Since the only methods called in the try block are previousTankSetupEvent and AssignResourcesToPart, AssignResourcesToPart has its own exception handling, this exception is caused by an infinite recursion, i.e. \n\n    if (!_modularTankList[selectedTankSetup].hasTech)\n        previousTankSetupEvent();\n\nWill always execute.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-07-25T14:53:13Z\u0022 title=\u002207/25/2018 02:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 25, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by whitespacekilla**"},{"CreatedByName":"whitespacekilla","CreatedById":190042,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-07-25T18:45:47Z","Content":"[@FreeThinker](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/117389-freethinker/) before you dig too deep into my \u0060previousTankSetupEvent\u0060 bug, I did a little more experimentation and this problem probably only occurs when the tanks are used on a craft that is launched outside of the FlightScene (i.e. KSTS or RoutineMissionManager). I think it revolves around the HasTech code going down a different pathway when not in FlightScene so that property doesn\u0027t get set correctly and the infinite recursion results. This is likely a problem/solution of interest to only a small number of users so I will see if I can get a PR together for solving it rather than relying on your time (which might be better spent helping a wider audience with fixes) to do so.\n\nOne item of interest here is that the logging (and on first glance, the code) seems to still show that my tech progress is being interpreted correctly, just through the config node/save file path instead of the ResearchAndDevelopment.Instace path. I\u0027ll have to step through the code to figure that out and doubt I\u0027ll be able to set this up until this weekend.\n\nIn any event, I\u0027ll shoot at a minimum to make it so that \u0060previousTankSetupEvent\u0060 fails gracefully instead of SO\u0027ing and hopefully get all of it working so that these parts can launch outside of FlightScene in the PR.\n\nI might also look at the FusionPellets issue but I\u0027m at a loss for where to start here.
