Please be reminded that it is against the KSP EULA and Forum Rules to distribute the original content contained which is contained in the \u0027/KSP_Data/*.assets\u0027 files - this does not apply to Parts, so anything from the \u0027\\GameData\\Parts\\\u0027 folder can be publicly shared, like Parts and GUI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo to get started, you need to find the original name of the texture you are wanting to modify. To do so, open the \u0027UniverseReplacer.cfg\u0027 file located in \u0027GameData\\UniverseReplacer\\Plugins\\PluginData\\UniverseReplacer\u0027, this file holds aliases for the original texture names. The names on the left side of the equals(=) symbol are the original ones you are looking for. You have two places to look in to find the texture. Names without a directory like \u0027GalaxyTex_NegativeX\u0027 are located inside the \u0027/KSP_Data/*.assets\u0027 files, and textures with like \u0027Squad/Parts/Command/mk1pod/model000\u0027 are found in the \u0027/GameData/\u0027 folder relative to their name.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe textures found inside the .assets folder are \u0027.tex\u0027 files which must first be extracted and converted into a usable format.

The tool is pretty self explanatory, open the .assets file, sort by name and find the .tex file, then right click on it and hit \u0027Extract this File\u0027 - make sure \u0027Convert TEX to DDS\u0027 is checked. The extracted file will then be located in a sub folder named like the .assets file, for example \u0027UnityAssetsExplorer-1.2/sharedassets0/file.dds (you can ignore the .tex file that is extracts with it). If you need a DDS importer plugin for Photoshop, get it \u003Ca href=\u0022https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-texture-tools-adobe-photoshop\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E. Most of the textures are located in the files sharedassets10, then sharedassets2 and sharedassets0.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the Part textures, they are in a .MBM format. There is a KSP wiki guide on how to convert these \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Editing_MBM_Textures\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E. The \u0027Editing Textures as .RAW Images\u0027 is what worked best for me, Photoshop will \u0027guess\u0027 correct most of the time, I\u0027ve only had trouble with NormalMap texures which required me manually enter values. Normally halving the guessed resolution down to the DiffuseMap resolution, using a channel count of 2 and depth of 16 bits with the byte order IBM PC does the trick. This will give you a 2 channel alpha image which is of course not what you want - just manually create a new normal file and copy the channel images over to the RGB and ALPHA channels.
