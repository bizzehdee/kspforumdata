It\u0027s mostly a practice of continuity by now I guess because of the historical launch vehicles. Many are named after astronomical objects like Saturn, Centaur, Jupiter (conceptial LV), Ares (conceptial LV), Orion etc. But mostly it\u0027s sort of a speciality of the US space program. In the Russian or Japanese barely anything is named after mythological concepts. Ares made sense because it\u0027s the Greek equivalent of Mars, the Roman God of war and also the planet which was the very goal of of the now gone constellation program. Also it\u0027s Altair lunar lander which means eagle, a reference to the Apollo 11 lander and also a star of the Aquila constellation (which also means eagle).
