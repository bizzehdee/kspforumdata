You can make a perfectly flyable aircraft with (forgive my description for lack of the names) the first small rectangular wing connector, the first small triangular wing connector, and the smallest control surface (elevon 4?) as the wing assembly. As long as we get those in the first Wing tech node he could leave the rest of the wings and control surfaces for the following tiers, lest he run out parts before he runs out of nodes.  \n\nLong-winded?
