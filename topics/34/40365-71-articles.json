Considering that a planet is a wole lot of a space to check, could you make it a bit easier for us? For example create a splotch of several purple tiles that shows up in the scan, but only single random one will contain Mystery data. This way we would at least know where to look, though it will take a while to check every tile \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NeoAcario","CreatedById":24645,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-13T09:13:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Scotius\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Scotius\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHey, that sounds and looks very cool \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E I hope Fractal will incorporate it into KSPI - of course if you have nothing against it?
