I uninstalled the mod, got my rescue ship close enough to get within physics range. Quicksaved, exited, reinstalled the mod, and loaded the quicksave. Now the Kerbal is in the seat and you can gap him. After rescuing, i suggest uninstalling the mod, until the bug is sorted ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"offtheball","CreatedById":154734,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-30T10:45:53Z","Content":"Ahh, that makes so much sense.

Look, I\u0027m a developer, and I know that bugs happen. They\u0027re no one\u0027s fault, and sometimes they are legitimately actually features. In calling this a bug, I don\u0027t mean to cast blame on this mod or the developer at all.\n\nThe fact is, though, it breaks rescues. The issue isn\u0027t that kerbals get stranded in command seats.

How could this have possibly been the result of a near fatal mission failure?\n\nThe issue is that rescuing those kerbals seems to be impossible. Every time I tried, focus would switch to the stranded vessel when I got 2.2km out. The stranded vessel would be rotating rapidly. I found the stranded vessel on a gentle yet still deadly suborbital trajectory, with a periapsis of \u002B/- 25km. The rescuing vessel, most of the time, lost about 1800m/s of orbital velocity and was falling very steeply through the atmosphere. A couple of times it did maintain its trajectory (which, yes, was technically suborbital at the time of rendezvous), but trying to EVA across 2km while falling back into the atmosphere turns out to not be all that fun.\n\nThis is a bug. I was pretty excited to use this mod, but it can\u0027t coexist with rescue missions. If you turn those off, or you\u0027re not playing career mode, this won\u0027t be an issue, but if your game allows for rescues missions, this mod will break that. I don\u0027t know what it would take to fix, and if the developer doesn\u0027t have the time or energy, that\u0027s totally fine. This is still useful for many people, and any mod developer who makes something useful deserves praise from the community, but no one is helped if we pretend that bugs don\u0027t exist.

The issue here is his back is up against the wall as I see it, since it\u0027s stock behavior that does this, and is a bit outside of the scope of the mod to fix (in it\u0027s *present* state).\n\nThe \u0022solution\u0022 would probably require a complete rewrite. I don\u0027t know the nature of the plugin aspect of this mod (I believe it\u0027s a camera/kerbal refresh), but when I tried duplicating this mod, as soon as I added crew capacity to the command seat, it qualified for rescue missions. But if a part doesn\u0027t have crew capacity, then you can\u0027t add kerbals to them in the editor. A catch 22. It would be nice if there were a way for there to be a filter for rescue missions (since Kerbal Seats are a special module, you would think it would be easy to hit), but I seem to remember hearing it\u0027s not possible at present. Really though, this is something [@seanmcdougall](%7B___base_url___%7D/index.php?/profile/143691-seanmcdougall/) should be answering.\n\nAn alternative \u0022solution\u0022 is to try out the [Kerbal Academy](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/140739-112-contract-pack-kerbal-academy/#comment-2606257) contract pack, which actually disables rescue missions entirely, and provides a different contract means to get new recruits.\n\nBest I can come up with, (and sorry if I came across as cantankerous.![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif \u0022:P\u0022))\n\nCheers."},{"CreatedByName":"Jarin","CreatedById":71395,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-08T17:43:07Z","Content":"I\u0027m having a couple odd issues I\u0027m trying to troubleshoot... anyone know if TC can be safely uninstalled while command chairs are currently in use somewhere?

That\u0027s how I got Arcee Kerman home: rendezvous without the mod, reinstall it, and she was there, fully controllable, alive and well.\n\nI tried to do a whole bunch of save hacking to get Arcee into her seat without the mod, basing her on Jebediah sitting on the launchpad, but in the end, the closest I got was a kind of zombie kerbal: she was there, I could get her out of the seat, control her, get her to the rescue pod, but once I recovered her the game thought she was dead.\n\nI think if your seats are vacant, you can do it.
