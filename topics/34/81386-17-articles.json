I think you misplaced a decimal point somewhere. I checked the rest of the tanks to be sure, and they all look fine (identical or close to stock).

All of those spacecraft used monopropellant engines, because the extremely small form factor you can achieve. If you give monoprop engines stats that make them equal to LFO engines, then the same vessel with monoprop engines will always be strictly \u0022better\u0022 (because smaller). Except for 2.5m, where it all breaks down, because stock KSP couldn\u0027t be consistent if its life dependend on it or something \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the same time, check out the KER stats of the vessels above. Exhibit 2 is fairly well valanced, while exhibit 1 clearly has the monoprop engine with an overall advantage (doubled TWR for just 90 funds and 53 kg extra) in addition to the smaller size. The Cirrus really is extremely good. Probably too good. I know you designed these to be vacuum engines, but I think their Isp is too high across the board. No stock monopropellant engine (RCS or not) has anywhere near 300s, while most of yours are significantly above. I\u0027m gonna toy a bit with Test 4 and see what happens if I bump Isp down a bit. And what else can be done to keep them relevant... stock has less \u0022holes\u0022 in its lineup nowadays.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso interesting to see that the monoprop options always match price or get minimally more expensive than their LFO counterparts. This is despite monoprop engines themselves being cheaper... the cost is primarily coming from the large amount of fuel stuffed into those tiny tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERE: the Puffin... a lot of why it wasn\u0027t competitive came down to the fact that it simply didn\u0027t offer enough dV to make it worth paying the price for another decoupler. Even tiny probes often got less than 200m/s for me whenever I tried to use the Puffin. The SMAC actually suffers from a similar problem. Both of these upper stage motors have significantly worse dry mass/fuel mass rations, and significantly worse part cost/fuel cost ratios... and their TWR is very high. In other words, they carry too little fuel for their thrust, mass, and price.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/44754370/rlasolids1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022rlasolids1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the Puffin\u0027s dry cost went down from 38 to 30 and if it carried 0.25t of fuel instead of 0.15t, for instance, its TWR would drop from 3.94 to 2.71, its total cost would stay the same, its dry/fuel ratio would improve from 0.47 to 0.28, and its cost/fuelcost ratio would improve from 3.17 to 1.50. That looks much closer to the stock options and would significantly boost its dV. That might help make it relevant. The SMAC could perhaps use similar tweaks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Boostertrons meanwhile struggle to compete with the Hammer. The stock option has higher TWR, less thrust loss at liftoff, higher overall Isp, a better mass ratio, and better price/performance. Considering the Hammer unlocks in the very first node players research in career mode, that pretty much makes the Boostertrons a subpar option regardless of where they are placed in the tech tree. I mean sure, they\u0027re the \u003Cem\u003Eonly\u003C/em\u003E solid option in size 0, so that\u0027s a niche of sorts, but they\u0027re no good as strap-on boosters for 1.25m stacks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd while I\u0027m at it, some preliminary comments towards Test 4:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The placement of the Spinnaker breaks stock career mode progression, offering a gimbal before the Swivel comes in. I\u0027d start a node later with the whole size 0 liquid fuel progression. Maybe even with the entire size 0 progression. While I suppose the Boostertron I doesn\u0027t hurt where it\u0027s placed, it doesn\u0027t really have a use there. Basic Rocketry is generally unlocked without launching a vessel (because of the World First contract that pays you 10 science for a crew report from the pad without launching), and the player\u0027s actual first launch will be done with a single Flea or Hammer (or a multistage vehicle combining the two to get over 18km into the flying high zone). Which generally yields enough science to unlock the next tier already, since you already have both goo canisters and materials bays (which also unlock before the first launch) to take along for that flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The \u0022Protective Rocket Nosecone Mk1\u0022 should probably come a node later as well, together with the other nosecones. Of course, there\u0027s also the stock size 0 nosecone there. Which is actually pretty good, all in all. Do you even need to ship your own nosecone anymore? Might be worth saving the RAM and axing this one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Similarly: your TR-1V stack decoupler is a carbon copy of stock\u0027s TR-2V in every respect. I can see why you\u0027d want a size 0 decoupler much earlier, what with your size 0 parts coming much earlier than stock\u0027s, but wouldn\u0027t it be better to just MM-config the stock decoupler to a lower tech node instead of adding a redundant part?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Same goes for your carbon copy of the stock linear RCS port. Especially since you have \u003Cem\u003Ea third\u003C/em\u003E linear RCS port in the RM-50 Micro, and it even comes in the same node. I\u0027m not sure I\u0027d ever use either of those parts, honestly; I never used any linear RCS in my entire KSP career since 2013. Others might differ, of course, but all the same... if you want a linear RCS in that node, why not move the stock one? Also, at the point that node is researched, you don\u0027t have any RCS tanks - those unlock only one tier later, both inline and radial. So the only thing that has RCS is manned cockpits. Which have no use for a probe sized linear RCS, and very limited use for linear RCS in general. You might want to use the monopropellant for orbital maneuvering (docking ports don\u0027t unlock until the next tier), but the linear ports have big troubles being oriented in the required direction on the slanted cockpit surfaces. The round linear ports barely work out if you mount them near the nose and point them forward with the rotation tool; the blocky RM-50 however just never looks good regardless of how you mount and rotate it. Recommendation: move the RM-50 into the same node with all the other RCS thrusters. Axe your own linear port.

Exhibit 2 is fairly well valanced, while exhibit 1 clearly has the monoprop engine with an overall advantage (doubled TWR for just 90 funds and 53 kg extra) in addition to the smaller size. The Cirrus really is extremely good. Probably too good. I know you designed these to be vacuum engines, but I think their Isp is too high across the board. No stock monopropellant engine (RCS or not) has anywhere near 300s, while most of yours are significantly above. I\u0027m gonna toy a bit with Test 4 and see what happens if I bump Isp down a bit.

Even tiny probes often got less than 200m/s for me whenever I tried to use the Puffin. The SMAC actually suffers from a similar problem. Both of these upper stage motors have significantly worse dry mass/fuel mass rations, and significantly worse part cost/fuel cost ratios... and their TWR is very high. In other words, they carry too little fuel for their thrust, mass, and price.\u003Cp\u003EIf the Puffin\u0027s dry cost went down from 38 to 30 and if it carried 0.25t of fuel instead of 0.15t, for instance, its TWR would drop from 3.94 to 2.71, its total cost would stay the same, its dry/fuel ratio would improve from 0.47 to 0.28, and its cost/fuelcost ratio would improve from 3.17 to 1.50. That looks much closer to the stock options and would significantly boost its dV. That might help make it relevant. The SMAC could perhaps use similar tweaks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Puffin I never saw anyone actually use, at all, ever. Cutting it since it wasn\u0027t useful in that size range is no big deal really, and so far no one seems to mind. I\u0027m not terribly surprised since having to account for a solid-rocket burn later in a launch doesn\u0027t seem like something many players would enjoy doing. The SMAC does suffer the same problem but at least it doesn\u0027t have to compete with quite so many engines. I\u0027ll go over it again, particularly the dry cost/mass and how much it contains, not exactly anything in stock KSP I can use as a guideline for those anyway. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Streetwind\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Streetwind\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe Boostertrons meanwhile struggle to compete with the Hammer. The stock option has higher TWR, less thrust loss at liftoff, higher overall Isp, a better mass ratio, and better price/performance. Considering the Hammer unlocks in the very first node players research in career mode, that pretty much makes the Boostertrons a subpar option regardless of where they are placed in the tech tree. I mean sure, they\u0027re the \u003Cem\u003Eonly\u003C/em\u003E solid option in size 0, so that\u0027s a niche of sorts, but they\u0027re no good as strap-on boosters for 1.25m stacks.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah I went in a bit of a different direction with those three compared to the way the stock SRBs scale. The longer one is quite possibly the only viable one since it\u0027s thrust has scaled up linearly with the amount of fuel it has, rather than the way the 1.25m boosters do. The point of all the boosters really is to provide a bonus big of thrust at the start of a launch for cheap, and the Boostertron III I feel does that pretty well. The Spinnaker on a fuel tank is an awful lot more efficient, but it only has 37-40 thrust, that\u0027s about the same as the short Boostertron, and the long one has 3 times that for a lot less cost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI agree their ISPs can do with touching up, and if the short one isn\u0027t useful it\u0027s no problem to cut it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Streetwind\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Streetwind\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe placement of the Spinnaker breaks stock career mode progression, offering a gimbal before the Swivel comes in.

While I suppose the Boostertron I doesn\u0027t hurt where it\u0027s placed, it doesn\u0027t really have a use there. Basic Rocketry is generally unlocked without launching a vessel (because of the World First contract that pays you 10 science for a crew report from the pad without launching), and the player\u0027s actual first launch will be done with a single Flea or Hammer (or a multistage vehicle combining the two to get over 18km into the flying high zone).

Others might differ, of course, but all the same... if you want a linear RCS in that node, why not move the stock one? Also, at the point that node is researched, you don\u0027t have any RCS tanks - those unlock only one tier later, both inline and radial. So the only thing that has RCS is manned cockpits.

Eclipse powered by 1x OX-9 (already price-adjusted). Umbra powered by 1x OX-9 and 2x OX-4. Tanks are FL-10R stock size 0 monoprop tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt first glance: yes, it is much cheaper not to use the Eclipse. But that\u0027s not the point. High performance engines are never price competitive. You choose them to get performance the other engines don\u0027t give you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, imagine you know you need roughly 4850 m/s dV to accomplish a mission. All three engines can accomplish this. But with a Cirrus, you need to mount 10 tanks. With an Eclipse, you need to mount only 3 tanks. With the Umbra you need to mount only a single one. This example \u0022equivalence point\u0022 has been marked green above. So, how much room does your launch vehicle have? Making a huge fairing costs money and adds mass. Also that stack of 10 tanks is going to be wobbly as all heck. And maybe you\u0027re physically constrained by other things, such as the length of the cargo hold of your SSTO spaceplane, and literally \u003Cem\u003Ecannot\u003C/em\u003E mount 10 tanks. Suddenly only the electric engines give you what you need and the Cirrus ceases to be an option. You pay the markup because that\u0027s the one thing that can get your mission done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimilarly, you\u0027ll notice how all of the engines run into serious diminishing returns at 8-10 tanks. This is normal; every engine has a dV limit (derived from the fuel/mass fraction of its tankage) that it can never pass, even with the entire observable universe\u0027s mass in fuel. And the more you approach this figure, the less each additional tank gives you. For the Cirrus at 330 Isp, that limit is roughly 6009 m/s. You will never reach that; in fact, due to the mass of the engine and its payload, you will never even get near 6000. The Eclipse meanwhile smiles as it almost hits 6200 m/s with just 5 small tanks. In this case, the Eclipse literally is the cheaper option of the two, because even a hundred million funds thrown at the Cirrus will ever match that dV. With 4 tanks and at 5609 m/s, the prices are already very close; the Eclipse costs 7035 with that, while the Cirrus takes 21 tanks (!) and costs 6035 to do 5608 m/s. Just 1000 funds difference. And now consider a 4.5 kN thrust Cirrus pushing 21 tanks versus a 6.6 kN Eclipse pushing 4 tanks. Which one is going to be more comfortable to fly? And is that comfort going to be worth those 1000 funds for you? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can play the same game with the Eclipse and the Umbra; the Eclipse will never pass 10470 m/s dV even with all the fuel in the world, but the Umbra can roughly match that with just 3 small tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd this discussion isn\u0027t just something that affects RLA, by the way. People have discussed this in stock KSP for forever. \u0022Why should I pay for a LV-N if a LV-909 gives similar dV at much less cost?\u0022 (This was especially relevant pre-1.0, where they even used the same fuelmix and the LV-909 had even higher Isp.) The answer is: you shouldn\u0027t, because this is clearly an application that doesn\u0027t need a LV-N. But keep adding fuel tanks to that ship, and very quickly the LV-N massively outpaces the LV-909 in dV. And make your mission more complicated and more demanding, and there will come a point where a LV-909 either simply cannot give you that dV, or takes so much fuel to do it that a LV-N is literally the cheaper and/or more comfortable option.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe bottomline is: high-Isp engines need high-dV missions to be worthwhile. This is somewhat unfortunate, because stock KSP\u0027s tiny solar system doesn\u0027t have much room for high dV missions. A lot of people run interplanetary missions on Skippers because when you only need 3000 m/s dV to go to Jool, why bother with slow and expensive nukes? But then someone plans a Grand Tour, or accepts a contract to redirect a class E asteroid, and suddenly it makes sense. Or somebody installs a system resize mod like KScale2 and suddenly things cost a lot more. So there are definitely niches for high Isp engines. Just don\u0027t ask them to compete on price with chemical engines in low dV missions - they never will \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-02T04:13:57Z\u0022 title=\u002208/02/2015 04:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starbuckminsterfullerton","CreatedById":117494,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-02T00:22:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECongrats on the latest build Hooj!

Also, at the point that node is researched, you don\u0027t have any RCS tanks - those unlock only one tier later, both inline and radial. So the only thing that has RCS is manned cockpits. Which have no use for a probe sized linear RCS, and very limited use for linear RCS in general. You might want to use the monopropellant for orbital maneuvering (docking ports don\u0027t unlock until the next tier), but the linear ports have big troubles being oriented in the required direction on the slanted cockpit surfaces. The round linear ports barely work out if you mount them near the nose and point them forward with the rotation tool; the blocky RM-50 however just never looks good regardless of how you mount and rotate it.

Then, it has too little liftoff thrust to compete with the Reliant as a booster rocket despite the higher on-paper TWR, because that only applies in a near-vacuum.

The linear aerospike has more lifoff thrust (196 vs. 168.8), more top-end thrust (245 vs. 200), and more top-end Isp (325 vs 320) for the same cost and the same weight, while also providing that crucial thrust vectoring. Its sea level Isp is a bit on the low side (260 vs 270), but the higher liftoff thrust lets it carry a small extra fuel tank while still maintaining higher TWR. And if you pair it with Reliants and crossfeed, that disadvantage is mitigated even more efficiently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(If you wanted to avoid replacing the Swivel, you need to remove the gimbal. That will render the linear aerospike essentially useless for rockets, since its TWR and sea level Isp are too low to compete with the Reliant as a launch booster, an application in which the higher top-end numbers never come to bear. But as mentioned before, spaceplanes have ample atmospheric control authority and a naturally flip-proof shape, they don\u0027t need thrust vectoring rockets. So it will remain useful there. Maybe bump the thrust to 250 to compensate for the loss of the gimbal.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Better idea. Increase the price to around 4000, much like the toroidal spike.
