You\u0027ll notice in the video that one of the first things the spider does is raise every other leg. It\u0027s also lowering the other ones the same amount to set the gait. (Kind of like setting the tire size) If I didn\u0027t do that the inner part of the leg would spin while everything else would remain motionless. This was done by making 2 IR groups with half of the inner hinges in one and the other in the other... but in such a way that they are staggered... like even numbered left legs and odd numbered right legs in one and the rest in the other. Then set the controls for the two groups so that they are the same buttons but opposite. like (9,0) and (0,9). This way you lower half while raising the other half. At the body and at the knee(?) are servos that spin the whole assembly at the same rate and direction. This gives the outer leg the appearance of walking rather than spinning like a wheel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second part is to break the servos down by left side and right side in the IR controls. For example, I set the left side ones to go \u0026lt; when Q is pressed and \u0026gt; when E is pressed and then on the right side the opposite. \u0026gt; for Q and \u0026lt; for E. This way all the servos turn the same amount all of the time. You\u0027ll later want to set an action group to center all of your servos before you start walking forwards after turning or vise versa... otherwise your spider is going to do the dieing cockroach because the left and right will be off sync. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo add a layer of control, I added a second hinge between the outer servo and the outer half of the leg. This allows me to tilt the outer leg up and down. (in the video you\u0027ll see me use this when the spider dips down and then back up prior to setting the gait.) This helps out A LOT.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo move forward, I simply made an action group to spin all the servos forward at once.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope this helps folks out and that you have as much fun with it as I did.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mughi","CreatedById":80867,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-04T03:49:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Boole\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Boole\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAhh, looks like I downloaded it off the Spaceport and not this thread, which would explain why it was an old version.
