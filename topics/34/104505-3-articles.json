During a normal exit EditorCameraExtension will rebind those to the values that were set before. But I\u0027m assuming the game crashed for you preventing exactly that. So in the next version I\u0027ll fix that by saving the binding into the settings file to recover from an unexpected shutdown.

This way it is easier for eyes (digits do not move from side to side).\n\n2) please **fix FPS limiter so it is still possible to use Physical Wrap when KSP is minimized.** Currently it sets physical time to ~100% when minimized, despite I\u0027ve set 4x Physical Wrap, and it doesn\u0027t matter what target FPS I set...\n\n3) option to disable FPS Limiter completely in game\n\n3) sincerely I much, much prefer **more compact UI,** say, like in MechJeb. Screen real estate is precious. As for toolbar - QuickGoTo mod is silver standard of how sub-toolbar might look like IME :-)4\n\nAlso I\u0027d like to know what **exactly** \u0022Use VSync\u0022 does.
