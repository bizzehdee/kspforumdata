And because its dark at the poles i had to use the scansat anomaly scanner to find it and i was only 3km off. Theres an antenna there so it should have something. i activated the spike but now what? theres no message and it doesnt point at anything. nothing changed from what i can tell after it did its thing. I dont have a relay around vessa so i cant remote control the plane to check the bay. i did find a \u0022disole3\u0022 signal a while ago but i dont know if its the next one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nalso the vessa signals go D92 D96 D10 so it appears to be a typo there. i found a D62 in a random crater on pequar that didnt say anything of note which should probably be D262. could do with a better placement too since it caused a lot of confusion roving from the equator up and suddenly having to double back a lot thinking its the actual target.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nhere is what i mean with about D62\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Pequarvisual1802x901.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022100.00\u0022 height=\u0022670\u0022 width=\u0022670\u0022 src=\u0022https://u.cubeupload.com/EnderiumSmith/Pequarvisual1802x901.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\noh and the new artifact has the same problem where its not actually in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-01-25T07:41:31Z\u0022 title=\u002201/25/2024 07:41  AM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Jan 25\u0022\u003EJanuary 25\u003C/time\u003E by EnderiumSmith\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geblag.Xelvari","CreatedById":232002,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-02-18T02:04:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo cool.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JuanitosGG","CreatedById":229203,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-03-09T17:55:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis looks amazing!!!\u00A0How have I not seen this mod before?
