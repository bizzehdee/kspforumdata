These daughters are assumed, collectively, to have a half-life of 9 hours so the power output will decay along that curve until 3 days have passed at which point the reactor will have totally shutdown.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt that point, you have new options, such as refueling the reactor! You have some nice big Hexcans full of fresh Uranium Hexaflouride, when you refuel, you will add this fresh load of new Uranium Hexaflouride to your reactors while the depleted Uranium Hexaflouride from your reactor will be added to the can. Thus, over time, you end up with cannisters full of nuclear waste products.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mUHoMYb.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022mUHoMYb.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vImV6Kq.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022vImV6Kq.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/25uoKDq.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002225uoKDq.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KadUPvE.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022KadUPvE.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RadHazard","CreatedById":80815,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-13T01:56:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s pretty neat.

I usually go through a bit of docking/modular power system acrobatics on long duration manned missions using multiple nuke reactors such that some of my reactors overheat on the way up, shut down, and then get turned on a later time as they are needed. I use this system to rotate a number of 3.75m nuke reactors on a Moho computer core station.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
