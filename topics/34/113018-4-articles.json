Kudos!\n\nThat said, there are a couple of things about it that bug me, so a little constructive criticism from me (sorry)!\n\n1. The reactors run on Ore. I understand why you want to make it stock-compatible, but the parts themselves can create ore, so it\u0027s not a limitation. The Community Resource Pack has a variety of nuclear fuels that could be used as an alternative, it might be worth doing an MM patch to change the fuel if it\u0027s installed, or just make it part of the pack, or use a fuel that is not quite as easy to make on-the-fly.\n2. Across Near Future, USI Reactors and (to a lesser extent) KSP-Intersteller Extended, the reactors have a (broadly) similar output that is higher than your alternatives. So there\u0027s nothing to stop somebody from powering all your goodies with a better reactor from a different pack. From a balance perspective, it might be worth upping the respective outputs and power requirements of your parts to make them more ... competitive?\n3. If I remember correctly (I\u0027m writing this after dropping the mod a week ago), there\u0027s no catchup processing on refocus. So leaving a station running and coming back to it after doing something else meant it hadn\u0027t produced or consumed anything. If I\u0027m wrong please ignore this, but if this is still the case, including this feature would be a big plus.\n\nI really did enjoy a brief play around with this mod. I like the idea of having refueling stations in important places, but not the grind of maintaining them, so I saw this mod as filling a niche for slow fuel regeneration at a high initial cost (and weight) setup; slow, stationary (orbital) resource accumulation. \n\nFor additional complexity, have you thought about making the dust accumulation gravity-dependent? Requiring the presence (or absence) of gravity to get efficient production? Also, if you\u0027re content with the current reactors requiring ore (which isn\u0027t unreasonable at all) it may be worth re-branding them as high-efficiency ore-burning generators. The game has Ore drills, ISRU, and fuel cells so it\u0027s not a leap to repackage this all into one part. \n\nHope you found some of that rambling helpful!"},{"CreatedByName":"Drelam","CreatedById":103798,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-17T14:45:09Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 19.2.2016 at 8:57 PM, Carbonjvd said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Just a quick update on the next update, very clever!

Now to answer your suggestions:\n\n1) I can see your point in wanting a more specialized fuel for reactors and other nuclear based parts. Those kinds of changes are a possibility for further expansion of the game, I\u0027ve looked into it since the beginning but to keep it stock compatible I left it as ore for the nuclear fuel substitute. So a possibilty for the future!\n\n2) They\u0027re less powerful? Well I can\u0027t have that now can I? In the next update or two I\u0027ll be amping it up!!\n\n3) The catch-up processing is one that I\u0027d like to fix but is eluding me. So once I figure it out, I\u0027ll be releasing the fix in the next update.\n\nMaking the dust collection to be gravity dependent is an interesting idea, though making plug-ins would be leap in modding for me. Renaming them? Eh maybe.\n\nThanks again for the feedback!\n\n-Carbonjvd\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-25T17:54:44Z\u0022 title=\u002203/25/2016 05:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 25, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Carbonjvd**"},{"CreatedByName":"Scientia1423","CreatedById":116562,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-27T13:39:32Z","Content":"Well I\u0027ve sailed across the seven seas of kerbin (with a plane) to find an updated version of the ion hybrid pack/futureKSP.
