Just add one or more command seats to your ship, assign crew as usual, and launch! Your Kerbal crew will automatically spawn and jump into their assigned seats.\n\n![zMPUluul.png](http://i.imgur.com/zMPUluul.png)\n\n![zxIt655l.png](http://i.imgur.com/zxIt655l.png)\n\n![CBPBJzXl.png](http://i.imgur.com/CBPBJzXl.png)\n\nDownloads\n\n- [CKAN](https://github.com/KSP-CKAN/CKAN)\n- [SpaceDock](http://spacedock.info/mod/585/Take%20Command)\n- [Curse](http://www.curse.com/ksp-mods/kerbal/230395-take-command)\n- [GitHub](https://github.com/seanmcdougall/TakeCommand/releases)\n\nSource\n\n- [GitHub](https://github.com/seanmcdougall/TakeCommand)\n- License: GPLv3\n\nSupport Requests\n\n- Please [read this page first](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/83212-how-to-get-support-read-first/).\n- If you\u0027re still experiencing a problem, [open a new issue on my GitHub site](https://github.com/seanmcdougall/TakeCommand/issues) and attach your debug log (output\\_log.txt or Player.log depending on your OS).\n\nCredits\n\n- TouhouTorpedo for giving me idea.

Normally I stick to stock parts, but I downloaded the Kerbonov and USI Exploration packs (and their dependencies) from CKAN to try them out with my mod. Initial tests were promising - I was able to crew the new seats from the VAB/SPH just like the stock seat without any immediate problems. However I did encounter some random lockups when trying to subsequently EVA a seated Kerbal from a seat. I\u0027ll have to do some more tests to figure out if it\u0027s actually a problem with my mod, one of the others I installed, or the stock game itself. \n\nIn the meantime, if you\u0027re feeling adventurous you can replace TakeCommand.cfg with this new config to make all command seats crewable (stock or otherwise):\n\n    @PART[*]:HAS[@MODULE[KerbalSeat]]{    CrewCapacity = 1    MODULE    {        name = TakeCommand        minimumCrew = 1    }}"},{"CreatedByName":"Uzric","CreatedById":102098,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T11:07:56Z","Content":"Actually, the [MM rule post](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55219-1-0-x-Module-Manager-2-6-3-%28May-4%29-Bonsai-Trimming-Kit-Edition?p=728591\u0026viewfull=1#post728591) says you should add a :FOR[TakeCommand] at the end (where the :FINAL was), instead of leaving it blank.\n\nThis is to ensure further :AFTER[TakeCommand] and :BEFORE[TakeCommand] work as intended with your own patches.\n\nGood mod, by the way.
