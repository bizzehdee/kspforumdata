(I\u0027m pretty new, so it\u0027s really the first time I\u0027m getting into kethane/resources). I downloaded your mod along with EvilC\u0027s EL mod/ore extension and already have built it to my own suiting. You made it so easy! I don\u0027t even know what language any of this is in, but it\u0027s easy to interpret and modify (at least cfg files). With your plugin and the commented modules included in EL we have everything needed to create whatever we want, and quickly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGet in there people! Make some cheesemium and fartonium! (or more real things if you prefer \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for everyone out there, I recommend trying to edit it yourself. Leave the mod devs to use their time on more valuable things (like creating this wicked plugin, or eating some food). If you mess something up, try and macguyver it a bit - if it gets worse and you fail, then start over with a fresh dl of the mod. It won\u0027t be long until you\u0027re a resource making master.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far I edited the resources to use more realistic values (again easy thanks to comments in code). Quickly took some parts (some stock/some modded) and made things for EL. I removed all the ore modules from the launchpad which is easy with the comments (thanks EvilC!) and used them on other parts. For ore detector I just used the stock comm dish, for drill I used an enlarged quantum strut with no strut functionality, then I made an ore refinery and \u0027rocketparts workshop\u0027 out of big fuel tanks from KW rocketry. Also moved all kethane/resource/EL parts to science category as I have a lot of parts in all the other categories. All in all, took me like an hour with a few loads to test - never hit an issue once, all worked like a charm as and expected. Now I have two separate detectors on my Mun satelitte (and need both) to detect ore and kethane!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, just wanted to show how easy it is for others and thank Majiir (and EvilC) for their awesome work. I can only begin to imagine the possibilities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKris\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S. @Majiir, I love that you have separate maps for each resource to toggle between. My only small suggestion is that it might be easier when you have more resources if they each had a separate window. This allows you to compare visually to see where \u0027hotspots\u0027 are of deposit crossovers. (Or maybe there is a better way I don\u0027t know of yet!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.P.S. I also have a quick question on the resource plugin Majiir. Is the size of the deposit (showing on the map) correlated to the quantity of resources in it? I see there are min and max resource counts and vertices, but unsure if the rest is random or not.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-18T10:34:16Z\u0022 title=\u002206/18/2013 10:34  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 18, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Krisism\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EA pps line; arn\u0026#039;t they great?\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Majiir","CreatedById":7550,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-18T10:43:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m glad you\u0027re enjoying it!
