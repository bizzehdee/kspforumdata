I\u0027m sure the weight distribution is nothing like the real rocket (it\u0027s six meters shorter, after all), but that isn\u0027t the issue -- it\u0027s stable without the fairing, but adding the fairing makes it horrifically unstable. I\u0027ve tested this in flight, too. With the fairing it flips pretty early in flight and there\u0027s not much I can do about it.
