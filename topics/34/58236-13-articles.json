Have you removed all reaction wheels (unless SpaceX actually uses them, but if so they probably have like 0.001 torque max)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Is ElectricCharge used as kJ, with EC rates in kW? (for example, a 3kWh battery, aka 10,800kJ battery, would be stored as maxAmount = 10800 EC, and a system that used 485W would have rate 0.485 EC)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. If SpaceX uses biprop RCS, you can add two ModuleRCS (hattip: stupid_chris) one set for each fuel, to replicate biprop RCS. If they use monoprop RCS, never mind. (Use correct Isp for both modules; use thrusterPower * volumePercent for each, where volumePercent = percent of total mixture by volume for that propellant). See my latest FASA.cfg for examples.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Do the part masses for F9 and F9H match what\u0027s been released? Do all parts of Dragon sum to the latest released dry mass for Dragon? (I ask because I notice for a lot of parts you\u0027re not touching mass, only rescaleFactor...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. I love reaction wheels even though they are terribly unrealistic. I\u0027ve been using them for myself but for a proper release they should definitely be removed so I\u0027ll do that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. The number 16800 for a battery appeared for the Dragon seven man capsule. All I could find was that the Dragon uses \u00224 redundant Li-po batteries\u0022 and that number sounded good so I left it. Sources have the solar panels listed as 5kW peak so I set charge rate at 2.5/sec (5 for the two panels combined) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.The Draco thrusters on the Dragon (different from Super Draco used primarily as a LES) are used for RCS. They use the same hypergolic fuel as the Super Dracos (MMH \u002B N2O4) however at the time I didn\u0027t know how to replace the traditional RCS with that. Should that just set that up as biprop then? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Yes, to the best of my knowledge and research. Though it can be a bit more challenging to find precise numbers on a rocket that hasn\u0027t even been built yet.

Used a pretty standard ascent profile like I sue on most of my other rockets. Started my turn around 120m/s, about a 5 degree pitch to start the indicator drifting.
