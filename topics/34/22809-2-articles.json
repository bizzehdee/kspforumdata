The method I use is, have my ship ready and in orbit around my starting planet before the alarm fires, and then try and depart as close to the optimum time as possible, it doesn\u0027t have to be exactly on the alarm, and in fact typically can\u0027t be as you need to leave the orbit in the right direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo your most efficient time to travel from Kerbin to Jool is when the alarm fires - you should get your ship into orbit ready to go and then try and leave as close to the time of the alarm to use the least fuel, and have the best chance of success in arriving at the position Jool will reach at the same time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor extra/background info...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo generate these optimum times in the KAC I have used two methods - \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003EFormula - based on circular orbits - watches the angel between the planets and tells you when that best angle occurs - as orbits aren\u0027t normally circular these are approximations.

Nothing I couldn\u0027t recover from, but I thought it was strange. I\u0027m using the default of one minute before SOI change alarm, and it seems to be off by at least 30 seconds, as it is still warping past the SOI change, then the alarm kicks in, and after I turn off the alarm the orbit is saying I have a new SOI change. Anyone else see this?

I believe this behavior with missing the event is going to be related to the warp (and my math). When you warp the flight plan items become estimates, and if recalc is enabled then the SOI alarm becomes an estimate as soon as you start warping. So basically, once you start warping the alarm clock is slowing you down to meet the estimate under warp, not the actual time the alarm was set, and sometimes it will miss the precise event at the start - To be honest I didn\u0027t think of this till now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ED_B, for now a way to still have precision (assuming the SOI isnt actually changing as you get closer) would be to turn off the auto-SOI and SOI recalc options and set the SOI alarm manually while under no warp. Another alternative may be to use Fyrem\u0027s suggestion of a larger margin, then once you hit the 20 min(?) margin you could set a more precise one then. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomething for me is to maybe have an option so it only does recalcs while at 1x warp, will have a think about that one too\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dweller_Benthos","CreatedById":15418,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-15T23:48:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOK, thanks for the explanation.
