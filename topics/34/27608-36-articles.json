Higher cambre also has the side-effect of making stall occur at much lower speeds and AoA\u0027s however, which makes cambred airfoils far better at producing lift at low speeds and angle of attack, but far worse at providing lift at high speeds and high angles of attack. I believe activating flaps on a wing surface in-game applies the effect relative to the distance from the center of mass, so it does relatively little if activated on a delta-wing craft, but if it did increase cambre on a delta wing it would cause a pitch down moment. This is all VERY apparent if you observe flight data in FAR while still on the runway, as you\u0027ll notice that when you try to pitch down your craft on the runway with delta wings the L/W ratio will actually go up, where as if you try to pitch up your L/W ratio will go down. This will occur until some critical AoA at which lift will increase regardless of the difference between the two cambre\u0027s caused by the pitch-up/pitch-down input.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is all, however, just a rough explanation of what i know on the subject, can\u0027t guarantee all of that is always correct \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-17T01:27:52Z\u0022 title=\u002210/17/2014 01:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 17, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by TheGatesofLogic\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-17T01:54:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPure deltas, I meant.

I\u0027ve been looking for a way to reduce the part count on one of my heavier designs and so I decided to convert it over to pWings.

Very odd. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe wings while not attached to the craft, still continue to act as iff they are a part of the craft. Strut connectors will stretch infinitely behind them and if FAR is loaded about 500m down the runway it will begin to do very strange things that will cause the remaining powered portion of the plane to flip about through the air and crash. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter trying for some time to remake the wings and get them to stay attached, I gave up, figuring it must be a corrupt craft file and started fresh.

Very odd.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI moved the craft file over to my unmodded KSP install to test whether it was something to do with FAR or the other mods I have loaded.

If I revert back to the hangar, the CoL will be off to some direction. The problem clears up immediately when I remove FAR, and the normal wings work properly with it installed.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-19T07:42:12Z\u0022 title=\u002210/19/2014 07:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 19, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Hyomoto\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-19T09:41:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry copying (ALT-click) one of the wings, removing the original pair and reattaching the copied one.
