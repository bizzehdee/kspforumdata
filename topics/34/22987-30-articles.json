I wanted to do a really cool station on my stream featuring this.

I sent up a single docking core with a TKS and Salyut vehicle on either end as tugs, That gave me a 75-80 part count station core that was so laggy I couldn\u0027t even get it to orbit when it plus the launcher assembly was less than 250 parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwaster","CreatedById":71262,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-24T01:12:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DarthVader\u0022 data-cite=\u0022DarthVader\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnything new?\u003Cp\u003Ei vote ribbed fairings, they look realistic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFairings, like potato chips and Klingons, are better with ridges.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CardBoardBoxProcessor","CreatedById":10179,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-24T01:56:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Starwaster\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Starwaster\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFairings, like potato chips and Klingons, are better with ridges.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood news. you will get both. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Captain Sierra\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Captain Sierra\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAre those 0.625m tanks?
