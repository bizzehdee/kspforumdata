That\u0027s when I deleted those 3 files and it auto-tagged everything correctly in my alternate save. My main loaded up just fine afterwards...oddly enough.

It\u0027s the reasoning why I think new parts being added causes the CTD. Sometimes the game will load up just fine after the \u0022new part CTD\u0022, but I\u0027ve also noticed parts missing and random CTD when picking parts...again, fixed after deletion and a rescan.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if you have auto-tagging CTD\u0027s, delete those 3 files, auto-tag again, and carry on about your business.
