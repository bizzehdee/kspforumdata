What I do suggest is to use stock engines until 1.03 hits and we see what kind of adjustments (if any) make sense in that hopefully improved aero system. 1.02 is a badly cobbeled together hotfix which doesn\u0027t even allow the basic jet engine for example to reach the speed of 1,7 Mach it should be able to reach by the description.

You do not have to clutter up your GameData folder with dev files. Indeed the repository information states that it is over 700 MB in size. If you had bothered to click the link you would have discovered though that you are downloading a zip file which is only about 73 MB in size. From this zip file you only need to extract what is in the GameData folder and put that into your GameData folder which means you will hardly use much more space than with the R 5.2.8 version and you actually would have a mostly functional version at this point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut please don\u0027t come into this thread with an outdated version and start reporting bugs.

The MK2 adapter is fine there are no problems on this front. I think you are getting confused there. Most of B9 fuselage parts also allow for surface attachment. When you are a little unprecise while trying to node attack, the part will often flip to surface attach instead. Press the ALT key to force node attachment and that will not happen. I do confirm problems with the T2 (tail) engine mount though. It only attaches right when you use Non-strict attachment rules in the debug menu, else the fuselage node gets ignored and it will attach at the engine node. I guess it is a part that is rarely being used because it only really fits the M2 cargo bays and s2 parts and nothing else.
