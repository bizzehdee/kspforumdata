You don\u0027t need to land one huge ship with all of these things but on small worlds like Gilly or Pol it\u0027s not impossible. If you land them sepearately, though, you will need to dock them together on the ground (which frankly is harder than just giving up on the whole thing and resigning yourself to launching everything from Kerbin) or install Kerbal Attachment System and hook things together with pipes. Once you\u0027ve hooked everything up, start the drills, furnace, and rocket factory and you should start getting rocket parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother option is to land part of the assemblage on the planet, and then truck a resource up to orbit where you do the rest of the job.
