No idea how he came up with that figure, but I trust him. I will try to keep any new wings around that value, and see if it works out nicely with larger planes and their take off and landing speeds. With some luck I can also tweak a new engine module to give a better feeling thrust response, where you take off at a reasonable rate, and don\u0027t immediately go to Mach 1, only to hen be stuck there.

I de-rated the engine through tweaks to make them somewhat more similar to their real life counterparts, but even so, the Airco stalls out at around 35 m/s. Seems everything has to be faster in KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the beams, yeah the stretchy struts are great, but you can\u0027t attach things to them, hence the need for stringing tail skids together. I did however find that P-Wings and kerbpaint can be used as a stand-in; I\u0027ll try it out on my next project, the FE2B.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: FE2B (mostly) Done.
