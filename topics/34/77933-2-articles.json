I haven\u0027t tested this with .25, so maybe something bad happened... Wait did it take on the new delta wing model?? If so, it can easily be fixed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe hydrogen conversion system does require a significant amount of ElectricCharge, but I don\u0027t think it would wipe out a 10k battery... Like I said, I have not tested to make sure everything works right in 0.25, but the code was recompiled. I\u0027ll try to remember to look into it later, but no promises.
