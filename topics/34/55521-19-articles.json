ATM is configured to convert any non-DDS textures it encounters to DDS in the cache.

Then on the next startup when it\u0027s loading from cache, it encounters those garbage entries, fails to load them, and isn\u0027t set up to go back and try to load the original file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt worked on older KSP versions either because the older versions of ATM were managing to load something sensible or because the older versions of Squad\u0027s part compiler didn\u0027t hang the entire startup sequence if a texture that gets overridden with something else anyway was missing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-11T22:06:04Z\u0022 title=\u002205/11/2015 10:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by undercoveryankee\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Raptor831","CreatedById":68286,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T02:34:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI tried to remove the 2x2 .pngs from the Leek folder, it didn\u0027t work.

I know the old tanks were a part of Real Fuels main download. The engines are taken care of by the engine configs (one of 3 sets). The ones I manage (the \u0022Stockalike\u0022 ones) do have (old) HGR engines set up. Once RF is updated for 1.0.x I\u0027ll be adding the newer engines to the mod. I don\u0027t recall if the realistic engine configs make use of these, but you could check out the Realism Overhaul thread or the RftS pack. They\u0027re linked from the RF main thread.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LessrOf2Weevils","CreatedById":81058,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T21:16:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m still having trouble with start up hanging on the Leek folder with ATM installed.
