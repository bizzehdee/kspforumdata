I added a signal delay of ~1 hour to occur around periapsis, then proceeded to add the following experiments to the queue: Mystery Goo, Science Jr., Thermometer, Telemetry Analysis (from Science Revisited Revisited) and Magnetometer (from DMagic). At periapsis, the experiments activated properly and I saved the reports to be transmitted once I achieved LOS with Kerbin again. Afterwards, I noticed almost nothing works on my spacecraft. I cannot review the data on my science experiments, I cannot transmit data, I\u0027m unable to activate RCS/SAS, I cannot close the service bays, cannot shut down my engine, cannot activate staging, etc. The only things that work are pitch/yaw/roll, throttle (engines thrust properly), and I am able to change my antenna\u0027s target on a Comms DTS-M1.
