Should help get the nose up faster and keep it there, particularly with heavy loads. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Angled the rear \u0022Roll-bar\u0022 tail elements instead of being straight vertical. This both evokes more of the classic TB-2 feel, and on a practical level, allowed me to fit an extra intake scoop up there (for a total of 5). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Landing gear was made more robust in the form of an extra pair of gear that fold out from and support the engine pods. Also the landing gear as a whole was raised up slightly for better clearance. Overall there should be much less chance of damaging or ripping away parts of the plane on even a relatively heavy landing in wilderness conditions away from a runway. The gear uses the \u0022Procedural Landing Gear\u0022 mod. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- B9 Heavy Airbrakes have been added for more control and stopping quickly on landing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve included 3 different versions of the Thunderbird. Externally they are all the same, and use mainly Mk 4 and stock parts, with some B9 parts added and also using the Procedural adjustable landing gear. All three versions also use Mechjeb. Though it\u0027s more than possible to fly the craft manually. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere they differ is mainly in the cargo bay area. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0022Stock\u0022 Thunderbird has no KAS parts and no LLL parts. That minimizes the number of mods necessary to use the plane. This is for people who don\u0027t want to use KAS or LLL. I only used 2 LLL parts in any case, hardly cause for you to download the entire mod set and then try and figure out which parts I used to delete them etc. - Also - maybe you do have KAS for example, but you just want to set it up your own way. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next variant is the \u0022Stock KAS\u0022 version. It still uses no LLL parts, but has the KAS winch system and storage boxes set up. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe last version is the Thunderbird set up the way I use it. All the custom bits added. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing I do recommend - and it\u0027s the reason I have the LLL Hatch door on my custom version - is some way to move Kerbals straight from the cockpit back to the cargo bay without having to get out and walk (or EVA) to do so. This is particularly useful when you have very large loads to set up in the bay with the KAS system - it\u0027s also one reason why I have 2 KAS storage boxes - one at the forward end of the bay and the other near the back. That\u0027s so if a Kerbal can\u0027t walk around the sides of a big cargo, then 2 of them can work together and secure the cargo from the front and rear ends with the KAS struts etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a B9 \u0022Info Drive\u0022 installed that will list the action groups on loading.

If it\u0027s not too much trouble could you consider adding a small automated ramp at the front of the pod - I can get the rear loading ramp to work by turning it around and placing it inside the pod body and it looks reasonable - but a dedicated front ramp for boarding would look great.
