I did two identical launches, with the only difference being the solar panel covers. One launch had the title of \u0022Dragon 2 Solar Panel Cover\u0022 and the other launch I modified the cfg to make the title \u0022Dragon 2 Solar Panel Cover \u003Cstrong\u003EFairing\u003C/strong\u003E\u0022 and noticed a reduction of ~300deltaV to orbit (with RSS) with the latter. I think the stock panel covers are not actually \u0022covering\u0022 the solar panels from drag with FAR. FAR searches titles for words like \u0022cargo bay\u0022 and \u0022fairing\u0022 so this seems to make a difference because 300deltaV is too high a number to be accounted for by simple error.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the \u0022Falcon Flight Control System\u0022 (gold colored control piece) makes any rocket it\u0027s attached to wildly unstable. I have no idea why, I think it might also be a FAR issue but the part is almost no different from the heatshield part which doesn\u0027t cause instability. I tried the same rocket without FAR and it became stable, so for some reason FAR doesn\u0027t like this one specific part. I think I\u0027ll post in the FAR thread to see if anyone knows.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit 2: just to clarify, I think these were preexisting conditions and not caused by the recent update.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-22T23:38:54Z\u0022 title=\u002202/22/2014 11:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 22, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Scripto23\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Woodstar","CreatedById":99637,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-22T22:33:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethe explorer .craft file says locked or invalid parts when i try to load it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Virtualgenius","CreatedById":67644,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-23T00:21:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo we either need updated craft files for the explorer vehicle or build your own, I dont use FAR seems like to much trouble as everything doesnt seem to be compatible\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: I went back to my backup install and figured out how to rebuild the explorer craft replacing the old redundant parts for rthe new parts there are some problems the old model doesn\u0027t wobble the new one oscillates wildly it also has a roll problem where as the old model flies straight as an arrow no roll no oscillation.

With everything in your mod rescaled to 1:1 so the diameter is 3.66m, the length of the first stage is only ~36m. The length/diameter of all the other components and stages line up perfectly. So for my rescale I added the following lines which corrected the issue. This also matched up to the appropriate size tank to represent the correct volume and mass of fuel that is used.\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E    \u003Cbr\u003EMODEL\u003Cbr\u003E{\u003Cbr\u003E    model = LazTek/Parts/LazTekFalconMainTank/model\u003Cbr\u003E    scale = 1.2, 1.407, 1.2\u003Cbr\u003E}\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E@node_stack_top = 0.0, 19.71207, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 4\u003Cbr\u003E@node_stack_bottom = 0.0, -19.698, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 4\u003Cbr\u003E@node_attach = 0.0, 0.0, 1.805, 0.0, 0.0, -1.0, 1\u003Cbr\u003E@rescaleFactor = 1\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust thought you might like to know.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso a very minor detail, The very \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.junovo.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/falcon.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Efirst Falcon 9 had huge \u0022SPACEX\u0022 written in big bold letters up the side\u003C/a\u003E .
