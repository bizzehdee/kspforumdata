I mean, in real life there is no limit to the amount of \u0022nodes\u0022 on the bottom of the tank, so you can attach as many engines there as you can fit. A part that let\u0027s you do what you should be able to do anyway should not add 6 tonnes to the weight of your vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yes, I need this for RSS purposes.

The mass calculation for walls is fine, I\u0027d even be okay with them being heavier than they currently are. It\u0027s the huge mass of the bases (which are pretty much a \u0022workaround\u0022 non-part) that result in weird masses for completed PF interstages. As an illustration: a h=3, r=5 interstage is almost THREE TIMES heavier than a h=5, r=3 interstage, despite having the exact same surface area (3x5 is exactly 3.608t, 5x3 is 9.642t, both have 95.25 square meters of surface area).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do use AIES, but the ability to do the same with any engine makes your part immensely useful. I never said anything should be massless, I\u0027m just saying that the mass of workaround structural parts should be insignificant, like say under 2 tonnes. As it currently stands, a 10 meter thrust plate (10 m is a pretty standard first-stage diameter for large rockets in RSS) weighs over 6 tonnes, which is way too much to just brush off.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-07T09:47:06Z\u0022 title=\u002207/07/2014 09:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 7, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Hattivat\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"e-dog","CreatedById":73796,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-07T09:49:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027d be decouplers with shroud when I\u0027ll finally make them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELow mass inline parts for heavy rockets have issues with physics simulation though, because of imperfect joints and high-frequency oscillations caused by high mass ratio of connected parts which are not properly captured with high time step of realtime physics.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hattivat","CreatedById":110255,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-07T10:00:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022e-dog\u0022 data-cite=\u0022e-dog\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ELow mass inline parts for heavy rockets have issues with physics simulation though, because of imperfect joints and high-frequency oscillations caused by high mass ratio of connected parts which are not properly captured with high time step of realtime physics.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI see.
