Could you maybe cobble together a longer linear strut? And a double-length one for the very long 1m solid boosters, and 1.75m boosters, that has its ejection force increased more than linearly, otherwise those heavy boys just scrape along on ejection ripping off anything in their path.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - The Medium Bertha and Twin Bertha Lite have a mass of 1.5, while the Big Bertha has a mass of 12. An order of magnitude difference in mass means the Big Bertha is actually almost never a good choice. Especially since 3m engines have a mass of 3 and 4.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Along the same lines, please take a look at the mass of the Aerospike (1.6, more than mid/small bertha) and NERVA Nuclear (3, almost as much as Matriarch). I think they should be heavier than most, but that\\\u0027s possibly a bit far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - I\\\u0027ve been using the aerospike engine a lot (because its short) and I\\\u0027ve noticed it overheats really, really fast. Now an aerospike engine would probably realistically disperse heat worse than others, but again right now its a bit much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - The 1.75m, 2m, 3m SAS and the \u0026gt;1m RCS tanks need to have their values increased exponentially, rather than linearly. Even if this means you having to make them bigger and heavier, because right now to get the same kind of response you get from putting 1x 1m SAS on a rocket, you need to pack 2-3 1.75m and even more 3m, same with the RCS tanks, which inevitably introduces a whole of wobble. As they are right now, a single module, it does nothing! If you make something that has a 3m tank, unless its the shortest tank and it has nothing on top of it with any weight, a single RCS tank will barely get your rotation started.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Selecting the MK 2.3 1.75m decoupler is very hard, only a thing band under the bottom warning stripe works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Said decoupler is also unncessarily long for the Twin and Medium Bertha, so a shorter one would be awesome, if you can bang one together \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S. the Odin is awesome \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shuttle","CreatedById":5225,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-11T16:57:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen will Alternate Configs be released?
