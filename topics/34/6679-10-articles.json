The reason for the delay is a re-balancing effort that the team is undertaking. The parts are going to be made lighter, and will follow a universal weight standard of a half-ton per cubic meter. This will not only make the pack easier to use, since stations will no longer require ridiculous amounts of thrust to reach orbit, but it will also improve craft handling in orbit, which will be handy for module-to-module docking in the future. We will also be adjusting RCS fuel tank size and working with the plugins a bit more, partially to improve realism, and partially because lower weights will change RCS performance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Eventually, Kosmos will not just be space station parts. Cardboard has already mentioned our next project after the station parts are finished, the Angara series of rockets.
