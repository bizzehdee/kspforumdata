This occurs if the stage is 22.5km away from the active vessel and is at an altitude below ~23km. If altitude \u0026gt; 23km but distance \u0026gt;22.5km, the stage is unloaded and NO physics is applied to it, other than acceleration from gravity (but no atmospheric drag). This is when SR starts its calculations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) If the current surface velocity of the stage is \u0026gt; 2000 m/s AND the save game has reentry heating enabled, SR does a check to see if the stage is burned up. The process is outlined in the OP. It is possible that this is an \u0022unrealistic\u0022 speed, since atmospheric drag may not have been applied to the stage like it should have been and so the stage is going faster than expected (due to being \u0026gt;22.5km away but above 23km altitude for part of the trajectory).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) SR calculates the terminal velocity based on parachutes and vessel mass. For RealChutes it uses the exact formula. For Stock it uses an approximate formula that can be off by up to 2 m/s in testing (in either direction), since I don\u0027t know how to calculate it exactly anymore and I needed something quick for 1.0.2 (the old method worked in 1.0)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) If the calculated terminal velocity is \u0026gt;6 m/s (the Low Cutoff setting) then it attempts powered landing. First it checks for a pilot or probe with SAS capability. If that\u0027s found, it calculates the total thrust to weight ratio based on active engines and the amount of delta V the ship can provide. It then consumes either enough fuel to drop the terminal velocity to 4m/s (at a rate of 1.5 times that of normal, to represent inefficiencies in piloting. AKA, it requires 1.5 times the terminal velocity in delta v, which is about 300 dV without chutes and can be as low as 50 dV or less with \u003Cem\u003Esome\u003C/em\u003E chutes) or it consumes ALL of the fuel and calculates the new terminal velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) After determining the final velocity it sets the Speed Percentage based on where the velocity lies in relation to the Low/High Cutoffs. If V\u0026gt;High Cutoff, then 0%. If V\u0026lt;Low Cutoff, then 100%. If Low\u0026lt;V\u0026lt;High then it calculates it based on a quadratic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) The latitude and longitude at deletion is used to calculate the Great Circle Distance from the KSC, giving the Distance Percentage between 98% at KSC and 10% on the other side of Kerbin linearly (depending on Tracking Station level actually. At Level 1 it\u0027s 10% at 1/4 of the way around Kerbin, at Level 2 it\u0027s 10% at 3/8 of the way, and at level 3 it\u0027s 10% at 1/2 way around).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7) The Speed and Distance Percentages are multiplied to give the final percentage. The total part values are calculated and funds equal to Total Part Value * Final Percentage are awarded. Kerbals are \u0022recovered\u0022 (set back to Available and un-killed in their flight log). Science is recovered at 100% rate. And the success message is created, along with firing of the Success event in the API.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere you go. That\u0027s pretty much everything SR does to recover a craft.
