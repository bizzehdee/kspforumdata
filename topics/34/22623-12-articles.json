Think, be careful and make sure you can make payments in the long run. With every loan you take out you basically surrender a little bit of control over your own life to others. Others that do not care about you personally, I might add.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know it is common to take out personal loans and credit cards for stuff like this in some parts of the world (US, I am looking at you), but that does not mean it is a good idea. Try to stay as debt free as possible for trivial things, ensuring you can make payment on the important stuff you will need to survive in todays world (housing, bills, education et cetera).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Yes, I am aware that you need to be in debt for a decent credit rating in the US, but that does not warrant trivial spending in itself.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell that\u0027s well said, and this would have actually been my first loan which is probably why I wasn\u0027t able to get it, as for the credit card I did get, I\u0027m not planning on spending all the money on the card and staying in debt like most people do. I never want to exceed 1 credit card and even this one I got to buy my second monitor will be paid off within 1 month which is actually in time for the bill, meaning I won\u0027t be charged interest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do believe your right about not borrowing money for trivial things, although I would hardly consider a vehicle trivial... Although I did buy mine outright, simply because I had the money to do so at the time. (Speaking of which I don\u0027t see why the heck people need brand new cars with all the bells and whistles when you can get one that works just as well for 10% of the cost if you buy it used.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(On another note though: If I didn\u0027t have a computer I\u0027d probably be crazy bored all the time, having no actual friends has that side effect.
