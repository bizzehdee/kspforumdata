I already have several models for a skylab i have been working on...but am yet to finish there textures and hatch and ladder collider tweaks. I\u0027m usually working on the Imp. Inov. parts when i have time...but a texture change would be better than nothing till i get you some models to look at or until someone else offers too do it.

One picture, after all, from the surface of Mars is cool, but doesn\u0027t really tell us much. Effectively the camera would be balanced by extremely high data size and transmission efficiency, but somewhat low scientific value, except it can be repeated.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
