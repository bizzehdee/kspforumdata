A remote command module allows a vessel to function as a command station (providing it has enough crew). This allows you to set up remote command stations to minimize signal delay. Just try flying a mission to Eeloo with a signal path going all the way back to Kerbin and you\u0027ll get an idea of how difficult it can be to maneuver under heavy signal delays. The flight computer goes a long way to make things easier, but stuff like landing is almost impossible unless you have near instant controls (or are landing on a planet where you can use parachutes).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PhilMcgroin","CreatedById":80183,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-25T09:46:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh, signal delay.
