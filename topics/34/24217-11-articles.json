The landing legs are displayed as being half-deployed in the VAB. I can right click the pod and actuate all of the options, i.e. ladder, legs, lights, in the VAB, but when I launch, the pod appears on the launch pad with the legs (again) half extended, the bottom fairing adapter is there as though it\u0027s attached to something underneath, or maybe it\u0027s the pad itself, and most importantly, the pod is TOTALLY non-responsive. None of my action group buttons do anything. Right-clicking the pod brings up the normal GUI window, it says the pod is operating \u0027Nominal\u0027ly, but I can\u0027t control anything with the menu either. Click to extend the ladder, nothing. Landing gear, lights, nothing responds. Finally, the throttle and flight controls don\u0027t do anything either.
