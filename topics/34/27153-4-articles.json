When one invocation of the solver relies on an inaccurate result of a previous invocation for a constraint, this often causes the constraint to be impossible, hence the errors and infeasible state messages. These problems do occur on simpler problems, like the example craft, however they do so much less frequently. I am currently trying to write a new solver that is much more stable. The current solver is a very naive implementation of the Primal Simplex Method. The next one will be a much more robust Bartels-Golub Revised Simplex Method. I am also working on contingency plans for the possibility of the solver failing occasionally, such as extrapolation of previous results.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe engine balancing mode in fact has no concept of the orientation the craft is in relative to anything. The pro/retrograde problem may be an illusion, or it may be related to moving reference frames for the calculations causing numerical instability. The mode does not try to keep you upright or hovering - its only task is to stop unwanted rotation when thrust is applied, regardless of the vessel\u0027s orientation. It really is trying to do exactly what its name suggests - automatic trimming of engine thrusts. This is also explained in the help info for the mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETLDR: The problems you are experiencing are due to the poor accuracy of the current solver in some situations, not anything related to the logic using the solver.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"evilC","CreatedById":60370,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-10T11:34:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust been thinking about how things might work in an ideal situation...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think in order to get the most from your code, I think what we need is to be able to set some engines as \u0022RCS Only\u0022.

I\u0027m also seeing \u0022Internal Error 01\u0022 - what does this mean?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInternal Error 01 occurs in a particular situation where the results of the maths the solver calculates contradict each other. This happens due to numerical instability from floating point arithmetic errors. I am currently working on an improved solver that should be much more numerically stable. So then you should in theory hardly ever see that message. Also, if you find that the balancing modes are not working perfectly (i.e. some drifting still occurs), it is likely due to numerical instability. Again, this should be fixed when I finish the next version of the solver.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"seanwjones","CreatedById":75443,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-23T07:26:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ZRM\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ZRM\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHmmm.

You can do this easily for all RCS parts if you have a utility that can find and replace through an entire directory. Notepad\u002B\u002B does this especially well.
