The cockpit choice was due to intake order, but I can swap that.\n\nAs for the external command seat, there was a method to my madness. It is in the rover branch under Field Science, which is why you probably missed it. I put it there because of the Apollo Lunar Rover.\n\nI am planning a big revision next week. Nothing save game breaking, just maybe a little inconvenient for those with saves. Along with adding more part packs and updating new parts from current packs, my hope is to *fission* the Modern Physics branch into reactors and engines. Hopefully I can perform some *fission* on the aviation side also so that the nodes aren\u0027t overly packed with parts."},{"CreatedByName":"NuclearH","CreatedById":150458,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-30T09:59:27Z","Content":"Hello, anyone has the problem with missing items ?\n\nI already unlock the advanced exploration, but the processing lab and the ladders are missing...\n\nI create an sandbox and a science mod and both are ok.\n\nSorry for the english ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Probus","CreatedById":102512,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-30T20:44:05Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Hello, anyone has the problem with missing items ?\n\u003E I already unlock the advanced exploration, but the processing lab and the ladders are missing...\n\u003E \n\u003E I create an sandbox and a science mod and both are ok.\n\u003E \n\u003E Sorry for the english ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nHi NuclearH,\n\n The ladders are sprinkled around the manned branch.

I like the idea of your tech tree, it\u0027s number 1 for me now.\n\nI have some ideas if you don\u0027t mind.\n\nYou included the K2 pod in \u0022advanced manned space exploration\u0022 node. Would be cool to see the Corvus command pod in this node for those, who use it instead of the K2 pod. But corvus has some additional cool parts, which could be added in the node below. Something like this:\n\n![kdNYFsp.png](http://i.imgur.com/kdNYFsp.png)\n\n1). Manned Space Exploration (50 ScP)\n\n2). Advanced Exploration (95 ScP) (Corvus pod)\n\n3). Additional Equipment (25 ScP) (includes all corvus parts: nose cone, decoupler, MP-tank and Orbital Meneveuring System)\n\nAlso I saw a USI Surv. Pack in the TBD list, which is great. Maybe the \u0022survivability\u0022 node could be extended the following way:\n\n![4DD1xw7.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/4DD1xw7.jpg)\n\n1). Survivability\n\n2). Escape Pod (50 ScP) (includes the USI escape pod and it\u0027s propulsion system)\n\n3). Inflatables (25 ScP) (includes airbags and floaties)\n\n4). Real Chutes parachutes (already exists)\n\nI like to start with Bi-Planes, But I think, they should be integrated into the aviation tree. I noticed some balance issues. When you unlock the Bi-plane cockpit and some LFO engines, technically you can go to space! Of course, I limit myself and don\u0027t fly Bi-Plane cockpit higher than 5 km. Would be great to have the altitude limitations for all cockpits. And if you put your poor Kerbal in an unpressurized cockpit on the rocket and launch he will die of hypoxia. (I saw this idea in BTSM mod, what a pity I know nothing about the coding stuff, I could have integrated this feature with unpressurized cockpits to all aviation parts, maybe someone could do this.)\n\nAs I understood, You\u0027ve also integrated the Deadly reentry parts, it\u0027s good. But there are also some cool Heat-Shield parts, that could be integrated into the mod.\n\n**NASA - Adaptable, Deployable Entry Placement Technology (ADEPT) by OLDD**\n\nand\n\n**[1.0.4] Oblivion Aerospace Pack**\n\nGreat mod, keep up good work!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-02T03:24:50Z\u0022 title=\u002209/02/2015 03:24  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by panzerwaffe044**"},{"CreatedByName":"Probus","CreatedById":102512,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-04T12:05:55Z","Content":"First of several planned updates this weekend:\n\nMerged Goo Branch\n\nSplit Modern Physics into Nuclear Reactors and Nuclear Propulsion (not shown on the OP tree yet)\n\nAdded support for:\n\nSolaris Hypernautics\n\nCorvus\n\nKerbal Planetary Base Systems"},{"CreatedByName":"Dr. Jet","CreatedById":99880,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-05T08:41:08Z","Content":"Still no support for NF: Propulsion and NF:Spacecraft?"},{"CreatedByName":"Probus","CreatedById":102512,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-05T16:03:42Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Still no support for NF: Propulsion and NF:Spacecraft?\n\nI forgot about those Dr. Jet.

I\u0027m playing it in science mode with 50% science, and I really like the way the early game is set up. After a stint trying realism overhaul, I liked the early portion of that game with somewhat uncontrollable rockets and building things that have to spin to go straight. Your mod is set up with a probe that has no control at the beginning, which encourages trying out builds for what are really sounding rockets, as opposed to the full-fledged controllable rockets. The limited science gaining options at the start also make it harder to get a massive burst of points at the beginning that lets you progress too fast. Definitely interested in seeing how it progresses as more tech is unlocked."},{"CreatedByName":"TheDoctor1004","CreatedById":134352,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-12T22:58:54Z","Content":"Hey!
