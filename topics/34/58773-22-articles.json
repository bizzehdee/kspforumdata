If a module can live with such a value changing on rescale (editor) and on vessel loading (editor \u0026amp; flight) then writing a small config is all it needs. The current config tries to do this for your slider values, but as far as I understand it occasionally works by chance and mostly messes up your internal state. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is also an API that allows to run arbitrary code on the rescale events.

This version brings minor quality-of-life fixes for 1.0, and fixes the inline docking port. \u003Cstrong\u003EVladP53\u003C/strong\u003E, thanks for your report! It wasn\u0027t actually an issue with my mod, but rather a floating point problem with infinitely repeating fractions (0.3 is infinitely repeating in binary) and the way Squad\u0027s implemented their FloatRange tweakable. As a workaround, I\u0027ve changed the default center value for the OKTO port\u0027s torque fields to 0.25 (nerfed by 0.05).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECHANGELOG:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003Ev.1.9.1 [2015-05-01]\u003Cbr\u003E* TweakableDockingNode: Removed now-unnecessary fixes for the inline docking port that were broken in 1.0.\u003Cbr\u003E* TweakableParachutes: Changed the default values for deployment factors to provide a better experience with not crashing your parts.\u003Cbr\u003E* TweakableReactionWheels: Patched the OKTO core\u0027s reaction wheel values to default to a value that won\u0027t suffer floating point errors and slow down the tweakable.\u003Cbr\u003E* Minor code cleanup.\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BudgetHedgehog\uFEFF","CreatedById":104112,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T22:18:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022toadicus\u0022 data-cite=\u0022toadicus\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ETweakableEverything has been updated to version 1.9.1!\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.0.2 compatible?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
