It is high thrust for 1.25m and medium thrust for 2.5m but the good ISP and long burn times makes it work well for 2.5m. I laucnhed this craft to test out emissives. The short and stubbiness makes it quite stable. Like the Antares Rocket it really crawls out of the launch pad. Only going 40m/s at 2500k lol. But with such good ISP it eventually gets going pretty good.
