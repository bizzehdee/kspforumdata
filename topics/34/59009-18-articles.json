This non-existent vessel cannot supply a Guid value and thus throws the error seen above causing all sorts of terrible things to happen. This release fixes that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt also makes any survey contract (orbital, surface, or biological) parameter able to complete by returning science results to Kerbin, regardless of their science value. Transmitted science results still require that there be a minimum amount of science gained from experiment, but returned science no longer has this requirement. This should address any edge cases like those mentioned in this post, and avoids generally frustrating results caused by taking the time to return a vessel to Kerbin only to get the \u0022not enough science message\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt also has what should be a more reliable method for resetting DMagic contracts upon upgrading; again, note that upgrading from v0.8.5 will not reset contracts. See the first post for the full change log.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat giant update warning will be standard in all of my release posts from here on.

The on-screen message will appear when you try to collect data within 30km of the anomaly (this also varies with height); both of these give a pretty good indication of where the anomaly is, even if it is buried underground or too small to see.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf there is something really wrong, like the anomaly is somehow at the center of the planet, the anomaly scanner will never get close enough to work, and SCANsat also shouldn\u0027t work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022CyanAngel\u0022 data-cite=\u0022CyanAngel\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpdate: Seems I was leading you on a bit of red herring there, I started systematically removing mods, it wasnt US or ScienceAlert, when I find the mod to blame I\u0027ll let you and the other mod maker know.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpdate 2: It seems to be a problem with either version of Interstellar, but things seem a bit up in arms with those mods so I\u0027ll ditch it, might try near future\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s good to know, well... good for me to know. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll add some debug outputs and more safeties to catch anything weird happening when science collection occurs; this won\u0027t fix anything, but it will give a better indication of exactly what is wrong, and there is some slight, but very real danger that null science data could be passed through the system with catastrophic (and hilarious) results.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-27T23:43:55Z\u0022 title=\u002209/27/2014 11:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 27, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by DMagic\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"chucksterock","CreatedById":114173,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-28T00:32:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DMagic\u0022 data-cite=\u0022DMagic\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe other problem is that there is no need for experiment definitions to be in a file called ScienceDefs.cfg (in fact, you could put part definitions, experiments, resources, etc... all in one big config file if you wanted to) so just searching for , or changing, that name won\u0027t not help.\u003Cp\u003EA better way to verify that this is actually the problem is to either post your output.log file (found in the KSP_Data folder) or check your logs to see if you\u0027re getting a duplicate key dictionary error (this happens while KSP is first loading, so it happens to quickly to easily see it in-game).
