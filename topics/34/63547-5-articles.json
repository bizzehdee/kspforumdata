Basically, a part that would greatly increase the temperature at which the compressor overheats, by cooling the intake air down. Also, why did you remove the intake requirement?

With intakes, make each engine require a certain intake area. Exceeding it should not cause a performance increase, but not meeting it would cut into the maximum fuel flow you can introduce into the engine. Each intake has to be connected to the engine via a structural part (i.e. not a wing or a fuel tank).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, precoolers. They\u0027d have to be located somewhere on the structural path from intake to the engine. Each precooler would reduce the engine heating by a certain factor (configurable in it\u0027s module), by cooling the air introduced into the engine. Their effects should probably stack, so make them heavy to compensate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for drag problems with intakes, just remove the stock intake module via MM and insert your custom one.

The stock physical model uses intakes as some kind of operation ceiling, which is implemented by AJE in a much more realistic manner. The problem is, with the corrected fuel flow, you need a lot of intake air, and the engines will automatically throttle down when it is insufficient. So the air intake physical model serves no real purpose but a negative effect that is not wanted and hard to predict. In previous versions I tried to increase the intake area and resource of intakes, but for some high-altitude high-speed designs there\u0027s still the problem\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently, intakes have no drag(both stock and FAR if you use v0.13) and no purpose, but you can still use them anyway you like. If inlets are to be modeled in a realistic manner, we must consider 1) total pressure recovery, which depends on Mach number and angle 2) drag, which includes friction drag and shock wave drag, mind you that the oblique inlets could have very complicated, multiple shock waves. Simply requiring a minimal area is 1) not realistic 2) too easy since they have no drag 3) this is a sandbox game that allows player to alter anything so there\u0027s no real banning of cheating behaviour\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow do you decribe precoolers in exact terms?

And what\u0027s the difference between that and F-100? In the future, I may make something to allow choosing engine parameters in the editor, very much like what PP does. It will save many engines in one xml probably. Then you can choose any afterburning turbojet/low bypass turbofan to replace the stock jet. I think the stock turbofan should remain some kind of ramjet, its nozzle 3d model is quite special. May be it should choose from ramjet, turboramjet, or scramjet if that\u0027s figured out.

Even if you have the exact same engine thrust, you may not have the exact same size of fuselage and wings. Let along that 3rd generation and after fighters usually take advantage of induced vortices which FAR doesn\u0027t model. Also FAR has only one airfoil so some subsonic designs can be weak too. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally I like thinking like a designer. Set up goals for max speed, weight and range, then choose engines and geometry. From that viewpoint, engines from roughly the same era and same purpose are very similar. By \u0022purpose\u0022 I mean CPR. A high-CPR (\u0026gt;20) favors subsonic thrust and efficiency, and a low-CPR favors supersonic thrust and efficiency. Ramjet as no CPR, and its best performance is \u0026gt;Mach 3. Generally you always want a higher TET, and that represents \u0022era\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-30T05:30:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks!
