Anythig over 10 kerbals and you are looking at lag city; this has been an issue with KSP for ages (at least 1.0.4) and thus I have them switched off to allow normal game play while not even running a potato (4790K/16GB/SSD/GTX970). This poses a problem with Deepfreeze as it will not show the kerbals in the part GUI, and the deepfreeze UI will show them but now thaw/freeze the kerbals. Is there any way to get this to work with internals switched off?\n\n![lag_internals.jpg](http://jimbodiah.com/ksp/lag_internals.jpg)  \n\nThis is a plot from MemGraph showing the load for parts with internals and then dropping way down when I undock from the ship with inetrnals. When I use my patch to remove internals, the entire plot shows around a 20-25MB heap vs the 150mb without the patch. Also notice the frequency of the stutter which is every few seconds with internals and around 1 minute without them.  \n\nHence the complete aversion to having more than 2-3 kerbals showing in the internals.\n\nPS: Also when Kerbals are frozen, the contracts will not register them crossing \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E consitently.

So they part cannot freeze any kerbals until it cools down.  \n\n    Temperature Checking function (switch on and off via config settings: RegTempReqd = true/false). If switched on the Freezer Part temperature must be \u003C the RegTempFreeze value (in settings)to be able to freeze a kerbal. If switched on you must maintain the Freezer part temperature BELOW the RegTempMonitor (in settings) value. If you do not, then there is a good chance the freezer will fail and your kerbals WILL start dying if you have the EC fatal option turned on. If switched on Freezing/Thawing and Holding Frozen Kerbals will cause the freezer parts to produce Heat which you will then need to manage. - This function only operates on the active vessel as Temperature control on unloaded vessels is too risky in the current KSP version. If you wish to use this function, do so at your own risk.. (or rather the Kerbals) and use a heat control mod and parts like this one."},{"CreatedByName":"mkalaska","CreatedById":172246,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-12-16T01:01:44Z","Content":"Thank you sir worked like a charm"},{"CreatedByName":"GerAseR","CreatedById":104417,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-06T01:00:03Z","Content":"Im getting the \u0022Missing Module Manager\u0022 Box on the starting screen (will not work with RPM) but i have the newest \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E  and RPM versions installed, will that be a problem?"},{"CreatedByName":"GooglyNarga","CreatedById":186364,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-27T00:34:48Z","Content":"Can anyone confirm this works for 1.6 please?"},{"CreatedByName":"4x4cheesecake","CreatedById":187982,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-29T23:11:03Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 1/27/2019 at 1:34 AM, GooglyNarga said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Can anyone confirm this works for 1.6 please?\n\u003E \n\nThe core feature works perfectly fine but the glass textures of the pods are just pink (IVA) or black (radial mounted pod)."},{"CreatedByName":"GooglyNarga","CreatedById":186364,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-30T02:14:24Z","Content":"Am able to confirm, Thanks!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-01-30T02:14:34Z\u0022 title=\u002201/30/2019 02:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 30, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by GooglyNarga**"},{"CreatedByName":"TheBok","CreatedById":187752,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-01T08:29:32Z","Content":"Heya and many thanks for this epic mod.\n\nI\u0027m running DeepFreeze with 1.6.1 and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E \u002B many others.
