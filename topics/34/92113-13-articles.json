Kerbin looked all white (completely covered with clouds) with red areas. I had to revert back to Edge of Oblivion in order for KSP to work. Are you using AMD cards? At first I thought it was some sort of incompatibility with AMD cards. I\u0027m using a Sapphire R9 290 Tri-X and the only way I could load without crashing/having red and white planets was reverting back to EoO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also tried to load KSP with each part of this pack enabled individually, it didn\u0027t work either.

Specifically, I LOVE the Jool from this mod, but I think the Eve from KSPRC looks way better (I like that the clouds on Eve are so thick you can\u0027t see the surface, which is not the case in this mod). So I\u0027ve tried to move over all the Eve details, but I can\u0027t get it to work. Do I need to change any cfg files? If so, what?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedit: I figured out the cfg files to edit, and with some tinkering I got Eve looking gorgeous so I\u0027m happy.
