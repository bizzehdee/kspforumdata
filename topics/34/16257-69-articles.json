Why is it necessary at all to use a remote command module? If you had adequate Remote control coverage, say a bunch of satellites spaced out in geosync orbit with dishes pointed at various things, wouldn\u0027t you be able to have coverage anywhere? Because all the remote control sats relay signals from KSC, so anything with the control module could receive signals from the command center? I\u0027m not understanding where the control module would be useful. But I\u0027m probably missing something vital to how this works, because I made a sat with a RemoteControl module, an omni antenna, a sat dish, plenty of power, and launched it into geosync orbit. It said it had control while it was there, but when I came back to it a few days later, it had no signal and couldn\u0027t be controlled, despite being in geosync above KSC with the dish pointed at it and full power :s\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
