I like the one about adding optional SSTO to satellite missions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpeaking of satellite missions going to be a brand new one in next version that can use any mod part that is part of the Science Class and randomly add it to the satellite as Objective. No need for configs to add them yourself, MCE will find them for you. The only downside to this system is that it will literally find any Science part. ANY. Including the lab. LOL. Makes for pretty interesting contracts. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWorking hard right now on trying to get the first Civilian contract working the way I want.
