{"TopicId":106369,"ForumId":34,"TopicTitle":"[1.9\u002B] ModularFlightIntegrator 1.2.7 (19 October 2019)","CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T20:11:29Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T20:11:29Z","Content":"No [logs](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92229#Logs) =\u003E No support\n\nKSP 1.0 gave us VesselModules and the most important of them : FlightIntegrator. This module is the one that handles most of the aerodynamic and heating model.\n\nAs with all the VesselModules it is easy to replace it and we could have custom version that change only part of the model (Thanks Mu for the modularity). But a problem rise when more than one mod wants to change something in the FlightIntegrator. We know two ways of handling that properly in code and ModularFlightIntegrator is one of them that should avoid complex debugging later.\n\nModularFlightIntegrator is a VesselModules that allows multiples mods to override or insert code into various call of the stock FlightIntegrator. This was written in collaboration with Ferram4 and Starwaster.\n\nCurrently the code is in a rough shape and if multiple mods tries to override the same part then only the first one to try is allowed to. Later I plan to add a more complex system but we needed a first version out quickly.\n\nThis plugin is of no direct interest to end user but a least two mods using it should be out soon-ish so here it is.\n\n1.1 Fix a bug that manifest mainly with wrong gimbal movement.\n\n1.1.1 Fix the version info of the DLL so current mods work without a rebuild.\n\n1.1.2 for KSP 1.0.5\n\n1.1.3 KSP 1.1\n\n1.1.4 KSP 1.1.2\n\n1.1.5 Include a fix by [@Thomas P.](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/113164-thomas-p/) for the calculateSunBodyFLux delegate check\n\n1.1.6 Rebuild so \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E re index it\n\n1.2.1 For KSP 1.2. Include a ModularVesselPrecalculate to override the stock VesselPrecalculate\n\n1.2.2 Fix a nasty bug where MFI started on inactive object like flag prefabs\n\n1.2.3 Fix the same nasty bug in an other part of the code. ![:huh:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif \u0022:huh:\u0022)\n\n1.2.4 Fix a few bugs that [@eggrobin](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/4680-eggrobin/) found out and add some code to help Pincipia integration.\n\n1.2.5 Updated the AVC template.\n\n1.2.6 Updates for KSP 1.7\n\n1.2.7 KSP 1.8.x \u0026 1.9.x Build\n\nKSP 1.8.x Download : [ModularFlightIntegrator-1.2.7.0.zip](https://ksp.sarbian.com/jenkins/job/ModularFlightIntegrator/33/artifact/ModularFlightIntegrator-1.2.7.0.zip)\n\nKSP 1.4.0-1.7.x Download : [ModularFlightIntegrator-1.2.6.0.zip](https://ksp.sarbian.com/jenkins/job/ModularFlightIntegrator/31/artifact/ModularFlightIntegrator-1.2.6.0.zip)\n\nSource : [https://github.com/sarbian/ModularFlightIntegrator](https://github.com/sarbian/ModularFlightIntegrator)\n\nLicense : MIT\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-07-05T13:57:04Z\u0022 title=\u002207/05/2020 01:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 5, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by sarbian**"},{"CreatedByName":"gkorgood","CreatedById":124879,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T20:12:40Z","Content":"Ooh what does it do?
