You can\u0027t do anything about that until physics/aerodynamic model in KSP will be changed. Fortunately, there is no difference in difficulty between those new fuselage systems and tiny stock ones, as with the size comes the fuel to feed more than enough engines and attach more than enough wings to make a very good plane.
