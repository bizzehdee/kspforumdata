If you say \u0027yes\u0027, it does so and your old savegame is gone...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E... BUT the Mission Control mod stores the campaign data outside that folder in its own plugin folder, using the campaign name. The result is that when you try to start the campaign over as described above, Mission Control still has your old budget number and still uses it. So if the reason you started over is that you ran your money into the negatives while trying to learn how the mod worked, as in my case, then when you start over you\u0027re starting a new campaign in which you\u0027re already at negative money from day 1 instead of starting at 50,000.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
