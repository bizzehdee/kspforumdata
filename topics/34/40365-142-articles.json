The reactor and generator are both online, but neither of them are producing any power. I\u0027ve got an antimatter collector inline with its tank, which is directly above the generator and reactor. My ship has 1043 out of 20,000 megajoules, and no electric charge (when timewarping to gather antimatter, it depleted and wasn\u0027t replenished). I\u0027ve tried quicksave\u002Bquickloading; I\u0027ve gone to the tracking station; I\u0027ve switched to a vessel on the surface of moho, quicksaved, and quickloaded; I very briefly ran the engines while MechJeb limited me to 0.01m/s^2.
