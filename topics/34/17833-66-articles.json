Usually you have a specific payload required for the mission and can then design each stage of the lifter to lift what you have so far. Building from the bottom up is awkward as, when you discover you haven\u0027t given your bottom stage enough thrust and/or fuel it can be rather awkward to change it later, especially if you have to detach the payload to change parts and then reattach it to check the performance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne question I have about your rocket, the staging list shows 3 stack decouplers (in stages 0, 1 and 4) and 3 radial decouplers (in stage 2). I can see the radial ones (though I\u0027m not sure what purpose they are serving) but I can only see one stack decoupler. Is that another one (non-stock) immediately under the pod? Where is the other one?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven when building top down, SelectRoot can be a very useful tool, especially once you start designing more complex vessels using sub-assemblies.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Boomerang","CreatedById":92198,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-16T04:46:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know whether this has come up before, but is there any chance of Engineer using a more stock-alike font?

I usually eyeball it: I zoom out, line up Minmus\u0027s orbit with Kerbin\u0027s equatorial plane, and launch when it looks like I\u0027m just about under Minmus\u0027s orbit.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah. I can use the \u0022Angle to Rel. AN\u0022 (or DN) to get a near perfect launch inclination. I guess I was just hoping for some way to show me how long it will take to get to the launch time, so I don\u0027t have to leave the rocket on the pad and do other things (I also use kerbal construction time, so I\u0027d like to know if I have time to launch something else and have the pad refurbished before it\u0027s time to launch to Minmus again.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TelluriumCrystal","CreatedById":25647,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-20T19:12:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have linked this mod to recurring lag spikes here: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100693-Consistent-Lag-Spikes?p=1552556#post1552556\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESupport Thread\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis might be unique to the OSX version as I am also running Kerbal Engineer 1.0.11.3 on my PC and have not come across this issue.

I used \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.notepad-plus-plus.org/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ENotepad\u002B\u002B\u003C/a\u003E to make the process less painful and less likely to fail horribly (Notepad\u002B\u002B is Windows-only, but I\u0027m sure there are similarly-featured text editors for other operating systems). I selected all of my ships and opened them at the same time, and then used the \u003Cem\u003EReplace All in All Open Documents\u003C/em\u003E button in the find-and-replace dialog. As a sanity check, there should be twice as many replacements of EngineerChipFlight to EngineerChip as there are replacements of FlightEngineer to FlightEngineerModule, because each chip itself is named twice (once by the parent part, and once by the chip itself) while the module is only named once (within the actual chip). I then found all locations of BuildEngineer and deleted each of the BuildEngineer MODULE blocks. Notepad\u002B\u002B\u0027s bracket matching feature came in very handy here!\u003Cp\u003EEditing the save file (persistent.sfs) itself was the tricky part, because when I deleted one BuildEngineer module, all of the line numbers of the subsequent modules changed, so I couldn\u0027t just jump directly to them from the search results window as I did the first. In retrospect, I should have started from the bottom and worked my way up. I\u0027m sure there\u0027s a way to automate this (Notepad\u002B\u002B has a feature for recording and executing macros, for one thing), but it didn\u0027t take more than a few minutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"}]}
