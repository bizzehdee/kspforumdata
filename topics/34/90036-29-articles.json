My point with all this is that if the other two crafts of this mod are all sharing textures in a rather efficient manner, and the ranger has to load a separate large texture that is exactly the same for each part, then there\u0027s something that needs to be addressed. I\u0027m trying to make it work in the meantime for my local copy, but in the end the developers of this mod need to decide if they\u0027re going to use an efficient way of handling models and textures or not, and not have a whole third of their project bogging the user\u0027s system down with redundant textures when the rest is more optimized. And before you say it, yes I know the endurance itself has a separate texture for each part...
