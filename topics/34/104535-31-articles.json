But that\u0027s compounded by the connection sometimes being weak (floppy) between the IR part and the part to which it\u0027s attached. This is actually a problem with all low mass parts in KSP. Based on my re-testing tonight It seems to have been improved from 1.04 to 1.05 (I just installed 1.05 yesterday), or perhaps it\u0027s only certain parts that do it.  \n\nIn any case, the second problem can be alleviated by connecting a \u003Cu\u003Ephysicsless\u003C/u\u003E part on each side of the IR part. For example (fuel tank)-(cubic octagonal strut)-(IR joint)-(cubic octagonal strut)-(fuel tank). This will at least make the joint between the IR part and its neighbours rigid."},{"CreatedByName":"allmhuran","CreatedById":66124,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-02T08:39:22Z","Content":"KOS 0.19.0 has just been released: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Kos/comments/48klw7/new_release_v0190/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kos/comments/48klw7/new_release_v0190/)  \n\nThe KOS release notes themselves don\u0027t mention anything specific about changes in IR other than a general bugfix (\u0022IR:AVAILABLE was reporting incorrectly\u0022).

I\u0027m using NeatFuture Construction for the chassis.  \n\nI figured out the problem. it has to do with weight, tweak scale, and symmetry. NTF construction hubs wont use symmetry (IE you have to place left and right separately). this seems to do something to the unity physics making the two sides not treated the same. the reason why my piston problem changed sides it because i changed which side i made first when i reversed the pistons.  \n\nas for the jittering/not responding it seems to be because i overloaded them with weight. (6 pistons holding 32 tonnes of submarine). Tweak scale doesn\u0027t seem to proportionately chance how much weight they can handle, just the size and electric draw.  \n\nI rebuilt the chassis with stock beams using symmetry and with 12 pistons on each side and it worked for lighter craft. perhaps there\u0027s a mod or a way to make IR joints handle greater weight/torque?"}]}
