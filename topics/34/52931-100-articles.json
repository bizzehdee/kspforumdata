Making it possible to disable via config would be an option, but forcing people to compile from the source just to get 64-bit enabled is just. plain. wrong. It\u0027s also a fallacy that it will \u0022fix\u0022 anything, as people dumb enough to complain to the mod author about 64-bit bugs are usually also dumb enough to complain if the mod doesn\u0027t work at all (due to being artificially disabled).
