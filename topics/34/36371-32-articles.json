For some reason, this wasn\u0027t working - blowing the fairings would separate the CSM engine from the LM payload stage - but the fairing bases would stay attached to the LM... which was now unmanned and uncontrollable. I checked all my staging and there were no errors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, this time I considered just putting the CSM engine against the LM docking port, to decouple manually after blowing the fairings. This way, I only need to use an interstage fairing at the base (because a regular fairing will cover the command module completely - including the escape tower!). The only problem I have now is that the interstage fairing sides are a straight slope from the base to the top radius - meaning the lander that would fit inside a 3.5m cylinder clips through the fairing walls about halfway up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I need is a fairing wall that goes straight up for most of the way, then tapers to the smaller diameter.
