The height map of Floorite( Essentially the bumpiness as seen from space) was wrong, I must have must up a file name. The fixed version makes the planet looks exactly how it is from space, but very... I believe \u0022Choppy\u0022 is the best word for it. The height and color maps from space is too low res to look smooth. Now the obvious solution to this issue is to simply increase the texture size form 2048x1024 to 4096x2048. This will also make the cracks in the ice much smoother and more crack-like. However, the mod is currently running at 2.26 GB with aggressive texture management installed.

One of them isn\u0027t actually a pack of any sort... and I have not mentioned and may not be mention for a while... The other one is designed for the 64bit hack, and the soon to be 64 bit version. I won\u0027t say much about it other than this... It\u0027s supposed to be a possible realistic(including size) scenario type pack using CE and Kittoptech (and possibly RSS with a blank cfg to deal with deep space kraken if that set-up works-haven\u0027t attempted that yet). The scenario is that on a large earth-like (in properties but not topography), the aliens had just terra-formed their small moon (A kerbin with only it\u0027s gravity and orbit altered) and have sent their first colony there with a space center. After the astronauts landed, a biological war-fare erupted on their home planet and all life there ended. Then from there they have to remake everything and be able to move every single surviving astronaut to another earth-like planet which has microscopic life and is habitable in another star system. AFAIK you can\u0027t make planet parameters a function of time except for cycles(such as orbits and it\u0027s rotation) but if I figure that part out by release it will probably be included.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways...
