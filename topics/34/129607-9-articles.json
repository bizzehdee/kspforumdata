to optimize his best guess for low TWR ships, but he is aware of the issue. \u00A0he built this mod primarily for KSP players who tend to build rockets with too much TWR. \u00A0That said his latest DEV version does \u0022learn\u0022 with each launch for each ship design. \u00A0 In other words the more you repeatedly launch the same ship design the better it will do at predicting the optimal

particular ship design. \u00A0It is tracking things like total loss and max critical heat, so yes, burning up is something that it will learn from.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMessing around with the AP time settings is a little hard to quantify for the guess. \u00A0Right now I\u0027m thinking of adding a special case for SRBs to extend the APTimeStart, so that the rest of the launch fades gradually down to a 40 second AP Time, instead of currently where the SRB stage will push the AP time out to a minute or more and the mod will throttle all the way back. \u00A0This will make a big improvement at least for a lot of my personal ship designs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVersion 1.3 will include this SRB feature as the only adjustment to AP Time settings. \u00A0The 1.3 guess improvements will be made only to the Start Time and Turn Angle for this version. \u00A0Later on maybe I can better quantify when/how/where/why to make other changes to the AP Time guess, but I have to take it one step at a time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mcirish3","CreatedById":50775,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-30T18:19:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDude, thank you and as always
