The second thing I\u0027d check is right-clicking on each of the wing parts once the flight scene has loaded to make sure that the cargo bays are not accidentally \u0022shielding\u0022 them from the airflow; this has been a problem in the past, and though I believe I\u0027ve solved it, the bug may still exist.\u003Cp\u003EBesides that, I\u0027d suggest placing your engines underneath the wings rather than above them (you have to fight the pitch-down moment from the engines on top of the wings currently, which will require more pitch control surface deflection, creating more drag). I\u0027d also tilt the vertical stabilizers less, since they\u0027re not being as effective as they could be (in the configuration they\u0027re in they also make the plane less stable in roll; if they were angled outward they would make it more stable in roll).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA guide is planned, but first a question to FAR users: is a .docx file good? I\u0027d like to include graphs and illustrations with a guide and that filetype is my go-to for that kind of situation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I\u0027m using a wing placed at the side of the fuselage, I usually do engines above and below the wing- you just can\u0027t see the ones on the underside. I\u0027ll try the struts method to see if it fixes the wing flex, but I\u0027ve flown some real noodles and they didn\u0027t have that odd roll tendency. I mean I was using Damned Robotics hinges, which... don\u0027t work for wings. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to the stabs: Yeah, my sense of aesthetics is constantly fighting my sense of good airframe design. Inward rudders are cool. I didn\u0027t even think about the difference in roll stability, though. That\u0027s quite helpful. (Also, on that plane the stabilizers were right in line with the CoM, so they probably weren\u0027t doing much. I\u0027m learning.
