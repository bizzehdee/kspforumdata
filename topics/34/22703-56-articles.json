(The LLL stuff has gotten even BETTER for that purpose now, I might add. It\u0027s no longer quite the chore it used to be to try and make the stuff fit the right way.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the problems I noticed was that if you make an entire LLL pod into a fuel tank, the Eagle can just BARELY lift off with it. That could obviously be a problem for heavy loads. The Eagle Mk 3 isn\u0027t as ridiculously overpowered as the Eagle mk2 was. So although it\u0027s a bit of a challenge, that\u0027s a change I approve of. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever - I thought that there SHOULD be an obvious solution to the problem of heavy loads - add VTOL thrusters to the pods. All Eagle pods should have the extra thrusters on them, right? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the Mk 2 Eagle I tried and tried to figure out a way to make that work. And I never could. I guess it makes sense. For one thing, the pods were built at 90 degrees off-angle to the Eagle and although the engines would attach just fine, they wouldn\u0027t actually activate. I think part of the problem with the Mk 2 Eagle was just the way that the VTOL activation was \u0022hard-wired\u0022 in to MechJeb. You couldn\u0027t really add extra engines to it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I started to add engines to the Mk 3 pods and ran into the same problem! I was tearing my hair out trying to clip fuel lines from the truss to the pod engines thinking that fuel flow might be the problem. No go. They\u0027d attach just fine but they wouldn\u0027t fire up. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I finally got a clue when I added the extra engines to the truss itself directly just to see what happened, and they STILL wouldn\u0027t fire. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETHAT\u0027S when I facepalmed. ACTION GROUPS!! Logan you IDIOT!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*sigh* \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah. Add the new VTOL thrusters to the same action group that Devo assigned and VOILA! They all work now! No extra fuel lines required - just make sure whatever you attach them to is crossfeed capable and you\u0027re good. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/PVOCLap.png\u0022 alt=\u0022PVOCLap.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/m3PxHk1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022m3PxHk1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/eIzOhzg.png\u0022 alt=\u0022eIzOhzg.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ccsZ5TJ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ccsZ5TJ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Passenger Pod Eagle is made purely from Lackluster Labs (LLL) parts that have been updated for KSP .22. The LLL doors on either side turn the structural pod into a space capable of carrying 16 Kerbals. (8 per door)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso - I might add that if you have those extra thrusters on a light load like the passenger pod above? It has a LOT of extra power to spare for lift and the engines throttle requirements are cut in half for getting off the ground. Since the basic Eagle is not as overpowered, I\u0027m guessing it wouldn\u0027t have as easy of a time getting off of Eve as the Mk 2 did. However - I\u0027d bet that as long as you had enough fuel, that a Mk 3 carrying a light passenger pod with the extra thrusters should be able to do it. (Might be useful for getting stranded Kerbals off of Eve, yes?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith Mechjeb 2 attached, and the mods that I made in my previous post, the Eagle has OUTSTANDING performance!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI want to point out something for anyone moving from the Mk 2 experience to the Mk 3. Remember the old \u0022nosedive\u0022 issues? Gone. But now there\u0027s a Nose UP tendency. However it\u0027s not as instant. And it actually helps offset heavier loads, which I think was the point. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll take the nose up over a nose dive any day. A nose pitch UP doesn\u0027t instantly put you in danger like a nose dive would. The pitch up on the Mk 3 also is a bit slower to happen than the nosedive of the Mk 2. Which gives you more time to react to it and correct for it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen operating with Mechjeb 2.0 it\u0027s an absolute dream to fly, even with a load. It\u0027s easily manageable to orbit and has plenty of control. Mind you - you do want to keep the RCS on a little more with the Mk3. But the over-correcting wobble I experienced in purely manual flight is damped right out when flying with Mechjeb\u0027s Kill Rotation and Surf features and RCS use is minimal. Just enough to correct for any pitch-up that occurs and damp it right out. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the fact that you can REFUEL the Eagles now! That\u0027s just awesome. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact, take a look - remember the Kethane prospecting unit from previous posts of mine? It\u0027s a lot more streamlined and useful now. Check it out -\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/aGkjEhf.png\u0022 alt=\u0022aGkjEhf.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/l6N0gKl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022l6N0gKl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Kethane Prospector Pod requires the LLL, Kethane, and Kerbal Attachment System (KAS) mods that have been updated for .22. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the front end of the pod is the Kethane Cracking unit. Right behind that is the Kethane Storage tank. Attached to the sides of that are the drilling units, solar panels for extra power, and a pair of KAS storage boxes that have pipes and struts for use in refueling other vehicles and some more solar panels you can add, just in case. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBehind the Kethane tank is the bay that holds the Kethane sensor. Technically the doors don\u0027t HAVE to be open for the Kethane sensor to work, but they sure do make right clicking for activation a lot easier! Behind the Sensor bay is an RCS tank and a Fuel tank. I\u0027ve attached a pair of hatches as well that in LLL style define a small lab/living area for more kerbals. This isn\u0027t a passenger pod, but there\u0027s still room for 6 Kerbals back there if you need to mount a rescue mission. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have one of these currently orbiting the Mun after a full refuel. It\u0027s ready to depart and I\u0027m thinking of sending it off to Duna. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the Kethane Prospector pod in place, you have a powerful ship that can refuel anywhere that it can detect Kethane. It has effectively unlimited range. you could mount a complete \u0022Grand Tour\u0022 of the entire Kerbol system just with that ship right there. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMind you - there\u0027s still a slight problem. Releasing those pods is now possible - the parts no longer clip and blow up the ship if you release them from their mounting points. But they may fall apart still and there\u0027s no guarantee that you can redock properly with them. But if you HAD to get rid of them, you could do so safely. I\u0027m still working on making versions that can be picked back up again. I\u0027m having to redo a lot of stuff from scratch. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway. Aside from fully integrating the Eagle parts into the .22 tech tree, I\u0027d call the Mk 3 Eagle pretty much DONE. Everything about the performance issues of the Mk 1 and 2 has been addressed properly and it can fly properly - and refuel! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s only one thing left - and that\u0027s the authentic Eagle pods from the source material itself. But considering that you can build your own now, I\u0027ll be satisfied even if that never shows up. One suggestion to Devo if you ever do make them - the pod landing gear should be usable with other style pods than the Space 1999 versions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it\u0027s pretty clear how I built those pods just by looking at them.

The pods I was working on I just got over putting the detail into them as time went on, but yes they do have 4 x animated landing legs for underneath.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHows this for a compromise? I make the legs seperate so you can throw them on the LLL pod?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E \u003Cp\u003EAbsolutely! That\u0027s really the main obstacle to making pods - no current landing gear works with them! Or at least no landing gear works that looks GOOD. Sure - you can add landing legs to the sides of the pods, but... bleagh... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo now we can give the pods the thrusters, landing gear etc. We\u0027re pretty much golden as far as functionality. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe LLL pods are fantastic and you can make one as seen above that\u0027s 85-90% of the Eagle pod look. You know what I\u0027m thinking though? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou don\u0027t need to model the whole pod. But what makes the Eagle pods have the right look is really that top section that the truss fits snugly into. Maybe the bottom plate as well. the slab sides of the pods and doors can be handled by the LLL parts just fine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I have a couple of ideas: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbsolute minimal modeling option for looks: Model JUST the windows alone. Cause the LLL parts are great - but they aren\u0027t the \u0022tri-window\u0022 look of the Eagle windows. ( Hell - maybe just take the LLL strip windows there and put \u0022stripes\u0022 on them to divide them - that\u0027s what the model makers did for the original eagle models! LOL! )\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore involved: Make those angled top sides of the Eagle Pods - the parts with the windows - and make them as separate strips that you can fit along the sides of the truss - or attached to the top sides of another pod. That way you get the look of the truss sitting snug in the \u0022bracket\u0022 and the slight overhang of the sides when it\u0027s actually an illusion. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore involved still: Make a unified top plate that the LLL parts can clip to. Maybe make a bottom slab that adds just that little \u0022underhang\u0022 of the pods and has the underside details similar to what\u0027s on the main truss body of the Eagle. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain - NONE of the above is necessary. Just ideas I\u0027m tossing out. Cause I have no idea of the complexity of modeling involved. Again - I\u0027ll just be happy with the legs themselves for functionality. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI AM finishing the eagle IVA! it\u0027s on my bucket list haha, It\u0027s 50 percent done, I didn\u0027t stop it for any reason just never got round to finishing it, the eagle was really going to be a long term project as the munbase alpha is now even more possible with kerbtown plugin.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOH.

Sirkut and I are also working with Zodiusinfuser on some more infernal robotics parts, im plugging away at the Serenity like mad, I am studying Helldivers advice in his thread to try and make Serenity the best I can. I have cut alot of the modules down.\u003Cp\u003EAll my previous ships I always tried (sometimes not that apparent) to make the parts somewhat compatible with other stock parts. Not all, but at least in most of my packs there is something that can be used on another ship. With the Serenity I am not worrying about any of that for once. The ship is the ship. If you want to add parts to it cool, but the only thing you will be able to really take off the Serenity is the Cockpit and engines. The fuel tank is embedded in the ship, the landing legs are so specialised they really just won\u0027t go on any other craft effectively. So far, it\u0027s the most detailed thing I\u0027ve worked on in both modelling and textures. I usually think \u0022Yeah, thats good enough \u0022 when I make a part, but with this ...

The Eagle works mostly unmodified because it\u0027s already that \u0022off-white\u0022 we\u0027re familiar with. It\u0027s one of a handful of Sci-Fi ships that already pretty much looks \u0022Kerbal\u0022 already. (Others I can think of - The Discovery - some of the UFO stuff - The original Star Trek series Enterprise - the Star Wars and (original) Galactica ships etc.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut with Serenity it would just look WRONG to have it be modeled with those textures. It\u0027s a combination of highly reflective surfaces (solar panels I think) brushed metal, and industrial. And for all that it\u0027s a glorified cargo hauler, it\u0027s one of the most graceful ships in Sci-Fi I can imagine. \u0022I am a leaf on the wind, watch me soar!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-31T07:27:36Z\u0022 title=\u002210/31/2013 07:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 31, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Logan.Darklighter\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Devo","CreatedById":22750,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-31T07:26:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYep, exactly my thought, I don\u0027t want to do it grey, white or even glossy white. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is my dream, and my dream I shall have...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.devogeninteractive.com/picup/image.php?id=6284_52720617\u0026amp;jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022image.php?id=6284_52720617\u0026amp;jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UltraVires","CreatedById":57675,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-31T21:44:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EStill lots of awesome goodness in this thread! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGreat work with the eagle pods Logan, I\u0027m impressed, as always. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E and thanks for the craft files, the Kethane Eagle is unstoppable!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan\u0027t wait till your done with Serenity Devo.

After seeing Lack\u0027s fantastic addition (thanks again, Lack!), I\u0027ve spent a little more time updating my pods and I came up with a couple of new ones. Which I\u0027ll share a link to below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst is the modified Passenger pod with the spiffy new windows seen above. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext - If you use the Kerbal Attachment System, an Eagle with a whole bunch of parts to use could definitely be a great help in fueling or even repairing ships and habitats.

Lights, and even some solar panels. Or you could make your own arrangement. (But be CAREFUL with the weight distribution! Load it up too much on one side and not the other and you might find things getting... difficult.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext up is a slight modification to the Kethane Prospector. I put the crew cabins up forward (makes more sense if you\u0027re using the Crew Manifest to move kerbals around inside the ship). Also gave it an extra pair of inherent solar panels (and a couple more in the KAS boxes just in case) for use in keeping power levels up when using the Kethane cracking unit. All my Eagles have inherent RTGs tucked away under the trusses, so they can regenerate power easily. But those solar panels really make a difference. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/uYSCAcG.png\u0022 alt=\u0022uYSCAcG.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext on the list is a standard passenger pod Eagle modified with an R4 Boat parts docking unit in case you want to land it on the carrier and dock up.

The docking part is clipped into the underside. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd lastly - something I\u0027m working on that isn\u0027t quite finished up yet. The Eagle Booster pod.

(You can replace the doors with an airlock port of some kind so the Eagle can dock to your station of choice.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not finished yet because I\u0027m still deciding how to reinforce the pod internally. the extra engines need a little bracing.

I\u0027ve found that I LOVE that mod. And it\u0027s allowed me to remove the ladder from the command pod. Since I can get Kerbals back into the ships just using the doors on the side. If you don\u0027t have Crew manifest and don\u0027t want to add it then you might want to add the ladders back to the command pods. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve made an updated pack of stuff for Kerbal Eagle enthusiasts.

Lastly - I\u0027ve added into the pack all the pods as sub-assemblies in case you want to swap out in the hanger that way.
