So, You can go there and harvest it and come back Kerbin to sell it making a good profit.\n\n-= Description =-\n\n5dim Helium-3 Space mining is a mod that add a new resource: He-3.\n\nThis resource is located in all planets and moons except Kerbin and Minmus. You can detect and harvest it with vanilla parts, He-3 can be store in Xenon tanks, you can switch between xenon and He-3.\n\n The value of He-3 in Kerbin is really good but not too high, so you can earn money doing spacial mining but this mod dont break the career mode.\n\n![He-3.png](http://5dim.es/kerbal/He-3.png)\n\n-= Download =-\n\nYou can download it from [Curse Forge](http://kerbal.curseforge.com/ksp-mods/229977-helium-3-resource)\n\n-= Requirements =-\n\nThis mod needs [ModuleManager](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55219) and[Interstelar fuel Switch](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117932) but ALL are include in the mod.\n\n-=Recommended mods =-\n\n-= Changelog =-\n\n[v0.2] [2015-5-13] - \n\n- Added He-3 to asteorid\n\n- Minor fixes.\n\n[v0.2] [2015-05-2] - \n\n- Added InterstellarFuelSwitch to Switch between xenon/He-3 \n\n[v0.1] [2015-04-30] - \n\n- Release\n\n-= License =-\n\n5dim Helium-3 Space mining is licensed under [CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/)\n\n-=Notes =-\n\nThanks to [ModuleManager](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55219) to do it possible.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-12T22:19:14Z\u0022 title=\u002205/12/2015 10:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by odin\\_spain**"},{"CreatedByName":"rabidninjawombat","CreatedById":108889,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T22:18:44Z","Content":"Your link is bad cant download.
