The issue manifests itself like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I have a large tank as a long burning primary stage which is then boosted off the pad by liquid or solid boosters. I\u0027ve got the fuel quantities and thrust limiters set so that as the boosters expire, I\u0027ve still got about half of my DV left in the core stage with about 4-6 mins of burn left and a TWR of between .7 and 1 (yes, I know that\u0027s still high, but it seems to work for me). All of the DV / TWR values are established using both engineer and MJ together. Anyway, with certain engine / fuel configurations, I\u0027m getting all sorts of strange behavior. First off, the fuel in the core stage drains much faster than it should, leading to the vehicle losing first stage DV AND second stage DV at the same time, sometimes depleting a 500,000L tank in about 2 minutes even though the thrust limiter is such that the tank should give an 8 minute burn. In addition to this, I\u0027ve noticed that rockets with TWRs as low as .8 can lift off with acceleration akin to a vehicle with a TWR closer to 1.5-1.7. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not really sure what\u0027s going wrong here. The only time I\u0027ve ever seen something like this is when I wrote a MM config to add the crossfeed enable module to all the procedural fuel tanks, which led to a situation where my core stage was feeding my booster stages in a reverse asparagus arrangement, but I\u0027ve since removed that config and anyway this occurs with solid boosters as well as liquid, meaning its unlikely that the solid boosters would be stealing liquid fuel from the core stage. I don\u0027t think this would explain the mismatched TWR either. This also only seems to happen with certain engines / configurations, so I\u0027m wondering if it might be an issue in the configs for those specific engines. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, any thoughts / help would be appreciated here as it\u0027s getting quite frustrating trying to build launch vehicles when the DV shown in the editor and on the pad isn\u0027t the same DV experienced in flight.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-15T13:11:44Z\u0022 title=\u002207/15/2014 01:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 15, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by SpacedInvader\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Raptor831","CreatedById":68286,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-15T17:28:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SpacedInvader\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SpacedInvader\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo I\u0027m running into an odd problem and I\u0027m really not sure what could be causing it.
