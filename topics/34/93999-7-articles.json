First up is Sarnus, which will get a slew of new moons in 1.3. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst I want to share our vision for this mod and how that translates into what moons we and won\u0027t make. Our first goal with this mod is to extend the Kerbol system with planets and moons that have the distinctive Kerbal style, but like the stock celestial bodies are also grounded in reality. While I can\u0027t ensure that all the science works out, we\u0027ve tried to keep our moons as realistic and believable as possible. To do that we\u0027ve drawn inspiration from real-life moons and scientific concepts, but still allowed for some Kerbal flair.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOur second goal was to have each moon feel unique. Some real-life inspirations allowed that without much change, but others had already been emulated by an existing planet or moon in KSP. The most clear example of this is our Titan analog. Eve and Laythe both covered much what makes Titan unique, so for us there was little incentive to make a true Titan analog, as that would just be an Eve/Laythe combo that wouldn\u0027t feel that new. So our stand-in for Titan, Slate, will only be a partial analog.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe third goal was quality over quantity. Don\u0027t expect dozens of new moons in this mod. It\u0027ll just be a handful of very well done moons that are each unique and exciting to explore.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003ENow we have that behind us, let\u0027s meet the new moons:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHale\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA small moon about half the size of Gilly that orbits in the rings of Sarnus. One side of the moon can often be seen from the other which, due to the irregular shape of its terrain, makes you feel like you\u0027re constantly standing on the edge of a cliff. Luckily there\u0027s not really an up and down in Hale\u0027s low gravity, meaning you can\u0027t fall of side of the moon. And if you do and bounce your way into an escape trajectory, you can easily use your trusted jet pack to get back to solid ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EReal-life inspiration: Saturn\u0027s shepherd moons\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOvok\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwice as large as Gilly, but due to its unusual composition it has a nearly perfectly smooth surface and a gravity as low as Hale\u0027s.

Eeloo was always a poor analog of Pluto, even with the sparse data we have on our favorite dwarf planet. It does however make a great Enceladus analog. So we decided to move Eeloo to a place which better suits its look and composition. In a future update, we\u0027ll make something that does the Pluto system analog justice and perhaps also takes into account the discoveries that New Horizons will make in the coming months. For the moment, there\u0027s a dwarf planet called Plock with the same orbital characteristics of Eeloo in version 1.0-1.2.1 of OPM.

First up is Sarnus, which will get a slew of new moons in 1.3. \u003Cp\u003EFirst I want to share our vision for this mod and how that translates into what moons we and won\u0027t make. Our first goal with this mod is to extend the Kerbol system with planets and moons that have the distinctive Kerbal style, but like the stock celestial bodies are also grounded in reality. While I can\u0027t ensure that all the science works out, we\u0027ve tried to keep our moons as realistic and believable as possible. To do that we\u0027ve drawn inspiration from real-life moons and scientific concepts, but still allowed for some Kerbal flair.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOur second goal was to have each moon feel unique. Some real-life inspirations allowed that without much change, but others had already been emulated by an existing planet or moon in KSP. The most clear example of this is our Titan analog. Eve and Laythe both covered much what makes Titan unique, so for us there was little incentive to make a true Titan analog, as that would just be an Eve/Laythe combo that wouldn\u0027t feel that new. So our stand-in for Titan, Slate, will only be a partial analog.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe third goal was quality over quantity. Don\u0027t expect dozens of new moons in this mod. It\u0027ll just be a handful of very well done moons that are each unique and exciting to explore.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003ENow we have that behind us, let\u0027s meet the new moons:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHale\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA small moon about half the size of Gilly that orbits in the rings of Sarnus. One side of the moon can often be seen from the other which, due to the irregular shape of its terrain, makes you feel like you\u0027re constantly standing on the edge of a cliff. Luckily there\u0027s not really an up and down in Hale\u0027s low gravity, meaning you can\u0027t fall of side of the moon. And if you do and bounce your way into an escape trajectory, you can easily use your trusted jet pack to get back to solid ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EReal-life inspiration: Saturn\u0027s shepherd moons\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOvok\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwice as large as Gilly, but due to its unusual composition it has a nearly perfectly smooth surface and a gravity as low as Hale\u0027s.

Eeloo was always a poor analog of Pluto, even with the sparse data we have on our favorite dwarf planet. It does however make a great Enceladus analog. So we decided to move Eeloo to a place which better suits its look and composition. In a future update, we\u0027ll make something that does the Pluto system analog justice and perhaps also takes into account the discoveries that New Horizons will make in the coming months. For the moment, there\u0027s a dwarf planet called Plock with the same orbital characteristics of Eeloo in version 1.0-1.2.1 of OPM.
