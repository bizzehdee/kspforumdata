If you don\u0027t have infinite EVA fuel enabled, it might very well be due to some rounding issue. Since KrakensBane keeps the coordinates of the active vessel at (0,0,0), moving the rest of the universe around it (think: Futurama), the coordinates for Kerbin would contain a couple of very large numbers, and would be traveling at very high speeds.

The 60GM dish should be sufficient for Duna area. On your own satellite that is doing the science around or past Duna, make sure that you also have a similarly long range dish and that it is directed to Kerbin. Depending on the transmission cone (0.04 degrees, 0.06 degrees, etc) it might not be transmitting at a large enough cone to reach one of your geo-sats.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn map view, have your long range dish target Kerbin and then zoom out and look at kerbin. You should see a thin white line extending from your science satellite to the Kerbin area and surrounding the planet with 2 lines, a transmission cone. You should be able to link up with a kerbin satellite if they are in range of that cone. More importantly, both your science satellite and your kerbin communication satellites need to have antenna/dishes with adequate range. If you\u0027re 55GM away, both your science sat and the comm-sat you want to link up with need to have an antenna of at least that range, and be pointing to each other either directly or to a planet and be in range of the signal cone. Your ship has a large antenna dish - make sure that is the one pointing back to kerbin. If that fails, try making the large dish target the a communication satellite instead of kerbin. Also make sure that those satellites have Line of Sight to the science satellite you have. If your satellite with a long range dish targeting active vessel is being blocked by a moon, it will break contact.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf all is good, in map view, you should have a solid green/yellow line connecting your satellite to Mission Control back on Kerbin, hooping through a few satellites to make the link-up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jivaii","CreatedById":75048,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-02T22:13:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Jagger\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Jagger\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI have been having some serious problems with this mod...

The current release of mechjeb conflicts with RT2, and the problem is in MJ\u0027s code, not RT2\u0027s. If you download the latest dev-build of MJ it seems to fix the problem - I am using MechJeb2-2.1.0.0-118 instead of the release version and am having no more problems with throttle jitter, and you don\u0027t need to turn off signal delay. MechJeb simply ignores the signal delay though, which is kind of bummer.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cilph","CreatedById":21477,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-03T12:51:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETomorrow I hear if I can start in the wonderful world of java web applications.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack to work on RT for now, I guess ^^?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrying to add the focus switching to the regular map view.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-03T14:55:18Z\u0022 title=\u002212/03/2013 02:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 3, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Cilph\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-03T15:25:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Cilph\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Cilph\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ETomorrow I hear if I can start in the wonderful world of java web applications.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood to hear! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(It is, is it not? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E )\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat would I have to do to enable the small dish in \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/43840-Hab-Hub-%28and-other-strange-things%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis mods science tank\u003C/a\u003E to make use of RT?
