Loading the game with OpenGL rendering, I have seen less of an issue with the game. It is still slower/more jittery than 32 bit KSP but the mod compliment that I currently have in, without ATM/Texture replacer, puts the address space usage up to 5,294MB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Edit* After I wrote that, I got the game to crash at around 10GB. Even if you are using the x64 version, Texture Replacer\u0027s ability to do compression helps a lot. So even if you don\u0027t use it for anything else, at least use it for the compression. You can also use ATM basic on top of that too, the savings are quite interesting.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-21T20:52:45Z\u0022 title=\u002208/21/2014 08:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 21, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by NoPersona\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdditional information added.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BrotatoSalad","CreatedById":119211,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-21T17:01:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI just got KAS today for the first time to straighten out my wobbly interplanetary ship.
