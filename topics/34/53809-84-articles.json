In truth, a game like this should use less ram and more CPU and VPU/VRAM. In my experience, when a mod like this breaks due to new version, the first thing to do is identify the changes that would affect the mod, then work your way down.

Just discovered that myself. \u0022-force-opengl\u0022 rocks for me too. Saved ~1.5GB in RAM leading to, hopefully, longer play session without the \u0022around-3.5GB-boundary-crash-in-32-bit\u0022. As a side note, some texture were not showing properly with KSP 0.25 while they were okay on 0.24. They were also okay in Direct X mode for both version: Namely some from the ScanSAT mod and a few from the Karbonite mod. All were Targa files. I just loaded them in GIMP, converted them to PNG and the problem was gone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also noted that RAM usage on the GPU was way up in OpenGL mode compared to Direct X: now goes over 1.5GB versus roughly 700-800mb with Direct X.

(it work if windowed btw)\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhat I have noticed, check the crash log it makes. It seems too me on my .25 running with OpenGL is overloading VRAM and causing vidcard to crash. When I ran with dx9 I get crash do to lack of ram. Full screen takes more VRAM than windowed that is why windowed works and full screen don\u0027t. If you have 1 gig vram or less a crash from lack of vram is most likely the cause.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a side note, I noticed today after installing all the same mods on both a 24.2 and .25 version of the game, on the 24.2 when game is loading ATM runs first and takes 3-5 mins before every thing else loads, on .25 I never see ATM in the loading bar,there for ATM must not be working as we all figured, this just goes towards confirming that. Also, running ATM on .25 may make your game crash more until it is fixed for .25 because it does build the texture cache and the game loads both the full size textures and the compressed ones, causing more crashes on my end any way, results may vary of course. I am running 24.2 until this is fixed because I can\u0027t live with out my mods and my system is too weak and/or game is to power hungry. I am on constant ATM forum watch until it is fixed, I just hope it is not going to be too big of a PITA to fix, I would feel awful for it\u0027s maker if it is. As far as any words to him, take your time, I think I speak for all this mods users when I say we are more than happy to wait for you in super chill mode \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_kiss.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:kiss:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
