Me and two very smart and funny people created a base of an add-on for KSP this weekend as part of the International Space Apps Challenge, and would like to share it with you.\n\nSome info on the International Space Apps Challenge:\n\nChallenge info: [https://2015.spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/asteroids-2025-2100-future-history/](https://2015.spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/asteroids-2025-2100-future-history/)\n\nOur project: [https://2015.spaceappschallenge.org/project/explore-capture-and-redirect-real-asteroids-in-kerbal-space-program/](https://2015.spaceappschallenge.org/project/explore-capture-and-redirect-real-asteroids-in-kerbal-space-program/)\n\n**What is it?**\n\nShort explanation of our add-on it is that we used three mods, CustomAsteroids, Kopernicus and ContractConfigurator, and then built content using these mods.\n\nThe content we\u0027ve created is adding asteroids and missions, based on **REAL asteroids** (currently not exactly right but close) and **REAL missions** ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nWhat we\u0027ve added:\n\n**Asteroids:**\n\n101955 Bennu, AKA 1999 RQ\u003Csub\u003E36\u003C/sub\u003E\n\nDionysus\n\n90 Antiope\n\n**Missions:**\n\nCollect Asteroid Science\n\nCrash into Asteroid\n\nRendezvous with Asteroid\n\nSurface EVA on Asteroid\n\n**Why those asteroids?**\n\nBecause they\u0027re cool!\n\nBennu is currently being evaluated for the ARM mission, and will also be the target for the OSIRIS-REx mission.\n\nDionysus is fun to add into the game because it has an interesting and challenging orbit.\n\n90 Antiope is a binary asteroid, and can therefore be a fun target for missions where you have to go to both celestial bodies.\n\n**Screenshots:**\n\n![EerYCib.png](http://i.imgur.com/EerYCib.png)\n\n![Q8puQGm.png](http://i.imgur.com/Q8puQGm.png)\n\n![EKYNWtb.png](http://i.imgur.com/EKYNWtb.png)\n\n![TyHpoLE.png](http://i.imgur.com/TyHpoLE.png)\n\nMore screens here: [http://imgur.com/a/ws9Wb](http://imgur.com/a/ws9Wb)\n\nThese are very much a work in progress, we learnt a lot throughout the weekend and are looking forward to adding more content in there.\n\nThe add-on can be found here: [https://github.com/jonasrosland/KSP-Real-Asteroids](https://github.com/jonasrosland/KSP-Real-Asteroids) under the MIT license.\n\n**TODO:**\n\n- Figure out if it\u0027s possible to stop the spawning of a specific asteroid after it\u0027s been spawned once, using CustomAsteroids. We\u0027ve created Bennu in CustomAsteroids and would like it to only appear once ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n- Create more asteroids like Dionysus and 90 Antiope\n- Since Bennu **also** is a binary system (with a much smaller moon), we might create that using Kopernicus as well\n- Fix the asteroid orbit, mass and rotation data to correspond correctly with the real ones. Right now the settings are close but not entirely correct\n- See if we can create a version for Real Solar System as well\n- Fix the missions to work flawlessly\n- Create an automated tool for creation of Kopernicus configuration files from the data found at [http://www.minorplanetcenter.net/iau/MPCORB.html](http://www.minorplanetcenter.net/iau/MPCORB.html)\n\nLet us know what you think!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-13T20:16:02Z\u0022 title=\u002204/13/2015 08:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by jonasrosland**"},{"CreatedByName":"nightingale","CreatedById":119307,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T20:14:16Z","Content":"This looks awesome!

That may be one solution to the issue of generating multiple asteroids with Custom Asteroids (as well as allowing you to generate asteroids that aren\u0027t in solar orbit). Note however that this ties you to the contract system, which you may or may not want.\n\nOh, and the functionality for generating asteroids via Contract Configurator is technically already available via [SpawnVessel](https://github.com/jrossignol/ContractConfigurator/wiki/Behaviours#spawnvessel), but would require that you create a .craft file for the asteroid."},{"CreatedByName":"jonasrosland","CreatedById":140857,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-14T00:17:54Z","Content":"I think if we were to tie a specific asteroid (like Bennu) to a specific mission (like OSIRIS-REx) that would make a lot of sense, and I\u0027d gladly test things out for you.\n\nAlso, SpawnVessel could be fun to play with where you can create **alien** vessels that may or may not be abandoned, sending out some sort of signal and it\u0027s up to you, brave Kerbal, to rendezvous with it and gather science.

I stumbled upon this after reading about the osiris-rex mission NASA is doing and thought it would be cool to have real asteroids in KSP instead of randoms. Like the planets it would let users see the orbits of asteroids and get a sense of where in space they are. This mod sounds super cool and I\u0027m hoping someone is still around to pick it back up and make it current. Maybe even put it on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003Eckan\u003C/abbr\u003E."}]}
