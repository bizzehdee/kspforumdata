You are able to transfer ANY science to the containers because you can manually collect everything by hand anyways if you wanted to take the time.

Halve the size of the part = 1/8 the ScienceCapacity, double the size of the part = 8 times as muhc ScienceCapacity. The \u00223\u0022 is an exponent applied to the factor by which you are rescaling the part (factor of 1/2 and 2, respectively, in my example), then multiplied by whatever ScienceCapacity the part originally had.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could change that exponent too, though, or you could even define specific values for ScienceCapacity at a given part size.
