If I\u0027m reading it right, it\u0027s loading every .SFS file in the current save folder and checking the AGextScenario number inside it against the filename of AGext#####.cfg. It then deletes any AGext#####.cfg file that isn\u0027t either A) the AGextScenario number or \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E the AGextScenario number - 1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem I see with that is that there are no checks in place to make sure that \u0022persistent.sfs\u0022 is the only file actually checked; it will follow the above procedure for every .SFS file without stopping. The quicksave file also contains an AGextScenario number, as do (in my case, anyways) a grand total of 18 other .SFS files created at various times in the last week (some of them backups automatically created by Kerbal Alarm Clock, some created by me). This results in the procedure will loop 20 times with 20 different AGextScenario numbers and wipe any and all AGext#####.cfg files out in the process.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI might suggest keeping only a current, backup, and quicksave version of the .cfg file rather than the numbering system. Short term, this could probably be fixed by only loading persistent.sfs and no other save files when checking for AGextScenario, or saving a list of all AGextScenario numbers found and doing all the file deletion post-loop (which would keep a current and backup .cfg for each .sfs file found, which was probably the original intention).
