Seemed from reading the stretchytanks threads there was an issue with MFT there, but now i\u0027m less sure. All my symmetric engine configurations have off-balance thrust, with random variations upon game reload / ship change.

Do all these vehicles use fuel lines? Does the issue continue if you remove the fuel lines and manually pump fuel (if necessary)?

Then it doesn\u0027t matter where you place the chutes the craft will always tend to fly at the orientation of the lowest drag without parachutes.

The camera shifts to accomodate the change in CoM, so the game thinks the pieces are still physically attached to the rocket (and in fact they will still function, fuel lines and struts still link them, and no damage shows in the log).
