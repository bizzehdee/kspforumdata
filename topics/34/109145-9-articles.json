Could you post the output log? Also, was this a one time thing for that plane, or is it happening for any plane using that engine?\n\nEdit: Poking at the engine some, I know what happened - the engine is running out of Intakeair, and rewatching your video it looked like you were using a single radial Air intake; while the resource panel looks like it has a decent supply, it was showing .03 of .05 Intake Air. The stutter is the engine flaming out, then getting enough IntakeAir since the engine isn\u0027t running, using it all and flaming out again over and over. Throttling down slightly, flying slightly lower, or using more intakes will solve the stutter.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-19T00:18:59Z\u0022 title=\u002206/19/2015 12:18  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SuicidalInsanity**"},{"CreatedByName":"Toyotawolf","CreatedById":75259,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T03:28:23Z","Content":"So is it a known bug that the SR-71 cockpit doesn\u0027t allow you to access the kerbals? there aren\u0027t even any portraits"},{"CreatedByName":"Svm420","CreatedById":136047,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T04:56:39Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E So is it a known bug that the SR-71 cockpit doesn\u0027t allow you to access the kerbals? there aren\u0027t even any portraits\n\nNot a bug.

First, it keeps the RAM footprint down, and second, I\u0027m not a texture artist; I\u0027m passingly competent at getting my ancient copy of PaintShop to do what I need of it, but any attempt at custom textures has a good chance of looking worse than what things are like now. That said, I understand your concerns, and I have remodeled and retextured several parts already; I can take a look and see where UV map improvements can be made, or where possible custom textures might work, but any texture improvements wouldn\u0027t appear before version 1.5 at the soonest.\n\n@Kolago;Aargh!

A shame it took me so long to find out about them; they look like they would be quite fun to use.\n\n@LitaAlto;Technically, yes. The old NTR and Project Pluto research gave me some inspiration back when I was making the Pluto NTR. I needed a name for it, so I used Pluto as a working name, which stuck. Of course, later, when I\u0027m making a NTJ which is much closer to the original PP spces, and need a name, Pluto is already taken... I suppose I could switch the names, so Rontgen becomes the NTR, and Pluto becomes the jet, but that might result in some confusion.\n\n@\\*Aqua\\*; Becoming stock would be nice, but that is ultimately Squad\u0027s decision. As for a ramp, I was considering several possible variations for my upcoming Mk3 expansion pack, but I never thought about one for Mk2.
