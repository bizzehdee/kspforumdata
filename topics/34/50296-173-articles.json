What\u0027s the best ascent profile for the recent version of DE? I\u0027m a new player. Trying to maintain low speed and making a smooth gravity turn makes velocity vector fall down the horizon. Increasing thrust makes the rocket fall apart. Struts and fuel lines go first, that makes further flight almost impossible.

Also try to build my rocket as aerodynamic as possible.\u003Cp\u003EShall I just go straight up to the upper atmosphere and then make a pitchover maneuver?

Question for you Starwaster. I am playing on a resized system so LKO velocity is around 4500m/s. I just dd a re entry with the mk1 pod as a test. Periapsis set to 25km wanted 20 but decoupler threw it off. I survived the re entry but ran out of ablator at about 50km up still from the high velocities. As an aside, my pod\u0027s skinTemp rose to 1460s I saw in the cfg it was supposed to have a depleted maxtemp of 1200 should that apply to skin as well? I was wondering what changes I could try to slow down the ablation rate. I loved the easy setting back in the pre 1.0 DR when you introduced it with the alternate heat model I believe I had used that to tweak ablation using a resized sytem.
