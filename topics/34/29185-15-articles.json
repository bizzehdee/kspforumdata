Filled with LF\u002BOX it has a mass of 13.59 tonnes and filled with only 3.49 tonnes, so about a quarter of the LF\u002BOX configuration.

If you want to do that stick with LF\u002BOX as those are the densest fuels. It has nothing to do with the NERVA is nerfed with this, as your assumptions aren\u0027t working then: NERVA use super light LH2 but the same amount of mass then before. So consequently it uses much more volume compared to other fuels. And the mass of the engine is only a secondary concern and it is the stock mass so nothing has changed.

Something is WRONG with the mod or the config stats.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI dont know very much about how this mod is doing the math, but if someone show me maybe I can help to find where is the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe same goes for you: What could be wrong with this mod? This mod defines the density of LH2, the specific impulse of the LV-N and the thrust of the LV-N. KSP itself then calculates the mass used to generate the given thrust with the given specific impulse and then calculates the volume with the calculated mass and the given density.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFabian\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AngelLestat","CreatedById":58968,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-02T13:49:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDo you know the big orange tank on the space shuttle?! This is ALL the fuel the Space Shuttle used during ascent and nothing else. And now imagine that most of the tank was for the LH2 while only in the tip was the LOX tank. The LOX tank has a volume of 553 m\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B3 and stored 629 t while the LH2 tank had a volume of 1 497 m\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B3 but stored only 106 t.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei know very well the structure of the space shuttle tank, and that is an example that shows that I am right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe size of the space shuttle is 1/2 the size of the orange tank. And in my example I have a tank that has 100 times more volume than the pod, using a NERVA engine with more ISP than the space shuttle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd it does not matter if I use different tanks or nerva engine sizes, the delta V always sucks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo..

That the problem is in how KSP do the math? What is the DLL for?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe are getting less than the 1/4 of delta V that we should get using h2 and nerva.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI dont have any experiencie modifying dll or other engine game files. But maybe we need to add new algorithm depending what kind of fuel is using it. Or.... change the isp value of the nerva engines, with some crazy value like 3000 just to maintain realism and balance.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
