For several reasons it made sense to try it with the upper first.\n\nAt very least, my hunch is for a Munar surface mission we would need it, however it could probably be half capacity of what is shown above.\n\nAnother KSP technical variable... in order to contain the payload as shown in the notional diagram you presented, an entirely new part would need to be made, and it would not be possible for it to be procedural: the \u0022up and angled in\u0022 fairing. Also the merits of such a design may not prove out when they cut metal. It might make sense to use the angled fairing volume for a dangled engine, allowing a cross brace as shown here, similar to the roof of a house having a brace under the pitch. Orion is a hefty sum to be waving around atop a composite, multi angle, bifurcating system.\n\nHowever, if it were feasible, could we potentially run the fairing all the way up to the LES get rid of the SM fairing?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-16T03:42:42Z\u0022 title=\u002208/16/2015 03:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by YANFRET**"},{"CreatedByName":"Budgie","CreatedById":13840,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-16T13:01:37Z","Content":"I would argue that in the real world, that would make the most sense, in regards to running the angled fairing all the way up, unless it\u0027s bearing the load of the Orion, as I may have (erroneously?) heard elsewhere. \n\nIn our KSP world, Budgie Aerospace Contracting has run various studies and advises Chaka Monkey Exploration Systems that it may be best to keep the everything above the angled fairings separate and common to all systems featuring Orion, as SLS Block IIB will not be the only system offered by CMES with an Orion payload. \n\nAlso, is that upper stage common to other CMES craft files?

It is used for example on all EMLV I vehicles.\n\nAdding it was an idea to fill the space inside the shortened angles failing with something shorter then the ICPS.\n\nAs far as stage balancing is concerned, I think the lower capacity version would be more efficient overall than what we pictured above.\n\nAlso keep in mind NASA can only show pictures if what the legislature says it can, the moon surface is not on the table and they are prohibited by law from showing pictures of Altair in any config, and reaching the moon surface without A) MLS style advanced boosters or ![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) a mini upper like we added, might restrict mission mass too far if the classic Ares lander baseline is assumed ( keep in mind that config used the Altair to get polar access )"},{"CreatedByName":"Budgie","CreatedById":13840,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-17T14:02:12Z","Content":"That last point makes a lot of sense, hadn\u0027t thought about it that way.

I can just take one of your builds and tweak it a bit for the mission and I\u0027m off to the races! Great stuff...\n\u003E \n\u003E Yep, it took a few days of messing around. The biggest piece of the puzzle was adding specific scale values for the larger fairing, so that the original part is stretched left to right but not up and down. Then we had to tweak and trim things just the right way for all the edges to line up the way we want. \n\u003E \n\u003E You\u0027re welcome to test it out with this beta zip of the CMES/Aero folder [https://www.dropbox.com/s/goq872gds6jo7xn/Aero.zip?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/goq872gds6jo7xn/Aero.zip?dl=0)\n\nThank you, I will give it a shot. I appreciate you letting me test this out. I\u0027ll let you know my results. I knew there had to be something to make it work. I could get the fairing to stop at a given height but it would still wrap around on the upper part of it so when I went to jettison it, it would either hang up or hang up really bad and cause all kinds of things to go wrong. The only way I could get it to not cause problems was by making it too large but that was really ugly. It got very frustrating by the end of my night, tonight\u0027s! So, your response was a big welcome to my frustration level. \n\nThanks again and and ill let you know what I think.\n\nE"},{"CreatedByName":"YANFRET","CreatedById":90547,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-20T04:16:39Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Yanfret, what kind of mission profile are you using for these flights with the USA and secondary payloads? I was playing around myself, and was curious to see what you\u0027re running.\n\nI\u0027m struggling with that because it really doesn\u0027t make any sense to combine Orion with the payload unless its a small habitat module with a toilet. That itself us a compelling reason, but any more it seems better to launch separately"},{"CreatedByName":"ebphoto","CreatedById":144831,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-20T04:38:16Z","Content":"Hey a dloaded and unzipped the file. I\u0027m either not understanding how to use this or I\u0027m not explaining it right or both. I cant seem to get the fairing to work. I see the new parts and I\u0027m selecting them but they behave the same way as the old ones did. I took a screenshot of what is happening without messing with the start stop settings and one with messing with them. Im only right clicking on the part, not going into the cfg file. I took a couple of screenshots in the hanger but I can\u0027t seem to post them. Basically, Im trying to use a fairing towards the middle of the orion or a few stages down from the top. If I od this and use the fairing it shoots all the way to the top of the orion or clips and curves into the stage that im trying to cover. Kind of trying to make it look like those big decouplers on the XLS ships. What am I doing wrong? Thanks...\n\nE"},{"CreatedByName":"YANFRET","CreatedById":90547,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-20T22:44:46Z","Content":"once you add the inter fairing you must reduce the fairing size by right clicking on the base and sliding the bar left"},{"CreatedByName":"Budgie","CreatedById":13840,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-20T23:07:28Z","Content":"So I\u0027ve managed to make my own SLS Block IB with the current CMES pack. On a white SLS with Shuttle-derived boosters, and the EUS (TALUS), with a payload of a procedural fairings interstage for the USA, an Orion and Orion fairing above and the Altair from some other CMES craft file, I was able to reach the Mun, land and return to Kerbin. No second upper stage for Orion. I used the following mission profile:\n\nKSC \u003E 400km orbit \u003E Orion separation and redock to now-exposed Altair \u003E TLI burn with EUS \u003E Course Correction to set Pe at 150 km with EUS \u003E Circularisation at Mun Pe with EUS \u003E Separation from EUS \u003E Land Altair (I\u0027ll see about adding latitude limits to this mission profile later) \u003E Reorbit, dock and return to Kerbin without establishing orbit\n\nLet it be known, however, that this was pushing the upper limits of the configuration. I had 100-200 m/s dV left in the EUS after circularising into a 0-inclination orbit around the Mun. The limiting factor, though, was the Altair. From 150km 0-inclination orbit, I was able to land in the centre of the polar crater, but just about not quite reach the original orbit with the NOS ascent module. I was about 40 m/s short, I think. I was using Mechjeb throughout, so there may be a way of doing it manually to make it more dV efficient (doglegging the ascent?)\n\nA note about the USA. I don\u0027t think I\u0027d use the procedural version. I\u0027d be happiest with something that just fits the Altair inside, as anything else would likely be smaller than that (the Extended Mission Module, which I use without the Orbital Orb). I can\u0027t really think of other payloads in there, though. What would you suggest to ride along with Orion?"}]}
