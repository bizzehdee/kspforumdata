First I still think the bases are far to thick. For a better design see the kosmos implementation of the same bases, they are much thinner. Secondly, I do not see why you cannot add a option to enable or disable decoupling. Once again the kosmos bases have decoupling enabled which meand for interstage stuff you have to be careful to put them in a safe place in the staging. Being able to enable or disable procedurally would be the best solution though. Finally, I like the parabolic fairing option you get with the kosmos mod. You might consider adding this option.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, I have a huge number of ships (almost everything I have built) in fact has a fairing and guess what?
