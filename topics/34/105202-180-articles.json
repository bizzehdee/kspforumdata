I\u0027ve been doing missions where I pre-drop a temporary base with supplies and hab, and I land Kerbals nearby for the mission.  I usually end up more than 150m away from the base when I land, because I\u0027m bad at precision landings (especially in atmosphere), so the lander isn\u0027t being shared.  My problem is that when I try to end the mission and return home, as soon as my Kerbals go back into the lander, they go tourist-mode.  It\u0027s as if the hab-timer for the lander keeps ticking even though the Kerbals aren\u0027t in it!\n\nWhen I looked at the source code, particularly ModuleLifeSupportSystem, I saw that it avoids updating TimeEnteredVessel if the Kerbal is entering the previous vessel.  What\u0027s the reason for this, out of curiosity?\n\nFrom my perspective, it means that my landers have to have as much hab-time as my bases in order to avoid hab penalties kicking in, or that I have to land a third \u0022dummy\u0022 vessel for kerbals to hop into on their way back to the lander.  It\u0027ll also make driving base vehicles like Akita rovers unnecessarily annoying, because Kerbals will have to avoid using whichever one they last used, otherwise they\u0027ll become grouchy.\n\nAside from this issue, I\u0027m really enjoying the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E mods, though!"},{"CreatedByName":"M.M.I","CreatedById":181416,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-16T09:26:29Z","Content":"I love this mod.

It can vary greatly depending on the vessel they are in. \n\nHomesickness is how long they can stay away from Kerbin. It is based on the best vessel they have been in since leaving kerbin. \n\nExample: if a Kerbal launches in a vessel that has 2yrs of Hab time and once reaching orbit transfers to a lander that only has 15 days hab time, the habitation timer will show 15days and the homesickness will show 2yrs - the current MET. So he then transfers back to launch ship. His habitation timer will go back up to whatever that vessels hab time is. 1 yr later he transfers to a station with 10yrs hab time. Habitation timer goes to 10yrs but the homesickness timer will go to 9yrs. This is because that Kerbal now has a total homesickness of 10yrs - the year he has been in space."},{"CreatedByName":"Cadet_BNSF","CreatedById":173975,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-18T01:51:18Z","Content":"I am playing with all of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E mods installed, except for the akita rover, and I am having trouble with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E LS.
