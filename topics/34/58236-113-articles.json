Roughly the same amount, but certain cases are now different?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKind of bit of all of the above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem with the old code was that it was based on temperature only, which is all we had pre KSP 1.0. When KSP 1.0 arrived, there was a minor change made where boiloff mass was actually removing heat but the rates of outgoing and incoming heat weren\u0027t really in sync so the part temperature would peak much higher and the boiloff rate would be a lot higher than it should have been.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe new code does still use the temperature but only to calculate the incoming heat flux and the boiloff is based on actual \u0027heat of vaporization\u0027 values. What that \u0027boils\u0027 down to (forgive the pun please) is that the heat removed through evaporation is pretty much the amount of heat that it took to vaporize it to begin with. The internal part temperature will tend to be a little higher than the coldest resource which does help with boiloff rates.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe one thing I don\u0027t like about this system is that it\u0027s too effective at eliminating boiloff for other resources in the same tank part. For instance if you have LqdOxygen and LqdHydrogen in the same part, the oxygen is pretty much not going to boil at all. There is actually precedent for that so it\u0027s not totally unrealistic but realistically it should only reduce the oxygen boiloff and not eliminate it outright. (of course, once that hydrogen finishes boiling off then your tank will rise in temperature until the LOX starts to boil)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing that I didn\u0027t put in the changelog is that time warp rates above 100x freeze the tank temperature because the system uses a different means of calculating heat (an analytical mode that is less expensive computationally), so you can also time-warp without fear of watching your hydrogen tanks vent their contents in the blink of an eye.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: One caveat is that conducted heat from engines is still a bit brutal though I\u0027ve tried to mitigate that for cryogenic tanks (cryo balloon too).
