This would allow a buffer/queue of outgoing screen caps and keep the flow good I would think. It would increase fps and would not have too bad a performance impact. (I think the most reasonable and my current favorite) \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing a shared memory space and getting .net and python talking via that shared memory would be... trouble me thinks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELinux would allow more true local sockets that could speed things up. Windows would be a no go for that really though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehere is the camera screen shot workflow:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003ETime comes to the point where we should capture camera data (next capture time \u0026gt; current time) \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EA Camera \u0022Screen shot\u0022 is rendered into memory \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Ethat screen shot is converted to a png \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Ethat png is www-posted to a local webserver via a .net/unity coroutine \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Ethat web server acquires a thread lock on an internal data structure such that it can\u0027t be read/writen to \u0022mid-read\u0022 or \u0022mid-write\u0022 \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Ethe web server updates the internal data structure \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Ethe web server release the lock \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Ethe web interface of GATU can then see the newer updated image \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Egatu updates it\u0027s \u0022next\u0022 capture time to be at the current time \u002B the capture frequency.

It also doesn\u0027t get into the space of having unity/ksp doing a lot of the processing or making something work in unity that really doesn\u0027t make sense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUltimately GATU is essentially rendering additional frames. At some point this will have to translate to performance impact. Whatever I can do to mitigate that I\u0027m going to try to find a balance. Sending every frame will KILL us, Sending 1 every two seconds is too slow. I\u0027ll find a balance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELong story short... I\u0027ve got my head in the game. I\u0027m thinking of ways to make it better. I think having multiple \u0022coroutines\u0022 capture and posting the data at the same time will prove the best balance of performance and FPS.
