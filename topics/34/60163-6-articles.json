I found some interesting things out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMe personally, I do not think that the ExactMatch variable does what we were thinking it does. Even with the variable enabled, it still attempts to smooth the transition between biomes. However, instead of every biome with in-between RGB values being reported as the player is transitioning from one biome to the next, it instead reports the first biome in the .att file during the transfer. Basically the current RGB values are still making a smooth transfer between different regions on the map, but the game does not report the current biome unless the RGB values match \u003Cstrong\u003Eexactly\u003C/strong\u003E with a defined biome in the att file. If the RGB values do not match, the game reports the first biome defined in the att file. With ExactMatch disabled, if the RGB values do not match, the game rounds to the nearest defined biome. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ExactMatchThreshold value does not seem to have any effect on the biomes and biomes detection method. In fact, it seems to be a pure boolean value; if the value is zero, then ExactMatch is \u003Cstrong\u003Efalse,\u003C/strong\u003E if the value is something other than zero, then ExactMatch is \u003Cstrong\u003Etrue.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ExactMatch variable does have a lot of usefulness, just not in the way we were expecting. For example the first biome listed in an att file can be a \u0022Transitioning\u0022 biome, or a \u0022Middle of Nowhere\u0022 biome with zero science value. That way the player is aware that the game is transitioning from one biome to the next, and won\u0027t automatically report the transition as a bug. Basically the first biome listed is the \u003Cstrong\u003Edefault\u003C/strong\u003E biome when ExactMatch is enabled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my own personal experience of working with biomes thus far, it my personal recommendation that ExactMatch be enabled (with threshold set to 1.0) for biome maps that have biomes that are generally very large in surface area, and that a default biome be defined as the first biome for that particular biome map. ExactMatch should be turned off for maps that contain biomes that are very small in surface area, as the game has a hard time picking up small biomes when ExactMatch is enabled for some odd reason. The threshold value does not appear to matter. I also strongly recommend that as part of a biome map\u0027s design, that special attention is paid to contrast and what colors are being used. Choosing colors that are close to each other in RGB values directly next to each other (low contrast) will minimize the transitioning effects where as much higher contrast will cause transitioning issues. I\u0027ve noticed that a difference of ten is recognizable by the game, where as with smaller value differences the game gets confused. For example, the game will recognize the difference between two biomes with values 255, 255, 255 and 245, 255, 255. But the game will get confused with values 255, 255, 255 and 250, 255, 255 unless ExactMatch is enabled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope this helps with anyone wanting to develop biome maps. Also, special thanks to Trueborn for creating this resource and for implementing the ExactMatch feature, as my current project would not be possible otherwise \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-26T16:38:15Z\u0022 title=\u002203/26/2014 04:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 26, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Raven.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starstrider42","CreatedById":104043,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-02T16:29:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDoes this work with 0.23.5?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Raven.","CreatedById":99340,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-02T16:34:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Starstrider42\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Starstrider42\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDoes this work with 0.23.5?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have not personally had any problems with it, but I haven\u0027t messed with it much either.

All the words were crammed on the top-left corner of the GUI and it appeared that all the words were being rendered over the top of a single line in the top left corner of the GUI. As I found out later, however, a simple restart fixed the situation. Strange, but must have been some weird init issue or something. I couldn\u0027t find anything in the logs at the time it happened, but if it happens again, I will get screencaps and try to fish out relevant logging.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a side note, love the mod.
