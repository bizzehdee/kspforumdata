My easiest to fly designs are canard designs, with the main wing aft of the COM with flaps on the main wing. I try to place the subsonic no-flaps COL right behind the COM but very close. Next I adjust the max flaps to ensure that max deflection moves the COL aft - if the deflection is too large it will push the COL forward and/or stall which is bad. Because the COL moves aft as you transition to supersonic flight, the I use the flaps to start with my COL aft when fully deployed. Don\u0027t forget to set the flaps to action groups so you can adjust them. While you are in the action groups it I\u0027ve found it helps to remove your nose gear from the brake command.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, for the basic flight profile. The first thing is to set your flaps to max deployment. Takeoff however you prefer and gain some altitude, but keep an eye on your mach number. As your speed approaches mach .8 cut your rate of climb to increase your acceleration through the transonic range. Next, start raising the flaps. This takes some timing, but the idea is to shift the COL forward by raising the flaps while the transition to supersonic speeds so your COL stays in approximately the same location. Once you\u0027ve reached Mach 1.2 or better resume your climb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are going to use the analytical methods, remember that you have to adjust mach number, speed, and air density. Because all 3 are inputs you can create some non-nonsensical situations (ex. high mach number \u0026amp; low airspeed) where the stability derivatives don\u0027t make sense.
