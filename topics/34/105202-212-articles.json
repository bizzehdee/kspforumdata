Additional **weaker** recyclers cover more Kerbals **at their own** capacity (for example 50%).\n\nOnce you have covered all the Kerbals, then adding **even more** recyclers (even the weakest ones) keep increasing the recycling ratio up to the ratio of the most powerful recycler. By adding more weaker recyclers, you will at some point achieve the maximum ratio for the whole crew.\n\nAs for the 0.5 being 50%, I believe that you are right here.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-04-19T01:29:47Z\u0022 title=\u002204/19/2020 01:29  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EApril 19, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Kazkar**\n  \nAdd more words to clarify the thought."},{"CreatedByName":"dlrk","CreatedById":60033,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-22T03:58:32Z","Content":"I\u0027m not sure if this a display bug or I\u0027m misunderstanding the format, but  \n\n    \t\tBaseKerbalMonths = 1\tCrewCapacity = 4\tBaseHabMultiplier = 0\n\nis displayed as 5 kerbal months/crew affect 4 in the editor."},{"CreatedByName":"Terwin","CreatedById":139655,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-26T14:12:12Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 4/1/2020 at 4:23 PM, ski23 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Also, usi is the only mod I have equipped that can effect kerbals not being able to leave the command pods.

If this is the scenario you are encountering, I would recommend setting the LS grace period to a minimum of 1 day to prevent this issue.\n\nIf your grace period is already 1 day or longer and you have ample supplies and recycling, I would suggest copying your save into a fresh install with only \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS and see if you can still replicate the issue.
