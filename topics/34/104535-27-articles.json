This allows me to control individual servos accross multiple groups. I know you\u0027re saying change the IR GUI to allow for servo button assignment not group assignment. But this work great in the meantime. Only downside is sacrificing an action group or two."},{"CreatedByName":"gamerscircle","CreatedById":151261,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-24T06:18:12Z","Content":"Firstly - if this is not the correct thread, I am sorry.

I have a mk3 spaceplane, and i have a 2.5m Kontainer with a docking port on each end.  I want to lift it up with two stacked Adjustable Rails so that I can then plug one end with a docking port into a space station.\n\nThis all works exactly as I wanted it to.  I was pleased.  Then I undock from the docking port on the other end - there\u0027s a mated clamp-o-tron (regular one) attached to one of the adjustable rails - basically there\u0027s a vertical wall in the cargo bay which has a rail attached, and then there\u0027s a rail attached to that rail, and then a docking port attached to that.. then another port flipped around, then the payload.\n\nOK so after decoupling... i do the F5/F9 to get around the undocking-breaks-half-the-mods-in-the-game bug, and I think everything is ok.  I go to retract the rails and they\u0027re.. not where they were.they retract down through the bottom of the ship(!) and if i F5/F9 again now they\u0027re mounted HIGHER up on the wall and i can\u0027t close the docking bay.. this was fine when it launched and worked fine in the SPH and on the ground ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022) ... worse yet, I take an engineer out and it claims that both of the rails AND the parent docking port attached to the rail, somehow have child objects and therefore cannot be scrapped - pretty sure that\u0027s not the case.\n\nDidn\u0027t find any exceptions thrown by IR.\n\n1. I am not tweakscaling any of the IR parts, the docking ports, the payload, nor the thing that the rails are attached to.  In fact the only things tweakscaled on this craft are the wings which don\u0027t touch anything.\n\n2. None of the IR parts, payload, docking ports are clipping into any other parts at any point (except when things go wrong as described above; they\u0027re not designed with clipping, is what I mean to say.  \n\nAny known incompatibilities with.. anything?
