You\u0027re lucky in that Win64 KSP has given you minimal issues, but that\u0027s usually not the case (for me it crashed if I looked at it funny). Mod authors were spammed with bug reports that were irreproducable and it was impossible to distinguish mod bugs from KSP64 bugs. So support was dropped. When Squad releases a stable Win64 build of KSP, mod support will likely come back, but until then you\u0027re just going to have to live with 32 bit (or go to Linux, on which the 64 bit build is stable).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"s.maelstrom","CreatedById":116120,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T20:11:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/j0HEv\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/j0HEv\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENarrowed this issue down to this mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.0.2, launch clamps keep respawning after liftoff, approx. every 10-12sec.
