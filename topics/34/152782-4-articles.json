This repulsor is set to a very large (read: maxed) load capacity, which is more than enough to prevent that particular failure mode. It does come at the cost of the crew\u0027s personal safety (it\u0027s launched Bill and murdered Jeb), but that is a small price to pay for vehicular durability.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe repulsor below the pivot, furthest from the centerline, acts as the primary spring. The entire weight of the vehicle is on these for most of normal operation. It also acts as compression damping.\u003Cbr\u003E\nJust fore of the primary repulsor is the overload spring. It cuts in at the extreme of travel to prevent the Magnus from scraping against the ground. As such, its force is set very high, though not as much as the negative travel limiter.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAbove the pivot is the rebound damper. It corresponds to the compression damper directly below it, preventing the wheelgroup from extending with excessive speed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDue to the unique way in which the Magnus\u0027 suspension works, the possibility of sway bars has arisin.

Though they are not yet adjustable, plans are in motion to rectify this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe wheelgroups are connected to the chassis through a parallelogram.

Every now and again, the wheelgroups experience violent oscillations and pop the tires. I\u0027m fairly certain this is due to improperly tuned dampers, and not a fundamental flaw of the system.

They consist of 8 wheel colliders without suspension, with infernal robotics rotating the wheel hub.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, since wheels using this plugin do not use autostruts, I wonder if it would be suitable for my other infernal robotics wheels (\u003Ca href=\u0022http://m.imgur.com/4hlVCOy\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://m.imgur.com/4hlVCOy\u003C/a\u003E)?\u00A0Due to IRL commitments, I have yet to get around to updating these to 1.2s wheel physics, so would\u00A0updating them to this plugin be the better option?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShould be doable, but probably not with your previous rigging methods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNotably they won\u0027t work with \u00278 colliders without suspension\u0027 -- this wheel system relies on the suspension in order to derive the friction forces.\u00A0 No suspension = no friction = no wheel simulation.\u00A0 You can have a wheel without a visible suspension mesh (e.g. repulsor), but the spring-damper-based suspension physics is what drives the rest of the wheel simulation by providing a \u0027down force\u0027 to use in friction calculations.\u00A0 You can have multiple colliders (e.g. tracks), but each one must have suspension.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, after doing some research into mecanum wheels, it looks like you could use a standard single wheel collider, with suspension, set at a 45\u0027 angle offset from the visible wheel mesh.\u00A0 You would need one model angled for \u0027left\u0027 and one angled for \u0027right\u0027.\u00A0 This would mean they would mostly only work \u0027right-way-down\u0027, as the wheel system is still raycast/spherecast based.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlternatively you could use the existing 8 wheel colliders (so they will work in any orientation) but give them a rather small suspension range (~0.1m), and offsetting the collider into the wheel hub slightly to compensate for the suspension.\u00A0 However such small suspension ranges when used with large suspension forces can cause simulation integration problems, and is very much on the \u0027not recommended\u0027 list; they would work but could be jittery/bouncy in some configurations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-29T20:41:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222904098\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022152782\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221483013400\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022110660\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u00220111narwhalz\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n9 hours ago, 0111narwhalz said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou know, when you said \u0022for testing of the wheel physics,\u0022 I don\u0027t think you expected people to test \u003Ci\u003Ethis\u003C/i\u003E.\u003Cbr\u003E\nMeet the Magnus.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/w5wUY6l.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022 title=\u0022Enlarge image\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022w5wUY6l.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage ipsImage_thumbnailed\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/w5wUY6l.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThough it is yet a WIP, the Magnus is my most successful complex suspension mechanism yet.

friction forces though can be put through an RK4 derivative calculation framework for -much- improved accuracy at the cost of some minor calculation overhead (some extra mults/divs/add/subtracts, but no added allocations or raycasts).\u00A0 Now, since I cannot use RK4/etc on the suspension forces this setup won\u0027t be able to fix the jittering caused by suspension, but it should clean up any jittering caused by friction as well as allowing for a much more robust integration of the torque application code (reduced wheel slip on first applying torque or brakes, better response during dynamic handling scenarios, reduce or eliminate overshoot that could cause jittering).\u00A0 RK4 integration is new to me though, so likely will take a couple weeks to learn the ins and outs and get it implemented properly.\u00A0 The existing friction integration code will need to be reworked to allow for derivative use; shouldn\u0027t be too difficult, but will require cleaning up some assumptions that currently exist in the code (such as delta-time always == Time.fixedDeltaTime).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the PartModules end of things -- after I get the integration stuff reworked and figured out I should be able to spend a few weeks / month to get them cleaned up.\u00A0 I have a concept for a \u0027stock-alike\u0027 suspension auto-tuning algorithm that should remove a large majority of the manual setup for wheels (if the auto-setup system is enabled; it will be configurable through the settings menu).\u00A0 This system will constantly auto-adapt the suspension on a craft to keep the ride height within the config-specified \u0027valid\u0027 range; the trick is going to be getting it to work without interfering with standard dynamic suspension response too much (e.g. how to detect difference between constant over-loaded-compression and a constant hard banking turn, from the perspective of a single wheel?.... without knowledge of the entire craft I don\u0027t think it can be done....and wheels cannot be aware of other wheels or the vehicle design, they must be self-contained and vehicle-agnostic).\u00A0 Shouldn\u0027t be a problem on wheels with sufficient travel (as turning would not cause body roll sufficient to leave the \u0027valid\u0027 range), but many of the stock/mod wheels I\u0027ve seen have very tiny travel ranges where even the slightest turn causes wheels to either over-compress (outside) or nearly leave the ground (inside).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom there that still leaves a few things that need to be figured out -- tuning the friction curves, implementing better steering and motor handling functionality, a proper tracks handling module, and finding solutions to a few collider-related oddities.\u00A0 Should all be solvable, but may take awhile to get it all sorted out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSometime -after- all of that is figured out and working I\u0027ll look into opening up a new KF thread and getting everything cleaned up for that mod.\u00A0 Need the colliders and part-modules to be functional (and easily usable) first though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nEdit:\u00A0 After a bit more thought on RK4 integration, I realized that it really isn\u0027t workable for any of the wheel physics -- every part of the wheel physics relies on variables controlled Unity code that I cannot access -- e.g. in order to use RK4 integration on wheel friction I need to be able to determine the final state of the rigidbody for each derivative, and use that state as the input for some of the other derivatives (as friction relies on things like the local wheel velocity, which are controlled entirely by the rigidbody it is mounted on, which I have no control over).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI might be able to fake it a bit by \u0027guessing\u0027 at what the rigidbody state would be at for mid-point derivatives, but this will be inaccurate on anything but perfectly evenly loaded suspension, and even then it might have problems due to not knowing how Unity actually integrates their physics code (difference in calculations could cause inaccuracies).\u00A0 Still going to investigate a bit, see how bad \u0027guessing\u0027 at rigidbody state is, and at least try and clean up the friction code (still can\u0027t do much on the suspension integration).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-12-29T22:10:50Z\u0022 title=\u002212/29/2016 10:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 29, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Shadowmage\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"0111narwhalz","CreatedById":110660,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-30T05:52:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWould changing the max delta-time in any way affect the simulation quality?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, where did those stock \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E patches go?

Recently, the wheels seem to have gone wonkers, strutting everywhere\u00A0despite the fact that they\u0027re not installed in symmetry and attached by IR rotatrons (which should sever autostruts). So, I swapped the stock wheels for KF ones. The minimal tuning I managed to do got it through stage one of the Kerbal Dakar rally, but it\u0027s not really all that fun to drive.
