I\u0027ve started working on the 18x6 truss. Only needs a few more tweaks. Surface-dwellers may be pleased to know that I\u0027ve also started work on a small pod house, inspired by one of the pictures I posted a while ago. I\u0027m doing it as an alternative radially-attached 4-kerbal house, though I may resize it later.\n\n Stealth17: Your appreciation is appreciated.\n\nI had also thought about the possibility of adding more civilian functionality, but I haven\u0027t done any coding in KSP, so I wouldn\u0027t know where to begin. Anyway, here are some ideas:\n\nCivilian ISRU: Some sort of refinery and maybe a small drilling module, or even a facility for creating small robots which could go out and gather resources (that one would be more interesting, but harder to implement). All fully controlled by the civilians, and requiring a certain number of civilians on the base. Basically, you set this up with power, and somewhere to gather resources, and the civvies build up resources, which you can then buy from them. If we got this working, it would be possible to include MKS configs, etc. which would allow civilians to manage a base by themselves.\n\nJobs for civilians: Have either a requirement, or an option, for civilians to staff various modules (including the space ports and farms). This could affect things like resource yield or power consumption (no need to keep robots running when a kerbal can do it). A working kerbal gets paid, which would negate their rent.\n\nMaking some of the modules require maintenance: this would be provided by employing a kerbal to work on the module, as above. Lack of maintenance would mean decreasing yields, possible waste of resources, etc.\n\nAdding an option to the civilian docking ports to order in resources (there\u0027s a mod out there which does this already). Unlike the civvie ISRU, you could order from anywhere in the Kerbin system, but it would take time for the resources to arrive, based on distance from Kerbin.\n\n All of those would be possible, but are pretty much pipe dreams right now."},{"CreatedByName":"Vorg","CreatedById":74652,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T20:31:14Z","Content":"These big pannels, trusses, and other parts.

Given that, I\u0027d be setting Civilian consumption to .5 supplies per civilian per day. \n\nBasing this roughly on the military MRE. (Meal-Ready to Eat). The Militarily recommended daily allowance is 3, and they roughly all sit at about 1250 calories each(probably more if you were like me and traded to get more peanut butter:P) So that\u0027s roughly 3750 calories a day. Your average civilian is recommended 1700-2000 calories per day, So roughly half that. You\u0027d imagine your average Kerbonaut would be doing alot of strenuous activities, similar to a solider, so thus is my logic.\n\nGiven the USI numbers , Ill grab the consumption of TAC-LS resources per day/per kerbal. And half that for each civilian, to make things easy. \n\nProduction on the Biospheres and bio-dome will be patched to their requisite size housing (small to small, etc ), with the housed Kerbonauts and cilvians, along with a small excess. \n\nAll these will be popped into the next patch. Enjoy the excess production while you can ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nFeedback is welcome!"},{"CreatedByName":"Speadge","CreatedById":145302,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-10T14:22:45Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E New in this update:\n\u003E \n\u003E  Fixed issue with 6x6 Core Girder, Core length is now proper.\n\nThank you VERY much ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif):)![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nedit:\n\nlittle hint:\n\nu turned the model 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 around, so everyone using it already will have ships that look... awfull :-(\n\n![1JiPcOW.png](http://i.imgur.com/1JiPcOW.png)\n\nthose cores were horizontal aligned before updating\n\njust for me to know: will you change it again or shall i live with the new orientation?\n\nahh.. and the nodes are inverted\n\n    name = truss18x18NoCorenode_stack_bottom = 6, -9, 0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 3node_stack_right = -9,6,0,1,0,0,3\n\nthat does not fit well\n\nshould be (i think, not sure):\n\n    name = truss18x18NoCorenode_stack_bottom = 6, -9, 0, 0.0, -1.0, 0.0, 3node_stack_right = -9,6,0,-1,0,0,3\n\nthe nodes of this girder were inverted in last version as well. i did a \u0022private fix\u0022 back then ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-10T14:37:44Z\u0022 title=\u002207/10/2015 02:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Speadge**\n  \nscreenshot"},{"CreatedByName":"rabidninjawombat","CreatedById":108889,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-10T14:25:55Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Thank you VERY much ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif):)![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\u003E edit:\n\u003E \n\u003E little hint:\n\u003E \n\u003E u turned the model 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 around, so everyone using it already will have ships that look... awfull :-(\n\u003E \n\u003E just for me to know: will you change it again or shall i live with the new orientation?\n\u003E \n\u003E ahh.. and the nodes are inverted\n\nHuh.. they shouldnt have..didnt make any changes to the config/or model of the single core one(other than reduce the size of the core. post up a screen shot so i can see whats going on and ill put up a hotfix."},{"CreatedByName":"micr0wave","CreatedById":136352,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-10T14:29:45Z","Content":"My Biodome shrinked\n\n![DK1Fiev.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/DK1Fiev.jpg)\n\nthe dome is the rootpart (i think) which seems to be the common issue (had that in 0.9 too and also with the MKS Kontainers)http://i.imgur.com/DK1Fiev.jpg"},{"CreatedByName":"rabidninjawombat","CreatedById":108889,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-10T14:36:57Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E My Biodome shrinked\n\u003E [http://i.imgur.com/DK1Fiev.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/DK1Fiev.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E the dome is the rootpart (i think) which seems to be the common issue (had that in 0.9 too and also with the MKS Kontainers)http://i.imgur.com/DK1Fiev.jpg\n\nHrmm.
