And by the way, using 4096x4096 textures is an overkill for most screen resolutions and setups: your GPU will only show the 2048x2048 MIP level (leaving other 4/5th of texture size without use) unless you have resolution set quite higher than 1920x1080, or are zooming into the skybox (which is only available with the telescope mod).
