Not having any trouble getting the current KSC from RSS thankfully (except when first loading a save, in which case the value is empty. I either have to poll it again at a later time [assuming it\u0027s no longer empty] or I\u0027ll have to advise everyone to go into the tracking station before doing anything else). I seem to be losing track of which KSC is the active one when entering the VAB (likely just me clearing the active one on scene change and not loading it properly) but I just need to play with it some more. I should probably save which KSC is the active one when changing scenes/exiting the game and then setting that one active on scene change or game load. That\u0027d likely fix all of those issues and is easy to do.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Climberfx","CreatedById":57126,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-18T18:17:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI love this plugin and his idea.

Currently implemented is the part inventory, which will make any ships you recover and rebuild take minimal time compared to a new one (to represent refueling and reconditioning of the vessel). However, there is a planned feature to let you recover ships directly to the inventory (see \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/magico13/KCT/issues/10\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis GitHub issue\u003C/a\u003E) which may be closer to what you are describing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magico13","CreatedById":73338,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-19T03:17:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI can confirm RSS support is working and the new save system isn\u0027t COMPLETELY broken!
