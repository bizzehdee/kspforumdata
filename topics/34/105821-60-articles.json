The issue is that the two models have their their \u0022front\u0022 facing different directions relative to their local transform.  If you wanted to stick to editing config files, you would need to take the rotation field (which is a quaternion) and rotate it around one of the Euler axes - it\u0027d be pretty much guess-and-check.  The other option is to download and install Unity and the KSP part tools, and use the visual editor there to rotate it (and you could throw some other props into the cockpit while you were at it)."},{"CreatedByName":"Gaultesian","CreatedById":145145,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-08T22:05:07Z","Content":"Thanks MOARdv.
