There\u0027s no clear winner between them in terms of performance/cost for smallish payloads, but for a liquid engine you still have your ship afterwards.

Still writing all the missions myself at this moment as I go along. But the mission payouts are hard to figure out.. In the old system a vessel like the moonshine V cost about 250,000 just under the Kerbal Engineering Plugin.. With the Mission Controller with all the different cost it jumped to almost 600,000. No big deal.. I adjusted mission payouts to be more in line with MC. Now this new system.. Which again I don\u0027t mind because modders are not making good choices with part cost.. The same vessel is almost 1,000,000 To launch.. I was like DAM!! Had to adjust the amounts again in my missions to correct for the new cost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yes eventually I will release the missions.
