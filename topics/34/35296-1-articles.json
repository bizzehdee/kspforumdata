It can take up a bit of the screen for larger graphs.Also, as an idea (request), would it be possible to allow for size of the in-game graph to be independent of the x and y limits set for data recording? A 600 point x and y axis is rather large on the GUI. All I\u0027m really interested in is collecting the CSV data for excel.
