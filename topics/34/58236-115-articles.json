Still, for a rocket sitting on the pad, that boundary layer on the outside is more important than the tank material. Whether it is steel or aluminum: any heat that makes it through the boundary layer will be passed on by the metal with out noticable delay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s even more obvious if you express it as resistance (= 1/conductivity): 0.04 for the boundary layer and 0.00006 for 1cm of steel: three orders of magnitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimilar effects can be expected at *any* boundary. For a solid-liquid boundary it usually doesn\u0027t amount to much, but with the thermal resistance of sheet metal being as low as it is, even a miniscule boundary effect can easily triple your insulation.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-09T20:55:01Z\u0022 title=\u002211/09/2015 08:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Laie\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
