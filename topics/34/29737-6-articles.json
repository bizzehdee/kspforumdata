First, you know that coming in and out of warp happens outside atmospheres, so make the G force detector method only register when inside an atmosphere. Also, going along with Awaras\u0027 suggestion, make whatever G force damage be a function of both the integral and severity of G force, and not just maximum G\u0027s. This way, the ship would be able to sustain mysterious spikes in G force, but extended, moderate to high G\u0027s would cause damage.

Also, while a part is on fire, if it isn\u0027t an engine, it begins generating its own internal heat and so won\u0027t cool as quickly even if you take it away from its heat source. Once it stops being on fire, the damage remains but the extra heat generation stops.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EG-forces also deal damage - parts have a maximum G-force tolerance and sustain damage if they go above this value.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EParts have six damage thresholds:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(0% - none)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eup to 10% - light\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eup to 25% - moderate\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eup to 50% - severe\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eup to 100% - critical\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Epast 100% - destroyed\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA part\u0027s G-force tolerance, breaking force, and impact tolerance are directly reduced by its current damage, while temperature tolerance can be reduced by up to 15% by heavy damage.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ialdabaoth","CreatedById":57270,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-31T19:26:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ialdabaoth\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ialdabaoth\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EUpdated to RC4; I finally got G-forces working right!
