This would allow for more interesting search and rescue/recovery operations in which the player could opt out of using the map and simply use the good ol\u0027-fashioned ocular search method to find the trail and follow it to the lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t even know if this is a practical suggestion, but that would be my 2 cents. Regardless, thanks for the cool mod.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SirJodelstein","CreatedById":62251,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-27T21:48:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EProgress in inevitable.
