Not only that, but it features memory - you can get the engine to remember up to 3 different angles, and return to those at any time. The options are limitless with this thing.

For one, it would allow us to save memory angles along with the craft, which would save a lot of time on pre-launch. Furthermore, having to have action groups to change engine angle, then save and recall the saved engine angle uses a ton of action groups. If we could set them in the VAB, we\u0027d need maybe 2 or 3 action groups. One for each saved angle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr alternatively, allow us to set them through the right click context menu for the engines in flight.
