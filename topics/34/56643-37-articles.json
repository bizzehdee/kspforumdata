Then the issue is elsewhere. There is another method called shouldtoggle in the SMAddon.cs file. This one is called when the toolbar buttons are pressed via OnSMButtonToggle handler. This handler works for both toolbars, so I\u0027m thinking that ShouldToggle is the culprit. In there there is a reference to !PauseMenu.isOpen \u0026amp;\u0026amp; !FlightResultsDialog.isDisplaying I have recently learned that these sometimes return null exceptions for unknown reasons. Blizzy\u0027s toolbar actually encapsulates them to trap for the error... I\u0027ve since added that to my code in my current dev build, as well as consolidating bouth shouldToggle and CanShowShipManifest. This may be were you are having issues.
