The Remotetech wiki has a chapter on this, but here\u0027s the basics in brief: an excellent transmitter/receiver on one end can connect to a puny whip antenna over a distance that vastly exceeds the whip\u0027s nominal range.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpecifically, it is (the smaller antenna\u0027s range) \u002B SQR(range1 * range2), capped at a maximum of 100times the smaller omni range or 1000x the smaller dish range.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis means that \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea) In the early game, you can assume that every antenna will have 100x it\u0027s nominal range. The Sputnik whip antenna is good for GEO, and the Communotron-16 (the stock starting antenna) can talk back to earth from the moon. If you lose connection, it\u0027s usually because you have no line of sight to any ground station. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E Two equal antennae will have their ranges doubled when talking to each other, that is, two Communotron-16 can still talk to each other from 8Mm apart.
