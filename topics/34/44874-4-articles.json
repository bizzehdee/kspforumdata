(finals, graduation, moving, new job, no job, etc)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd quite a few are category 5. Maybe their mods were small and not deemed large enough to want to host on something like Spaceport in the first place. Dropbox, Github or Mediafire and the like. A lot of the mods I use fall into this category like DREC or RSS or FAR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBottom line though is that unless an author has openly stated his stance towards Curse (or the move in general) you really can\u0027t infer lack of support based on them not uploading to Curse and updating the download link. Given that you\u0027ve been clicking on outdated links you would think those \u0027tons\u0027 of authors would have openly stated in their threads why those update links no longer went somewhere useful. And yet here you sit in the dark dependent on us to explain to you why the links no longer work.
