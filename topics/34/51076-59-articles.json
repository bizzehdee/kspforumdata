If you can reach your server via localhost, it\u0027s running correctly and the problem is either on your friends end (not likely) or in the way you\u0027ve set up your connection.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo lets clarify a bit and make sure you\u0027re giving him the correct IP. If you\u0027re using an IP that starts with 192 or 127, that\u0027s not your external IP but your internal...meaning that\u0027s just the IP between your computer and your router. As an example, if I access my router I can see my gaming computer IP is 192.168.1.101, my router is 192.168.1.1, my netbook is 192.168.1.102, tablet, 192.168.1.103, etc. But if I search on Google for \u0027what is my ip\u0027 it gives me Your public IP address is ***.25.190.161. That\u0027s the router\u0027s IP on the internet which is what all the computers hooked up to your router use. That\u0027s the IP your friend needs to use. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf that doesn\u0027t work, check your port forwarding. Did you enter the correct port? It\u0027s easy to fat finger it and hit the wrong key on a keyboard. Is it forwarded to the correct computer? Won\u0027t work if you\u0027re forwarding him to your brothers laptop. Is there a check box to indicate that it\u0027s active? Did you make sure to click \u0022accept\u0022 or \u0022apply\u0022 if there are buttons for that? On my router I actually have to do ALL that...haha. Also make sure that port isn\u0027t also forwarded to another computer in your house/dorm/whatever for something unrelated. That shouldn\u0027t be possible...but the key word is shouldn\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWithout getting into trouble shooting with trace routes and pings, what you can also try is to disable port blocking if your router allows it...meaning just open them all up. My router has an option called DMZ (not sure what it stands for) that basically will forward ALL ports to the chosen computer. Not a good thing to do long term, but as a test you should be fine. If your friend can connect when you do this, then the issue is somewhere in your router \u0026amp; port forwarding config.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022tetryds\u0022 data-cite=\u0022tetryds\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EJust one small thing that annoys me a lot.\u003Cp\u003EPlease, don\u0027t make me need to type /say when trying to say something on the chat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts extremelly annoying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI only use / when making commands, if i want to talk i should be abble to just type away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI belive its really simple to change, using /say is something that they use on most servers but its really bad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre you talking about from the command window?
