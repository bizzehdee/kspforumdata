So, as I never had the chance to test the Kethane integration before v8, I\u0027d like to know:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow exactly does that Kethane integration used to work? Should I assume that we would have to activate both Kethane and Altimetry scans, but with the advantage that we could leave the probe scanning in the background, while controlling other vessels/KSC, and the Kethane would still be mapped?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI should make a more detailed tutorial about this at some point. For ORSX, as I said above, you must use special SCANsat resource scanners, most of which are provided by the addons that actually use them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor Kethane you can use SCANsat scanners (the MM configs are provided here), this allows for background scanning, but it isn\u0027t actually necessary. The Kethane scanning data is taken directly from Kethane\u0027s database, so you can scan something with a regular Kethane scanner and it will all show up on SCANsat maps. You can also do the process in reverse, scan everything with SCANsat scanners then update Kethane\u0027s database (though getting the Kethane grid to update usually requires reloading).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere isn\u0027t technically anything wrong with SCANsat\u0027s Kethane integration, there is just something weird happening with the Geodesic Grid assembly that prevents SCANsat from accessing some of the methods it needs. I can build the GeodesicGrid.dll myself and it works fine, so we will just have to wait until Kethane updates before it works again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022asbrand\u0022 data-cite=\u0022asbrand\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENevermind...found it in my \u0022\\GameData\\SCANsat\\Plugins\\PluginData\\SCANsat\u0022 folder. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think I see why the maps are getting saved to that location, but that\u0027s definitely not where they should be.
