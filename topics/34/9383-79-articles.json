Throw it a reasonably high polar orbit and it yields excellent coverage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECons:\u003C/strong\u003E Time acceleration can scan planets extremely (and unrealistically) quickly. SAR scanning is designed to scan in a high orbit, but given a low orbit will give you the same resolution and beam width, and scan faster. Negates the need to have the \u0027faster, low resolution\u0027 altimetry scanners when you can just send the SAR and multispectral and scan a whole planet with a few minutes of acceleration. Stock models are pretty basic and repetitive (although that\u0027s addressed in the Pros.) Doesn\u0027t (to the best of my knowledge) export data other than the color maps in PNG format.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"little square dot","CreatedById":42920,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-14T00:56:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mr. Scruffy\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Mr. Scruffy\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThx alot also to the author of IMS (no cynism, really!), but i guess your work has been caught up on.
