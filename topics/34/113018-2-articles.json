So, beyond the fixes and tweaks I also added two new parts I hope will be well enjoyed. First is simply a large Catalytic engine, so more resource generation from atmospheres using your engine! The other is a massive deployable heat shield, it uses its magnetic charge as an ablator and has a ridiculous surface area, perfect slowing down large spacecraft and even makeshift gliding in thicker atmospheres. Well here you guys go, enjoy!"},{"CreatedByName":"DaniDE","CreatedById":130484,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T01:01:22Z","Content":"Hi, a small bug report - I noticed that I dont see the engines ingame, due to them being tied to the \u0022experimental rocketry\u0022 tech node which I dont have.

Does it go by a different name there perhaps? I double checked and I dont see it in stock. It does however not work the way you mentioned, the node is not magically created just by parts present that reference it. Since ModuleManager can patch techtrees now maybe you can add a patch to simply create the node, because the only mod that create it to my knowledge is the KSPI mod (I downloaded it and checked inside). \n\nOn a further note, sandbox is not what I play, and since sandbox ignores any techRequirement statement, of course you see the parts there. My guess is that the mod is probably meant to be used even by those who are so crazy and play career ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-02T08:32:40Z\u0022 title=\u002207/02/2015 08:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by DaniDE**"},{"CreatedByName":"Carbonjvd","CreatedById":137685,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T09:36:51Z","Content":"I delved into a little deeper and found that the tech node I was using, Experimental Rocketry, was removed a few updates ago I never noticed since I only play sandbox, career is too much grinding for my taste. So back in the day it did in fact work the way I described, but they\u0027ve since changed it. To that end I\u0027ve already begun thinking of rearranging a number of the parts location on the tech tree, to make it more evenly distributed in a future update.

I\u0027ve fleshed out the resource system to come full circle using dust, ore, and virtual particles.\n\n Now introduced a ton of new parts including nuclear reactors, magnetic cooling units, various dust parts, and much much more! I specified reactors and magnetic coolers for a reason, they both increase or decrease their own and thermal levels, so now its possible for things beyond engines to overheat. So while reactors produce power and a lot of heat, magnetic coolers can chill themselves and adjacent parts effectively. All reactors have a built-in cooling system, but they\u0027re only meant as buffer while running. Another tip for using reactors is that they need electricity to start up, so no power means no reactor start up. The largest reactor is referred to as a Nuclear Forge because not only does it produce power, it can also forge virtual particles into dust for later use, also at the cost of a lot of power. Dust can now also be draw out of atmospheres using catalytic engines or the new dust accumulator that requires constant power to work. From there, dust can compressed into ore or even have xenon extracted from it. Of course there\u0027s a bunch of new tanks for all this stuff. Containment Tanks hold both dust and virtual particles, but they require constant power of else they\u0027ll leak virtual particles until empty. Spherical Tanks only hold dust, not much more about that. There\u0027s a handful of new engines too, radial versions of the Q thruster and Catalytic engine, and also a thermal compression jet. The radial Q thruster is a perfect efficiency engine that only needs electricity to run, though a lot of it. The radial Catalytic engine doesn\u0027t draw dust from the atmosphere, but instead is half liquid-electric rocket and half Q thruster. The thermal compression jet is a more conventional version of the fusion scramjet, so it can be used without oxygen and is useful and less than break-neck speeds. \n\nAll the parts have been reorganized in the tech node requirements along with various attachment node resizing to more appropriate. All that and a handful of tweaks on the parts to balance or fix embarrassing mistakes. Hopefully I didn\u0027t miss anything!\n\nHave fun guys and gals!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-05T23:14:08Z\u0022 title=\u002207/05/2015 11:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Carbonjvd**"},{"CreatedByName":"Drelam","CreatedById":103798,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T16:42:05Z","Content":"Sounds cool, thanks for the good news!"},{"CreatedByName":"Amedee","CreatedById":134429,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T21:47:26Z","Content":"Is this mod compatible with Community Tech Tree?"},{"CreatedByName":"Carbonjvd","CreatedById":137685,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T00:29:00Z","Content":"@Amedee Yes it should be compatible, the mod uses the stock tech tree, so you shouldn\u0027t have any problems with it."},{"CreatedByName":"Carbonjvd","CreatedById":137685,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T13:30:50Z","Content":"Updated the mod! This one just does the usual tweaks and two new parts, one being the Thermal RCS, and the other being a Doppler Spectrometer. The Thermal RCS is ultra powerful RCS that uses liquid fuel and electrical charge to move around. Its meant to maneuver large ships that normally take way too many RCS thrusters and end up being extremely slow in response. The Doppler Spectrometer is a new science tool for detecting the composition of whatever its orbiting. The science is really high and takes a good bit of power to transmit back home, so it needs plenty of power as well.

Perhaps I\u0027m missing a dependency for dust and ore? I was using the catalytic engines on my HX spaceplane (I know, it\u0027s ridiculous) and they generated negative thrust in dust-breathing mode? It actually didn\u0027t generate a negative force, since my ship still made it to space just fine, but at no point was there any propulsion from dust-breathing mode. Do I need dust tanks too?\n\nI think it\u0027d be helpful to update your OP with pics and descriptions of each part, when you have time, now that there are so many.

On the particulars for catalytic engines, their \u0022Atmospheric Filter\u0022 mode is meant as a way to use what is normally a propulsion part to be able to draw resources directly from any atmosphere far faster than Dust Accumulators can by themselves. Accumulators take days to fill tanks while catalytic engines only need minutes to achieve the same result. You also need dust tanks to store it, and in the filter mode it doesn\u0027t provide any thrust. The negative thrust number was simply a way to set the amount of dust being drawn into it. So making a legit descriptive album is now on my to-do list for the mod, along with some more parts in the adaptation stage.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-22T04:51:28Z\u0022 title=\u002207/22/2015 04:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Carbonjvd**"},{"CreatedByName":"IcepickJosh","CreatedById":146064,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T03:33:24Z","Content":"I spent some time working with this mod.
