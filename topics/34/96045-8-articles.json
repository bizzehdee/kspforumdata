Contrary to popular belief, KSC is not on the equator, but at a latitude of -0.10266804865356. I did a quick calculation, and when you\u0027re all the way up in an equatorial orbit, that small latitude difference makes the point directly over KSC 12 km away.

This is the first report I\u0027ve heard of it in 1.0\u002B, so you\u0027ve dashed my hopes that it was fixed. In short, the stock contracts app queues up all the updates to contracts while it\u0027s closed, and then when you open it, it goes crazy trying to catch up (it seems to be quadratically worse the more updates you add). Having big contracts or lots of contracts exacerbates it (sounds like you have both). I have tons of logic in Contract Configurator to limit the amount of updates that actually make it through to the window which has made it mostly manageable, but you\u0027ve got the extreme case.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, workarounds are to have the contract window open all the time or use DMagic\u0027s Contracts Window \u002B.
