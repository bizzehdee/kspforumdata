I also sense that there are hidden prerequisites to trigger the introduction of a new contract. I started a new career and soon received the \u0022Haul a Thumper..\u0022 contract. It is usually after completing that contract that I have enough science points to buy two or three of the nodes in the 4th level of the science tree.\n\nI am playing KSP 1.1 and I have installed Historic Mission 2.0.0 via CKAN. I see the first historic contract in my contract list upon starting a new career. I did not attempt a historic contract.

I then tried deleting Historic Missions and then reinstalling it but no success.

In its window I see that HistoricMissions is enabled but I have no historic contracts at Mission Control. Should I be able to see historic missions contracts in a career that has already begun or do those contracts appear only upon starting a new career?
