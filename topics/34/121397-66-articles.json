There was a conversation back on page 13 about how EL parts tend to use ExConverter, where stock and your parts use ModuleResourceConverter. You mentioned you needed to check on the numbers because there was a cycle that could give infinite metal because of either not enough scrap used to remake metal or too much from making rocket parts, but I couldn\u0027t find whether it had been tweaked. You mentioned ExConverter doesn\u0027t work well for you/your mod, so should it be avoided when designing a template? If the numbers for the Ironworks in the EL patch are correct, then I think I\u0027ve completed it using ModuleResourceConverter.

But on Minmus, I have a Pathfinder \u002B KPBS base deployed in one of the flats, with three Haciendas configured as 2 ISRUs 1 Power Plant. Initially had them drilling for water, which they did, topping off whatever water tanks were on the base. Then I switched them to Ore mode, and for some reason they aren\u0027t drilling up ore, they\u0027re still drilling up water. I can confirm this by going to the KSP Resource Panel: with the drills off, Water reads as 0.00 (being drawn by the Cooling Towers (closed cycle)). Turning on the Hacienda drills (both via the GUI and the PAW, and confirming they\u0027re set for ore), Water reads 0, as though they were continuously being topped off like a solar panel will the EC resource bar. (And Ore does not budge one bit.

Engineering can take interesting turns sometimes.\u003C/sub\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn to a substantial matter. I came upon an interesting phenomenon. Remember I said I had a base on Minmus with Pathfinder inflatables? Okay, so that base\u0027s purpose was done, which was to support construction of a permanent infrastructure being set up. Part of that permanent infrastructure delivered to Minmus from Kerbin was a Conestoga to serve as an expansion point for Pathfinder modules, the important thing being that it carried its own OSE Workshop installed and pre-configured in the Hangar (so that I didn\u0027t have to do it in the field). The prior Pathfinder base also had an OSE, configured in-field, which had already been used to build a couple of parts. Since I didn\u0027t need the old base anymore (apart from one Casa configured as a Hab), I deflated the rest and stored them, along with the other noninflatable parts and a couple of 3-length Buckboards, these Buckboards never having been connected to my old base in any way, in a Chuckwagon configured as \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E storage.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s the historical context. The phenomenon is that I tried manufacturing a few items in the new OSE workshop, none of which ever showed up in its inventory, or in any of the inventories in the base (all inventories are with Pathfinder parts). After a few moments of being stumped, I tried taking out all the inflatables I previously stored in the Chuckwagon as explained above (but the Buckboards remained). Inflated those as well as a just in case to check their inventories, but didn\u0027t find anything (apart from a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E port I forgot to take out of a Casa or Ponderosa, I forget). But only after I had emptied the base of any stored inflatables did OSE manufacturing finally drop its products in the base inventory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLikely a bug, but am not sure if the bug is unique to Pathfinder because of its inflatable modules retaining \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E storage capabilities (in fact,\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eshould\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0they retain any storage capabilities on deflate?

Engineering can take interesting turns sometimes.\u003C/sub\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn to a substantial matter. I came upon an interesting phenomenon. Remember I said I had a base on Minmus with Pathfinder inflatables? Okay, so that base\u0027s purpose was done, which was to support construction of a permanent infrastructure being set up. Part of that permanent infrastructure delivered to Minmus from Kerbin was a Conestoga to serve as an expansion point for Pathfinder modules, the important thing being that it carried its own OSE Workshop installed and pre-configured in the Hangar (so that I didn\u0027t have to do it in the field). The prior Pathfinder base also had an OSE, configured in-field, which had already been used to build a couple of parts. Since I didn\u0027t need the old base anymore (apart from one Casa configured as a Hab), I deflated the rest and stored them, along with the other noninflatable parts and a couple of 3-length Buckboards, these Buckboards never having been connected to my old base in any way, in a Chuckwagon configured as \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E storage.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s the historical context. The phenomenon is that I tried manufacturing a few items in the new OSE workshop, none of which ever showed up in its inventory, or in any of the inventories in the base (all inventories are with Pathfinder parts). After a few moments of being stumped, I tried taking out all the inflatables I previously stored in the Chuckwagon as explained above (but the Buckboards remained). Inflated those as well as a just in case to check their inventories, but didn\u0027t find anything (apart from a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E port I forgot to take out of a Casa or Ponderosa, I forget). But only after I had emptied the base of any stored inflatables did OSE manufacturing finally drop its products in the base inventory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLikely a bug, but am not sure if the bug is unique to Pathfinder because of its inflatable modules retaining \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E storage capabilities (in fact,\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eshould\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0they retain any storage capabilities on deflate? I was surprised I forgot to take out a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E port and yet managed to deflate the associated part (although admittedly it is possible to replicate in real life).

I\u0027m pretty limited in what I can do. Meanwhile, now that I have DSEV\u0027s Odyssey Two release ready to go, I\u0027m turning my attention to a request by \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/111360-justjim/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022111360\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/111360-justjim/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@JustJim\u003C/a\u003E for a meeting room for Pathfinder. In thinking about it, I came up with this concept:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022p1kNNeO.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022637\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/p1kNNeO.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022aVImpP2.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022640\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/aVImpP2.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe idea is that you haul a big packing box the size of the Buckboard 6000 to your desired location, and then assemble the Ranch House with 20,000 units of Equipment. Unlike other parts, the Ranch House cannot be disassembled, and has no templates. Instead, the part has the following capabilities:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nBonus to production efficiency for all attached parts. The more kerbals you stuff into the Ranch House, the higher the bonus.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nGenerates science data that is added to all attached Doc Science Labs (this data can already be processed into Science, sold for Funds, or published for Reputation).
