I think i might tweak the orbits in future and bring all planets out slightly to make it a little easier\n\n2\u003E It worked perfectly with FAR in previous versions but i haven\u0027t tried the latest versions of it to see. If you find any issue let me know and i\u0027ll fix them ASAP.\n\n3\u003E I actually had plans to completely redo the stock system from scratch (like Alternis Kerbin did in the past), however it\u0027s only been a thought so far. It\u0027s easy enough to do with Kopernicus though.\n\n4\u003E Asteroids are hard coded to spawn outside of Kerbin\u0027s SOI in ksp, so they spawn in a sort-of asteroid field between kerbin and Serran in orbit of Sonnah. I want to look at changing this with something like Custom Asteroids Mod (if it still works) but for now asteroid missions are pretty easy unfortunately.\n\n5\u003E I manually set them, but I\u0027m still not 100% they are perfect. I have had only limited experience with the mods that use them so i might have gotten abundances wrongs sometimes. (This is why feedback is always important for me) AND with the change to the system I\u0027m still not 100% with the new system.\n\n6\u003E No, contracts in stock are generated on a distance scale. So you\u0027ll get contracts depending on distance to another body. I\u0027ve heard custom contracts (like orbital science ones) have unforgiving times (like 3 years to do a minmus mission when it\u0027s now in orbit of Eeloo!). Looking into this is on my to-do list, but i needed to see if it\u0027s stable in 1.0 first before expanding more.\n\n7\u003E Possibly, it\u0027s actually a forum member! We had an incident where i didnt set an atmosphere properly on Serran in an earlier version resulting in it getting about 220atm pressure and he gave me the idea of adding a planet with an insane atmosphere and almost no gravity and after I finished it I decided to name it after him/her!\n\n8\u003E Thats easy enough, go into their configs (GameData\u003ENew\\_Horizons\u003EKopernicusFile\u003ENewHorizonsPlanets\u003E[PLANETNAME]) and find the ring section. Delete everything between the { } and it\u0027ll work fine.\n\n(I also fixed the imgur screw-up, thanks!)\n\nIf theres anything else you want to know, just ask! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Thanks for your work on this.\n\u003E The prospect of the same old system for the 15th time made me look for a changed system and this one looked the most promising, so I\u0027m trying it.\n\u003E \n\u003E I have one question, is there a way to determine the low space/high space boundaries ingame?\n\nat the moment theres no way in-game to do this, however the information is easily readable in the configs. open the config for the planet you want to know about (they are all in the New\\_Horizons folder) and scroll down to the ScienceValues section and i\u0027tll say\n\n                    flyingAltitudeThreshold = [x]                spaceAltitudeThreshold = [x]\n\nthe [x] is the altitude in meters from the surface that the change from low to high takes place"},{"CreatedByName":"Therlun","CreatedById":133436,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T21:40:41Z","Content":"I played a bit with this in science mode.\n\nKerbin orbiting a Gas Giant is cute. The setup definitely provides a different starting experience than the normal Kerbin/Mun/Minmus system. \n\nHowever, in science mode the reduced science yields really impact the gameplay in a negative way.\n\nIt doesn\u0027t feel very rewarding when a surface sample from the Mun or Aptur is actually worth less science than one from Kerbin\u0027s Grasslands 3km away from the KSP. This leads to the odd situation where you do flybys of those moons for the orbital science, but landing on and returning from them is much more effort than it\u0027s worth. Maybe it\u0027s different with contracts in career mode but in science mode grinding all of Kerbin\u0027s biomes is *much* easier *and* more productive, which feels really weird and counter-productive. \n\nI tried to land on Serran next and there seems to be something wrong with it\u0027s atmosphere. Even assuming the extreme stats are intended (three times as dense as Eve, 15 times Kerbin, yet it only starts at 54km?) there seem to be issues with some variables.\n\nIf you go too fast you will just explode at the 54km border. If you manage to slow down enough and survive you will fly through literal glue. The ship will be *instantly* slowed down to 150m/s (maybe? seems to be a display/instrument error, actual speed is more like 15m/s) once it crosses the atmospheric threshold. Any thrust/breaking only has negligible effects as you slowly descend through that tar-like substance.\n\nLater at 20km or 14km there is another similar break point, where the instruments will do another jump to 15m/s (although the actual speed seems unchanged from before, but it\u0027s difficult to tell).\n\nIt seems all atmospheric drag is instantly applied at max value at certain height thresholds, instead of a slowly thickening atmosphere.\n\nI looked at the Serran.cfg but I didn\u0027t find a similar cfg that actually includes the vanilla data for Kerbin so I couldn\u0027t compare the values. I also didn\u0027t reach any other atmospheric bodies yet so I can\u0027t tell if it\u0027s limited to Serran or if it\u0027s a general atmosphere issue with the new planets.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-04T21:57:13Z\u0022 title=\u002205/04/2015 09:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Therlun**"}]}
