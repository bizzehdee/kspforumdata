They have been moved to a LEGACY folder to prevent breaking existing saves, though they may not have textures.  This folder will be deleted with the next KSP release.  \n\nThe new Nom-O-Matics can operate in three modes:   \n\n - As a Converter (Mulch\u002BFertilizer=Supplies)  \n\n - As a Recycler (using a biological filter)  \n\n - As a Hab Multiplier (By repurposing the hab as an indoor mini-park with pretty plants)  \n\nSwitching modes after launch will cost 1,000 EC and 200 supplies, and is an EVA action performed by an engineer.  \n\nThe two radial Nom-O-Matics have been replaced by new, more stock-alike models  \n\nIn Habitation Multipler mode, EC is still consumed to keep the units operational  \n\nRecycler EC cost has been increased (Be sure to check the tooptips)  \n\nFixed an issue in persisting configs that may have resulted in corrupted life support settings, so be sure to recheck these in space center view and re-save.  \n\nFixed a node issue on the inline greenhouse  \n\nAll life support items now appear in a new \u0027Life Support\u0027 category.  \n\nAdded a mini cupola with a corresponding hab bonus.  \n\nLess hobbit-like Kerbals.  The default supply consumption has been adjusted slightly downward (from 16.2 per day to 10.8 per day) - no more second breakfasts.  To adjust for this, change per second consumption to 0.0005 from 0.00075 in the GUI.  \n\nCrew capacity only results in a 7.5 day hab bonus as opposed to 30 days.  This is being done to keep things balanced with dedicated habitation parts, which will have more space but less mass.  \n\nWIth the inclusion of switchable parts, stock adjustments have been rebalanced."},{"CreatedByName":"gsamelon","CreatedById":131652,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-12T11:04:48Z","Content":"awesome work rover dude, thanks for making great mods.\n\nHere is a screenshot of a null ref experienced when i click the life support setup button on the main ksp page:![9YRXAlm.png](http://i.imgur.com/9YRXAlm.png)\n\nI don\u0027t know much about debugging, let me know if there is more info i can provide."},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-12T12:54:26Z","Content":"Start with KSP version and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS version.
