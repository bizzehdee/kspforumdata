Some slower turning craft can overshoot the burn point quite badly) after the de-orbit burn the blue estimated landing location marker is way short of the target, like 1/4 of the way to it along the surface, if you turn the landing guidance module off and re-enable the landing location estimate the blue marker moves to pretty close to your previous target, if you leave the landing guidance on it will do a \u0022course adjustment\u0022 that burns you into an ever-increasing orbit and finally leaves the SOI of duna entirely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can get it to work semi-manually by letting it do the de-orbit burn, manually tweak the estimated landing and target indicators close to each other on my own and then use \u0022land anywhere\u0022 when closer to the surface\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot sure if a bug or not but it would be nice if MJ re-enabled SAS after you disable SmartASS like it did before, or at least have the option.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"willow","CreatedById":13072,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-11T12:45:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI noticed this changeset comment in the jenkins changes list (Changed landing position drawing and picking to use terrain height) I tried to read the code but I don\u0027t quite get it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this a change to the map scene?

The only utilities I\u0027d used thusfar in the flight were limit to terminal velocity and the maneuver planner. While I do have other mods installed, the only components available from other mods which were present on the craft in question were fuel tanks with default liquidfuel and oxidizer resoources in them and red LED\u0027s from B9 aerospace, neither of which should have interacted with throttle in any way.

With one engine disabled and the control part selected on the ship with the active engine, it was hit or miss if it would throttle up when the time came to change the periapsis or circularize.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would rotate to get into position then sometimes it\u0027d auto warp, sometimes not but instead of throttling up it would just fly past the node. Then I changed active engines and control parts and it\u0027d work correctly *one time*. Then it\u0027d fail to throttle up again until I switched active engines and control parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, I\u0027d set the active engine and control part then quicksave. If it didn\u0027t throttle up I\u0027d reload, change ends and it would do the periapsis change burn at apoapsis. So I\u0027d quicksave and try to circularize at periapsis. Nope, no throttle action until I\u0027d change active ends on the docked pair of ships. I was being careful to make sure the controlling part was always on the same ship as the active engine. (Learned that one when my little deorbitizer probe almost managed to push a piece of space junk to a Mun intercept from LKO because I\u0027d left control on the docking port of the booster I wanted to bring down.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would always turn the correct direction to aim the active engine for the burn, but just wasn\u0027t running the throttle half the time. Took quite a while and many saves and reloads to get the orbit down to 15KM circular from the 16~17KM slightly elliptical orbit the ships had been pushed into after several dockings and Kethane transfers and fuel conversions. I could have undocked the two halves of the refinery/fuel depot and changed orbits separately, but that would\u0027ve used more of the painstakingly harvested fuel to rendezvous and re-dock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose little puffs of RCS to back away after undocking can accumulate into some fairly large orbit changes over time. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould it be possible for landing guidance and maneuver planner to detect and warn when there are no active engines on the same side of a docking port as the active control part? \u0022Warning: No active engines on the controlling ship. Thrust may not go the direction you want.\u0022 For example, if you have a booster with a probe core and a docking port but no fuel, then dock something with fuel to it so it can be de-orbited but forget to set control from here to the half of the docked pair with the fuel and active engine, Landing Guidance will aim the wrong direction and burn all the fuel going up and out with a prograde burn instead of a retrograde one.
