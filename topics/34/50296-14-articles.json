Are adding a .625 or 1.25 shield in addition under it? That\u0027s going to really increase (decrease?) the ballistic coefficient. In other words make it very heavy for its drag which is bad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor testing try the 20km to 40km range in 5 or 10km intervals (or less). I find the usual desired zone lies in there. As for \u0022burned up\u0022 results it\u0027s very important to report the amount of ablative shield remaining. It\u0027s a very different problem if the craft exploded with shield remaining or with none.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe normal behavior of DRE is that too steep = over G, too shallow = too long in the burn zone. The squeeze is to find the compromise between G and shield endurance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI should insist that I\u0027m experiencing these issue after tweaking shockwaveExponent to 1.17 as recommended on the first post.
