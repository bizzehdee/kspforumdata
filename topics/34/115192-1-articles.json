Previously, you\u0027d have to revert to the editor (or recover), switch the flag and launch again... NOT ANY MORE!\n\nWith this carefully crafted file of specifically chosen letters you can change your flag at any time while in the flight scene. Mun, Minmus, Eve, below Jool\u0027s surface... you name it, you can change your flag there.\n\nJust click the handy-dandy button that shows your current flag on the toolbar (which will show the flag of your vessel\u0027s root part), pick your new flag and you\u0027re done! Exactly how do all the flags on your ship get reprinted in an instant? Well, actually, we don\u0027t know, but we\u0027re told it has something to do with portals and toasters or something. We\u0027re sure it\u0027s all very complicated.\n\nPlease note this will only effect your active vessel. Our toasters aren\u0027t powerful enough to do it on a global scale, or at least that\u0027s what the scientists told us.\n\nPlanted a flag on a planet only to realise it\u0027s not the right one? You can change those, too!\n\nOur top scientists tell us that it should work with any part mod, so long as they don\u0027t use a custom FlagDecal module, whatever that is.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
