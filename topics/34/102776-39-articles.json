From 150km orbit, it will take about 730 dV to reach escape velocity. Altering the direction you escape from Kerbin relative to it\u0027s orbit around Sonnah (escape heading in the same direction to inherit some of Kerbins energy, escape in the opposite direction to lose some, and anything in between) allows you enter into virtually any desired apsis and correct from there. I\u0027ve found direct encounters with the Mun from Kerbin to be the most elusive for me, but I\u0027m not patient. I want to leave *NOW*, not in three days. \n\nReturning is pretty cheap, typically.

I put on 3 RealChute parachutes to be safe. I also figured that I would need less DeltaV than getting off Kerbin, but that it would still be significant.\n\nSo I built a ship, sent it off, had a rather harrowing landing experience... Lets just say that landing with parachutes is, um, interesting. Anyway, got my science and took off, watched the DeltaV count down as I hit orbit. It didn\u0027t look good... Got a nice transfer window and discovered I didn\u0027t have enough fuel to escape Serran\u0027s SOI.\n\nWelp... Can\u0027t leave em here, so I built a rescue ship. 30 days later I managed to get everyone home safe and sound. Was a really fun mission and it may have been a lot less harrowing if I had a map.
