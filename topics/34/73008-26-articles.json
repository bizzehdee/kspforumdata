The Mk2 Fuselage has a much bigger volume than that, from pure volume I\u0027d say it could even contain 1200 units of fuel, but being a plane fuselage, it probably has additional things like structural reinforcements, electronics, channels for intake air, which take away space for fuel.

Angle snap causing random pivoting near other parts and symmetry not working on bicouplers, that happens with stock parts aswell. It\u0027s just how the editor handles things, and until the devs revise them, we have to live with it. The bi-coupler symmetry thing in particular is caused by the colliders of the parts beeing slightly over 1.25m in diameter, touching each other, and thus the symmetry prohibits you to place them. This is indeed very annoying, but can be solved by enabling part clipping.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Higgi91","CreatedById":8380,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-21T10:24:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnyone else getting parts randomly \u0027crashed into launchpad\u0027 when in general operation?
