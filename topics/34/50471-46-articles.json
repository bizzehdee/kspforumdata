All image files in GameData, no matter what they are (jpg? png? mbm? tga? bmp? whatever) are loaded and converted to bitmap, then either stored (if mbm with no-compress flag, or tga) or compressed (to DXT1 if no alpha channel or DXT5 if alpha channel, if png or normal mbm). What that mod does is also compress the files that weren\u0027t automatically compressed (again, to DXT1 or 5, using the same built in Compress() call that KSP calls for pngs etc).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, pngs are already compressed by KSP natively; their issue is that there\u0027s a bug where mipmaps aren\u0027t autogenerated for them like they are for mbms and tgas. The best format for KSP textures remains MBM...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jrandom","CreatedById":74522,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-04T02:40:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAn now I am enlightened. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain_Party","CreatedById":59820,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-04T12:02:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not about how much RAM I HAVE, I just a) Don\u0027t need them with ST and \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E Removing them, I can add MOAR MODZ, like KOSMOS, AIES and Soviet Engines.
