But if you do than you can make halve the tech tree on kerbin alone. If you try to play with less you get forced to grind, like me with a 40%.\n\nI would like something like: first biome 100% (first time landed first time splashed). second one 50% third one 25% fourth one 10% and then goes to 0 the rest of the science is provided as raw data. (if you get out 25% science you get 75 % as raw data resource).\n\nSince Labs are too strong I would change them in a way that the more advanced experiments also only give a raw data resource that you have to process first(would take goo and materials bay, moving goo up in tech tree and the thermometer/pressure/other sensors down). \n\nMaybe if I can motivate myself...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-04-23T14:07:50Z\u0022 title=\u002204/23/2018 02:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EApril 23, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by SchitzoSchaf**\n  \nadded some more stuff"},{"CreatedByName":"Beetlecat","CreatedById":92207,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-25T23:28:16Z","Content":"While we\u0027re asking [@Gordon Dry](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/163177-gordon-dry/) about the skyboxes -- what mod adds the little \u0022file manger\u0022 widget for the science data?
