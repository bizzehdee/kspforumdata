Using Kethane and EL, I scanned Laythe and found a kethane deposit and an ore deposit that, although not overlapping anywhere, were perfectly adjacent at one point. As there were no other combined deposits on land, I figured I would land precisely on the border of the hexes and extend one drill into one hex and another into the other. Mining the kethane works great, but I have to undock my ore miner for it to mine ore. It seems that the Kethane mod checks for which hex the center of the craft is in as opposed to which hex the drill itself is penetrating. Is this indeed the case? If so, how difficult would it be for the code to be modified to check the physical location of the drill?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor now, does anyone have any suggestions to save me from having to unlink my pipes any time I want to mine ore?

Ok, SCANsat already has a method for background scanning built in, but still, it took me literally five minutes to come up with a workable solution. The trick is that SCANsat doesn\u0027t actually scan anything in the background, it just records what sensors have flown over what area of the planet. The elevation and biome scanning is all done when the map is drawn. The same thing is possible with Kethane, you just check which areas of the planet have been scanned and which cell those areas correspond to.\u003Cp\u003EThe active vessel, with the blue orbit, does not have a Kethane scanner and is orbiting at ~750km. The inactive vessel, in grey, has a small Kethane scanner with a SCANsat module attached to it and is orbiting at ~250km. It took about 15 sec at max time warp to go from the map shown in my last post to this map. The Kethane grid doesn\u0027t seem to accept my additions to its database until I reload, but the SCANsat map (note the \u0022Rebuild Kethane\u0022 button) works fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI added a Kethane sensorType to SCANsat (using sensorType = 4, the old slope scanner number), set the fov = 1 and the best alt = 250000. The rebuild button checks which cells have been scanned and adds them to the Kethane database. I\u0027m guessing you need an active Kethane sensor or part on the vessel for the grid to update without reloading. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if the reason for not having background scanning really is technical and not philosophical then I don\u0027t see any reason why this can\u0027t be added to SCANsat.
