My dad\u0027s health deteriorated badly and I\u0027ve gone from \u0022occasional helper with chores\u0022 to \u0022live in caretaker\u0022. Basically - if not for my being here, dad would\u0027ve had to go to a nursing home most likely. And no one wants that. He\u0027s still mentally sharp. Just very frail these days. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso about the last time I posted here, I was just about burned out, and the changes to KSP had me (and a lot of people) kinda ticked off. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I hadn\u0027t even touched KSP up until very recently, when I updated to .21 and .22 and began practicing with the plain vanilla parts and techniques. Have placed space stations and refueling depots in Kerbin and Munar orbit. Got a couple of nuclear powered tugs pushing craft around. Landed on the Mun and Minmus. (One lander got re-used and refueled 4 times and has made 2 landings on both the Mun and Minmus!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I got some good practice with the basic systems and have been getting back up to speed. With 22 out I figured now was a good time to check on all the mods and start reloading things. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWas delighted to see that Devo had a Mk 3 Eagle. So naturally that was one of the first things I downloaded. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEarlier in this thread, there was that challenge that Devo posted about landing the Eagle on the VAB. That sounded like a good first goal. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHoly crap it was tough! More than it had any right to be! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah - noticed some problems with the Eagle. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-- No engine sounds. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-- Didn\u0027t seem to have near enough torque for stability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was REALLY wobbly. More than the old Mk 2. I crashed it a few times. Finally decided to see what attaching an extra SAS unit to the main body would do. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt made it a LOT more stable! And I got a good landing on top of the VAB out of it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/pnQguvv.png\u0022 alt=\u0022pnQguvv.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Hmmm...\u0022 says I. \u0022Let\u0027s take a look at the craft files and compare them to the squad equivalents.\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I found was very interesting and enlightening. There\u0027s some new code for .22 (that seems geared for the new science system). And the SAS module code was changed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost importantly - in comparing the Eagle\u0027s nosecone ASAS with a standard SAS or flywheel, I realized that with the changes to .21 and .22 that that little Eagle nosecone was doing NOTHING. NADA. ZILCH. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I didn\u0027t think I liked what I was seeing in the Command pod as far as SAS code either. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo here\u0027s the experiment I ran. I replaced the code in the command pod for SAS functions with the equivalent values from the standard 3-man capsule. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext I took the Squad reaction wheel code and pretty much replaced everything in the old Eagle ASAS part with that. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile I was messing around in the guts of the command pod, I made it into a two-man pod with the cockpit interior of the Gemini capsule from the Novapunch mod packs. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I checked on the engine sounds coding and replaced the values there with Squad equivalents. Specifically - I made the Eagle nuclear main engines sound like the vanilla Nuclear rockets. And I replaced the VTOL thruster sounds with jet engine sounds (since that\u0027s the closest the original Eagle from the TV show sounded like). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo - how\u0027s it handle now? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA HELL of a lot more stable!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWas able to VTOL around KSC with much more confidence and hover rock steady. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7mo1QyH.png\u0022 alt=\u00227mo1QyH.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JQSUPNr.png\u0022 alt=\u0022JQSUPNr.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/i3fEnuC.png\u0022 alt=\u0022i3fEnuC.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Dwnm3IA.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Dwnm3IA.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5edf12Z.png\u0022 alt=\u00225edf12Z.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo - in summary - \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Fixed up the engine sounds\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Fixed much of the stability issues\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- modded the cockpit interior\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Added reporting of science functionality to the command module (still tweaking that)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso looking into the possibility of adding the Eagle parts to the Tech Tree since I THINK I understand the code for that.

(The LLL stuff has gotten even BETTER for that purpose now, I might add. It\u0027s no longer quite the chore it used to be to try and make the stuff fit the right way.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the problems I noticed was that if you make an entire LLL pod into a fuel tank, the Eagle can just BARELY lift off with it. That could obviously be a problem for heavy loads. The Eagle Mk 3 isn\u0027t as ridiculously overpowered as the Eagle mk2 was. So although it\u0027s a bit of a challenge, that\u0027s a change I approve of. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever - I thought that there SHOULD be an obvious solution to the problem of heavy loads - add VTOL thrusters to the pods. All Eagle pods should have the extra thrusters on them, right? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the Mk 2 Eagle I tried and tried to figure out a way to make that work. And I never could. I guess it makes sense. For one thing, the pods were built at 90 degrees off-angle to the Eagle and although the engines would attach just fine, they wouldn\u0027t actually activate. I think part of the problem with the Mk 2 Eagle was just the way that the VTOL activation was \u0022hard-wired\u0022 in to MechJeb. You couldn\u0027t really add extra engines to it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I started to add engines to the Mk 3 pods and ran into the same problem! I was tearing my hair out trying to clip fuel lines from the truss to the pod engines thinking that fuel flow might be the problem. No go. They\u0027d attach just fine but they wouldn\u0027t fire up. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I finally got a clue when I added the extra engines to the truss itself directly just to see what happened, and they STILL wouldn\u0027t fire. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETHAT\u0027S when I facepalmed. ACTION GROUPS!! Logan you IDIOT!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*sigh* \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah. Add the new VTOL thrusters to the same action group that Devo assigned and VOILA! They all work now! No extra fuel lines required - just make sure whatever you attach them to is crossfeed capable and you\u0027re good. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/PVOCLap.png\u0022 alt=\u0022PVOCLap.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/m3PxHk1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022m3PxHk1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/eIzOhzg.png\u0022 alt=\u0022eIzOhzg.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ccsZ5TJ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ccsZ5TJ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Passenger Pod Eagle is made purely from Lackluster Labs (LLL) parts that have been updated for KSP .22. The LLL doors on either side turn the structural pod into a space capable of carrying 16 Kerbals. (8 per door)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso - I might add that if you have those extra thrusters on a light load like the passenger pod above? It has a LOT of extra power to spare for lift and the engines throttle requirements are cut in half for getting off the ground. Since the basic Eagle is not as overpowered, I\u0027m guessing it wouldn\u0027t have as easy of a time getting off of Eve as the Mk 2 did. However - I\u0027d bet that as long as you had enough fuel, that a Mk 3 carrying a light passenger pod with the extra thrusters should be able to do it. (Might be useful for getting stranded Kerbals off of Eve, yes?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith Mechjeb 2 attached, and the mods that I made in my previous post, the Eagle has OUTSTANDING performance!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI want to point out something for anyone moving from the Mk 2 experience to the Mk 3. Remember the old \u0022nosedive\u0022 issues? Gone. But now there\u0027s a Nose UP tendency. However it\u0027s not as instant. And it actually helps offset heavier loads, which I think was the point. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll take the nose up over a nose dive any day. A nose pitch UP doesn\u0027t instantly put you in danger like a nose dive would. The pitch up on the Mk 3 also is a bit slower to happen than the nosedive of the Mk 2. Which gives you more time to react to it and correct for it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen operating with Mechjeb 2.0 it\u0027s an absolute dream to fly, even with a load. It\u0027s easily manageable to orbit and has plenty of control. Mind you - you do want to keep the RCS on a little more with the Mk3. But the over-correcting wobble I experienced in purely manual flight is damped right out when flying with Mechjeb\u0027s Kill Rotation and Surf features and RCS use is minimal. Just enough to correct for any pitch-up that occurs and damp it right out. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the fact that you can REFUEL the Eagles now! That\u0027s just awesome. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact, take a look - remember the Kethane prospecting unit from previous posts of mine? It\u0027s a lot more streamlined and useful now. Check it out -\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/aGkjEhf.png\u0022 alt=\u0022aGkjEhf.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/l6N0gKl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022l6N0gKl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Kethane Prospector Pod requires the LLL, Kethane, and Kerbal Attachment System (KAS) mods that have been updated for .22. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the front end of the pod is the Kethane Cracking unit. Right behind that is the Kethane Storage tank. Attached to the sides of that are the drilling units, solar panels for extra power, and a pair of KAS storage boxes that have pipes and struts for use in refueling other vehicles and some more solar panels you can add, just in case. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBehind the Kethane tank is the bay that holds the Kethane sensor. Technically the doors don\u0027t HAVE to be open for the Kethane sensor to work, but they sure do make right clicking for activation a lot easier! Behind the Sensor bay is an RCS tank and a Fuel tank. I\u0027ve attached a pair of hatches as well that in LLL style define a small lab/living area for more kerbals. This isn\u0027t a passenger pod, but there\u0027s still room for 6 Kerbals back there if you need to mount a rescue mission. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have one of these currently orbiting the Mun after a full refuel. It\u0027s ready to depart and I\u0027m thinking of sending it off to Duna. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the Kethane Prospector pod in place, you have a powerful ship that can refuel anywhere that it can detect Kethane. It has effectively unlimited range. you could mount a complete \u0022Grand Tour\u0022 of the entire Kerbol system just with that ship right there. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMind you - there\u0027s still a slight problem. Releasing those pods is now possible - the parts no longer clip and blow up the ship if you release them from their mounting points. But they may fall apart still and there\u0027s no guarantee that you can redock properly with them. But if you HAD to get rid of them, you could do so safely. I\u0027m still working on making versions that can be picked back up again. I\u0027m having to redo a lot of stuff from scratch. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway. Aside from fully integrating the Eagle parts into the .22 tech tree, I\u0027d call the Mk 3 Eagle pretty much DONE. Everything about the performance issues of the Mk 1 and 2 has been addressed properly and it can fly properly - and refuel! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s only one thing left - and that\u0027s the authentic Eagle pods from the source material itself. But considering that you can build your own now, I\u0027ll be satisfied even if that never shows up. One suggestion to Devo if you ever do make them - the pod landing gear should be usable with other style pods than the Space 1999 versions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it\u0027s pretty clear how I built those pods just by looking at them.
