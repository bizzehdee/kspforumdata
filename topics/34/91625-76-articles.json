Most of the work for contextual contracts is around selecting \u0022appropriate\u0022 vessels for that contextual contract (example: you don\u0027t want to choose something landed on the surface for a \u0022reposition satellite\u0022 contract). As far as I know, this logic is baked right into each type of contract. Also, Contract Configurator provides modders with the ability to do that type of thing through its expression syntax.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s some new logic in 1.0.5 for tracking a numeric \u0022progress\u0022 variable that is used internally to determine when certain types of contracts get offered.

Then changed my mind because it is mostly done in another way in the SETI contracts pack. I don\u0027t know the exact way it was put in but my idea was based on the diagram of SETI \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/106130#SETIcontracts\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/106130#SETIcontracts\u003C/a\u003E . Take a ruler and draw lines across in and you see a pattern. At the top is low technology contracts and at the bottom is high technology contacts. As the player moves along the flow chart give him an increasing score and use that to judge what the next technology tier is available to spawn contracts. So if orbit and recovery is unlocked you can use this score to trigger say the Remote tech pack. That way Remote tech does not appear until after the first successful orbit. It just gets toggled on in settings when the score hits the right number. Right now I deselect the pack in settings and switch it back on when appropriate manually. It could be a way to automate this based on progress. \u003Cp\u003EAnyway.
