Except for one thing: It will not aerobrake. Not properly, anyway. When reentering, I assume a 35\u00C3\u00A2\u00C2\u00C2\u00B0 nose-up attitude, and wait for the atmosphere to start slowing the ship down. Instead, it pushes the nose down to a maximum of ~10\u00C3\u00A2\u00C2\u00C2\u00B0, at full pitch up. This is low enough that the wings are lifting the ship, which means the damn thing just flies along at 40\u002B km altitude and ~2 km/s. It slows down extremely slowly. It will even \u003Cem\u003Egain\u003C/em\u003E altitude, depending on circumstances.

I should mention that the only thing I\u0027m attempting to land is a 3 person command pod, with 2.5 m heatshield attached. Also, every component of the ship says \u0022isshielded: false\u0022, and no part displays temperatures. All of these things suggest a programming glitch, but since there\u0027s crossover between both mods, I don\u0027t know which. The guy in charge of DE is being quiet until 0.21 comes out, so I was hoping someone here has some ideas or experience with this issue. Specifically, what conditions make for viable reentry? I\u0027m looking everywhere and don\u0027t see consistent numbers, and this thread is so long I\u0027m not even sure where to begin. So let\u0027s begin here!

I would suggest setting your periapsis lower and trading lower heating for higher g-loads. Probably pushing periapsis down to 10km or less should work for reentry from a circular 80km orbit. Remember, the longer you stay in the upper atmosphere the more heat is absorbed by the heat shield, which will degrade it faster. You want to dive quickly to try and bleed off speed so that the heat shield survives the reentry.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-21T07:24:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETrying again--last time I posted this it didn\u0027t show up\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(crossposted to the DRE thread)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, I\u0027m absolutely loving FAR, thank you so much!

FAR applies open-node drag by first raycasting from CoM to node to find where the node is; on the 2.5m heatshield, for example, both top and bottom nodes are above CoM so there\u0027s no open bottom node, and thus very little drag (Cd of 0.05 vs 0.6 for unshielded Mk1-2 pod). If you move the node below the CoM (and move the model too, so no visual changes) then all\u0027s well--you get a Cd of like .4 or so, which makes sense for a rounder, smoother, more aerodynamic bottom.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChanges:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ereplace asset params and node defs with this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E// --- asset parameters ---\u003Cbr\u003E//mesh = model.mu\u003Cbr\u003EMODEL\u003Cbr\u003E{\u003Cbr\u003E\tmodel=DeadlyReentry/Parts/deadlyReentry_2.5Heatshield/model\u003Cbr\u003E\tposition = 0.0, -0.1, 0.0\u003Cbr\u003E\t// bnode of shield was at 0.05*1.3=0.065\u003Cbr\u003E\t// tnode of shield was at 0.145*1.3=.1885\u003Cbr\u003E\tscale = 1.3, 1.3, 1.3\u003Cbr\u003E\trotation = 0, 0, 0\u003Cbr\u003E}\u003Cbr\u003Escale = 1\u003Cbr\u003ErescaleFactor = 1.0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E// --- node definitions ---\u003Cbr\u003E// definition format is Position X, Position Y, Position Z, Up X, Up Y, Up Z\u003Cbr\u003E//node_stack_bottom = 0.0, 0.05, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 2\u003Cbr\u003E//node_stack_top = 0.0, 0.145, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 2\u003Cbr\u003Enode_stack_bottom = 0.0, -0.035, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 2\u003Cbr\u003Enode_stack_top = 0.0, 0.0885, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 2\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can do the same thing for the other shields with this issue: replace mesh= with a MODEL{} block, move the model and both nodes down by the same amount.
