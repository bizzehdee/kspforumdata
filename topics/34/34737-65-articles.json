Prebuilt or semi prebuilt parts can sometimes look nice, but it also limits their use. Most of us play KSP because of its freedom and I think that parts should allow for that, instead of restricting the users or uses. The best parts are parts that get used in ways the designers of those parts never envisioned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis also means parts should be relatively simple. Although it is tempting to embellish, they are a means and not an end. They should not be show pieces, but functional and beautifully simple.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The look and feel should blend nicely with stock KSP and stock parts. I think it has been noted that the current look sometimes does not really match up with KSP parts. They generally look good on their own, but seem a bit out of place when combined with other parts to make a vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, some parts are hard to combine with stock parts while still looking good. A notable example it the powered hinge (\u0022taller motorized hinge\u0022) - which is incredibly useful - but through its width makes it hard to build anything that looks good. No truss or beam will fit it right. Either the hinge is way too small, or its surface is so big that truss will only cover its surface partly, looking odd.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOutside of the textures I like the general look of the parts, the only and major exception being the VTOL rotatron. The single flat powered hinge with a different model looks fine, but seems redundant as the open and closed hinges do the same thing (and look even better).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I would really love kOS support - but I know that is being worked on, so I will sit quietly in my corner \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E I know that Sirkut is taking a coding break from things and I think that is a very smart move.
