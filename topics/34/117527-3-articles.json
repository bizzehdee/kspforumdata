Right now, KSP has several bugs with cargo bays, including spontaneous explosions, and spontaneous overheating. It has something to do with how the bay\u0027s shielding turns the contents \u0022on and off\u0022. That is, they\u0027re physicsless when the doors are closed, but as soon as it opens, the physics start getting applied. It\u0027s entirely a KSP problem, rather than a problem with the bay.\n\nAs much as I hate to say it, it\u0027s probable just going to take some trial and error to make rovers that can survive it."},{"CreatedByName":"CarnageINC","CreatedById":132865,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-20T19:43:32Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Unfortunately I\u0027m not sure what to suggest.

Your response helped me zero in on why my rovers explode. Simple fix was to ensure that I left one center line attachment point on the end of the rover directed towards the opening of the door.

Another idea of course is to just go 2.5m, but make an otherwise compact pod.\n\nThere is (was, not updated since 0.90) the [**Mk1-1 A2 command pod**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/98250-WIP-Parts-2-Kerbal-Command-Pod-Mk-1-1-A2-%28Alpha-0-36%29), a sort of squashed 2.5m pod that seats 2. That diameter feels too big for two-seaters, though.\n\nI\u0027ve fallen in love with HGR\u0027s 1.875m parts, so I\u0027m 110% on board with that one. Much like Gemini\u0027s diameter sits between Mercury and Apollo (not a perfect arithmetic progression, but 1.8-3-3.8 meters isn\u0027t bad), 1.875m feels right for two-seaters. A 1.875m heat shield and a 1.25 and/or 2.5m adapter/service tank or two (contents: RCS? LFO? Combo? Both separately?) would do the trick. (HGR and MOLE combine adapters using engine-fairing tricks like your Zero-Point Inline Fairings and Firespitter mesh switching, respectively, but neither has tank functionality.)\n\nI\u0027ll see about sketching up some profiles for what the part could look like; in the meantime, here\u0027s a concept by SockeAA (unfortunately never finished, since his hard drive failed) that I like. I think I\u0027ve mentioned it before, but here it is:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E [![I9c7HTj.png](https://i.imgur.com/I9c7HTj.png)](https://i.imgur.com/I9c7HTj.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E [![9I8h8SK.png](https://i.imgur.com/9I8h8SK.png)](https://i.imgur.com/9I8h8SK.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nHaving a 1.25m front end instead of the 0.625m nodes of the HGR Radish (Gemini-based) or MOLE (1.875m \u0022backseat\u0022 for the Mk1) means that the capsule gets to mount a proper crew-passable docking port like the Dragon does.\n\nAs an alternative to having a straight-up 1.875m bottom, you could instead have it narrow down to a 1.25m flat bottom, kind of like Vahal\u0027s upper drawings do. (It would still probably need a 1.875m heat shield, since I\u0027m pretty sure the shield needs to cover the whole \u0022face\u0022 of the spacecraft to work, and then the heat shield\u0027s fairing could serve to visually adapt to 1.25m.)\n\nIn the extreme case (not one I prefer, to be honest), it could be a 1.25m pod that has a bulge in the middle, even a sphere capped on both ends by smaller-diameter nodes.
