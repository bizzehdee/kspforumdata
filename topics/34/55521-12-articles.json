I have to say I absolutely love it as well as the provided pre-made ship to take into orbit. The soyjuice is extremely efficient for traveling in low Kerbin orbit and I think it\u0027s going to become a permanent addition to my space station ferries just as the real one (I also have the space shuttle but it\u0027s a bit big and clunky to dock!).
