In general, solar panels will not produce large amounts of power in orbit around Kerbin, and so LKO solar power plants are a novelty at berst. However, thanks to the inverse square law, if you can send a satellite into a low solar orbit, it will produce a very large amount of power. A satellite with just 2 gigantors can match the output of an un-upgraded 1.25m fission reactor/generator combo in a 500 Mm orbit around Kerbol. By placing very large satellites in low-Kerbol orbit, large amounts of free electricity can be collected and transmitted, with the added advantage of always knowing that you can point your receivers towards the sun for maximum power output.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s entirely possible to send a big solar satellite to low Koerbol orbit and, given enough radiators, any generator attached will send out power (obviously, you\u0027ll need a transceiver as well..)
