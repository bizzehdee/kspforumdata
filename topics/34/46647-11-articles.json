For reference, the TWR1 Low message is supposed to come up when an 80% throttle setting is less then TWR of 1. (Or a 100% throttle with a TWR of less the 1.25.) I suspect I\u0027m calculation the available upwards thrust incorrectly as that changed in KSP 1.0 and I missed something when I updated. This will be the first thing I look at tomorrow, until then the Velocity Control should still work even if the TWR1 Low warning is displaying.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-14T03:33:55Z\u0022 title=\u002205/14/2015 03:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Diazo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Diazo","CreatedById":81549,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T00:58:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlright, I was able to take a look at this and I am unable to replicate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll that means however is that you are using a different engine then I am.
