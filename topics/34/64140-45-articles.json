A 3.75m heat shield weighs 4.2 tons, as much as an entire empty Dragon spacecraft, whereas the Apollo heat shield only weighed 850 kg. Reducing the amount of ablative is currently a workaround, but this is imprecise and the balance seems a bit off compared to real-world ablatives. For example, when I removed ablative from a 3.75m shield to reduce its total mass to 1 ton and performed a ballistic reentry from 400 km LEO with a 0 km periapse, with a pre-entry spacecraft mass of 9 tons, all of the shield\u0027s ablative was expended, (although it did not burn up). I would like to be able to adjust the amount and effectiveness of the ablative material to approximate different real-world materials and requirements (e.g. reinforced carbon-carbon shield for ballistic entry on Jupiter vs. multi-use PICA-X shield for lifting entry from LEO).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would also like to be able to change the shape and length of heat shields just like with the tanks and nose cones. The current fixed \u0022pill\u0022 shape doesn\u0027t fit smoothly with many parts. Real-world heat shields typically use either spherical sections or sphere-cones, neither of which are currently possible with Procedural Heat Shields. For that matter, an adjustable top diameter as used in procedural tanks and structural elements would allow biconic heat shields and other more complex sections. Making the heat shields hollow, with an adjustable position for the \u0022internal\u0022 node, would also help a lot, although I\u0027m guessing it would require changing the plugin\u0027s code.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m guessing some of these features would have to be implemented in future updates to Procedural Parts, but for the time being are there any changes that could be made to the config files to allow some of them?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-12T23:19:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYep, sorry, not a project I plan to take on right now.
