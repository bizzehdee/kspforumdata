It\u0027s the same basic reactor/generator design (1 reactor attached to 1 generator with 6 radiators) You can see the reactor and generator are running fine! I can switch away and come back to this ship until hell freezes over and the reactor will still be running!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPicture 4,5, and 6 show that when I return to the mk2 version of the ship the lights in the front half of the ship are out??? The next picture shows the reactor is offline even though it has fuel and it should have had a continuous 187\u002B MW of power from the 30GW generator to keep it running yet the reactor is friggin shut down!!!! WHY? The last picture is me just clicking activate reactor and the damn thing starts right back up again. I can sit with the ship active for 1 minute or 24 hours and the reactor runs just fricken fine. But as soon as I switch away to anything and immediately come back half the damn lights are off and the reactor is shut down again!!!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SirusKing","CreatedById":98303,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-03T13:07:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs the other model for the acclubeir drive meant to be in the experimental science node?

I have three reactors already in orbit that have been and are functioning for weeks (RL) and years (IG).

It has the upgraded high-q tokamak 55gw fusion reactor, the ktec solid state generator, 6 huge graphine radiators, 4x1200Ec batteries, 6xblutonium generators, and a computer core. This is the core of the power system on my four working power stations (3 stations and 1 Dt Vista ship). these have been in continuous use for several kerbal years and are still working fine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever the new ship I built last night and spent the last 16\u002B hours trying to debug will not keep the reactor running if I switch away from the ship!

From what I remember of messing around with the microwave-thermal recievers, ground stations work well right after launch but quickly drop off as you get higher and the angle of incidence increases, so geosynchronous relays set up to be near the horizon when at KSC might be best. If you have the station above KSC and relay(s) off to one side, you should get good power throughout your gravity turn ... I think.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@ctbram: Okay, that\u0027s just weird. Don\u0027t think I\u0027ve had that happen before. I\u0027ve had a few unexpected reactor shutdowns, but those were generally while I had the vessel focused, and there was usually a reason once you investigated (weird waste heat fluctuations at high timewarp, or running out of tritium in the reactor because all the bred tritium went into external containers ...). I really can\u0027t think of anything besides a bug that would be causing your problems. Uhh ... try deleting and reinstalling KSPI? I have no idea if that would help, but it might. Make sure you get it reinstalled before you load up the game so it doesn\u0027t delete your ships for having invalid parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Just loaded the game and switched to my Asteroid Tug with the 3.75m fusion reactor, and it was offline ... well well well.
