You will probably need to add a text filter, so edit this section.\n\n    TextFilters  \n\n    {  \n\n        // --- Text Filters - Stock System-----------------  \n\n        // In the stock system these combinations are not possible  \n\n        TEXT\\_FILTER = Kerbin Splashed Mountains|Highlands\n\n        // [x] Science! is assuming this is in Shores not Grasslands  \n\n        // probly need a special case in code, banning it for now.  \n\n        TEXT\\_FILTER = Baikerbanur  \n\n    }\n\nYou can add any text to this section as a filter.  The idea is that if you can type it into the filter in the main science window then you can add it here.  Write a filter like\n\nTEXT\\_FILTER = PlanetName|PlanetNameToo Splashed\n\nThat should do the trick\n\nIf you get it to work, let me know and I\u0027ll add it to the next release.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-08-14T21:26:44Z\u0022 title=\u002208/14/2017 09:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 14, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Z-Key Aerospace**"},{"CreatedByName":"OhioBob","CreatedById":128005,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-14T21:30:43Z","Content":"Thanks, [@Z-Key Aerospace](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/138926-z-key-aerospace/).

It just tells you when there is science experiments available to be run, and provides an interface with buttons to run the experiments, so you don\u0027t have to go hunting for the science part. There are other mods that do automate science, but I find this better as sometimes I want to save a particular \u0022run once\u0022 experiment until I reach somewhere specific. Using this I can just not click the button to run the experiment until I get to where I want to run it."}]}
