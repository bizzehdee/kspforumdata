There is no need to launch a smelter, or even an auger. In fact, there is generally no need for either to have a surface velocity greater than 1m/s (orbital velocity depends on the radius and rotation speed of the body, and the latitude of the part). There is a reason I put orbital construction in EL and made it so pads work in orbit and the orbital dock works on the surface (actually, as far as EL is concerned, there\u0027s no difference between the dock and any pads).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, sometimes it is necessary to move augers about, so they being not too cumbersome is reasonable. In fact, I carted one by truck 500km across Kerbin to the nearest ore deposit, and then back again. I then smelted the ore into metal at KSC and flew the metal to Minmus. There I converted into parts to build storage for more parts to build more storage for parts to build a smelter\u002Bauger assembly.

I have never used hyperedit, though I have occasionally edited rocket parts into my containers. For the most part, the only chance I get to play is while testing, and I get to kill three birds with one stone: I get to play (yay!), I test EL (or MFT, though thankfully it\u0027s pretty stable) functionality, and I play-test EL (which using any cheats would defeat). I even drove a truck 1000km, suffering many crashes (both of truck into ground and KSP into command line) along the way, in the name of play-testing (\u0022How small a seed can I use to bootstrap a minmus base?\u0022 answer: two large hexcans of ore -\u0026gt; 3 large hexcans of metal (half full), plus one empty hexcan for parts)).

If you import it from something else I think Unity will interpolate a bunch more frames between the ones you set. But if you made it in Unity I think you need to have less than 180\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003E between keyframes. The Euler angle values that you set get converted internally into Quaternions, which won\u0027t necessarily rotate the way you expect them too if the difference is more than 180\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003E between keyframes.

It was still jumping back after 180 degrees, but since the large auger had a double helix screw (which has 180 degree symmetry), it didn\u0027t appear like it was jumping back.
