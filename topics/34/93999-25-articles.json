A lot of stuff is already done and at the moment I\u0027m trying to port the mod from its Kopernicus \u002B Kittopia \u002B RSS method of adding planets to the more refined KittopiaTech, which is a mix of Kittopia and Kopernicus. This solves a few long standing bugs, although sadly not the biome bug. Development of Kopernicus has become more active in the last few days, so that might lead to a fix for that one though (so fingers crossed).
