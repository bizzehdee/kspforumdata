I\u0027m talking on the same ship, not connecting two ships together. If you connected two ships via pipes or docking ports etc first, then you could do the fuel lines to make it work.

I added some to a folding station design, using IR hinges to hinge out 5m trusses with docking ports on the ends, added strut connectors to the top and bottom of each near the docking port, struts in the same direction as the hinge to counter motion, added strut connectors to the main body of the station 45 degrees up and down from the docking port location, made a kerbal go out there and join all the points together, ship bumping into the docking port a bit still makes the entire arm bend, and can make the struts snap loose, it\u0027s nowhere near as strong as the stock struts, not to mention the KW struts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RzAbV2W.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022RzAbV2W.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould be nice if they were strong enough to be viable for assembling stations, securing loads connected to winches etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-22T12:45:20Z\u0022 title=\u002201/22/2014 12:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 22, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by K3|Chris\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
