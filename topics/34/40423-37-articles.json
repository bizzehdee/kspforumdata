In other words, when you press the key to translate left, the velocity vector on the gauge (yellow prograde marker) will always move directly left, and so on. Likewise, regardless of craft orientation, pitching your craft up will always move the white crosshairs up relative to the orange alignment circle, or in other words will move to orange alignment circle downward on the gauge.
