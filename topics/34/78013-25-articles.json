Sadly ISP isnt a nice solution, it makes my rocket go even faster on low altitudes due to extreme acceleration with close to empty boosters. I would love a mod that makes just Kerbin larger so i would need about 1000m/s more DeltaV to get into orbit. Until then i will play without FAR or NEAR, while its awesome for spaceplanes and realism it just makes rockets to easy...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike this one: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/90088-6-4x-Kerbol-System-v2-0-1-RSS-Config-11-16-14\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/90088-6-4x-Kerbol-System-v2-0-1-RSS-Config-11-16-14\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t try it but I heard that it works like a charm with FAR/NEAR.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Drelam","CreatedById":103798,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-25T08:13:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESince there is little documantation (or i simply cannot find one) and i don\u0027t have the time to read the previous 63 pages i hope you can answer some of my questions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat does Ctrl Dflct and Flp/splr Dflct exactly mean (when right clicking control surfaces) and where can i find relilabe documentation about things like that?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow can i prevent control surfaces to continously \u0022swinging\u0022 in flight (steering up/down all the time, instead of just keep course). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a option to engage SAS that makes the craft fly straight, instead of flying uncontrollable?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(that\u0027s not just at one of my airplanes, but on ALL of them)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore you ask, i have read all tutorials i could find in the last months. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes COL is just behind COM (with and without fuel).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI try to keep as few control surfaces as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t get me wrong i always try to solve problems like this for myself before asking you guys here at the formus, but i have come to a point where it becomes really frustrating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy question doesn\u0027t refer to a specific craft i have build, but it it more general, because i have problems like this even with aircraft/SSTOs from other people.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Crzyrndm","CreatedById":92871,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-25T08:29:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Drelam\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Drelam\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhat does Ctrl Dflct and Flp/splr Dflct exactly mean (when right clicking control surfaces) and where can i find relilabe documentation about things like that?\u003Cp\u003EHow can i prevent control surfaces to continously \u0022swinging\u0022 in flight (steering up/down all the time, instead of just keep course). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a option to engage SAS that makes the craft fly straight, instead of flying uncontrollable?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EControl Deflection is the maximum angle a surface can deflect by when the relevant control input is maxed (eg. roll for ailerons).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlap/Spoiler deflection is the same thing, just for when you use the surface as a flap or spoiler instead of a surface that responds to pitch/roll/yaw control input.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the SAS issues: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100073-0-90-Pilot-Assistant-Atmospheric-piloting-aids-0-9-6-0-%28Dec-20%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100073-0-90-Pilot-Assistant-Atmospheric-piloting-aids-0-9-6-0-%28Dec-20%29\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOpen the SAS window =\u0026gt; switch it over to stock SAS =\u0026gt; increase the scalar value under the pitch heading until the oscillations stop\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Andrewmacor","CreatedById":82259,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-25T19:52:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo lately MM is telling me that there is 11 errors in the GameData/NEAR/NEAR folder and I have tried re downloading and re installing the mod fresh.

Either that or I\u0027ve just not setup NEAR correctly. I\u0027ve started a new career mode game so I have limited parts. I\u0027ve assembled a small ship built with the mk1 command pod, an RT-20 solid rocket booster and some parachutes. According to Mechjeb (I do have the MechJebNEARExt.dll so I expected Mechjeb to give accurate data), the drag coefficient is only 0.009. And even if Mechjeb isn\u0027t giving accurate data, the small RT-20 rocket apparently has enough thrust on it\u0027s own to push my ship up to about 94km. As soon as I remove NEAR the exact same ship can barely make it up to 8km.
