Worked fine in the most previous version I was using (6.4). This occurs with no other mods (beyond a handful of my flags), and I have plenty of memory left (the system has 16GBs, so Unity /should/ able to use whatever its addressing space allows). This was also a problem when I attempted to use Papics\u0027 8k clouds prior to your inclusion of that texture into the mod. I had written that off as possibly a download error on the part of the texture, but I suppose not. If I copy over the smaller kerbin1 cloud from 6.4 the issue goes away (but has the obvious texture repetition).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Incidentally, resizing the new kerbin1 texture to 4k also makes it \u0022small enough\u0022 to work. 8.7MB vs 30MB....
