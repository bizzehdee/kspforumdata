However afterwards the predicted time and DV for maneuvers is wrong. I discovered the error when my ships built with Tantares mod parts kept running out of fuel early. A 900 m/s burn actually used ~1300 m/s of DV. I tried to replicate the issue with a stock ship. I was not able to produce such a huge difference in DV but the predicted time for one of the burns was 1:02.4 but the burn took over 3 minutes to complete instead. Other burns didn\u0027t match DV or times either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know if it matters since I don\u0027t know how KER logic works, but one ship was not crewed and they had dissimilar engines with large differences in thrust. The stock ships both had a VAC ISP of 350, the Tantares probably had different ISP\u0027s. I have noticed this on more than one Tantares ship and my stock ship docked to two different drones with the same results so it doesn\u0027t seem to matter all that much what how the ship is made. (Hence I didn\u0027t bother with screen\u0027s but I can get them if you want.)

When I select the base using Engineer, occasionally the game will lock up tight but not CTD and I have to force it to close. I\u0027ve replicated this twice now but two other tries failed to replicate the error but I did get a secondary effect on those two tries - my FPS would plummet and nose dive until near nothingness from my average of around 55-60 FPS to around 4-6 but the game would continue running. My landing was actually successful on those two tries mainly because once I finished my deorbit burn and ended over the target I would deselect it and my FPS would instantly jump back to 55-60.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike I said, this is a really weird issue I\u0027ve never encountered before and have difficulty replicating but since I saw the NRE in the output_log I figured it wise to bring up in case there is something hiding in there you need to be aware of. If you need more info, please ask and I\u0027ll provide anything I can. I will be saving a copy of the output_log with the error within it in case it proves to be needed.
