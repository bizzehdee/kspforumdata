Even the tiniest of forces can move the largest of objects if there is no other force providing resistance or friction, so it makes sense (ex.

The most obvious is the partcount. The more parts the slower KSP gets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother reason is accuracy. There is no way to place a part exactly at the desired place which will cause stabilityproblems. In real life this is done by including special fittings or connectionpoints to the structure.
