It ignores them when loading textures. Implementing a DDS loader isn\u0027t feasible, since Unity needs uncompressed image data to construct a texture, which eliminates the main advantage of DDS. A solution to your problem could be disabling texture compression (currently TR only disables compression if TextureCompressor is detected) and supplying your files as TGAs, because PNGs and JPEGs are automatically compressed to DXT5 by KSP.

Is there any inherent issue that prevents replacing only normal maps? I\u0027d like to clean up Bop and Gilly\u0027s terrain but I am fine with their stock diffuse textures.\u003Cp\u003EPresuming there is nothing preventing this, would it be possible to add support for this in a future update? Either way, I appreciate your excellent work on this mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEdit:\u003C/strong\u003E After replacing the normal maps while keeping the stock diffuse textures, the macro blocking of those textures became readily obvious, so I\u0027ll be making some higher res diffuse textures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo it\u0027s a non-issue now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll remove this limitation in the next version. It\u0027s just a (insignificant) performance optimisation from early versions when texture replacement pass was run every frame. Now, replacement is done only on a few occasion and code is much longer then, so that \u0022optimisation\u0022 has even less much sense now.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shaw","CreatedById":64788,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-04T20:41:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022tygoo7\u0022 data-cite=\u0022tygoo7\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHow do we assign the heads?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt says in description.
