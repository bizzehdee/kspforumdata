It points to RO but it doesn\u0027t say what to get there. Later on on page 126 the OP said the heatshields cfgs. However, on page 125 Starwaster releases a code which he calls a \u0022blanket solution\u0022. I do believe this solution to be better. I may be wrong here, i\u0027ve never coded anything for games or anything on unity for that matter so take this with the proverbial grain of salt. From what i\u0027ve seen the code Starwasher published seems to address all parts with ModuleHeatShield, which includes both shields and B9 parts (and stock obviously).
