A person puts his finger on the chart at his starting point, moves his finger along it to his destination, and adds up the numbers along the way. All well and good--that works and matches observations. OK, now he wants to go back so he repeats the process in reverse. He has his finger were he is now and moves it back to Kerbin, adding up the numbers as he goes.

Hmmm, this isn\u0027t on the chart. But we\u0027ve heard of this thing called conservation of energy so we\u0027ll assume 430m/s to get the same...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETOTAl: 1080m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, we all know this isn\u0027t correct. The downhill transfer (step 3) doesn\u0027t take 650m/s. But that\u0027s what you get from the chart if you read it backwards. That\u0027s what I mean about the chart not reading the same in both directions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou say above that the downhill transfer actually takes the 430 and then the 650 circularizes, so you end up with the same total. I agree that sounds like how it should work, what with conservation of energy and all that. But it doesn\u0027t actually work that way in practice. Step 3 will only cost about 200m/s. Now, if conservation actually worked in KSP, you\u0027d need 1080 = 200 = 880m/s to circularize back in LKO without the atmosphere helping. But it actually only takes in the neighborhood of 500. Don\u0027t ask me why, but that\u0027s that sort of thing I see, and this applies to any downhill transfer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, we all know that KSP violates all the conservation laws it can all the time. When you EVA a Kerbal, you create mass. The EVA Kerbal has mass yet the mass of the capsule doesn\u0027t change. Likewise, when the Kerbal goes back inside, you have destroyed mass. And if this is all done with the ship moving, you violate conservation of momentum. You can change the orbital velocity of a spinning ship simply by pumping fuel from 1 end to the other, thereby creating kinetic energy from nothing. Ships on rails don\u0027t use electricity so there you\u0027re violating conservation of charge. And when spinning ships shed pieces, the central part doesn\u0027t spin any faster, so it violaties conservation of angular momentum. I\u0027m sure there are other examples of broken conservations in KSP.

By my math, 370 m/s is the dV needed to reach escape velocity for Duna (1272 for escape and 902 for orbit, both at 52 km as posted on the map), however, you\u0027ve listed that value as \u0022escape \u002B transfer\u0022. They can\u0027t both be right. I think if you burn 370 m/s of dV from a circular 52km orbit around Duna, you will \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E be in a transfer orbit (even if you do it at the right time).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the 110 m/s value represents the sum of the dV cost to start or end the transfer from escape velocity around Kerbin \u003Cstrong\u003Eand\u003C/strong\u003E the dV cost to start or end the transfer from escape velocity around Duna.
