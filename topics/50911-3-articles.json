The bug is not the URM tanks (or not only the URM tanks). The bug is that the entire ship is shifted by 0.141m when you go to the launch pad (look in the debug log for the \u0022Ground Contact!\u0022 message). In 0.21, the error was 0.006m. There is a large adjustment being applied to a ship when you go to the launch pad, while physics is \u0022on\u0022. I was hoping that this plug-in would affect the launch clamps enough that I could undo the hack to the launch clamp breaking force, but it isn\u0027t enough to fix that problem.

Isn\u0027t it \u0027fixed?\u0027\u0022 Well, it\u0027s \u0022fixed\u0022 for a given timestep (how much the physics simulation calculates forward every update) and for a given mass ratio (which is always kind of a problem). Smaller timesteps make the simulation more accurate, but more expensive to run; halving the timestep will double the processor power to simulate a set amount of time. This means that you\u0027ll get physics slowdowns for much smaller rockets with a smaller timestep, so it\u0027s quite obvious why the KSP devs have opted to go for a larger timestep for the simulation, at least for now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the theory behind the stiffening, at least between attached parts:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe stiffness of the joint is based solely on the part size; this is used to calculate the estimated connection area and area moment of inertia, which are used to calculate linear and torsional spring constants to model the distributed strain (percent change in material size at any point) of the part. In general, stack attaches are assumed to be connected through a cylinder of diameter equal to the part diameter; surface attaches are assumed to be connected along the length of the part, with the \u0022area\u0022 being calculated assuming that the part is a cylinder and that the surface attach is along a 15 degree arc section of that cylinder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe actual stiffness values are much lower than they would be in real life; this is because with the real life stiffness of aluminum in the calculations all part connections were incredibly twitchy. As a result, all rockets still flex far more than in real life, but certainly within manageable limits now. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo as for the computational overhead for most of this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThere\u0027s a very slight (completely unnoticeable) overhead from running the global joint update function.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThere\u0027s some overhead when a new vessel initially loads on the pad / from the list of vessels in flight as the joint properties are calculated.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe decoupler and launch clamp functions themselves add very slight overhead due to the extra PartModules on them, but this is somewhat difficult to notice.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe joints added by the decoupler and launch clamp functions do incur some overhead, since physics calculations need to be run on them, but since there are fewer parts to simulate, it seems to be faster than adding struts. If you can\u0027t tell the extra overhead from using autostrut = yes on procedural fairings, then you can\u0027t notice this.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe stiffening of joints does nothing to make physics calculations worse, since it replaces the old joints completely with different parameters. Same calculations have to be done anyway.\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, you can\u0027t just strap boosters on like mad and expect it to work.
