I know for a fact that many other players experience the same thing. Personally I don\u0027t mind this much as I know that once I hit the end of the runway and can tilt the nose up, the plane will take off no problem. But there\u0027s something about that that just doesn\u0027t feel right, you know?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I figured \u0022hey, RATO is a thing. Why not put some decouplers under the wings, strap on two small SRB\u0027s and gain some additional speed that way?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETurns out, it works. It really does. The plane suddenly took off at half the runway and the SRB\u0027s can even boost you a few hundred if not thousand or more meters up. If you put a parachute on the SRB\u0027s they even make it down to the ground unscathed. My goal with space planes was always to have a fully re-usable spaceship that would be cheap to lift fuel, kerbals or payload into space once the economy system is realeased. Everything that goes up comes down intact (minus the fuel) right? Well that actually still holds true if you use RATO and strap a parachute on each SRB. And with that extra boost for take-off, you can suddenly build bigger and heavier planes that normally would never get off the runway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd really, it just looks. so. freaking. cool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah. Space planes with solid rocket boosters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECome to think of it, why stop there? I could try my hand at multi-stage spaceplanes that have all parts come down intact.

The stock KSP aerodynamic model is much like flying a submersible through split pea soup. While FAR fixes this it makes it so that air reacts like air on an aircraft, thus making planes, space planes and anything that flies through the atmosphere act like it should in real life. So pancake rockets don\u0027t work well in FAR, if at all.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
