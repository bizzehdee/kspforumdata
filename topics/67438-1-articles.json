It was about 1/2 there. Last night I resumed that game. I went to tracking, selected the flight and clicked on fly. When the ship loaded all of the part disconnected from each other and flew in a star burst pattern away from the capsule no explosion or anything. F3 showed nothing. This left the capsule traveling on the same course completely unaffected other than every single part separated from it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo is this a Kraken or is it some other bug?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESide note: I restored a back up and the only way I could get to the flight without the parts flying everywhere, was to select something else like debris,,fly that then from map mode select the flight and switch to it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nemrav","CreatedById":91029,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-01T17:36:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyes you met a very minor form of kraken, you got off lucky....\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KvickFlygarn87","CreatedById":76314,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-01T17:56:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0027s with the lac* of *-s?
