But than I took two to the muns and hey that ion engine has lots of fuel left. (First time I ever used it)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I thought lets get those probes everywhere, start with the big glowing thing in the middle...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyeah... what to say... First I haven\u0027t enough power for the ion engine but that seems to be a minor problem. Fuel on the other hand... I managed to get periapsis below 1 million km, but shortly after that I ran out of fuel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo befor I just strap two satellites from the carrier together (for double fuel) and try it again, I wanted to ask.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Is there a way to get a satellite on it\u0027s own to every celestial body? (From LKO, of course)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETarget orbit is 500km for all planets/moons and below 1million for the sun. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDelta V looked immense for the sun alone. I read about bi elliptic transfers so launching to sun from jool would be easier but you still have to brake to circularize orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Strainborm","CreatedById":116277,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-30T09:28:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI guess there\u0027s really only 2 ways you can do that. 1. lots n lots of fuel. 2. incorporate some clever gravity assists from planet fly-by\u0027s to get to other planets. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2nd way is pretty tough, although very possible. I remember Scott Manley\u0027s video where he took the stock Kerbal X to almost every planet in one go, but it took a reeeeeaaally long game time, so its not ideal if you have other missions going on at the same time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1st way is something i would do, pretty lazy, but hey, it works \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-30T09:39:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022627\u0022 data-cite=\u0022627\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo I thought lets get those probes everywhere, start with the big glowing thing in the middle...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESurprisingly that big glowing thing in the middle is the hardest one to get to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally I\u0027d suggest:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- go as light as possible except ion engine and xenon:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-- replace all massy parts with massless where possible (solar panels, battery)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-- remove any unneeded payload (docking port)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-- use lightest available probe core (OKTO2 if you have it already)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen it should be no significant problem to get the probe to each planet and moon. If you make it light enough it should not be a problem to get it even on low periapsis Sun orbit right from LKO.

They will be larger overall, but more capable. Basically, build the first probe stage to establish encounter, the second stage to establish orbit, and the third stage with ion propulsion for simple orbit adjustments when desired.
