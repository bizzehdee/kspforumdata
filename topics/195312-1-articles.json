It\u0027s aggravating as hell.\u00A0 To be truthful, if it wasn\u0027t for MechJeb I wouldn\u0027t be able to play the game.\u00A0 Sometimes I go days or a week or more between sessions, and I\u0027ve given up on being a top notch Kerbonaut in exchange for a guy who pretty much knows the deal but is willing to turn some functions over to the autopilot until I get better (which I really am, honest.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the other day, it started to come together.\u00A0 I started building a space station, leaning heavily on the suggestions of those in the forums on what to do and how to do it.\u00A0 But then I hit a snag.\u00A0 I put a Clamp-o-Tron Docking Port Senior on the station module I want to connect to, plus the module I\u0027m trying to connect into place.\u00A0 I tried bumping uglies for an hour, reloading and trying again\u00A0but the stupid things won\u0027t latch together.\u00A0 I tried docking the Senior on my inbound module with the Junior on the station (green bracket in picture).\u00A0 Also no dice.\u00A0 Then I turned it over to MechJeb, and instead of docking it tried to ram through the station and get to the docking ring from the back side (which is already connected).\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m at a complete loss.\u00A0 I don\u0027t know why it\u0027s not working, and nothing in-game will help explain why.\u00A0 Can I not join two docking ports?\u00A0 Are they directional so that I should have flipped the one on the station around?\u00A0 If that\u0027s the case, can I do that maybe via\u00A0an EVA somehow, or is my station plan completely down the crapper?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShort version: can somebody help me?\u00A0 And feel free to explain how this stuff actually works, because this forum is the only reason I\u0027ve been able to play this game; the tutorials and little documentation from the developers are\u00A0no help.\u00A0 Advice and tutorials from you folks are what helped me stick with it.\u00A0 I\u0027m such a glutton that I\u0027ll torture myself with days of failed missions in exchange for that one or two that goes off just the way I planned.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for any advice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022screenshot-9.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://rekroom.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/screenshot-9.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geonovast","CreatedById":179753,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-04T04:45:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027re trying to dock a normal docking port with a Senior.\u00A0 You can\u0027t join ports of different sizes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd the other senior port in the picture, the one you have the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Part Action Window\u0022\u003EPAW\u003C/abbr\u003E up for, is reversed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-04T06:48:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223814589\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022195312\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221593837948\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022179753\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Geonovast\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, Geonovast said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd the other senior port in the picture, the one you have the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Part Action Window\u0022\u003EPAW\u003C/abbr\u003E up for, is reversed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022c59QvPn.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002278.33\u0022 height=\u0022235\u0022 width=\u0022300\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/c59QvPn.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhich means...\u00A0 short of installing the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E mod and having a kerbal remove it and re-attach it correctly while on EVA, That docking port is now just a wall.\u00A0 But don\u0027t worry, this is one of the many right\u0027s of passage that KSP has.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-04T08:20:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI second the above- you can only dock two ports of the same size together, and that large port on the station is backwards.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou might be able to fix that by bodging a save file- do a quicksave, copy then open the file in a text editor and find the station then find that specific port, then change one of the rotation values by 180 degrees and load the edited save in the game (hint- don\u0027t close KSP while doing this!) and see if it\u0027s pointing the right way and nothing explodes.
