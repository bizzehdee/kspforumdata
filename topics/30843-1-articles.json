The Kethane mod provides a way to mine and produce fuel and supplies in-situ, and it will be leveraged as much as possible. No fuel mass should be launched from Kerbin unless absolutely necessary! There\u0027s also a strong focus on modularity and re-use to minimize launches. Only 2 big IPTs are launched that can carry up to 5 payloads, instead of a little one for each payload. Only one Kethane tanker is launched, and hangs out on Minmus for the duration. Minimizing infrastructure launches means more tonnage for payloads!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe secondary goal is to maximize early mission score by maximizing launch mass to the first Duna transfer window on day 55. The challenge grants one free lifter on day 10, and the next can follow x*(launch mass) days later, where x=2 for normal lifters or 1.5 for lifters that are at least 50% re-usable. So, a launch interval of 45d and a re-usable lifter gives a payload mass of 30t. See the lifter post for more details.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only other goal is to maximize score and efficiency by putting the most Kerbals on Duna, and keeping them there as long as possible without incurring the no-return penalty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was hoping to go for at least Mission Execution 500, but planning and building has taken me so much time I don\u0027t think I\u0027ll get to it. 0.21 is calling and will destroy all my in-game work!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECrew and Base mobility?

Put wheels on ALL THE THINGS!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENods are made to crew safety where possible, like leaving some lifeboats in Duna orbit and making sure every mission has an ascent vehicle to use them. Particularly, the crew\u0027s safety is robust to the failure of any single piece of equipment after the arrival of the first IPHAB lifeboat in transfer window 2. But to make the first transfer crew-safety focused as well would have cut way down on the score. After all, challenges are about winning and Kerbals are all about taking unnecessary risks. Just look at how they build rockets. So KSC management decided to screw the crew safety achievement. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Mission Robustness was easy with a mission plan this modular, and with this many Kerbals hitting Duna in the Day 500 window. In the worst case, a rapid unplanned disassembly of the first IPT/KCV launch, the score would be seriously affected but the mission requirement could still be easily completed in the 2nd transfer window. As long as one IPT/KCT launch (rescheduled as necessary) plus one other launch succeeds within the first 8 launches, the mission is not in jeopardy. if 3/8 succeed, it\u0027s even robust to IPT/KCT failure after launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is the mission plan, see the posts below for module definitions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bSxR4k3.png\u0022 alt=\u0022bSxR4k3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHighlights:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E34 Kerbals on Duna\u0027s surface on day 500\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E92 Kerbals on Duna\u0027s surface on day 1000, with the first 8 having just left orbit.

It also serves as an ascent vehicle, capable of reaching LDO from Duna surface. Though not self-powered, it is mobile and can be dragged around by any powered module. As is the trend with Duna InSitu, the REAV launches empty and is designed for on-orbit fueling through the shroud\u0027s docking port. It must be refueled slightly before it can land safely on Duna - just a few seconds of thrust are required right before landing to finish what the parachutes start. Once on Duna, it can mine and convert Kethane to refuel itself for ascent, and can ascend/descend infinitely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHABitable EXploration vehicle\u003C/strong\u003E, which is a mobile long-term Duna habitat for 4 Kerbals. It can explore on its own for several days before running out of resources, but must dock frequently with a life support module to replenish its O2 supply. Alternatively, it can drag around the REAV on its exploration missions. The HABEX lands via parachutes, plus 8s of retro-rocket thrust to kill its final velocity and land safely - wheel repairs are occasionally required if Bill panics and fires the retros too early. This tiny fuel supply could be replenished by a REAV in case Jeb ever wants to take it off some sweet jumps, but the HABEX will never leave Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe payload shroud is a pure ripoff of sturmstiger\u0027s design, with a fairing for aerobraking and drogue chutes to get subsonic quickly. The modules are then dropped with some separation, and land individually. Some ideas are just too good to improve on! The shroud has plenty of RCS for orbital maneuverability and docking, with additional linear RCS ports on the outside of the shroud near the tip (not shown). This maneuverability will become important later.... Actually, the shroud has way too much RCS capacity - the size of the tank is necessary as a spacer for the parachutes and to accommodate the large docking port. For delta-V reasons, this tank will never be full. 100/750 is plenty to fulfill its mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ttaChL0.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ttaChL0.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWet Mass: 37.45t\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDry Mass: 29.15t\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaunch Mass: 29.15t\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, maybe some of you are looking at the pic above and thinking \u0022Hmmm... that looks a little anemic for a Duna launch vehicle. Is that just 2 LV-909s? Will that really make Duna orbit?\u0022 After reviewing my post I sure was. I recalled designing it to 1800 dV, but that was with a small RCS tank for supplies back before adding the big 3t IonCross support system. In the state shown above it\u0027s.... broken. Like, \u0026lt;1 TWR and under 1000 dV broken. So, one quick redesign later I give you the lighter, thrustier, more Delta-V endowed REAV 2:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/pIPB1BN.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022pIPB1BN.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith 3 Vestas and an extra 1m tank stuck in the middle, this will definitely get to Duna orbit with fuel to spare. This exercise also showed me that the IonCross parts aren\u0027t that well balanced relative to one another. This uses 4 of the small support modules which each provide for 2 kerbals, so the REAV can now support itself and the attached HABEX even if one of them fails. But each only weighs 0.25t, while the big one to support 10 kerbals weighs 3t. I should really redesign the O2MOD to use these instead, but... meh. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly downside is the longer REAV needs about 1m more on the fairing to avoid clipping the wheels, which forces it up a whole size, 50% longer.

I am 100% confident this will work as I proved it out for the IPT/KCT day 10 launch: a partially fueled IPT can take 41t all the way to Minmus with fuel to spare. The launch mass of the day 100 IPT/MIRV/IPHAB is 42t, and it drops off the IPHAB in LKO before heading to Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) They are RCS, I am using IonCross as a substitute for the supply rule so no supplies are used anywhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Good point, my plan was definitely to have the O2MOD operational for the transfers. There is spare mass for solar panels on the payload shrouds (after revising the REAV, the 2xHABEX is heaviest at 28.04t), which I really should have put on there anyway to keep the probe body powered. Can we just say I did that, or do you want to see pictures?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
