You are absolutely correct that T2 doesn\u0027t own the rights to NASA\u0027s logo just because it has been posted on these forums. Likewise, if I publish a mod that slaps a big \u0027ol NASA logo on all 4 sides of every stock park, T2 wouldn\u0027t have any right to distribute those texture files themselves, especially for financial gain, as there is no apparent fair use at play. (Technically I wouldn\u0027t even be able to publish such textures without NASA\u0027s permission, but let\u0027s assume I got permission somehow.) Just apply this same legal theory to your own copyright protected material, and the answer is clear. \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EBefore you even get to KSP and PartTools, you have created 3d models and textures which are your intellectual property. Using those models and textures in KSP does not make them any less yours, because you created them using tools not under the T2 EULA. If PartTools is under the same EULA, you can make the same statement - the models and textures that make up the file that PartTools output still belong to you. T2 cannot claim that output for distribution or financial gain because, outside of the formatting of the files, the product is identical to your existing copyrighted work (a textured 3d model of identical appearance). The US Copyright Office itself says that changes to format alone do not give rise to a new, copyright-able work (usually this would be for things like making a play into a movie, but here we are essentially moving from different types of 3d model files, so one could expect this protection to be even stronger). Because your use of PartTools does not give rise to a copyright interest, you retain the rights to the output of PartTools.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mako","CreatedById":69375,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-28T01:35:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m no lawyer, but I don\u0027t think they can just negate existing copyrights with a blanket, generic ToS or EULA.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo any orginal code and assets\u00A0would belong to the creator and whatever copyright it has at time publishing would stand.

Basically, you\u0027re using someone else\u0027s copyrighted material, and if you do so without permission then the owners of the copyright could take action against you. Typically it would be a Cease and Desist order, but if the owner believes you\u0027ve damaged their finances in some way they can attempt to recover those damages in court. Fan works will usually fall under a derivative work. The only exception to this is Fair Use, but that is limited in scope and doesn\u0027t seem to cover typical fan art or fanfic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically, any mod that is made that uses copyrighted material from souces other than Squad, Take-Two, and the mod author (like using copyrighted fonts) cannot just be taken and put into the game. The most they could do is a Cease and Desist.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the entire mod can be seen as fully derivative work written/made by one person and published on Squad/Take-Two owned servers then it\u0027s likely that Take-Two can do a lot more with it.

If you only post it off site they can probably just Cease and Desist you, or possibly try to use DMCA to issue a\u00A0 takedown. It cetainly seems that under this new EULA Take-Two could even just use fanfic that\u0027s been posted here without permission or accreditation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll of this being said, it is unlikely that Take-Two would do nefarious things unless they saw potential for more profit than problems. It may be hard for them to do anything nefarious, however, because Squad has shown a history of celebrating fan creations. This new EULA does change things though, and while it\u0027s likely to cover the upcoming missions built with the expansion pack, it really should be addressed by Take-Two before it goes into effect.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScaring away mod makers and the community at large is not in Take-Two\u0027s\u00A0 best interest, but maybe they just don\u0027t care.

My problem is that the EULA seems - as others have already stated - a blanket document, that T2 throws over all their software, without regard whether it really is fitty 100% or not. One indication is the mention of \u0022car designs\u0022 in the \u0022user created content\u0022 section.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegarding the issue of mods, I thought a bit about this. First of all, I believe that any mods created by the community are \u0022safe\u0022. First of all, because they are not hosted on any servers belonging to the \u0022\u003Cstrong\u003ECompany\u003C/strong\u003E\u0022. Secondly, because they are your IP. T2 cannot take away something they do not own. It would of course be something else entirely, if mods were uploaded to a T2 server... What\u0027s more, I cannot see, why any mod would give rise to these so-called \u0022\u003Cstrong\u003Ecopyright interests\u003C/strong\u003E\u0022 - especially since no mods I know do directly interfere with the software itself. I believe that this clause refers to the case that applies if I take \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ein-game artwork\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E that has been created by the \u0022\u003Cstrong\u003ECompany\u003C/strong\u003E\u0022, modify it and upload it as a mod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain, this interpretation comes from the \u0022car design\u0022 above - like in a racing game, where I can design various paint jobs for my racing cars. But in this case, users are creating their \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eown artwork\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E and at least my legal understanding states that noone can take your artwork away from you, whether it is a stand-alone piece or a modification to a game (expropriation).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow to the matter of screenshots. Here I do not see such a clear case. At the end of the day, IMHO it still boils down to what the \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cu\u003Euser\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E created, namely a piece of \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eown artwork\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E, that he himself arranged in a certain way - especially if it contains \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cu\u003Emod content\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E. Again, if a screenshot contained \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ein-game artwork\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E that has been created by the \u0022\u003Cstrong\u003ECompany\u003C/strong\u003E\u0022 and which has been modified by the user, then I could imagine, that this \u003Cem\u003Emight\u003C/em\u003E give rise to \u0022\u003Cstrong\u003Ecopyright interests\u003C/strong\u003E\u0022. Same applies to fan fiction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTLDR - IMHO, while being formulated in a very catch-all way, I \u003Cem\u003EBELIEVE\u003C/em\u003E that the \u0022USER CREATED CONTENT\u0022 clause does not really cover the case with mods, screenshots, fan fiction etc. with Kerbal Space Program. All of the above is after again reading the legalese from cover to cover and sleeping a night over it and writing down what I \u003Cstrong\u003Ebelieve\u003C/strong\u003E to be what is meant. It still would be nice if someone at Squad or T2 would get back to us.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-01T08:41:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223307411\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022171236\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221519892881\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022118557\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022StarStreak2109\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 minutes ago, StarStreak2109 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nscreenshots\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis has come up in court.

There is much history to suggest the work of the modders will continue to be encouraged. I may be totally wrong.
