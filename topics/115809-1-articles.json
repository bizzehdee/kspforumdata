Part-friendly docking hub... now for 1.04!","CreatedByName":"Rune","CreatedById":52690,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T18:54:57Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"Rune","CreatedById":52690,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T18:54:57Z","Content":"Yup, rings are cool. They *never* go out of style. Plus, all those fuselage segments make for a very big fuel reservoir, if you care to select them all. If not... you know, rings. Because we can and they look pretty.\n\n![uyZ2AVU.png](http://i.imgur.com/uyZ2AVU.png)\n\nJust like before, every care was taken to minimize part count while building something truly massive. At launch it goes over 200 parts on account of it being so darn *big*, even though it launches (mostly) empty. But once you finish insertion you are looking at a much more manageable 135, and that\u0027s with all the extras! Included in your file, you get to orbit the main 95 parts ring, plus a 16 part science module (every experiment there is, plus the lab to analyze them and probe controls), a 12 part observation pod/light tug (can dock anything with a port and provides an alternative control spot), and two 11 part drive pods (reposition those with the cuppola pod, they can draw fuel from any of their ports). Not included in the file you get, you can see a few greenhouses for the USI mod and a KIS container, but pay them no mind, consider them dead weight that you won\u0027t have to bring up.\n\nSo how do you launch this behemoth in a realistic atmosphere? Simple, with a lot of care, and some imaginative strutting:\n\n![xwClwCG.png](http://i.imgur.com/xwClwCG.png)\n\nNote that I\u0027m launching with a couple of non-stock additions as I said, so you will have more margin for insertion, so much so that you might be able to circularize on the upper stage (and in this case, it is a truly *upper* stage, as in, it\u0027s the thing most \u0022up\u0022 in the rocket xD). I wouldn\u0027t, and instead I would empty the leftovers into the station\u0027s tanks as you reach your ~100km apoapsis form an almost-orbital trajectory with a low point still in atmosphere. The nukes might be boring (leave yourself time!), but they are *very* efficient. This could self deploy to anywhere, after a few refueling flights. TWR will be awful when full, but you can copy the Drive Pods as a subassembly and lift up a few more to put around the ring when you refuel it, they will draw fuel just fine and look cool as boop. Remember to also remove the extra bracing with \u0022abort\u0022, like you see on the album, to avoid space littering.\n\n**IMGUR ALBUM:**\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

And I have contracts for Duna and a launch window for Jool on the horizon...\n\nAlso, I think I fixed the issue with the drive pods, you can recreate the fix or wait for the MPS with the new Klaw and Drive subassemblies in it. Basically, they have no probe core now to overheat, and rely 100% on service tugs to be repositioned. Plus, without RTGs they cost *less than half*. And the radiator panels actually help the looks, while only raising part count to 8! I also shaved the cost on the Klaw pods by going battery-powered (210 charge, with half of it reserved, can last you a lot of orbits), adding a single part in the process. The combo is just 20 parts, and a Klaw can service any number of Drives of course, so the more you use them, the better part efficiency you\u0027ll get.\n\n![ZQGcUNZ.png](http://i.imgur.com/ZQGcUNZ.png)\n\nRune.

Not picking fault or anything, but I bet it\u0027s impossible to land. The way I\u0027d go about it, is land it in two parts, dock it on the ground, re-fuel with chosen method, then take off again. If I were to do it (again NOT PICKING FAULT!!!), I\u0027d try to make it more compact. I bet the front wobbles like jelly on a Saturn V. That, or strut it up. But I guess you wouldn\u0027t be able to re-strut it again without certain mods. Still, I really like it! I wasn\u0027t expecting such a hard task to look so rational, even for someone as good as you.\n\u003E \n\u003E You are going to have trouble docking that in space though. It\u0027d be hard to incorporate an RCS system on something like that - like you said, diminishing returns. And allow me to quote you and say \u0022Kudos for trying!\u0022\n\nIt\u0027s a blueprint just to see how crazy the idea is, not even strutted or with electrical sytems. In no particular order, semi-planned engineering issues I may or may not have a way around:\n\nLand docking this. If I fiddle with the wheel height enough, I could work it out so it happens on even ground on its own. The pushing would be done with another Klaw-equipped vehicle, to keep all that equipment away from the ship to save weight.\n\nSpace docking this. Not required. After all, by allowing fuel to flow to the first stage, this is more than capable of SSTOing Kerbin for transport to Eve in one piece. And since the \u0022payload\u0022 is one lone kerbal, he can EVA when he is safely on the orbital target. If need be, Klaw Pods can handle it in vacuum, and keep the docking systems (port included) out of the ship to save weight.\n\nLanding this. Empty, it should glide like a feather, whether in one piece or two. Especially in Eve\u0027s soup. I predict *very* low landing speeds. So land a refuelling system and you are done. The new aero systems means you probably have the crossrange to glide back to the launch site the first stage.\n\nTaking off. A bit more dubious, since you can\u0027t see it but wheel clearance is ..... Plus the neck. I think this would need a suitably placed \u0022ramp\u0022 (mountain) to take off.\n\nRigidity of the joint. You have me there. As it is, that\u0027s going to be a wet spaghetti as you say. Empty it might fly since both parts have similar wing loadings and full control surfaces, but even then it\u0027s doubtful. So, two options: messing around with other docking ports, adding weight, complexity and drag. Or go with a light mod, and use KAS\u002BKIS to secure it firmly with reusable struts. You have to use the flight manager for reusable stages to use it anyway... I just had the most awesome idea to both minimize drag and increase the rigidity of the joint by a lot. I even used some crude off-my-head structural analysis that tells me it should resist bending well! Basically, if I put two tail booms (teh longer the better, and they can be made out of fuel tanks) in the orbiter, that join the booster considerably behind the main docking port at both sides... it should allow very little *bending*, since such a thing on any port would cause *displacement* on the others. Plus, I shadow the booster\u0027s second row of tanks for more streamlining. See:\n\n![opQvJvm.png](http://i.imgur.com/opQvJvm.png)\n\nSo all in all, this needs a crapton of support infrastructure, is very impractical (if you can\u0027t glide back the first stage, good luck trucking it for hundreds of kms in Eve), and to actually pull off, you need mods in the first place. But it really sounds like a nice challenge...\n\nRune. Almost RL difficulty, with the crappy engine isps!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-22T16:49:54Z\u0022 title=\u002207/22/2015 04:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Rune**\n  \nA pictue is worth a thousand words"},{"CreatedByName":"CrashTestDanny","CreatedById":151030,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-28T21:32:13Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Pretty! That Spatha is not taking off again without infini-fuel (and even then, it\u0027ll be a looong climb), but it\u0027s awesome to see this kind of stuff! I doubt I have any of these on Eve soon. So much to do on kerbin with E-class \u0027roids my new Sentinel is picking up! And I have contracts for Duna and a launch window for Jool on the horizon...\n\u003E Also, I think I fixed the issue with the drive pods, you can recreate the fix or wait for the MPS with the new Klaw and Drive subassemblies in it. Basically, they have no probe core now to overheat, and rely 100% on service tugs to be repositioned. Plus, without RTGs they cost *less than half*. And the radiator panels actually help the looks, while only raising part count to 8! I also shaved the cost on the Klaw pods by going battery-powered (210 charge, with half of it reserved, can last you a lot of orbits), adding a single part in the process. The combo is just 20 parts, and a Klaw can service any number of Drives of course, so the more you use them, the better part efficiency you\u0027ll get.\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://i.imgur.com/ZQGcUNZ.png](http://i.imgur.com/ZQGcUNZ.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E Rune.

They *never* go out of style. Plus, all those fuselage segments make for a very big fuel reservoir, if you care to select them all. If not... you know, rings. Because we can and they look pretty.\n\u003E [http://i.imgur.com/uyZ2AVU.png](http://i.imgur.com/uyZ2AVU.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E Just like before, every care was taken to minimize part count while building something truly massive. At launch it goes over 200 parts on account of it being so darn *big*, even though it launches (mostly) empty. But once you finish insertion you are looking at a much more manageable 135, and that\u0027s with all the extras! Included in your file, you get to orbit the main 95 parts ring, plus a 16 part science module (every experiment there is, plus the lab to analyze them and probe controls), a 12 part observation pod/light tug (can dock anything with a port and provides an alternative control spot), and two 11 part drive pods (reposition those with the cuppola pod, they can draw fuel from any of their ports). Not included in the file you get, you can see a few greenhouses for the USI mod and a KIS container, but pay them no mind, consider them dead weight that you won\u0027t have to bring up.\n\u003E \n\u003E So how do you launch this behemoth in a realistic atmosphere? Simple, with a lot of care, and some imaginative strutting:\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://i.imgur.com/xwClwCG.png](http://i.imgur.com/xwClwCG.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E Note that I\u0027m launching with a couple of non-stock additions as I said, so you will have more margin for insertion, so much so that you might be able to circularize on the upper stage (and in this case, it is a truly *upper* stage, as in, it\u0027s the thing most \u0022up\u0022 in the rocket xD). I wouldn\u0027t, and instead I would empty the leftovers into the station\u0027s tanks as you reach your ~100km apoapsis form an almost-orbital trajectory with a low point still in atmosphere. The nukes might be boring (leave yourself time!), but they are *very* efficient. This could self deploy to anywhere, after a few refueling flights. TWR will be awful when full, but you can copy the Drive Pods as a subassembly and lift up a few more to put around the ring when you refuel it, they will draw fuel just fine and look cool as boop. Remember to also remove the extra bracing with \u0022abort\u0022, like you see on the album, to avoid space littering.\n\u003E \n\u003E **IMGUR ALBUM:**\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://imgur.com/a/Lyhzk](http://imgur.com/a/Lyhzk)\n\u003E \n\u003E **DOWNLOAD:**\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://www./download/abjck73qcskq8bv/Von\u002BBraun\u002BStation\u002BMkIV\u002B%28Stock%29.craft](http://www./download/abjck73qcskq8bv/Von\u002BBraun\u002BStation\u002BMkIV\u002B%28Stock%29.craft)\n\u003E \n\u003E Rune.
