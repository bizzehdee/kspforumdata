And if you replace the nucleus of an embryo then you end up with an organism that is (nearly\\*) genetically identical to the organism the nucleus came from. As the organism grows, the nucleus reproduces itself but the rest of the cell is coded by the nucleus. So the new organism would almost entirely resemble the organism that donated the nucleus.\n\nThat is assuming that you remove the old nucleus, which I suspect you\u0027d have to do because I don\u0027t think an embryonic cell will tollerate having multiple nucleuses (or if it does it will probably divide into two cells, and then you\u0027ll have two disticnt lineages, one of which will outcompete the other).\n\nAlso this works best with closely related organisms, it definitely works within the same species (in fact in the UK we\u0027re now doing this to cure some genetic diseases). It can work with closely related species (like cows and guars, I seem to recall). Bamboo and Sequioa are not closely related, their last common ancestor may have lived 300 million years ago, so I wouldn\u0027t bet on nuclear transfer being viable.\n\n\\*I say nearly identical because the the mitrochondria and, in plants, chloroplasts have their own DNA and that would continue to be present in the new organism."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T13:17:11Z","Content":"Or just use CRISPR and splice them wherever you like."},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T20:22:40Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E i assume the experiment has been done on bacterial level already...? anyone knows anything about that?

My best guess (as a sort of biologist) is that your double nucleated cell won\u0027t be viable and won\u0027t develop into any sort of plant.
