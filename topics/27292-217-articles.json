Only the second probe didnt reach its target - Dres (bad launch window \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E). The DeepSpaceSat has however not been working out much. Some probes exploded after the launch vehicle was detached, others didnt had enough deltaV to get to theyre target (near Kerbol space). So I fitted one of these things with a big fuel tank and one nuclear engine, which did the trick.
