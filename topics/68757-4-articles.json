Clipping parts for an aesthetically pleasing craft does not make the craft any more aerodynamic or fly further than a non-clipped part, since the game calculates drag based on mass regardless of an item clipped into another. A 20 part non clipped plane will still impart the same amount of drag as a 20 part clipped plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.)

Sometimes I\u0027ll do stuff like what OP did; getting stuff close together for looks. Or engine clusters. I don\u0027t like to double stack tanks or engines, though. Feels cheaty to me. But that\u0027s okay- I just don\u0027t do it. I still like seeing what other people do with it. Lots of cool SSTOs wouldn\u0027t be possible without it!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-11T06:05:20Z\u0022 title=\u002204/11/2014 06:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 11, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by loppnessmonsta\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-11T06:24:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022katateochi\u0022 data-cite=\u0022katateochi\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou don\u0027t gain any advantage except for a nicer appearance, and you can run a greater risk of things exploding when you decoupling stages.

I clip when it\u0027s convenient, too. My recent Moho lander had an SAS module clipped into a Science Jr. and some small tanks clipped into short girders in order to shorten the whole craft, not only giving more engine clearance but also easing the length of the launch vehicle (the payload in total was ridiculously long).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
