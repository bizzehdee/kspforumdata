For example, if you had a short in a battery near the engines it should disable all the electrical parts of the ship, not only those that are connected to its node in the tree: so recursion wouldn\u0027t be my first choice, in this case.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then, engineering considerations: cascading failures in aircrafts (and therefore, I assume spacecrafts also) are extremely rare because their design is reduntant especially to eliminate the possibility of cascading failures.

If a part goes bad, it was destined to go bad due to some undetected imperfection. What ever part is selected to malfunction would have a randomly set timer, or maybe a use counter (i.e. open \u0026amp; close your landing legs 3 times all is fine, mission success, but the 4th time a leg gets stuck closed) that would set it off at sometime in the mission. The player would be alerted at the time of the malfunction by a text message on screen like the master warning light, saying what happened. On a manned mission you might be able to fix some malfunctions by EVA given time and an appropriate situation (if your parachute fails on reentry good luck fixing it on EVA at 10,000m over Kerbin), but a kerbonaut on EVA can only do so much. A shorted solar panel, sure, we can rewire that, but a bad rocket motor is probably beyond fixing. On unmanned probes, there isn\u0027t much you can do but try to compensate for what ever went wrong. I feel like this would be an awesome addition to KSP and could add some real nailbiters as well. Sometime it won\u0027t make too much difference, like a solar panel. But if a radially mounted engine burns fuel faster than it\u0027s opposite counter part and unbalances your lander, and you don\u0027t find out about it until you are committed to a landing, you\u0027ve got a heck of a landing ahead of you!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fraz86","CreatedById":90101,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-20T07:17:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ippo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Ippo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAbout that, what do you think?
