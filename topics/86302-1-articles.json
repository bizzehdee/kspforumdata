(1) A radial monopropellant tank with massive capacity, the \u0022ballast tank\u0022. (2) An RCS thruster with massive fuel usage. (3) An RCS thruster with massive negative fuel usage. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen you put the negative one on top, and the positive one on the bottom with the ballast tank. That way, when you turn on RCS and translate downwards, you sink. To surface, just translate upwards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can download the new updated mod, which works with 0.24.2, at kerbalstuff.com:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/246/Gabyalufix%27s%20quick%20and%20dirty%20submarines\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://kerbalstuff.com/mod/246/Gabyalufix%27s%20quick%20and%20dirty%20submarines\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s very basic, very quick and dirty.

AFAIK, all previous submarine mods have relied on massive changes to liquids on a par with FAR\u0027s changes to the air (InfiniTedice\u0027s Boat Parts mod) or changing every single part (and Kerbals, too) to sink unless attached to a \u0022balloon\u0022 (so-called ballast tank) that makes it float (Hooligan Labs). You, OTOH, have gotten by the hellish viscosity of Kerbin\u0027s so-called \u0022water\u0022 with the simple expedient of brute force while keeping all the game mechanics the same.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExaulted modder, I wish I could give you more than 1 rep for this.
