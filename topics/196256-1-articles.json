preference or filter to what kinds of mods qualify to be reviewed by him. I can\u0027t accurately describe it but the main thing is that it has to deliver some amount of tangible content that adds to the universe, like parts, planets and KK bases. That said, he does review plugin mods like autopilots and things that add to the HUD/UI. But there isn\u0027t much juice to be squeezed (or much interest to be had by him) in mods for tech trees and resource placement, moreover, if it\u0027s a mod that\u0027s pretty empty by itself and needs other mods to complete it, he\u0027s less likely to touch it. He seems lazy or resistant to install complementary or dependency mods (such as when he reviewed Universal Storage but most of its parts actually don\u0027t appear without a life support mod installed too).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe best way to get his attention is with plane parts or ringed planets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/59783-hemeac/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002259783\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/59783-hemeac/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@hemeac\u003C/a\u003E Kottabos has made clear that he\u0027ll never re-review a mod. He\u0027s fearful of the can of worms that this leads into-- that he\u0027ll get pestered to re-review mods every time they have a major update.
