I\u0027ve switched to the rest of the craft after the cockpit explodes and it rides out the rest of the re-entry no problemo. \u00A0 \u00A0Please get better QA.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-23T12:59:09Z\u0022 title=\u002204/23/2016 12:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 23, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Rizendell\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-22T15:54:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhich inline cockpit?
