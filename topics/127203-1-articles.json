From a physics perspective, this is mind-blowing. But from an engineering perspective, it\u0027s quite a simple machine. The ones that have been made are basically just a hollow\u00A0truncated cone made of a conductive material like copper or silver, with a hole in the side with a magnetron from a microwave oven. Turn on the magnetron and the Kraken pushes it a little harder on one end than the other, producing thrust. The thrust measured has been minuscule, but\u00A0there is a mention on \u003Ca href=\u0022http://emdrive.com/faq.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethe official website\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0(scroll to the very bottom) that if the cavity is superconducting, it would produce\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ea lot\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Eof thrust. So basically, in order to do this, you need the cavity in the right truncated cone shape, made of a superconductive material, cooled to superconducting temperatures\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ewhile it\u0027s being blasted with microwaves originally intended specifically for heating things up.\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0That takes a bit of effort.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy idea would be to have the cavity made of a high-temperature superconductor like yttrium beryllium copper oxide, with another cavity surrounding it which is filled with liquid nitrogen which is continuously pumped through and refrigerated, as what is in there will quickly heat up from the magnetron\u0027s heat. In order to do this, I would basically have to make the cavity myself. I would do so using \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.futurescience.com/scpart1.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis method\u003C/a\u003E, but I\u0027m not sure how i would manage to get a truncated cone out of that. Then I would have to make the outer shell out of something that retains heat and is airtight so that the nitrogen stays in and doesn\u0027t get heated up from outside. Then I would need a refrigeration system that would keep the nitrogen cold and thus keep the cavity cold. Also, I would need some liquid nitrogen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo all in all that\u0027s kind of a lot, but it would be doable if I had a few thousand dollars to spare. I don\u0027t expect to be doing it anytime soon, but I\u0027d just like to know how feasible it is. The non-superconducting version would be easy, just get some sheet metal and gut an old microwave. But the superconducting version would be much harder to do, but possible if I had the materials readily available, and it would produce really definite thrust that can actually be used for something if it works.

I\u0027d wager, it will transition to normal as soon as you turn on the magnetron, making the whole thing work even worse than a good conductor like copper.

However, if you want to go down to 2K or so, you\u0027ll have to also reduce pressure in the chamber to drop boiling point to 2K.

That should be fairly easy to do, all it takes is someone to put it on a cubesat or something.
