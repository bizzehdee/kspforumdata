Typically they use antiprotons to induce fission in a heavy element like Uranium which provides the power to kickstart a fusion reaction between Deuterium/Tritium or Deuterium/Helium-3, a bit like a thermonuclear bomb only on a far far smaller and more controlled scale. These are rocket designs that I\u0027m very interested in looking at in the future and I\u0027d like to create a smoother transition between the standard rockets found in the stock game/early Interstellar and the very high-tech end game period.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese rockets tend to be high specific impulse, moderate thrust and are very heavy - the DT vista is probably the best example of such a thing that appears already albeit it at the high powered end.

You could simply adjust your course while timewarping through interplanetary space and the anaemic thrust of the plasma engines in KSPI, at least when using nuclear reactors, would no longer really matter. Hell it would probably make solar powered plasma engines worthwhile.

The thing that comes to mind at first would be more, cheaper tech nodes and upgrades broken into separate parts instead of simple stat changes. Of course, that\u0027s got its issues, memory for one, and simply an increased part bloat in an already pretty bloated environment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe easier and more practical would be to add clearer descriptions of what nodes upgrade which parts in the actual game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know its being worked on, but the ISRU needs some love. Right now I feel like it\u0027s very hard to work into most of your typical rocket designs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dbmorpher","CreatedById":77927,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-09T03:52:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENew update is sounding awesome\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ekeep up the great work!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AerospaceME","CreatedById":92841,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-09T04:19:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think the pre-cooler stuff needs some work. It would be nice if they also worked by attaching to the thermal nozzle / turbo-jet / rapier engine instead of intakes. This would allow compatibility with radial intakes, give design flexibility, and still be realistic as the turbo machinery shouldn\u0027t care where the intake air is cooled, as long as its cooled before it enters. It would be consistent with the rest of KSP to assume all turbo machinery is contained in the engines / nozzles. The pre-coolers could have a rated amount of intake air they can handle to prevent blatant intake spamming a few nozzles. Make the rating tied both intake air and air speed, so cooling required = airspeed x intake air. Exceeding the cooling capacity provided by the pre-coolers on the vessel would cause nozzles to overheat and explode.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Uml\u00FCx","CreatedById":69703,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-09T11:00:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Uml\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCx\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Uml\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCx\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ei have a question about the new precoolers. is it possible to add this function to the B9 Sabre precoolers somehow? they look great but are only for show as i remember?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehelp please? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fractal_UK","CreatedById":61595,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-09T11:15:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Uml\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCx\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Uml\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCx\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ehelp please? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB9 precoolers already function as precoolers within this system.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Uml\u00FCx","CreatedById":69703,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-09T11:40:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eaaah ! thanks \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"urbansys","CreatedById":76665,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-09T13:47:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Edoes this mod work okay with MechJeb?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alcari","CreatedById":89807,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-09T14:00:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve got a very basic question... maybe it\u0027s because of some other mod i have installed... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebut how do I upgrade stuff?
