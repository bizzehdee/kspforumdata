It doesn\u0027t work while in the Space center / tracking station. That\u0027s been fixed in the dev version though and will be updated here soon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022zyranyth\u0022 data-cite=\u0022zyranyth\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHello! I have been dabbling in KSP for a few months now and decided to install the ScanSat and Karbonite mods, but while scanning maps using the ScanSat sensors seems to be working just fine, fitting the Comms DTS-M1 antenna to any ship makes the framerate on the launchpad drop to something like one frame every two seconds.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake sure you are using the latest version of Karbonite and that your ORS/Plugins folder has ORS v1.2 and nothing else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ThirdHorseman\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ThirdHorseman\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI did a search of the thread, and I didn\u0027t see an answer so I figured I\u0027d just ask.\u003Cp\u003EWhy does the Wiki show the ideal altitude for the RADAR Altimetry sensor as 5km, which is also its minimum altitude? Is that a typo?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReasons... Ideal altitude is anything above what\u0027s labeled \u0022ideal\u0022 up to the max altitude. Many of the scanners could probably use some rethinking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sigma88\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sigma88\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI wanted to use the radar to get a map of duna in its real colors, is there a way to do that?\u003Cp\u003Econgrats on the mod, it\u0027s awesome!\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, no, but it\u0027s a good idea and has been suggested before.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-28T14:19:55Z\u0022 title=\u002208/28/2014 02:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 28, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by DMagic\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
