Paused work momentarily on the Modification Catalog to throw this out to the collective wolves then run back to what I was doing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the reasons I started work on the Modification Catalog is because two guys (Won\u0027t name any names but you know who you are \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:mad:\u0022\u003E) said they had some ideas on how to at least identify when the first post of a mod (where major updates are most likely to be made) have been changed.
