Perhaps when you have a bit of spare time?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, I think I\u0027ve discovered the problem with a fairly high degree of certainty: garbage collection pauses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(nerdy bit) This has been a little fiddly to find, but some of the juddering effects seem to correlate fairly well with when System.GC.GetTotalMemory(false); reports a lower number than in the previous frame, which would seem to imply that a GC has occurred - GC.CollectionCount(0) seems to back this up. These GC pauses seem to happen every 3-4 seconds from what I can tell, even when Kerbcam isn\u0027t doing anything significant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELayman\u0027s explanation (in case people don\u0027t know about garbage collection): KSP is written to use a runtime that uses garbage-collection based memory management. This means that periodically the game\u0027s runtime scans to see if any previously allocated memory can be reclaimed for use. (hmm, not a terribly clear explanation I guess): more information here: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)\u003C/a\u003E - note the section on \u0022Disadvantages\u0022: \u0022The moment when the garbage is actually collected can be unpredictable, resulting in stalls scattered throughout a session\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s not a good simple way to deal with this. GC pauses can be reduced, but that requires some profiling of the program to see where memory is being needlessly allocated to excess, and fixing them. That probably requires a debug build that only Squad will have access to (and C#/.NET-related skills I don\u0027t have).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGC pauses can be made more frequent (i.e worse) if any (or many) of the following are true:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E There is less memory available to the program\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E The program is using more memory\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E The rate of garbage generation is higher\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe latter two could be negatively influencing things with having more mods available. Adding more memory isn\u0027t strictly a solution either - it might theoretically make GC pauses less frequent, but they might last longer (i.e more noticeable when they *do* happen).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMind you - I\u0027m not an expert on GCing in general, and my usual experience with GCs is on the Java runtime rather than .NET/Mono.
