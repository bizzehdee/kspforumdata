When I started KSP, I went on wikipedia (English, due to having the most articles), looked up delta-v, and started following whatever cross-references seemed relevant from there. I probably read 30-40 entire pages on rocketry and physics.\n\nWikipedia doesn\u0027t go into the depth that a real textbook does, but it does give a useful overview."},{"CreatedByName":"Rokmonkey","CreatedById":9319,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-24T16:07:11Z","Content":"So, using KER is going to help you a lot, good call on that one.\n\nResources to learn from:\n\nFor basic rocketry in a simple language, check out the KSP wiki, there are some good guides there on orbital mechanics as well.\n\nAs far as rocket building goes, I will research and study rockets that have been used in reality, so Wikipedia is an excellent resource, especially with their \u0022Launcher Families\u0022 lists. If you find one you like, learn about it on it\u0027s page, it\u0027s staging launch profile etc. Personally, I mimic realistic designs, so I use Ferram Aerospace, which eliminates the stock aerodynamics and replaces it with real aerodynamics. I\u0027m a mechanical engineer, so that sort of thing causes me to cringe, especially when I see pancake rockets working.\n\nI highly recommend you watch Scott Manley\u0027s videos. He has excellent tutorials that teach you basic mechanics. As well, if you watch either his Reusable Space Program or Interstellar quest, he frequently discusses actually rockets, orbital manuevers and all things space programs. It is highly educational. He uses mods, but the general practices and theory is the same regardless."},{"CreatedByName":"Moonfrog","CreatedById":76295,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-24T16:28:49Z","Content":"Have you tried looking at a delta V map of the kerbal star system?

I don\u0027t know them all off the top of my head, but they are easy to find.\n\nThese first three are relevant because Newton discovered they not only pertain to planets and moons, but all objects orbiting a central mass:\n\n1. Kepler\u0027s First Law of Planetary Motion - All planets move in an Elipse with the Sun at one of the Foci. One critical equation that comes out of this is the formula for the Semi-Major Axis: Sma=(Pe\u002BAp)/2\n\n2. Kepler\u0027s Second Law - Orbiting planets sweep out equal areas in equal time. A couple equations can be derived from this law that tell you exactly how much you need to change your velocity to change one elipse into another.\n\n3. Kepler\u0027s Third Law - The Square of the Period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis: R=P^2/Sma^3, where R is a constant. This one can be easily derived into a simple equation to determine optimal transfer angles for interplanetary travel.\n\n4. Thrust to Weight Ratio (TWR): Which is simply Rtw=T/W\n\nand\n\n5. Tsiolkovsky\u0027s Rocket Equation (this one I have MEMORIZED) which describes how much total change in velocity (referred to as Delta-V) a rocket has based on it\u0027s mass, fuel, and engine efficiency: Dv=Isp\\*G\\*Ln(M0/M1), where M0 is initial (full) mass, and M1 is final (empty) mass. Oh and G refers to the force of gravity at sea-level, which is ~9.8m/s^2.\n\nI\u0027m like you, I would rather run a quick equation through a calculator and come up with the answer than run an add-on. Especially when it\u0027s really not that hard. It is Rocket Science, but it\u0027s not difficult."},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-24T16:56:31Z","Content":"For rocket science itself, in an easy form, why not try [NASA\u0027s Beginner\u0027s Guide To Rockets](http://exploration.grc.nasa.gov/education/rocket/).\n\nFor a more wide-ranging, borders-of-possibility, look at space; [Preliminary Notes on Atomic Rockets](http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/prelimnotes.php)"},{"CreatedByName":"SalehRam","CreatedById":138066,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T07:22:37Z","Content":"Well,\n\nI know about TWR, and delta-v, and I try to maintain a minimum TWR of 2 on all stages if I want to go to Duna on a round trip... same as Mun... (Though Mun trips became like a walk in the park for me lately...)...\n\nThe thing is when it comes to interplanetary, as it takes more dV, and thus more fuel, leading to a larger rocket design... it is there where I start to fail and sometimes getting frustrated... I did manage to get an efficient design for Duna (after ages of trial and error attempts, while I think it could be easier somehow), but when I tried to do something for Eve, I ended up getting enough fuel for 1 way trip, so my probe got stuck on it without fuel to even try and experience the ascend from there and how it is hard...\n\nMaybe I am exaggerating a bit, but it could be all I need is trial and error, but for all the resources up, I\u0027ll make sure that I take a look on them and read them carefully... as Physics is something interesting to me anyways and I am looking forward to the incoming fixes to the aerodynamic system...\n\nAppreciate your input guys and I feel happy to be part of such community ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T07:59:31Z","Content":"The problem with reading *real* information on things is that KSP is decidedly not real. There are many mods available that make it behave more in line with real physical laws, but reading about real rocketry you will learn things that either do not apply (reentry corridors and the danger of reentry generally, boiloff, liquid hydrogen\u0027s low density, problems reigniting engines or throttling them), apply much more weakly to KSP due to how small things are (staging), or are wrong for how KSP simulates things (aerodynamics and what a gravity turn *actually* is, Thrust and Isp, etc).\n\nIf you want to be able to apply real life knowledge to KSP, you at least need FAR.\n\nJust as a side note, you don\u0027t need a TWR of 2 at all once you\u0027re in orbit; you can make do with as little as 0.2 or so. Even getting into orbit you don\u0027t need such a high TWR; at least with FAR you\u0027ll do better with a first stage of starting TWR of 1.2 to 1.5, and an upper stage starting TWR of no *more* than 1.2."},{"CreatedByName":"Freshmeat","CreatedById":111048,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T08:06:09Z","Content":"If you want to build the right rockets for the right situation, the most important thing is understanding the [delta V map](http://i.imgur.com/IV8rzue.png). It tells you the expected *minimum* cost for going to a planet. Build your rocket so the return is accounted for, taking not that you can do aerobraking from a very high orbit. Start with the top stage and build downwards, but the tricky thing is that you need exponentially more fuel for a linear increase in payload. As of writing, [Fly on budget](http://flyonbudget.onegiantleap.info/index.html#) is down, but I hope it gets back up. The author shows with how little you can get by, serving as an inspiration. You might want to review your TWR requirements, I think 2 is a tad on the high end, for takeoff from Kerbin a TWR 1.7 or so make for a speed around the terminal velocity, as presented in [this table](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Kerbin#Terminal_Velocity_Table). I think you already know that TWR changes with the relevant body, and you can adjust in KER.\n\nThe second part is getting there. I have only little actual experience in interplanetary travel i KSP, but [the launch window planner](http://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/) tells you when to launch and what way to point your rocket when you make the escape burn. It saw me to Moho on a one way trip, and it had a decent estimate of the actual fuel consumption. Similar information, with some handy diagrams, are presented at [Interactive illustrated interplanetary guide and calculator for KSP](http://ksp.olex.biz/).\n\nIf you want to go into orbital mechanics, the science that lies beneath the above pages, you can get a [decent introduction here](http://www.braeunig.us/space/). Personally, I found it better than my university textbook (Kleppner \u0026 Kolenkow), and being an engineer, it should not be hard to follow.\n\nHope this helps, and remember to seach the forum and ask around.

Eve isn\u0027t just hard, there-and-back missions to Eve are generally considered some of if not the most challenging missions in the game. It takes a lot of clever staging, a huge amount of delta-v, usually aerospikes and either precision landing on top of a mountain or driving up one with a huge, wheeled lander, or building and landing a very clever space plane. It\u0027s one of those things even veteran players take a great deal of time and planning to pull off. Only Tylo missions come close. Even though they\u0027re farther away Dres and Jool are much easier to deal with. Try a Laythe mission! Air breathing engines work there making for some really cool design options.
