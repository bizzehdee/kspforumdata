I haven\u0027t logged on here since I created a profile forever ago, so this is also my \u0022Hi\u0022 to the community. I\u0027ve been playing the full KSP since .20, but have played the .13 demo and .18 for quite awhile. I was really bored one day and had two thoughts come to mind: 1. KSP model rockets 2. 3d printed craft\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Modular model rockets based after parts in the game(boosters pods, etc) could be bought as a kit and assembled to make a working model rocket. A simple kit could include 2 fuel tanks, command pod, fins, parachutes and solid rocket boosters. Note that these parts would not just be shells like normal rockets and engines would have to be bought separately. Parts could be taken apart, mixed and matched to make bigger and better designs. The packs could follow the tech tree\u0027s rocket unlock packs and cost more as the kit included more advanced parts. The same idea could be applied to aircraft. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. My next idea is one I\u0027m really interested in. Do you have an amazing space station, rocket or space plane? All you would have to do is take the .craft and send it to KSP(all stock of course). After paying a cost determined by the size you wish the model to be, your product will be printed(maybe painted?) and sent to you to display as you wish. KSP already has 3d printed merchandise, so I cannot see this being too far of a stretch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure merchandise is the last thing on the minds of the devs right now while the game is still in development, so I cannot see any of these ideas implemented anytime soon, but thought I\u0027d get them out there. Any thoughts?
