First of all I love KSP and rocket games, I love to add mods into this game. But to get to the point im focusing on one mod pack and one mod. First the mod pack is Realism Overhaul (Awesome Mod Pack) the mod is Real Solar System (Outstanding mod). Now I have had an insanely sad bug where I got onto the launchpad but smoke is already coming out of the launch pad, the next bug is when I press space to ignite the first stage nothing happens (Booo). Im wondering if anyone has a solution to this bug but right now im just working on the stock solar system and using KW Rocketry and Procedural Parts to recreate soviet space crafts. Anyways I am hoping somebody knows to remedy to this bump in the night.
