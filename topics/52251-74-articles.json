With Snackpacks being 42 each it would require 50 octo-cores of Universal storage snack-packs to feed that many kerbals for that long of a mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe transfer window planner showed a Kerbal years as 422 days with the trip being almost 3 years each way and 1 year between arrival and the first transfer window.

Each launch bring a part of the ship (no refuel, not even on LKO)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe assembly\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E=========\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first ship in orbit was the mothership, designed for science (lab) and rest (hitchhiker), featuring a nice place to contemplate the cosmos (canopy). The first stage was also equipped with 3 poodle engines and a bit of fuel and chutes for the return trip to Kerbin. Second stage had 9 nuclear engines (3x3 radial clusters). The 3 kerbal passengers had an uneventful launch and orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second ship was a big robotic tanker. It docked behind the mothership quite easily using RCS and a fraction of its abundant monopropellant fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen came the Laythe plane. Unlike the two other ships, it launched itself from the runway -- and without launcher. Docking was performed without RCS, those being replaced by vernor engines under the plane belly, designed to produced some emergency lift (the lander is actually VTOL capable, even though I didn\u0027t used the feature because of oxidizer budget. It could however be useful in order to get away from some bad landing spot)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe typo lander was last. It was a multi staged lander but orbit capable without discarding any stage. First stage is built around a single nuclear engine, second stage features 3-fold symmetric fuel tank legs ending with aerospike and landing leg. The third stage hold only additional fuel tanks. Once again, it docked with using only the main engine, beside the space plane on the mothership rear. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEn route to Jool \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E==========\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven with 9 nuclear engines, Kerbin ejection burn required many orbits. The 4-sections ship was wobbly, but not uncontrollably so -- thanks to the design putting the engine on front, and balancing the landers. Kerbals aboard opened - and finished - the snacks once crossing Jool orbit, and had to make due without for the rest of the multi-year flight before actual Jool intercept\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 (Yeahh, I didn\u0027t use windows !)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe original plan was to aerobrake using Jool, and visit Laythe, Tylo and the other moons thereafter. Everything changed when the pilot managed a Laythe intercept. It turned into a cheap - although retrograde - Laythe orbit. The plane was dispatched for landing (and science !), and had some trouble finding some land. The landing itself was skillfully managed on an island steep slope. But one big problem became apparent after take-off : chasing for an island had taken the plane south, and it was not possible to make an equatorial orbit. The rendez-vous with the mothership was compromised !\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Laythe mistake\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E==============\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever our courageous Kerbin tried to match orbit to the last oxidizer drop and got an intercept -- but docking with the plane was not possible, and docking with mothership would have been cumbersome and costly (in fuel budget). So our proud Kerbal had to jump ships in EVA. The mothership discarded the empty fuel tank, and the Tylo lander undocked the tank and docked again in its place. This maneuver was possible because there was only one lander left : the fuel tank was used as a double symmetric (and balanced) docking port for landers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETylo\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E===\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETylo had been designed as the next stop. The mothership would sit in low orbit (55km) while various Kerbals would use the Tylo lander in turns to farm science in the system, beginning -- of course -- with Tylo. After refueling and separating the lander, it performed its landing uneventfully. The fuel tanks were dropped before landing, and the aerospike stage shortly after take-off. Even though the remaining lander was low on TWR, the initial push from the second stage was enough to make it to orbit and circulize. There was more than enough fuel to rendez-vous with the mothership, drop the science, refuel, change pilot and go for the another moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMoons\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E====\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe now light lander was successfully used for landing and bring science from the other moon, although there has been some short calls. Fuel was usually very low on lander when burning for intercept and docking on mothership back at Tylo orbit (less than a few units in some cases). However, fuel on the mothership was high enough to go for one last daring move\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack to Laythe\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E=========\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Laythe near total failure had lead to an EVA last minute ship jump. And the Kerbal had saved itself, but forgot to bring the science results\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 So one last mission was launched to recover the lost science. It was a bit tricky to get to the ship (in retrograde oblique orbit\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6) and back with enough fuel to dock, but the science was saved !\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack to earth\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E========\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETheir mission duly completed, our Kerbals headed back toward Kerbin. After the ejection burn, it was obvious that the fuel was still plentiful, and Kerbin intercept was achieved without using the first stage fuel and engines\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 The nuclear engine stage was dropped only for not adding strain to the chutes, and the landing was uneventful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, I\u0027m sorry but that\u0027s absolutely not enough for accepting.

I didn\u0027t expect it to hold together for take-off, but it reached a stable 80x80 LKO orbit with 800\u002B m/s delta V remaining.

Re-entry skimmed the upper atmosphere for 3 full orbits before the final decent making it hard to guess where the plane will land. On Laythe I expect that could cost me the mission.
