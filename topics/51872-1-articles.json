It was also going to end up as his last. Ordos taxied the SparrowHawk onto the runway and prepared for take-off. He noticed a speck in the distance, but Ordos assumed it wasn\u0027t a problem proceeded down the runway at take-off speed, the engine screaming behind him. While he was distracted by the speck in the distance, he forgot a vital thing; permission to take-off. As he went down the runway at an incredible speed, he noticed what the speck was. The previous test-flight of the SparrowHawk, stationary on the runway. Ordos had no time to apply the brakes and instead tried to pull up and fly over the stationary SparrowHawk. The last thing Ordos ever heard was mission control telling him that he didn\u0027t have permission to take-off, and mere seconds later, the planes collided. Both exploded as they collided, sending parts flying away into the grass nearby and around the control centre. If Ordos had asked for permission for take-off, the tragedy would never have happened.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBased in a true KSP experience\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"VelocityPolaris","CreatedById":101162,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-26T17:20:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVery good!
