I put a fairing on it, that would shield away the experiments during aerobreaking. But I\u0027ve now run into an issue where, when I try to deploy the fairing, half of it gets stuck onto the rest of the spacecraft. The craft then proceeds to shake violently. If I try to EVA the game crashes, and I can\u0027t timewarp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing I tried was to send out the probe that I brought with me, fly it far away, and then jump back the the mother-craft with map-mode. But that just put it in a weird \u0022I am in space, but my status says that I am landed?!?\u0022 state, where I can\u0027t do anything. Accelerate. Timewarp. And my speed is \u00220\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt might be a bug/issue with the \u0022Close fairing\u0022 around another object.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I was wondering if anyone had an idea to how I can fix this?

When you\u0027re in the VAB/SPH right click on the fairing base and you will be presented with 2 options. One of these is \u0022Ejection force\u0022 which is at default a measly 30. I bump this right up to 100 and haven\u0027t had this problem since, except when I forget to do it. The other option you can change there is how many pieces each subsection of the fairing is made up of, I would assume increasing this would also lower the chances of the fairings bugging crafting out but I imagine it\u0027s probably just more of a cosmetic feature.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T17:19:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Rizzee\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Rizzee\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe solution I\u0027ve been using is quite simple.
