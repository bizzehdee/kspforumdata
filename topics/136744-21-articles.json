Andy Weir did that purely for literary reasons -- he wanted the initial disaster to be caused by a force of Martian nature, and the only thing he could come up with was a storm. The idea behind the book is a survival story of man versus the elements, so it wouldn\u0027t have worked right if it had been a human-caused accident that started everything. He knew full well that the dynamic pressure from a Martian storm would not be enough to cause that damage, but he ignored that for thematic purposes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Just Jim","CreatedById":148725,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-07T01:34:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWait... wrong subject... sorry... \u0026lt;redacted\u0026gt;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-12-07T01:36:58Z\u0022 title=\u002212/07/2016 01:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 7, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Just Jim\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"adsii1970","CreatedById":89014,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-07T02:14:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027re right, \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/148725-just-jim/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022148725\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/148725-just-jim/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Just Jim\u003C/a\u003E, this isn\u0027t pet peeves about chick flix thread... \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"p1t1o","CreatedById":74091,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-07T09:48:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/137807-mikegarrison/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022137807\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/137807-mikegarrison/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@mikegarrison\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/133850-wumpus/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022133850\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/133850-wumpus/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@wumpus\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re in the mood for an \u0022everybody dies\u0022 read, \u0022Level 7\u0022 is apparently required reading for all US missile silo troops.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hary R","CreatedById":111339,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-07T12:54:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have this one\u00A0pet peeve from many\u00A0space related story\u00A0for a while:\u00A0planets are never recognized\u00A0as a planet size object.
