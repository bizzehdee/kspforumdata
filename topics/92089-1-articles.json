Personally, I use Imgur, which is terrific for uploading images fast. Basically, once you\u0027ve uploaded your image, get the direct url to the image (the URL should end with \u0022.jpg,\u0022 \u0022.png,\u0022 etc.), and put \u0022\u003Cimg src=\u0022\u0022 alt=\u0022\u0026quot; in front of it and \u0026quot;\u0022\u003E\u0022 behind.

Go to the very top toolbar of the forums, and click on the tab that says \u0022Blogs,\u0022 next to the \u0022Articles\u0022 tab. The page it brings you to will have a button that says \u0022\u002B Create new post\u0022 above the toolbar on the right.
