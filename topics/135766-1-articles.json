Lands like a dream, however, when I was about to jettison all the unnecessary parts for re-ascension (everything is attached to radial decouplers), all that happened was that every single stage that was left on the craft got jumbled together in one stage, and not a single stage goes off. If a try to fire off this last mega stage (which would\u003Cbr\u003E\ninevitably\u00A0 end in catastrophe) nothing happens. If I try to redo the stages (a ridiculously painful task with 200 decouplers), everything goes back to its pointless mega stage, not doing anything at all. (Manual decoupling does not work either).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a side note, the resources tab tells me I have 55 as maximum electric charge, as opposed to over 3000 before take off. The batteries are still attached mind you and the decouplers on the batteries have not fired).\u00A0 The only mods I have installed is KER and Mechjeb.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nEDIT: I think I\u0027ve found the fault. Seems the landing was a tad too fast and snapped off the final stage with the command pod without actually causing any visible damage.
