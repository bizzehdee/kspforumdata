Their 8th or 9th great grand children would be the ones stepping foot on a new world. The Journey would take 100 or 200 years, the entire time, each generation would grow up learning how to do the job of their parent. Experimentation, cultivation, preservation. They would then pass this on to their off spring and so on. By the time the mission actually takes place, the colony won\u0027t be 100 strong, it would be more like 10,000 making it worth the journey.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as the large storage vessel. This is weird. We are in the midst of mapping out the human brain. One day we will be able to perfectly copy a humans entire brain, thoughts, memories... everything. We store said brain scans onto a large database on an essentially empty vessel, but it\u0027s not empty. The vessel contains cloning vats and the blueprints for each explorer scanned plus all equipment needed. Once the vessel is within 30 years of it\u0027s destination (really it\u0027s however long it takes to grow a clone) A clone is grown and the brain scan is imprinted. The new human is awoken with all knowledge of his/her mission, no o2 or food was wasted, no psychological problems due to emptiness of space. To them, they just got a brain scan, went to sleep and woke up near a new world (they knew it was going to happen) Time would no longer be an issue for these guys, just maintain a proper scan.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nyrath","CreatedById":61886,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-23T21:45:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe ultimate space ship would be a method of traveling through space from point A to point B in no time at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn other words it would be a StarGate.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"falofonos","CreatedById":57821,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-23T22:37:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESome sort of ring around a star with magnetic manipulation magic to drive the solar wind perpendicular to the ring.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPut walls along the inside edges of the ring, Cover the ring with mud, plants and stuff, top up with air.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFly wherever you want for a few billion years.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ShachonianX","CreatedById":62805,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-23T22:54:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was watching videos of FTL (that indie video game), and then came up with this.
