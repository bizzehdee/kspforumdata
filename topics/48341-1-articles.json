I dont know the part count of mine - but it must be around or over 800 or more, possibly over 1000 - as there are many small parts that are decorative, I can do without those in future builds. But Attaching them requires docking. If you can get the ports fairly close, Mechjeb will do the final docking for you, but you need to maneuver them fairly close.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E But docking is really not that hard once you try it for a bit. But I do sometimes use mechjeb to help out. You can use it to get very close, then do the final maneuvering, get it closer with the ports lined up - then mechjeb will do the final docking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E You can build them in dock-able stages, launching each part and assembling in space. I built this ship in 0.19, before they had optimized the game more, so by the time i was adding the last few sections it was terribly laggy. I am working on a new massive station to see the limits of the number of parts before it gets laggy again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E When you build really large ships, i recommend using the Tri-port adapters for the central connections, as it has 3 ports to attach and has a much stronger hold than just one one port. As you will see, I use that on all the areas that I add significant sized sections.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E here are a few screens of the one I built, The H.M.S. Wileen:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E This is the first base part of the ship. I decided to make the connections to the other main parts via tri-docking ports, which hold much more securely in a large ship. You can see 2 of them on the left/right sides. I did make a mistake by using the wrong kind of ports on 2 of the sides(front and back), I should have gone with tri-ports on all 4 of the sides. I will be doing that on my new station. I also added a tri-port on the top to connect with the upper section. I left the bottom with tanks and engines in case I needed to move it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img842/338/5g48.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00225g48.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E One thing I needed was to have the Tri-port docking parts on BOTH top and bottom of parts, so I had to devise a method of attaching them to the rest of the ship. This was the method I used, using 2 tri-ports facing each other and adding a separator ring on each:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img21/1711/3tricouplerconnection.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00223tricouplerconnection.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E This allowed me to undock the tri-ports from the engines, although it did leave a little debris in space!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere I am docking the Base section to the communications section using the Tri-port docks:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img35/9374/w9wc.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022w9wc.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA little tricky, but once docked, it was quite strong. Just make sure to line them up right!! Funny thing, This was only my 3rd or 4th docking attempt! So it really is not that hard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I built 2 of these antenna arrays, more for looks that function! Again - the tri-dock ports were used on both ends, one to attach, and one to add another section to later:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img51/7482/y6k0.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022y6k0.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd here is the final docking of the 4th section, again - lining up the tri-port docks carefully.

One thing to watch for is lag... I used mechjeb to assist adding the 6th section - and it didnt go to well, but the ship did not break apart, I believe that was because of all the tri-ports I used:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img20/233/10pt5collision.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002210pt5collision.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo always save before you begin approaches!!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Here is the final station \u003Cstrong\u003EH.M.S.

This is a pretty massive station, If it didnt lag out so bad i still could have enlarged it even more, by using the front and back docking ports, but I would have wanted to use the tri-ports there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img707/5942/11final.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002211final.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E i found the station to be very stable when rotating or even moving.
