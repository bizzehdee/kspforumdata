Between stock and mods there\u0027s more to do with the game now than I have hours in the day to do it, and yet all signs point to there being even more of this to come, and engine upgrades that will make modding even greater than it already is. What can I say, it feels good to like something enough to overlook a few things, especially knowing many of them will get fixed, for free, and I need only have patience (not hard with this much to do already!). \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"musicpenguin","CreatedById":57938,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-29T23:53:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E80% finished, Most of the game is done but lots of room for polish and improvement. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould like to see more time put into Career mode and some more parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-29T23:56:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d say 80%, but that\u0027s mainly because I think Career needs a complete overhaul.
