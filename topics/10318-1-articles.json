It can be done that way, but it is a lot easier to turn towards 90 degrees and park yourself in Kerbin orbit first, then shoot for the Mun when the time is right (if you burn prograde when you see the Mun rise over the horizon ahead of you, you\\\u0027re more or less guaranteed to intercept).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027d say that mission you have there in the first pic is pretty much lost - unless you have a lot of fuel to rotate the orbital plane (just for a start). Come home, have a biscuit, and try again...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the second picture, you will meet the Mun eventually if there is some difference in your orbit compared to the Mun\\\u0027s - if your Pe or Ap are more or less than 11,400,000m you\\\u0027ll get within it\\\u0027s gravity at some point. Might want to time warp, because it will take a while. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, pedantic note: you\\\u0027re not in Mun orbit - you\\\u0027re still orbiting Kerbin there, you just happen to have a similar orbit to the Mun. When you get near to the Mun, your orbit trace will change, and then you\\\u0027ll be in Munar orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck..\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tobu91","CreatedById":24654,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-08T12:21:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, I did fly up straight up from the moment I launched.
