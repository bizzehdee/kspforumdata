It can be done that way, but it is a lot easier to turn towards 90 degrees and park yourself in Kerbin orbit first, then shoot for the Mun when the time is right (if you burn prograde when you see the Mun rise over the horizon ahead of you, you\\\u0027re more or less guaranteed to intercept).\n\nI\\\u0027d say that mission you have there in the first pic is pretty much lost - unless you have a lot of fuel to rotate the orbital plane (just for a start). Come home, have a biscuit, and try again...\n\nIn the second picture, you will meet the Mun eventually if there is some difference in your orbit compared to the Mun\\\u0027s - if your Pe or Ap are more or less than 11,400,000m you\\\u0027ll get within it\\\u0027s gravity at some point. Might want to time warp, because it will take a while. \n\nAlso, pedantic note: you\\\u0027re not in Mun orbit - you\\\u0027re still orbiting Kerbin there, you just happen to have a similar orbit to the Mun. When you get near to the Mun, your orbit trace will change, and then you\\\u0027ll be in Munar orbit.\n\nGood luck.."},{"CreatedByName":"Tobu91","CreatedById":24654,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-08T12:21:38Z","Content":"Yes, I did fly up straight up from the moment I launched. I will try the other way next time.\n\nI have loads of fuel left, and as i\\\u0027ve never got the the mun, even orbiting it or crashing into it would be a success.\n\nMy Pe is 10,509,000 and Ap is 12,217,000. I am time warping at max speed but it doesn\\\u0027t really help as I dont get any closer to the moon. I guess our speeds are the same, or nearly the same.

A smaller orbit around the same object will have a shorter orbital period. So you\\\u0027ll catch-up with the Mun.\n\nMost people put themselves in a small orbit around kerbin then accelerate prograde when the the Mun rises. I normally follow your method, it doesn\\\u0027t matter if I time it badly. ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"BillWiskins","CreatedById":12285,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-08T13:42:07Z","Content":"I think the Mun\\\u0027s sphere of influence is around 2,400,000m."},{"CreatedByName":"Tobu91","CreatedById":24654,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-08T13:51:28Z","Content":"I did catch up with the mun, but I burned retrograde for far too long.
