I had XP installed on two separate drives and installed 7 by deleting Windows, Program Files, Documents and Settings etc from the second drive then booting the 7 install. After 7 was in I changed the boot order in BIOS and deleted the other XP install.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried many different things that were supposed to do mass permissions changes and ownership changes but all that would work were things that could only do one file at a time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERun PMT as an administrator, select the partition or folder path then hit the Default button and wait. When it\u0027s done you\u0027ll have ownership and full read/write/create/execute rights from the top level you\u0027ve selected on down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow do you know if you have permissions problems in your KSP folder tree? If you get access denied when trying to save changes to a cfg file but can save as a copy then delete the old file, rename the new file to the old name and from then on have no problems with the new/copy. If you right click and on the New option only have a choice of New Folder or nothing at all - you have screwed up permissions or are logged in with an account that has restricted rights.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S. Despite Avast leaping out of the shadows and declaring the main PMT exe file a \u0022threat\u0022 and tossing it into the chest, it is not. Avast just detects its ability to alter Registry and other settings. (Avast also periodically declares various audiovisual demo programs to be \u0022threats\u0022 and deletes them, despite how many times I report them as false positives.) If you temporarily disable your AV scanning, the permissions changing will go faster.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
