This means you can clip something all the way inside the fuselage, or have it stuck outside of the plane via offset gizmo, and it will still create a flat amount of drag period!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor prats to occlude (and actually lower another\u0027s drag), they need to be attached in line via the node at front or rear of the part you are interested to shield. This means that if you say attach a fuel tank behind a cockpit radially and then use gizmos to move it into the identical position it wouldve been had u just placed it behind the cockpit via node, itll have WAY more drag, and be affected by heat ALOT more. Basically only stuff in line shields stuff behind it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELonger fuel tanks have less drag then a stack of short ones in line (no bloody idea why, this is just what happens).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECargo bays completely disable drag/aero forces on anything in them when closed (if you are into clipping, you can shove it full of other fuel tanks and those fuel tank have 0 drag period). This is kinda exploity, but sofar ive found that shoving ion engine clusters, power units, and anything that isnt essential to the fuselage/flight in a cargo/utility bay lowers drag and well offsets the extra mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlacing some super low drag part in front of a massive plate will STILL occlue the plate (try a cubic strut in front of a 3.5m tank, the 3.5m tank WILL BE OCCLUDED!).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow i do not want to turn this into a discussion on whether this is good/bad, im just sharing my conclusions (as i have quite a few micro-SSTOs thatr abuse clipping, and i learned to stick all that junk thats clipped into cargo bays really quick). As much as i love the new aero, it does appear that without cargo bays you are going to be suffering MASSIVE drag penaltis on anything, be it internal or external to the ship, unless its either in line with something else, or inside a bay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIm now working on making a few nice images to show the details, and ill update this post when im done!

Not that its impossible to do (heck i have one myself), but it requires rather extensive abuse of the aero model to pull off, and abusing aero isnt quite what i call legit. Things like shoving fuel tanks and engines into cargo bays to bypass their drag, shoving clusters of ion engines into service bays (my laythe roundtrip SSTO abuses this).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe aero model is also rather weird, and does not behave as you would expect (for example parts that are radially attached are ALWAYS experiencing full drag based on orientation REGARDLESS or where they are located, be in inside the hull, or externally mounted. Based on what ive learned insanely quickly, service bays are your friend, cargo bays, ect. Even stuff like shoving fuel tank arrays inside them is a benefit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasicaly the one rule ive found (subject to change if the aero is improved) is that you NEED to place anything that isnt part of your physical hull, an engine you are using in atmosphere, or wings inside a cargo/service bay to disable all drag on that part. Those bays are basically ESSENTIAL to making stuff fly fast and not burn alot of fuel down low. Occlusion is not the super advanced thing we all expected, all it does is partially lower the drag on something attached behind a part via its node. Radial parts have no occlusion period, so unless theyre in a bay that flags them as having no drag, you will suffer MASSIVE drag penalties from even a couple radial parts. Not what id call logical, but at least they didnt stop clipped wings/control surfaces from working (my sci-fi appearance replicas live on!).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso one more conclusion ive come up with is that control surfaces are superior to wings when it comes to heat survivability. They are very hard to burn off for whatever reason (assuming ur using the smaller ones). Not saying you cant burn them, but ive started making planes with control surface wings, and they are capable of speeds well in excess of standard wings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMAJOR BUG FOUND!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOcclusion does not care whatsoever about the size of part its shielding, so if you place a cubic strut in front of a 3.5m tank, you get the drag associated with a cubic strut AND the tank gets FULLY OCCLUDED! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs much as i hate to see this, im so abusing teh crap out of it to make dragless planes that use basically 0 fuel to get out of the soup!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-29T15:02:22Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2015 03:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by panzer1b\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cinocal","CreatedById":54959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T15:11:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022panzer1b\u0022 data-cite=\u0022panzer1b\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOcclusion does not care whatsoever about the size of part its shielding, so if you place a cubic strut in front of a 3.5m tank, you get the drag associated with a cubic strut AND the tank gets FULLY OCCLUDED! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs much as i hate to see this, im so abusing teh crap out of it to make dragless planes that use basically 0 fuel to get out of the soup!\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is so broken.
