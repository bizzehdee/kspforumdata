I\u0027m pretty sure what you\u0027re referring to is cutting the time spent on physics calculations down so your CPU isnt working so hard and can concentrate on other stuff. if FPS is your problem though, this only helps if your CPU is the bottleneck.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-28T20:02:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe delta time slider in the settings screen can do this, by sliding it to the right to reduce the value, KSP will reduce the simulation speed instead of lagging if things become too much for the physics engine, but don\u0027t reduce it too far as if you do the physics will become less accurate \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Turbojohn","CreatedById":58369,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-28T20:43:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the help.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
