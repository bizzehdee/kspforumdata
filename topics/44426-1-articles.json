No lander did not work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem was that while I needed some trust high up deep in the atmosphere the trust above center of mass caused the lander to roll then I reached 16 km, the 75 kg seperatron was also an killer.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johnno","CreatedById":67618,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-31T05:27:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell known issue, you\u0027re going back into the central stack after going out from it, big no no.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MiniMatt","CreatedById":78749,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-31T06:13:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELooks like the same issue I encountered a few weeks ago.
