This was a significant challenge in terms of fuel capacity as I like to run stock and sans Mechjeb; so it\u0027s all hand crafted piloting with the \u0022add manoeuvre\u0022 flight planner.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope to post some pics when I\u0027m back on the gaming machine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo much fuel use to burn into orbit when I arrived out there, and over 3000 dV to get back into Kerbin orbit. I really must plan my intercepts better. The design uses my heavy lifter asparagus core which is only 4 x symmetry and discards all 4 in a layer at a time, so it\u0027s not super efficient, and has bulk SFB\u0027s to get it started, plus an interplanetary stage docked to a smaller lander. It was only when lifting off from Eeloo and trying to make rendezvous with the interplanetary stage to refuel that I discovered a design flaw, no SAS on that stage so sooo hard to get it stable enough to dock back onto. Judicious use of 5 x warp to stop it spinning was the solution and eventually we docked, with 0.5 units of mono propellant left in the probe controlled stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen fuel transfer to suck it nearly dry, discard most of fuel tanks (just keeping the central one with the last of its fuel, and home using the lander engines, throwing off the last tank half through the deceleration burn to intersect with Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis does take a refuelling in LKO of the remaining core of the asparagus lifter to give me enough fuel to get into solar orbit before pushing out to Eeloo, but it sure is a long mission.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
