I\u0027d not really tried using it to control a craft in space before thou, now I don\u0027t think I\u0027m going back to keyboarding! I think partly the new SAS makes a huge improvement when using a joystick and its so nice to have analog control and not use the keyboard (which as you say is not really standard issue in RL spacecraft). I had pitch, roll, yaw and translation up/down/left/right all on my left hand (I\u0027m right handed but this worked out ok) and my right could mouse to look around and I\u0027ve got translate forward/back on two side mouse buttons.
