If it does then it makes several distance calculations from the vessel to the anomaly. If you are flying or orbiting above it first checks to see that you are less than 100km above the anomaly, then it checks your horizontal distance to the anomaly. Basically it draws an upside down cone over the anomaly that has a radius of 150m at the ground and 15000m at 100km up. If you are within that cone it should work. For ground experiments it just checks to see if you are within 50m horizontally. Some of the anomalies are buried underground (even if they are visible, their actual center might be underground), but since I\u0027m only looking at horizontal distance that doesn\u0027t matter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it gets far enough to display this message that means that it is registering the experiment correctly and that at least some of the distance calculations are working correctly. I\u0027ll take a look at it and see if there is something wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Version 0.8.4.1 released: I updated the download links and uploaded to KerbalStuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere were two errors in the anomaly contracts, one is that the anomaly\u0027s position was defined upon loading, and wasn\u0027t updating appropriately. The other is that the altitude calculation was backwards giving negative values. I just switched it to the absolute value, so it doesn\u0027t matter if you are above or below the anomaly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe distance constraints are also fairly stringent, I might increase them a little to make the surface experiments a little easier. It can be difficult to tell the exact position of the anomaly and 50m isn\u0027t that far. The best option is to mount the anomaly scanner horizontally (so that it is parallel to the surface when landed) and watch the rotating camera closely. The will always point at the center of the anomaly, so by driving or flying around it you can figure out its exact location.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-15T01:16:35Z\u0022 title=\u002208/15/2014 01:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 15, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by DMagic\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Climberfx","CreatedById":57126,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-15T01:23:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis mod will turn my game even cooler!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you so much \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rkman","CreatedById":15721,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-15T16:00:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eoops, wrong thread\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-15T16:07:57Z\u0022 title=\u002208/15/2014 04:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 15, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by rkman\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Patrick Kerbivan","CreatedById":114804,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-19T00:10:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think I may have found a problem - or maybe somewhere additional info is just needed - with a magnetic survey contract.
