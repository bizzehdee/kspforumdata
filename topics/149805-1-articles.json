More space centres, missions to transport stuff between them, and the utility they serve by letting you play in all the game\u0027s various locations in minutes rather than hours. After you have established connections, that is. You shouldn\u0027t be able to launch your first vessel in Career off Eeloo, but once a base is purchased and established, you should have no bigger problems launching from there than from Kerbin. To put it another way: If you have put flags and bases on every planet, launched crewed missions everywhere and returned them, and your stations are orbiting more than half the bodies in the system, racing rocket-powered snowmobiles across the glaciers of Eeloo shouldn\u0027t still have to be a complex, hours-long mission out of Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think that the parallel Kerbin bases would need a good reason to exist other than \u0022being there just for having an option\u0022. Now, the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E is pretty much in the ideal location on Kerbin, lying perfectly on the equator and next to a large body of water for soft landings, while being easy to spot from orbit. Frankly, you can\u0027t beat the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E for sheer utility. However, if construction and R\u0026amp;D time was a factor, it would be beneficial to have other complexes to launch from. It could also give the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E the advantage it needs not to be overshadowed by, say, a Minmus shipyard (where gravity is trivial and Kerbin escape velocity can be acieved using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E alone): Even though you have to fight your way out of a gravity well and an atmosphere to escape it, the fastest research and assembly would always be done on Kerbin, particularly at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbabble","CreatedById":169643,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-13T13:37:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSorry, I didn\u0027t see your thread. \u00A0Glad there\u0027s someone out there with the same thoughts! \u00A0My concept was Kerbin-centric, but would easily expand to other bodies. \u00A0Accounting for the ease of lift-off/orbiting from a moon, I would likely put the cost of the initial plot up to x Science, y funds, z, reputation, as well as x amount of ore/fuel and hitchhiker containers and MPLs\u00A0(multiple drops, if needs be). \u00A0Basically bring a small construction crew to get started and show that you can easily get there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbabble","CreatedById":169643,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-13T14:54:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI suppose you could limit the tonnage of the vessel from a non-atmosphere\u00A0SC,\u00A0limiting it to rovers, orbiters, and insertion\u00A0flights to its parent planet?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-13T14:57:38Z\u0022 title=\u002210/13/2016 02:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 13, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Jimbabble\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
