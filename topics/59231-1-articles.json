Otherwise it is only really good for resetting the goo and material experiments. That makes it useful to have 1 lander on a ship with those experiments that you can reset for trips to other planets or biomes. You\u0027ll have to return data to Kerbin to get full value off it.

The way I\u0027m using it is to have it on a station in low Mun orbit, with some spare fuel. I have a reusable lander docked to the station that undocks, lands on a biome, then brings all the science back to the station and stores it in the Kerbin return vehicle, and then uses the lab to reset the experiments. I repeat this for as many biomes as I can, then send all the science back home with the return vehicle. It means you don\u0027t have to launch an entire rocket\u002Blander for every individual biome, and saves you a lot of fuel, since the only thing that you need to return to kerbin is a pod \u002B parachute. This will be much more useful when other planets get biomes, since you don\u0027t want to have to launch a new mission for every biome, you only need to send in fuel resupply tanks occasionally, or use Kethane. You could also just integrate the lab into the lander, but that\u0027s unneccesarily heavy and bulky (and looks silly, in my opinion)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust to clarify, you can hold as many experiments as you like in a single command pod, as long as they aren\u0027t repeats; if you have, say, a Mystery Goo Container, a Science Jr, and a Gravioli Detector on your lander, you can get data for every single biome with each experiment, and store it in a single command pod. You can\u0027t, however, store the same experiment from the same location twice; you can have a Goo reading from the Farside Crater, and a Goo reading from the Polar Lowlands, both stored in the same pod, but you can\u0027t have 2 Goo readings from the same biome.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"gilflo","CreatedById":62881,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-08T00:12:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAshflare\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo how do you transmit your experiments from your lander to your return vehicle, once they are docked together?
