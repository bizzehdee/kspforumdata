Mercury\u0027s orbit, for example, precesses due to the fact that in General Relativity the trajectories slightly deviate from eliptical ones. As you drop your periapsis closer and closer to event horizon, this gets worse. In fact, trajectories near a black hole can get really crazy with loops and everything. Close enough to the black hole, objects can actually spiral in, and if you drop bellow the event horizon, you are never coming out.

One photon is not actually traveling faster than the speed of light, it\u0027s just the appearance. The effect of what happens because of this is more or less the doppler effect. (Better known as red-shift.) That\u0027s the thing about the speed of light. It\u0027s value isn\u0027t relative to some other singular object; it\u0027s relative to EVERYTHING, not just the difference between an arbitrary reference point. (Hence the \u0022relativity\u0022 portion of Special Relativity and General Relativity.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is kind of like the example of two trains passing. If you\u0027re in a train passing another train that\u0027s moving in the opposite direction at the same speed, it\u0027ll appear that the other train is moving at twice the speed. (Lets say you\u0027re both moving at 30mph.) This is because of the reference point to which you are basing this experience off of. From your reference point, the train appears to be moving at 60mph. Are you or the other train moving at 60mph? No. It\u0027s just the appearance associated with your point of reference. Relative to the system both trains are in, neither are moving at 60mph; they\u0027re each going 30mph. Why? They\u0027re both basing their speed off of a static surrounding of zero motion: The Earth with which they\u0027re riding on. With good reason, we don\u0027t include the orbital speed of the Earth on automotive means of transportation. We base it off of a static point for both trains, not just one of them. That\u0027s kind of the idea here. Perspective has to be relative to a total system, not just a singular arbitrary point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be worthwhile to wrap your head around the fact that absolutely NOTHING in the universe is at a point of 0 cartesian motion. Everything is always in some kind of motion, and there\u0027s a speed limit to how fast it can go relative to static surroundings. With light in you\u0027re example, the only thing you would perceive would be a color change in the light.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NGTOne","CreatedById":55972,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-02T05:22:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/46089-Light-Speed\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EI contributed to a topic a while back that examined the physics of black holes in some detail.\u003C/a\u003E Diverged a bit (FTL travel, all sorts of other good stuff) as it went on, but there\u0027s some decent explanations of black hole and space-time physics.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JDobs","CreatedById":91072,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-03T01:41:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are parts along the event horizon where particles of light and gas are actually not pulled into the balck hole but thrown our in radio jets along a polar plane to the black hole.
