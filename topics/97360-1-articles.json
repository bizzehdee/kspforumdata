The problem is if your craft changes direction there is a chance for a split second where you aren\u0027t technically moving anywhere (zero velocity), so it cuts the chutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your open to mods, the RealChute mod fixes this problem by preventing chutes from opening unless your are going down and also allowing some cutes to remain open on the ground (drag chutes for planes)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-21T16:41:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kelmv\u0022 data-cite=\u0022kelmv\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhat the \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eheck\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E is going on here?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEasy now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut yes, parachutes only reliably work and don\u0027t-disappear when the craft you want to slow is going down.

They autocut when not moving, even wen you\u0027re in the air, have questionable drag and open abruptly, sometimes ripping ships apart.
