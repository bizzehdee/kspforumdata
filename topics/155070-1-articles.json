career mode (kinda already an idea, but this might be my own)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nso I heard of a mod for civilian population, in fact, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/101058-10x-civilian-population-14/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ehere it is,\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0but this is another idea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nso you are appointed administrator of the Kerbal Space Program, and you have to do a set programs set by the Kerbal Kongress, and the President, and (this can have an overhaul of the shipbuilding process) for major stuff like Kerbal Mercury or Voyager, you have to ask for funding from the kongress to do the program you want, say, a mission to Duna, and you have to ask for the funding, and you have a set parameter for the money, so lets say, 200,000 funds, and the leftover funds you keep so you can do another small mission like a satellite launch, so you do the mission, and this is where the rep comes into play, you have five different types of rep, Kongressional, Employees, Astronauts, Populace\u00A0and Presidential. if any of these go low, you have to change something or you get fired, and the things you change is in the strategies, which I never liked, like \u0022overwork ground staff,\u0022 you would take that out\u00A0so they like you better, and Kongressional and Presidential rep is for program completion, but every four years, when the election for a new president comes,\u00A0you\u00A0have to have finished\u00A0the program\u00A0by then, because when that happens, you get a new thing, where the kongress will raise\u00A0your budget, allowing for another program, or lower it, taking another\u00A0program away, or giving you more funds\u00A0for the current projects. \u00A0Astronaut rep is for whether you have sent them into space recently, or if an astronaut had died recently, population rep is for prebuilt things, like\u00A0you don\u0027t know a good solar array, you can ask Rockomax if they have an idea for it, and you get that idea for\u00A0the solar array, and it goes into your subassemblies. so now back to funds. if you have higher rep, you get better mission parameters and you can eventually tell what you want to do, and you get what you want to do, like a Jool V mission, or Moon Base, and best of all, moar funds. and here is the stuff for upgrading buildings, basically, you just ask for the funds like in the mission stuff, but you have to do things, like do 10 new keostationary satellites, so you cant just continually ask for funds to do the buildings\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nand here is my shipbuilding idea, though this\u00A0kind of works\u00A0better for things that use reusability, but it can work for the non reusable ones, like Mercury or Gemini:\u003Cbr\u003E\nso you have the ground crew, and you have an amount, and with your excess funds you can ask for more, and that gives you less time to build, and you can take some away, for more money, but it takes more time to build, wait, this idea sounds better in KCT, oh well, and for reusable things it has a timer saying \u00225 more days until ready to launch\u0022 so you don\u0027t have to wait for months to build a new one. and the rest is just KCT inclusion, well, most of this is KCT\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthis shall be my main idea for the mod, so I\u0027ll be adding on to it over time\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium
