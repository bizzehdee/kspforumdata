I estimate I saved nearly 2km/s on my current Jool mission by using Tylo to get into a stable orbit *and* I fixed my inclination while doing it.\n\nI am a proud descendant of Grandpa Erectus. Just as he chipped his rocks the same way for over 1 million years, so I, left to my own devices, never think that I might be able to do things differently. I had a routine of always aerocapturing off Jool then going to the various moons, so never considered there might be other options. However, like Uncle Neanderthal in the Ch\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A2telperronian period, I do recognize and steal good ideas from my new-fangled Homosap neighbors ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif).\n\nSo today, while performing some more controlled testing of aerocapture, I decided to give this Tylo thing a try. You can see the full report (and the test results) [here.](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/127129-1-0-4-Aerocapture-Testing?p=2051922\u0026viewfull=1#post2051922) In this thread, suffice to say that I got a pretty non-ideal encounter which, though it did capture me in Jool\u0027s SOI, put me into a retrograde orbit relative to Jool. But it was that or nothing, due to the phases of the moons when I got there. Still, I managed to fix the retrograde and end up in a 100km orbit at Laythe (after aerocapture there) for a total of 484m/s after entering Jool\u0027s SOI, without touching Jool at all. Thus, this was sort of \u0022MOAR Fuel Lite\u0022: somewhat (but not excessively so) more than a Jool aerocapture and rather less than using thrust alone.\n\nThe efficiency of using Tylo obviously depends on where it is when you get to Jool. Ideally it would be like in the pic on the KSP wiki, where you meet it pretty much tangent to its orbit to the right of Jool as you go in. I could only hit it at right angles on the back side of Jool. I doubt this is the absolute worst case but I\u0027m thinking it\u0027s up there. Other than being totally unable to get a Tylo encounter (say due to having to fly through Jool), what is the worst case? Is it even possible NOT to get a Tylo encounter? If you build your ship to rely on using Tylo can can\u0027t hit it, you\u0027re screwed.\n\nIt\u0027s this uncertainty about always being able to get Tylo encounter that makes me hesitant to use this as a standard tactic. While you can, if you want to spend the time, set up a perfect Tylo encounter when you do the burn at Kerbin, this is only really useful if you\u0027re just sending the 1 ship instead of a flotilla and can warp directly to the burn. If you change focus away from the ship, you\u0027ll hose the accuracy of the burn. And even if you avoid that, any inaccuracies in burn execution, trajectory bumps and SOI boundaries, and trajectory sways when rotating the ship via RCS, can all change your Jool arrival date by days to weeks, throwing your prediction of Tylo\u0027s position out the window anyway. So I\u0027m thinking Tylo\u0027s position when you get to Jool is all luck of the draw. If you can ALWAYS get an encounter, then just bring fuel for the worst-case scenario and you\u0027re fine. But if there\u0027s a chance you can\u0027t hit Tylo at all.............\n\n-----------------------------\n\nAnyway, back to the actual aerocapture testing. After dancing around Tylo, my ship soon hit Laythe\u0027s air doing 4200m/s, which is rather fast, seeing how ships hitting Laythe direct from Kerbin usually arrive with about 4500-5000m/s. I still had reentry heat set to 20%, which proved WAY too low. Nothing got hot at all even going down to a 34km Pe. Wow.\n\nSo I learned something important. For this particular ship in 1.0.2, [aerocapture at Laythe was even more severe than at Jool](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/122380-Ore-Travelling-Circus-02-Episode-17-FOOL-1-Prospecting?p=2020279\u0026viewfull=1#post2020279), even though at a lower speed than this. I had therefore been expecting Laythe to be a real bear this time, given what Jool was like in 1.0.4. However, it turns out that 1.0.4 treats Laythe differently than 1.0.2 did. Instead of being way worse, in 1.0.4, Laythe is way easier, despite 1.0.4 apparently making about 4x times as much heat (at least at Jool). And that\u0027s a serious point in favor of 1.0.4\u0027s heat model.\n\nAnyway, I\u0027ll have to try this again (now that I have a named save I can play with) using higher heat settings and see what happens.\n\nHmmmmmmmm............\n\nThe reason I started this thread was that I had come to the belief that trying to force things to be dangerous for LKO reentries had made any sort of useful aerobraking, let alone aerocapturing, at other planets pretty much impossible. Here\u0027s how I arrived at that conclusion:\n\n\\* In 1.0.2, things were quite bad at Jool and even worse at Laythe\n\n\\* In 1.0.4, things are about 4 times worse at Jool, so I assumed Laythe was right out the window given as the game had been making it even harder than Jool. And by extension, Eve and returning to Kerbin would be quite problematic.\n\nThis assumption has proved incorrect, however. For some reason, the various aero and heat changes in 1.0.4 appear to make Laythe quite doable, although further testing is required to determine how bad things really are there at higher heat levels. In any case, things aren\u0027t so bad as I originally thought, although I think Jool\u0027s a bit overblown.\n\nAnyway, I started this thread to get more knowledge and that seems to be working.

Sorry to get in the way.\n\nI consider this dead on topic. The question was how folks deal with interplanetary aerocaptures these days. One of the answers to the poll is to not do it, and another answer is \u0022other\u0022. Tylo qualifies under both.\n\nSo, what\u0027s the likelihood of NOT being able to get a direct (as in not bouncing off other moons or Jool first) Tylo encounter? It\u0027s got to be pretty low just based on the geometry. Jool, atmosphere included, really isn\u0027t that wide on the scale of its system of moons, so there\u0027s not much Tylo can hide behind. And if you go indirect, with bank shots off Jool itself and/or Laythe and/or Vall if they\u0027re handy, you can \u0022shoot around the corner\u0022 to at least some extent, and further reduce Tylo\u0027s ability to hide.\n\nNow, bouncing off Tylo can definitely put you in a retrograde orbit relative to Jool. This would seem to be the likely result if you hit Tylo when it\u0027s ahead of Jool. But that\u0027s really not so bad if your Ap is still out near Pol and your orbit is pretty eccentric (as in long and skinny). Then it only costs a couple hundred to flip it over to prograde.\n\nThe more I think about this, the safer it seems.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Jool is tougher, no question.

So adding the fuel for them to not need Jool areocapture just means a bigger transfer tug/stage. which is relatively trivial as things go in KSP. But it\u0027s quite annoying to HAVE to do that instead of being able to aerocapture off Jool, because it\u0027s a degree of player freedom taken away. Dragging a tug/plane combo through Jool\u0027s air these days at 100% heat is pretty much hopeless unless you\u0027re willing to build a huge shield, spam radiators (WHICH SHOULD NOT WORK), or some such. This makes me sad.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I had been unaware that 1.0.4 upped reentry heating, until trying to aerobrake at Jool (for a Laythe orbit).

I\u0027m thinking the root cause is that the curves for the present aero model, if allowed to run out to their asymptotes, would result in much taller atmospheres at places like Jool than allowed by tradition and the arbitrary caps we have. Thus, the thin, wispy, upper areas we\u0027d normally be aerocapturing in have been lopped off at the shoulders by the arbitrary height caps."},{"CreatedByName":"Brotoro","CreatedById":57674,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T05:07:01Z","Content":"Setting up a Tylo or Laythe gravity capture into Jool orbit is not as difficult as you might think. The trip out to Jool takes a long time compared to the orbital periods of those moons, so just increasing or decreasing your travel time by altering your trans-Jool trajectory can get you there at the proper time for the encounter you want. You just need to tweak you prograde/retrograde in combination with your radial outward/inward components (while focusing on the Jool system as you tweak the distant maneuver node in the background) to see ho this changes things. I usually do this targeting burn just after leaving Kerbin\u0027s SOI. The prograde/retrograde component will shift your arrival time, and the radial component can be used to target the encounter. You want to arrange for the encounter to be tangential to the moon\u0027s orbit...and the distance you pass by the outside of the the moon will determine the resulting capture orbit around Jool.

Is that correct?\n\nWhat determines whether or not a gravity assist will speed up or slow down a ship depends on how the directions of the ship\u0027s incoming and outgoing velocity vectors compare to the direction of the velocity vector of the body you are encountering. If the outgoing vector is closer to the direction of the planet\u0027s vector than the incoming vector was, then the ship will be sped up by the encounter. If the outgoing vector is further away from the direction of the body\u0027s velocity than the incoming vector was, then the ship will be slowed down by the encounter. So if you are coming in tangentially to the body\u0027s orbit (the ship\u0027s velocity vector is in the same direction as the body\u0027s velocity vector), then the ship will be decelerated by the encounter if the ship passes on either side of the body (since the outgoing vector will be bent further away from the planet\u0027s velocity vector). By shifting the path to either side, you can try to get as close as you can to a desirable post-encounter orbit.\n\nFor an example, see the \u0022Tricky Tylo Transfers\u0022 section of [**Long-term Laythe episode 31**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/27552?p=1099113\u0026viewfull=1#post1099113). I had sent in a payload for Tylo, intending to use a weak aerobraking at Laythe to slow it into Jool orbit (without stopping at Laythe)...but I found out that a near miss of Laythe (with no aerobraking at all) resulted in a gravitational capture with a periapsis out by Tylo. See the image of the capture trajectory.\n\nThe same thing happened in the \u0022But Wait, There\u0027s More!

In fact, in real life a gas giant\u0027s atmosphere produces rather less shock heating than Earth\u0027s, and that can (and IMO should) be modeled in KSP. A long time ago in the DRE thread ferram calculated shock temperature vs. velocity curves for various atmosphere types, and I think KSP\u0027s heating system would be well served by varying shock temperature (or transfer coefficient) by atmosphere type.\n\nI don\u0027t think it has to be an either/or thing, either, and I wish it wasn\u0027t. Like with Jool, if its upper atmosphere is supposed to be mostly hydrogen, hydrogen is a wonderful heat-absorber---it has the highest specific heat of any common element. Of course, it\u0027s not very dense but even so, it can still do wonders. So just as water in a plastic bottle will keep an external match flame from melting through the bottle by sucking away all the heat, you\u0027d think going through the upper layers of Jool would be pretty benign, as shown on Ferram\u0027s graph.\n\nWhile I\u0027ve got the attention of both the DRE guy and the air guy, what has to be done differently from stock to make this sort of thing happen? And do your respective mods do this or plan to in the near future? Or do you all know if Squad has any plans to address this?\n\nWhat I mostly complain of is the lack of wispy upper layers at other planets. You can hit Kerbin at like 3500-4000m/s coming home from Minmus or Duna, yet no flames appear at all until you\u0027re below 40km, nearly half-way to the surface. But hitting Laythe at comparable speeds and it\u0027s full-on flames just under the surface, and even more-so with Jool. I still haven\u0027t gotten around to trying Eve in 1.0.4 but from what I hear, it\u0027s the same way. What can be done about that?

Not sure about Laythe though.\n\nI don\u0027t understand what this \u0022convection\u0022 is all about in the context of a reentering ship. I was an engineer in a prior career but didn\u0027t mess with thermodynamics except in college. These days I\u0027m a firefighter by trade so study and deal with heat transfer on a daily basis, but in a less rigorous way than before, so my technical vocabulary has probably slipped a few cogs. But as I deal with heat these days, heat transfers in 3 ways: radiation, conduction, and convection. Radiation is electromagnetic waves/photons, conduction is through direct physical contact, and convection is how heated fluids expand, thereby becoming lighter than their surroundings, and so move upwards. Regardless of method, heat transfer is a separate thing entirely from heat creation. You have some process that creates heat, and then that heat transfers into the environment via one of these methods.\n\nThus, in the case of a ship hitting an atmosphere, the heat we\u0027re concerned with is being generated by the mechanical friction of the air on the ship, mostly on its front end. The rate of heat production thus depends on the speed of the ship, the density of the atmosphere, the sleekness of the ship---everything that makes for more air molecules hitting the ship, and hit it harder, in a given unit of time. Some of this heat is being radiated away in all directions (if you can see the flames, heat can see you). Some of the heat is conducting through the rest of the ship from the point of heat creation. Heat is also being conducted through the air from the source into the surrounding air, but if any pre-heated air hits another part of the ship, that\u0027s another, separate source of heat creation by friction. The only convection going on is in the ship\u0027s wake, as the air heated by its passage rises in the surrounding atmosphere, but won\u0027t cause any heat transfer to the ship, which is long gone. And the fact that this convection is happening means not all the heat created by the friction was absorbed by the ship.\n\nSo obviously, we mean different things by \u0022convection\u0022. What does \u0022convection\u0022 mean in KSP\u0027s heat model?\n\n\u003E \n\u003E CONCLUSION: Direct aerocapture at Laythe is possible without special heat-shielding designs if you use a tangential intercept.\n\nLooks good.

Air in front of the object entering atmosphere is compressed due to object\u0027s speed, thus raising its temperature proportionally to compression. Heat is then transfered from air to the ship.\n\nBy what mechanism does the heat from the compressed air get into the ship? It\u0027s not convection, certainly--that\u0027s just totally the wrong mechanic for this. There would be some radiation, but as the radiation goes in all directions, most of it is heating the surrounding atmosphere, not the ship. And no individual air molecule is in contact with the ship long enough to do much conduction. However, that air molecule is hitting the ship at Mach-whatever, which generates heat all by itself at the point of impact. Thus, I\u0027m pretty sure the main way of heating the ship is by mechanical friction. I suppose any radiant heat it absorbs is indirectly caused by the mechanical friction of compressing the air, but I don\u0027t see that in itself as the major heating cause.\n\nInstead, I believe most of the ship\u0027s kinetic energy loss does indeed go into compressing the air, which heats it, and then that heat is released and transfers to the surroundings as the air decompresses after the momentary passage of the shockwave. But most of that heat radiates in directions other than towards the ship.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Do you guys think Jool\u0027s atmosphere values should be tweaked to allow aerocapture?\n\nHmm. Jool aerocapture IS possible right now in limited circumstances. I would change it so it\u0027s doable under a wider range of circumstances.\n\nYou cannot look at a reentry into Jool, Laythe, or Eve, and say it\u0027s realistic that flames start the instant you barely touch the top of their atmospheres. Consider how on Kerbin you have to get below 40km, halfway to the ground, before flames start. That\u0027s more like what you\u0027d expect if the atmosphere faded out to nothing realistically instead of being chopped off at the shoulders by an arbitrary cap. IOW, the atmospheres of the other planets are too dense at their tops.\n\nSo, if you want realistic aerodynamics and atmospheres, the other planets need to have thinner upper parts. Whether this happens by raising the tops of their altitudes to where their existing curves would have them fade away, or change the curves so they fade at their existing upper limits, I really don\u0027t care. But one or the other needs to happen, strictly from a \u0022realism\u0022 standpoint. Having too much density at the top like they do now, these atmospheres are more like liquid oceans than gases, which is just wrong.\n\nNow, a side effect of fixing these atmospheres will be the creation of thin, upper layers in which interplanetary aerocapture will be rather easier than it is at present. More like at Kerbin coming home from Minmus or Duna. But what\u0027s wrong with that? If it\u0027s possible, and \u0022realistic\u0022 under an internally consistent set of rules within the game, then I certainly have no problem. And I think it\u0027s good for gameplay because it gives players more scope for more ambitious projects without saddling them with tedious workarounds. But then, I get my jollies from KSP out of thinking up something cool to do at another planet, designing the hardware for that, and then playing with it at the destination. I see the trip out there as just \u0022fly-over country\u0022 and warp through as much of it as possible. You might have other priorities.\n\nI\u0027m sure somebody will say \u0022but nobody does interplanetary aerocaptures in real life so they shouldn\u0027t be able to in KSP\u0022. But such folks are forgetting that KSP is toy-sized compared to real life. It takes an order of magnitude less dV to get anywhere in KSP, which means ships are moving proportionately slower when they arrive, so don\u0027t hit atmospheres nearly as hard as in real life. If you\u0027re willing to accept the small size of KSP, then you have to live with things like this. If the atmospheres are \u0022realistic\u0022 in KSP and its rules are internally consistent at all planets, then interplanetary aerocapture should naturally be something commonly used. It only makes sense to do it if you can.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-02T21:22:24Z\u0022 title=\u002207/02/2015 09:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Geschosskopf**"}]}
