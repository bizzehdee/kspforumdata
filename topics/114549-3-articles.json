Just as he chipped his rocks the same way for over 1 million years, so I, left to my own devices, never think that I might be able to do things differently. I had a routine of always aerocapturing off Jool then going to the various moons, so never considered there might be other options. However, like Uncle Neanderthal in the Ch\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A2telperronian period, I do recognize and steal good ideas from my new-fangled Homosap neighbors \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo today, while performing some more controlled testing of aerocapture, I decided to give this Tylo thing a try. You can see the full report (and the test results) \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/127129-1-0-4-Aerocapture-Testing?p=2051922\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post2051922\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere.\u003C/a\u003E In this thread, suffice to say that I got a pretty non-ideal encounter which, though it did capture me in Jool\u0027s SOI, put me into a retrograde orbit relative to Jool. But it was that or nothing, due to the phases of the moons when I got there. Still, I managed to fix the retrograde and end up in a 100km orbit at Laythe (after aerocapture there) for a total of 484m/s after entering Jool\u0027s SOI, without touching Jool at all. Thus, this was sort of \u0022MOAR Fuel Lite\u0022: somewhat (but not excessively so) more than a Jool aerocapture and rather less than using thrust alone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe efficiency of using Tylo obviously depends on where it is when you get to Jool. Ideally it would be like in the pic on the KSP wiki, where you meet it pretty much tangent to its orbit to the right of Jool as you go in. I could only hit it at right angles on the back side of Jool. I doubt this is the absolute worst case but I\u0027m thinking it\u0027s up there. Other than being totally unable to get a Tylo encounter (say due to having to fly through Jool), what is the worst case? Is it even possible NOT to get a Tylo encounter? If you build your ship to rely on using Tylo can can\u0027t hit it, you\u0027re screwed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s this uncertainty about always being able to get Tylo encounter that makes me hesitant to use this as a standard tactic. While you can, if you want to spend the time, set up a perfect Tylo encounter when you do the burn at Kerbin, this is only really useful if you\u0027re just sending the 1 ship instead of a flotilla and can warp directly to the burn. If you change focus away from the ship, you\u0027ll hose the accuracy of the burn. And even if you avoid that, any inaccuracies in burn execution, trajectory bumps and SOI boundaries, and trajectory sways when rotating the ship via RCS, can all change your Jool arrival date by days to weeks, throwing your prediction of Tylo\u0027s position out the window anyway. So I\u0027m thinking Tylo\u0027s position when you get to Jool is all luck of the draw. If you can ALWAYS get an encounter, then just bring fuel for the worst-case scenario and you\u0027re fine. But if there\u0027s a chance you can\u0027t hit Tylo at all.............\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-----------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, back to the actual aerocapture testing. After dancing around Tylo, my ship soon hit Laythe\u0027s air doing 4200m/s, which is rather fast, seeing how ships hitting Laythe direct from Kerbin usually arrive with about 4500-5000m/s. I still had reentry heat set to 20%, which proved WAY too low. Nothing got hot at all even going down to a 34km Pe. Wow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I learned something important. For this particular ship in 1.0.2, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/122380-Ore-Travelling-Circus-02-Episode-17-FOOL-1-Prospecting?p=2020279\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post2020279\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eaerocapture at Laythe was even more severe than at Jool\u003C/a\u003E, even though at a lower speed than this. I had therefore been expecting Laythe to be a real bear this time, given what Jool was like in 1.0.4. However, it turns out that 1.0.4 treats Laythe differently than 1.0.2 did. Instead of being way worse, in 1.0.4, Laythe is way easier, despite 1.0.4 apparently making about 4x times as much heat (at least at Jool). And that\u0027s a serious point in favor of 1.0.4\u0027s heat model.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I\u0027ll have to try this again (now that I have a named save I can play with) using higher heat settings and see what happens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHmmmmmmmm............\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason I started this thread was that I had come to the belief that trying to force things to be dangerous for LKO reentries had made any sort of useful aerobraking, let alone aerocapturing, at other planets pretty much impossible. Here\u0027s how I arrived at that conclusion:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* In 1.0.2, things were quite bad at Jool and even worse at Laythe\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* In 1.0.4, things are about 4 times worse at Jool, so I assumed Laythe was right out the window given as the game had been making it even harder than Jool. And by extension, Eve and returning to Kerbin would be quite problematic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis assumption has proved incorrect, however. For some reason, the various aero and heat changes in 1.0.4 appear to make Laythe quite doable, although further testing is required to determine how bad things really are there at higher heat levels. In any case, things aren\u0027t so bad as I originally thought, although I think Jool\u0027s a bit overblown.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I started this thread to get more knowledge and that seems to be working.

It\u0027s got to be pretty low just based on the geometry. Jool, atmosphere included, really isn\u0027t that wide on the scale of its system of moons, so there\u0027s not much Tylo can hide behind. And if you go indirect, with bank shots off Jool itself and/or Laythe and/or Vall if they\u0027re handy, you can \u0022shoot around the corner\u0022 to at least some extent, and further reduce Tylo\u0027s ability to hide.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, bouncing off Tylo can definitely put you in a retrograde orbit relative to Jool.

So adding the fuel for them to not need Jool areocapture just means a bigger transfer tug/stage. which is relatively trivial as things go in KSP.

I usually do this targeting burn just after leaving Kerbin\u0027s SOI. The prograde/retrograde component will shift your arrival time, and the radial component can be used to target the encounter. You want to arrange for the encounter to be tangential to the moon\u0027s orbit...and the distance you pass by the outside of the the moon will determine the resulting capture orbit around Jool.

If the outgoing vector is closer to the direction of the planet\u0027s vector than the incoming vector was, then the ship will be sped up by the encounter. If the outgoing vector is further away from the direction of the body\u0027s velocity than the incoming vector was, then the ship will be slowed down by the encounter. So if you are coming in tangentially to the body\u0027s orbit (the ship\u0027s velocity vector is in the same direction as the body\u0027s velocity vector), then the ship will be decelerated by the encounter if the ship passes on either side of the body (since the outgoing vector will be bent further away from the planet\u0027s velocity vector).

I was an engineer in a prior career but didn\u0027t mess with thermodynamics except in college. These days I\u0027m a firefighter by trade so study and deal with heat transfer on a daily basis, but in a less rigorous way than before, so my technical vocabulary has probably slipped a few cogs. But as I deal with heat these days, heat transfers in 3 ways: radiation, conduction, and convection. Radiation is electromagnetic waves/photons, conduction is through direct physical contact, and convection is how heated fluids expand, thereby becoming lighter than their surroundings, and so move upwards. Regardless of method, heat transfer is a separate thing entirely from heat creation. You have some process that creates heat, and then that heat transfers into the environment via one of these methods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus, in the case of a ship hitting an atmosphere, the heat we\u0027re concerned with is being generated by the mechanical friction of the air on the ship, mostly on its front end. The rate of heat production thus depends on the speed of the ship, the density of the atmosphere, the sleekness of the ship---everything that makes for more air molecules hitting the ship, and hit it harder, in a given unit of time. Some of this heat is being radiated away in all directions (if you can see the flames, heat can see you). Some of the heat is conducting through the rest of the ship from the point of heat creation. Heat is also being conducted through the air from the source into the surrounding air, but if any pre-heated air hits another part of the ship, that\u0027s another, separate source of heat creation by friction. The only convection going on is in the ship\u0027s wake, as the air heated by its passage rises in the surrounding atmosphere, but won\u0027t cause any heat transfer to the ship, which is long gone. And the fact that this convection is happening means not all the heat created by the friction was absorbed by the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo obviously, we mean different things by \u0022convection\u0022.

Heat is then transfered from air to the ship.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy what mechanism does the heat from the compressed air get into the ship? It\u0027s not convection, certainly--that\u0027s just totally the wrong mechanic for this. There would be some radiation, but as the radiation goes in all directions, most of it is heating the surrounding atmosphere, not the ship. And no individual air molecule is in contact with the ship long enough to do much conduction. However, that air molecule is hitting the ship at Mach-whatever, which generates heat all by itself at the point of impact. Thus, I\u0027m pretty sure the main way of heating the ship is by mechanical friction. I suppose any radiant heat it absorbs is indirectly caused by the mechanical friction of compressing the air, but I don\u0027t see that in itself as the major heating cause.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstead, I believe most of the ship\u0027s kinetic energy loss does indeed go into compressing the air, which heats it, and then that heat is released and transfers to the surroundings as the air decompresses after the momentary passage of the shockwave. But most of that heat radiates in directions other than towards the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDo you guys think Jool\u0027s atmosphere values should be tweaked to allow aerocapture?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHmm. Jool aerocapture IS possible right now in limited circumstances. I would change it so it\u0027s doable under a wider range of circumstances.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou cannot look at a reentry into Jool, Laythe, or Eve, and say it\u0027s realistic that flames start the instant you barely touch the top of their atmospheres. Consider how on Kerbin you have to get below 40km, halfway to the ground, before flames start. That\u0027s more like what you\u0027d expect if the atmosphere faded out to nothing realistically instead of being chopped off at the shoulders by an arbitrary cap. IOW, the atmospheres of the other planets are too dense at their tops.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, if you want realistic aerodynamics and atmospheres, the other planets need to have thinner upper parts. Whether this happens by raising the tops of their altitudes to where their existing curves would have them fade away, or change the curves so they fade at their existing upper limits, I really don\u0027t care. But one or the other needs to happen, strictly from a \u0022realism\u0022 standpoint. Having too much density at the top like they do now, these atmospheres are more like liquid oceans than gases, which is just wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, a side effect of fixing these atmospheres will be the creation of thin, upper layers in which interplanetary aerocapture will be rather easier than it is at present. More like at Kerbin coming home from Minmus or Duna. But what\u0027s wrong with that? If it\u0027s possible, and \u0022realistic\u0022 under an internally consistent set of rules within the game, then I certainly have no problem. And I think it\u0027s good for gameplay because it gives players more scope for more ambitious projects without saddling them with tedious workarounds. But then, I get my jollies from KSP out of thinking up something cool to do at another planet, designing the hardware for that, and then playing with it at the destination. I see the trip out there as just \u0022fly-over country\u0022 and warp through as much of it as possible. You might have other priorities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure somebody will say \u0022but nobody does interplanetary aerocaptures in real life so they shouldn\u0027t be able to in KSP\u0022. But such folks are forgetting that KSP is toy-sized compared to real life. It takes an order of magnitude less dV to get anywhere in KSP, which means ships are moving proportionately slower when they arrive, so don\u0027t hit atmospheres nearly as hard as in real life. If you\u0027re willing to accept the small size of KSP, then you have to live with things like this. If the atmospheres are \u0022realistic\u0022 in KSP and its rules are internally consistent at all planets, then interplanetary aerocapture should naturally be something commonly used. It only makes sense to do it if you can.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-02T21:22:24Z\u0022 title=\u002207/02/2015 09:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Geschosskopf\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
