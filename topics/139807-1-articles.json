If you don\u0027t want to revert to an older save I guess you could try and launch a probe and crash it into the engine form the side and knock it off. There is a risk that the station core gets damaged or de-orbited though. If it was me I\u0027d first return the Kerbals to the KSC and the de-orbit the station core with a probe with a claw, I hate messy stations hehe.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Atlas2342","CreatedById":155194,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-15T14:12:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr, do it the \u003Cem\u003EKerbal\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0way and use the Whack-a-Kerbal...\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E(In case you were wondering, altf12)\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
