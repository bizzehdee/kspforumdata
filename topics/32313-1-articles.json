And it wasn\u0027t just the docking, but figuring out how to rendezvous was pretty tricky as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut there she is. Complete, refueled (You should see the size of the refueler! Biggest ship I\u0027ve ever made that can actually get into orbit and is able to deliver over 10k fuel), and ready to journey off into space. I\u0027ve even built a rather odd-looking Space Shuttle (as docked to my Space Station in the pic) that is capable of crew transfers. It\u0027s not exactly a SSTO, as I launch the thing on a rocket, but after docking with the Space Station, it\u0027s able to fly back to headquarters and land on the runway ... Sometimes ... Well, it would be able to land on the runway every time if I were a better pilot!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll probably test out it\u0027s mission capabilities on Mun first. The mission to deploy the lander, land on the surface of the Mun, drive around a bit in the rover, re-attach the rover, and rendezvous the lander with the space station again.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Richy teh space man","CreatedById":12511,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-10T16:09:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice job, gratz on being able to land a space plane in one piece too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DisarmingBaton5","CreatedById":68576,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-10T16:18:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat plane looks amazing.

They were pretty much empty once I got the Space Station Core into orbit at about 150km above the surface, which was why I needed a big refueler to replenish them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Space Plane has a \u0022fat middle\u0022 because that\u0027s one of those hitchhiker storage containers, so that it\u0027s able to function as a shuttle to take up to 5 kerbals at once back home (the pilot and up to 4 in the container). Although I probably kinda need to figure out a way how to get multiple kerbals into the container while the space shuttle is on the launchpad, on top of the rocket that gets it into orbit. May see if I can build a ladder up the side of the rocket and into the hitchhiker container, so they can climb up it on the launchpad.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"joppiesaus","CreatedById":57698,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-10T17:11:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECongratcioulations! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
