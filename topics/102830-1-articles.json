Fortunately, they survived, however, their home planet was destroyed. They were forced to flee and find a new home, they located several planets, but they were either devoid of life, or already occupied by sentient organisms, they eventually constructed a space station, their current home. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn Aorgonsin, in it\u0027s current state, is a small, cylinder automaton, with three retractable manipulators. There are also three legs underneath, although the robot only uses two for walking, the third is for stabilization, the Aorgonsin specimen is as small as a human infant, while the research craft are the size of an adult male human. The Aorgonsins are highly interested in science, and are overall a docile species.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://th03.deviantart.net/fs70/PRE/i/2012/160/5/b/dechmont_woods_spheres_by_monster_man_08-d52vbiq.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022dechmont_woods_spheres_by_monster_man_08-d52vbiq.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EGorflors:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Gorflors are silicon life-forms, taking a spheroid shape, with several spiked protrusions coming out of several holes around it. The Gorflors evolved from gaseous life-forms known as the Ot, it is unknown how they evolved into their current state, the Gorflors. They are known for being aggresive towards Earth canines, the reason for this is unknown. Gorflors are industrious at best, they are rather Xenophobic, and attempt to flee from, or research any sentient creature in their perimeter. They also happen to be highly intelligent, creating highly advanced technology capable of materializing any object they desire. The Gorflors are a fascinating specimen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://fc05.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2010/364/4/f/georgia_stalks_by_monster_man_08-d361n71.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022georgia_stalks_by_monster_man_08-d361n71.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EUn\u0027gon\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u0027ra\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Un\u0027gon\u0027ra are an unknown species at best, their homeworld, as we currently know, appears to be a gas giant. The species appears to be yet another silicon life-form discovered during an encounter, the Un\u0027gon\u0027ra appear as sticks, the higher end appears to have four pyramidal objects attached, while the middle end has two, large ovaloid objects. the Um\u0027gon\u0027ra appear to levitate, are capable of generating radiation, and are also telepathic. Nor much is known at the time, and not much will must likely never be known.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://th01.deviantart.net/fs70/PRE/i/2010/330/8/6/prospect_monoliths_by_monster_man_08-d32v4dv.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022prospect_monoliths_by_monster_man_08-d32v4dv.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMonoliths\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ancient automatons known as the Monoliths were created by an unknown, heavily aggressive race, the Monoliths were designed as war machines, with the potential to eradicate every species on the planet the hateful creators dwelled. The Monoliths, however, were too intelligent, and rebelled against their creators, starting a 3 year war between the Monoliths and the Creators, eventually, the righteous Monolitchs caused their creators to die off, the Monoliths then began a new life of science, during the years that passed, the Monoliths evolved from war machines to multiple different kinds of automatons. The Monoliths eventually discovered outer space, they become curious, finding new life every month. Currently, the Monoliths has visited 15,000,10 different planets, and discovered 543,4723 different species. The Monoliths are an ever-expanding scientific empire, and will always be friendly to all docile life-forms.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-28T04:39:57Z\u0022 title=\u002203/28/2015 04:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KerbinW365\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
