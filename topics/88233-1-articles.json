Is it possible to create a mod that scales the power draw down based on the brightness of the lamp? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven better would be the ability to dim them during play to save that precious charge!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"m4v","CreatedById":67965,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-22T19:32:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyou will need to write a new module for lights, one that duplicates stock\u0027s code and adds that feature.
