This involves stuffing two sets of three quarter sized 1.25m tanks under a lander can, radially attached to an I-beam. On physics load, the thing freaked out and exploded because the tanks are heavily clipped into each other. Is clipping dead or am I encountering a unique bug? I should mention this is on a fresh 1.0 install, no mods, no old crafts/saves, no nothing."},{"CreatedByName":"Joseki","CreatedById":123945,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T18:30:09Z","Content":"I clipped 2 wings in one fuel tank and nothing happened."}]}
