What is your typical piloting procedure? Are you having difficulty controlling them at a certain point in the flight? Is the rocket actually disassembling itself, or is it simply running out of fuel before it gets high enough to achieve orbit? Have you noticed any common trends in how your rockets perform during the flight? Are you comfortable with your ability to read the navball and use that to help you figure out what\u0027s going on? Do you think you could provide a few screenshots of your most (relatively) successful craft? It might be possible that the fixes are relatively simple.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut yes, Kerbal Space Program isn\u0027t exactly the sort of game you can expect to just pick up and play flawlessly right out of the box. Part of the challenge is learning what works and what doesn\u0027t, as well as how to make what works work consistently. Some of the concepts may even seem counterintuitive to how you\u0027d expect them to work until you actually see them in action. That sort of game isn\u0027t for everyone, and I\u0027m not trying to push it on you if it turns out it isn\u0027t for you, but maybe you should give it a few more tries after arming yourself with some knowledge on how the game (and rocketry in general) works.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-06T18:21:06Z\u0022 title=\u002206/06/2013 06:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 6, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Specialist290\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Moach","CreatedById":9,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-06T18:19:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyou can always keep trying it on the demo before you commit your hard-earned cash on the full game, it\u0027s perfectly possible to achieve orbit with that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efailure is part of the game, you know - you\u0027re basically paving a trial and error through rocket science\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ekerbals will get hurt, there\u0027s no way around that - but don\u0027t feel discouraged, there are plenty more \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003Estupid\u003C/span\u003E brave astronauts to try to reach the final* frontier\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E*pun intended\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003ESomething eventually has to work out! when in doubt, keep adding boosters!\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003Echeers!\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"inigma","CreatedById":69310,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-06T19:13:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHave you read the wiki article on How to Get into Orbit? \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Tutorial:_How_to_Get_into_Orbit\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Tutorial:_How_to_Get_into_Orbit\u003C/a\u003E for a primer on how to get into orbit.
