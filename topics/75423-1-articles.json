She quickly speeds up as the fuel gets burned off, and eventually goes well over 100. \u0022Kerbaltek - Surfex\u0022 is a pretty good ground machine, and may help you there. With other craft, I\u0027ve been able to get speeds around 75 m/s on surprisingly rough terrain, with the proper suspension, but amphibious is a slightly different matter and this challenge is about efficiency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy experience tells me that Radial Air Intakes are best for floatation, because they can handle seriously heavy impacts; they provide good buoyancy; and of course they feed air to the engine.
