And game wise this makes some sense as its relatively complicated to conduct a realistic spacewalk using whats available to us in the stock game.\u00A0 However, with certain mods this becomes less of an issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe\u0027ve seen things like the Nebula handholds mod that gives us more options for moving about the spacecraft without having to use the jetpack. And even in stock, the ladders can perform this function fairly well even if they look weird. Then we see something like \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E with its winches, which perform very well as a tether system to keep you attached to the spacecraft, though they\u0027re not perfect, and to replicate how its actually done in real life (specially in regards to larger crafts where you\u0027d have to retether periodically) we\u0027d need either a dedicated winch-type part that can be put in the carry slot of a kerbal, so that the kerbal could re-tether properly. Though of course this can be worked around a bit by just placing dozens of winches all over the place, but this is also inefficient as not only do you get your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E menu super crowded but you\u0027re increasing your part count dramatically as you\u0027d need these winches in several places on every single module of the station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd another part of the problem is simply our ability to control our kerbals. We have some control over kerbals following a ladder in that we can change direction (Sort of), but this isn\u0027t great. We can only change the kerbals direction on a single plane, and this only kind of works and requires very careful handhold placement for it to not be janky or even work for that matter. Meanwhile we can\u0027t change directions any other way, so if we want a kerbal to be moving along but then change a module that goes perpendicular to the module its currently on, it can\u0027t do it unless you use a relatively complicated \u0022curved\u0022 handhold path. Again, doesn\u0027t look great and takes much tweaking to get working properly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for how these things could be solved, well I\u0027ve figured out some ways, though what it\u0027d take to actually get all of these things working is beyond me. But presumably they should work:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Tethers. Carryable tether part that preferably should be able to be attached arbitrarily to module (similar to hooks) or directly to handholds if this is possible. Could use separate dedicated parts for the tether to attach to, (and may be have these double up as handholds?) but that could increase part count unnecessarily.\u00A0 Naturally this tether would have a tweakable length.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother thing that could be done for earlier style spacewalks, is to introduce optional \u0022auto-tethers\u0022 to command pods, essentially mimicking the how the Gemini and early Soviet spacewalks worked. Kerbal pops out of the capsule but is permanently attached via a tether, and the capsule could behave similarly to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E winch and would be able to reel in the kerbal if he floats off structure.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, you could use a combination of these two things for more advanced spacewalks. The kerbal pops out of the airlock with the auto-tether enabled, but because he has the carryable tether,\u00A0 he can disconnect the auto-tether and then move along the station as needed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E is pretty prefect for this particular issue, so no reason I think to reinvent the wheel.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Handholds. This is pretty straightforward and again no reason to reinvent the wheel here. CX Aerospace introduced integrated handholds to its station parts, and many parts, stock and mod alike also have parts of their structure that logically speaking a kerbal could grab onto and use to move around with, so where appropriate its just a matter of enabling this functionality. Is probably a more complicated solution to implement than it sounds (as I\u0027m unsure if ladders are pure config work or if they do require model work to work properly) but even so.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Control. Not much that modders can do to change how a kerbal moves along ladders, I would think as thats something thats more to do with the games code rather than a \u0022kerbal part\u0022 that can be tweaked. However, something I think might be very simple to implement at least for separate handhold parts (like ladders) is the a right click ability to \u0022grab\u0022 it. Essentially if the kerbal is within arm range (which can just piggy back off of the already implemented grab range kerbals have) then you could just right click and grab the part, and the kerbal will switch to holding onto that part instead.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBit hacky but at the same time for game purposes should be a fairly clean way to make kerbals more mobile without relying on an unrealistic jetpack.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. Balancing non-tethered spacewalks. Probably the simplest part of this. Disable the stock suit jetpacks, and introduce separate EVA parts for this purpose. Cormorant Aeronologies MMU is a great example of how that can work, something like SAFER should be relatively simple to make in the same way. Perhaps take Universal Storage\u0027s EVA-X and make that the stock jetpack? Thers a lot of things that can be done here. The realistic amounts of fuel these things would have (and in case of MMU limited amount of power) would balance them against simply just crawling over your craft, but at the same time would still enable you do non-tethered spacewalks for whatever purpose.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut anyway theres the topic. Again gonna state I\u0027m unsure of what it\u0027d take for some of this, but just going off of my limited knowledge I\u0027d think these would be pretty clean solutions that would also presumably be possible with what can be done in a mod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
