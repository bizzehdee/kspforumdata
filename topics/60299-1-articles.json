Rather than reloading to the last save point, it might be useful to have an option to time warp in reverse, or to revert to the beginning of the last time-warp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENotes: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Reverse time warp would be impossible with physics warps (i.e. warps in atmosphere or started with the alt key) due to the fact that a player can control their craft during such warps. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Reverse time warping could only be allowed up to the start of the last time-warp period, since that is the only guaranteed period in which the player could not control their craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) An option to undo a time warp period would probably require a quicksave at the beginning of every time warp--that may not be desirable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) In my mind, implementing reverse time warping should be easy. That said, I\u0027m naive and have no idea what the source code looks like, so my convictions on the subject aren\u0027t worth a magic bean.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S. I am fully aware of Mechjeb\u0027s warp manager which eliminates the problem of warping past a maneuver node.
