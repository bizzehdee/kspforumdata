Save as a DDS file, which has to be vertically flipped from what you would normally use in any other format. I once used Texture Replacer to try and replace my water by extracting the assets, saving as a PNG and editing away. Because I failed to vertically flip them back to an upright orientation, my water all got reversed in-game. Same thing happened when I tried using the DDS loader on a stock part. I forgot to vertically flip it, so my part was wearing its texture upside down.
