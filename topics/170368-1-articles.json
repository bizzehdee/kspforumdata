Because of that, I can\u0027t be positive, but it sounds like hitting the ground with some sort of probecore on board will do. However, if it\u0027s destroyed on impact, I\u0027m not sure if the contract will register it or no. Sometimes it needs a few seconds to kick in. You might need to try it. Luckily, landing on Eve is simple for a small probe. Just use chutes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-01T15:53:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf it\u0027s a standard landing contract, then yes you do need to survive it, craters don\u0027t count.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood news is, Eve is one of the simplest places to land on. It\u0027s not far, and the atmosphere is so soupy chutes or gliders work really well. Just be careful entering the atmosphere \u0027cuz it will get toasty.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
