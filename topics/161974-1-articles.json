It should open it, and you\u0027re halfway there!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGo to the thing that you want to edit (e.g. crash tolerance, name, description,) and change it! I was annoyed that the jet engines used too much fuel (in my opinion, please no flame war on fuel efficiency!), so I changed the rate of fuel draining for the engine thrust. Next I modified the J-33 \u0027Wheesley\u0027 Basic Turbofan Engine\u0027s crash tolerance (changed to 150m/s), the thrust (max thrust to 2500), and some other values.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext, after you\u0027ve changed your respective part(s), simply go to \u0027File\u0027, and click \u0027Save\u0027.
