I just wanted to tell you about a new car/plane I just made, the F1 2030. completely stock, and it looks cool, But i need a little help with the flying. it should fly well, but something is wrong. The wheels just won\u0027t cooperate. So I had to put it on to a Rocket holder, and add a rocket to it. the download link\u00A0is\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalx.com/Concodroid/F-1-2030\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalx.com/Concodroid/F-1-2030\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(note this craft is completely *stock*.)

Also, if the craft is heavy enough to flex under its own weight so that the gear tilts will have the same problem.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Concodroid","CreatedById":153976,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-06T00:55:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStill not working!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JTpopcorn","CreatedById":130311,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-06T01:38:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTry unlocking plus limiting the front gear steering to overcome it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Concodroid","CreatedById":153976,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-06T15:19:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHmm...
