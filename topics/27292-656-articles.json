Kerman is indeed missing in action and presumed to be dead. Jebediah had been piloting the Explorer 1 spacecraft on its maiden voyage when it broke up during reentry. The administrator said that mission control lost contact with Jebediah just after re-entering the atmosphere. Witness reported a fireball in the sky followed by strange black debris landing around the supposed crash site. According to the administrator, \u0022the most likely cause of breakup was high temperatures, due to the lack of a heat shield on the craft\u0022. When questioned why there was no heat shield on the spacecraft, the administrator shrugged and said that \u0022the engineers probably forgot\u0022. No internal investigations are currently planned by the KSP. Jebediah is suspected to have landed in the Eastern Sea, if anyone knows where Jebediah is, they are urged to contact Kerbal Daily.-Leeroy C.
