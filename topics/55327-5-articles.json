What works well is have the new parts in a container (I like to have a container rack also right outside of the service bay to store more parts or just swap the containers out). Then you right click on the container and take the part you want. Then you right click on that part on the kerbal\u0027s back and click \u0022attach\u0022 and place it in the service bay where you want it. Once you have it where you\u0027d like left click and you\u0027ll hear the drilling sound (and it\u0027s green just like in the VAB, if it\u0027s yellow you\u0027re too far away but it\u0027s a valid place if it\u0027s red you can\u0027t place it there at all).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can right click on parts that you see in the bay that you want to remove and select \u0022grab\u0022 and those will go on the kerbal\u0027s back.
