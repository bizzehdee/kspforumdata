It\u0027s like the atmosphere doesn\u0027t update position at the same speed as the rest of the scene, which under normal flying conditions isn\u0027t a problem. It\u0027s mostly noticeable when quickly moving the camera up and down. Also, I don\u0027t know how it can be solved but the atmosphere ignores anti aliasing. I normally run just in game AA at 8x. I tried messing with nVidia Inspector and applied 2x2 supersampling, then 4x MSAA with 4x SGSSAA and the aliasing where the atmo meets the ground persists. I didn\u0027t try FXAA, which might help but that also applies to the GUI and I don\u0027t really want that going all fuzzy.\n\nIn some ways I find the aliasing minor because the most notable thing for me when running this with EVE was sub 30fps at times.

It\u0027s like the atmosphere doesn\u0027t update position at the same speed as the rest of the scene, which under normal flying conditions isn\u0027t a problem. It\u0027s mostly noticeable when quickly moving the camera up and down. Also, I don\u0027t know how it can be solved but the atmosphere ignores anti aliasing. I normally run just in game AA at 8x. I tried messing with nVidia Inspector and applied 2x2 supersampling, then 4x MSAA with 4x SGSSAA and the aliasing where the atmo meets the ground persists. I didn\u0027t try FXAA, which might help but that also applies to the GUI and I don\u0027t really want that going all fuzzy.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E In some ways I find the aliasing minor because the most notable thing for me when running this with EVE was sub 30fps at times.

So to end on a positive, the atmo height....oh my kraken, I nearly asked if extending it was possible a few weeks back. Mountains poking out of the atmosphere really and I mean really got on my nerves. It\u0027s truly wonderful.\n\u003E \n\nThat flicker and aliasing is caused by the new depth buffer, and no amount of antialiasing can fix it. I\u0027m looking into it.\n\nFor the atmo height, yeah, I was waiting to have a clean way to do it, last time I did it through the config tool and wasn\u0027t satisfied as it ended up full of artifacts.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 4 hours ago, Columbia said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [@blackrack](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/104258-blackrack/), do you have any word on the black ocean and scatterer disappearing suddenly at times?  \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Thanks!\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Edit: I now realize the Scatterer disappearing thing is listed under the known issues.\n\u003E \n\nFor scatterer disapperaing just revert flight or change scenes.
