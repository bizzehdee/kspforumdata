I like how there\u0027s now a way to make it easier or harder for career mode and science mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomething I was thinking of is for just the Science mode since it focuses on Science only if there was a way to modify the values for rewards of science for categories such as:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Surface Samples\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- EVAs\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Crew Reports\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- All the Science Equipment (a slider for each equipment item)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Recovery of the vessel\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERather than just one general slider but make it so you can give 150% for returned vessels but having 50% reward for EVAs or whatever the player wants for the above categories. This I think will make it so those who are more of wanting to land on planets and moons to change that where as those who want only to do science equipment experiments and such to modify those. (Sorry if this starts to sound confusing)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf this is possible to be added in through the game or a mod, that would be awesome, but I also understand if it wasn\u0027t able to be added.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for your reading\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-08T22:20:09Z\u0022 title=\u002210/08/2014 10:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 8, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Yokai134\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
