Wrap now defaults to false for backwards compatibility.

NOTE: If you change any PQS settings (let alone changing RSS configs!) you MUST delete all .obj files in GameData/RealSolarSystem/PluginData!

I\u0027ve been launching pretty successfully using gravity turns as described in the FAQ, but I always end up jockeying pitch to try and control my apogee while raising my perigee. This usually works pretty good right up until the last few seconds, at which time my apogee tends to go flying out into space and my perigee tends to stop lower than I want it, forcing me to waste more fuel later trying to circulaize at the altitude I want.
