The larger the size fuel tanks is like (3.75m) or (mk3) have less rigid attachment connections, so the higher you go beyond 1.25m the more necessary autostruts may become. In case you want to avoid them when not willing to you should use short Mk1 and Mk2 sized fuselages and a short width wingspan with 1 or 2 engines, that could do without autostruts always with minor part rigidity under stress. So beyond that I\u0027d use autostruts always. Below that I\u0027d discard using them. Remember that the amount of attachments nodes, further surface attachments like other fuel tanks and the total width, height and length of the vessel determine the joint strength. So 8 small 1.25m fuel tanks are more flexing then 2 big ones.\u00A0 Beyond that it is the engine thrust location (usually at the bottom) and aerodynamic stress that further request necessary autostruts use.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso, the distance from one part connection to another further degrades the rigidity or stiffness. So a part autostrutted to a part that is furthest away will become less potent then a location closer on the vessel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRigid attachment is what it says it does. It makes a connection rigid, like glass is. Glass breaks normally when dropped, the same goes with rigid attachment. Part stresses remain the same so if the particular connection is stressed like by impact or through aerodynamic stress on wings then the part is likely to break.\u003Cbr\u003E\nDue to rockets and planes undertaking a lot of stress it is better not to use rigid attachment only if you got a particular good reason.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOut of my mind I would only use rigid attachment\u00A0 for.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nCertain custom bearings to hold parts in exact places (stock propellers or mechanisms)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nLarge ground construction bases using I-Beams and girders to stop flexing\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSometimes on longer rockets it can be good to stop drag or engine thrust vibrations causing bending and swaying. Imagine a very long rocket that is thin it can make it super stiff so that the drag from the bottom fins or force of the engine gimbal doesn\u0027t alter the structure. Just don\u0027t try to land that rocket at the bottom hard as rigid attachment will make part attachments brittle and break off more easily.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOn wings. While most people don\u0027t it can be used on small to medium large planes when using multiple segmented wing pieces, usually on wide wing aircraft. Don\u0027t use it on the wing piece directly attached to the fuel tank as it get\u0027s the greatest stress, which is what most people do and then discard the option as wings snap off. The first wing piece is where bending needs to be as it holds the wing so never use rigid attachment there. On the outer wing segments it can make sure wing tips don\u0027t overly bend. Because the first segment bends the other segment that is set to rigid attachment doesn\u0027t snap off as the first segment absorbs the stress first keeping the snap off point at bay.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor autostruts you have Grandparent which makes that part connected to the part it is node or surface attached to. Heaviest and root part is obvious, however, if using large part count vessels make sure that if you dock to another vessel that has a heavier part the autostrut will connect to there or any of the root parts on any both vessels will change to any of both. Sometimes this will give explosions or problems so quicksave first and if so make sure to set all heaviest parts to any other as you can change autostruts in flight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause of this the grandparent is the safest option, if you do a lot of docking using large part count vessels make sure your vessels use mostly this setting. Usually the problem described isn\u0027t very common when using less complex vessels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EGrandparent\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs described it struts the part to the part it is attached to. In terms of strategy you best use grandparent autostrut on every part within the core stack. A stack is a single long fuselage, in terms of the core stock it means the one in the middle that has the cockpit or command pod.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis stiffens the vessel on every part connection making sure it doesn\u0027t bend.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso use grandparent part on the first part attached radially like a decoupler and also the fuel tank attached to it. The reason for this is that the connection that holds up a entire stack that is radially attached is located at the fuel tank to which it is attached first.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf you have a very long rocket it is best to attach the decoupler and fuel tank (or fuel tank directly) in the middle of the length. This makes neither the top or bottom will flex when fully building the stack further.\u003Cbr\u003E\nUsing grandparent on these parts makes sure the Center of Mass of the radial fuel stack is bolted in the center.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI you use either mirror or radial symmetry using grandparent on the lower or top parts will grandparent strut the parts together so i.e. a 6 radial booster setup will have all 6 i.e. nose cones attach to each other so stress will not bend their relative alignments.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EHeaviest Part\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUsing heaviest part seems usually the strongest for me. The reason being is that the heaviest part is usually the largest fuel tank, that fuel tank is usually at the middle. Using heaviest part autostrut means most parts are closer to the heavier part then root or grandparent, and while grandparent won\u0027t solve all problems heaviest will universally make the strongest vessel if all people would auto use this setting on every part. The reason why it works best is because the closer the autostrut connection is, the stronger that connection holds up, the same goes for using the strut part connector. Dragging a heavy part further out will bend more under stress when using any autostrut or strut part connector.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn practice \u0022Heaviest part\u0022 it is best used on parts in the radial stacks like boosters and extra fuel stacks for larger space planes. This involves most of the fuel tanks, cones and engines other then the one directly attached to the core stack which should be set to grandparent.\u003Cbr\u003E\nUsing it on the bottom will make sure the bottom parts of radial stacks which are usually fuel tanks and engines stay in symmetry to the center stack as this will stop bending them under stress.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ERoot Part\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRoot part is best used on parts that are closest to it that are not in the center stack at which the root part is located other then those directly attached to it. In that case using root is similar to using grandparent, which is the reason why \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nOn a regular rocket root part is usually a command pod on top. Using root on the top cones on any radial stacks or any fuel tank below there will stiffen those parts in aligment with the root and center stack.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, using a very small middle sections like on a 0.625 or 1.25m probe core that could be in the center of a stratolauncher type aircraft then the very large fuselages on the side would be very flexing unless every part of those fuel tanks were strutted to root instead of heaviest.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn other words, if the root part is not a very heavy part that takes in a lot of stress from the heavier parts then it is best to set root autostrut on the heavier parts.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn case of a space plane, the heaviest part is usually a fuel tank in the middle. To that fuel tank are wings, engines and landing gear attached that take in impact force from landing. When radial outer parts selected to heaviest the wing, landing and weight stresses of those outer parts will be strengthened more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn relation to the above, that center fuel tank could be the root part, but usually it isn\u0027t. Imagine that you have any vessel, rover, space plane, aircraft or rocket to which most of those stresses are located at or near the root part, like in the example of a stratolauncher vessel. In that case strut every part to root that you would normally strut to heaviest.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-05-08T00:12:08Z\u0022 title=\u002205/08/2019 12:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EMay 8, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Aeroboi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketSquid","CreatedById":152665,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-05-08T03:32:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/186653-aeroboi/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022186653\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/186653-aeroboi/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Aeroboi\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0so I should use grandparent if it\u2019s supposed to dock with something, heaviest otherwise, and use rigid attachment only when\u00A0I want to avoid bending at all costs?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Serenity","CreatedById":179192,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-05-08T07:04:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223595220\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022184320\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221557266733\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022152665\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RocketSquid\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n9 hours ago, RocketSquid said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u2019ve found the autostruts very helpful, but recently realized that I\u2019m probably using them wrong.
