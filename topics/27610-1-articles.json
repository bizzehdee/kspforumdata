Now I have the problem of a lack of documentation for the API an before I waste time trying and failing, over and over again, I wanted to ask you for help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI currently get orbit information from \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Courier New\u0027;\u0022\u003EFlightGlobals.Vessel\u003C/span\u003E and \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Courier New\u0027;\u0022\u003EFlightGlobals.fetch.VesselTarget\u003C/span\u003E. But those are in reference to the current main body of the vessel and the target. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow would calculate an orbit of a vessel around a body, where I would suppply the vessel and body. Is there a way to do that?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd how would I calculate the Ascending an Descending Nodes of two orbits (vessel and target). They are displayed in the map view. But I really have no idea where to find those values.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
