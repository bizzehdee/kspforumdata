Everything works great except the game clock. The scaled system has a 10 hour day and some apps like \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS adapt to the 10-hour day. My other fav apps - \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Alarm Clock (mod)\u0022\u003EKAC\u003C/abbr\u003E and TWP don\u0027t recognize it, so all the times shown in those two apps are wrong. It\u0027s happening because \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Alarm Clock (mod)\u0022\u003EKAC\u003C/abbr\u003E and TWP don\u0027t work with Kronometer...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EHow are others playing in scaled systems handling this issue with clocks being wrong?
