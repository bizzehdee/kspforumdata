The closest major to Aerospace is probably Mechanical Engineering, and there are a lot of mechanical engineers in the aerospace field. Do this now, while you\u0027re still a freshman and it\u0027s relatively easy to change majors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, go to a dedicated model and high-power rocketry forum like this one: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.rocketryforum.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.rocketryforum.com/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe KSP forums have a lot of rocketeers, but for shear number of knowledgeable members we can\u0027t beat a rocketry-specific community. If currently you know next to nothing it may be best not to mention the goal of reaching space, though. They get a LOT of \u0022I\u0027ve never built or flown anything before, now how exactly do I go to space?\u0022 type posts. People will take you a lot more seriously if you mention a smaller goal like Level 1 certification.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as access to materials goes, keep in mind that while up to a point rockets can be built cheaply with components like scrap mailing tubes and plywood, some components like motor cases, propellant reloads, and electronics, are very expensive. At certification level 3, costs will be several hundred dollars per flight, plus probably over a thousand for the rocket. An actual space shot will most likely have a budget well into the tens of thousands of dollars. It would be hard to get a college to pay for that - which is irrelevant because you\u0027ll almost certainly be out of college by the time you\u0027re ready for a project that size. It might be a good idea to consider various means of funding.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"-Velocity-","CreatedById":74097,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-23T14:32:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, you\u0027ll probably want an electrical engineer too. I did a lot of model rocketry when I was a kid but never progressed beyond G rocket motors. Other hobbies, the lack of launch sites, the high cost of motors (each launch of a G rocket costing like $15 IIRC), etc. all got in the way. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, with an electrical engineer you can integrate control systems and micro controllers into your rocket. As a simple example, there are a number of MEMS gyroscopes and MEMS IMUs (inertial measurement units) on the market right now. You can buy them for like $5 each. They come in surface mount packages, typically 4mm X 4mm X 1mm or smaller. So you could integrate them into a rocket and steer it to keep it vertical, or follow some profile. A more advanced version could use a full MEMS INS that flies the rocket back to the launch point. You could even include GPS guidance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Yes, I can think of a few issues- rocket motor vibrational/acoustic noise could excite the MEMS gyro at its mechanical resonance frequency and throw off its measurements; you might have to mount the electronics in sound absorbing material. Also, you would probably want to use a slow-burning rocket motor (they do make them for rocket-powered remote control model gliders) that didn\u0027t exert too many Gs on the MEMS components, otherwise they might bottom out. Also f you design the control system incorrectly for the rocket, it could also go dangerously out of control; you might want a radio-commanded abort system.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, once I finish my degree and get a house, I\u0027m looking forward to restarting rocketry myself; I\u0027ll need a nice garage or shed for a workshop and some oscilloscopes, power supplies, signal generators, etc. for the electronics. I\u0027ll have to be a little careful though; the same kind of stuff that could guide a model rocket could be used for nefarious purposes; if you published or sold any of your designs you could get the Feds breathing down your neck or worse yet, find yourself partly responsible for the deaths of innocents. I\u0027m not joking; sometimes you have to be careful about what you make and publish, even if your intentions are clearly and demonstrably noble or harmless. Supposedly a professor here had one of his student group\u0027s senior design project (a rail gun) taken away by Homeland security.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EANYWAY, I mention all of this because if you want a reasonably advanced and novel model rocketry effort, at least in terms of building high altitude instrumented rockets you\u0027ll need electronics, at the very least for staging and altitude measurements. Some of these electronics are already available, but if you really want to get serious, you\u0027ll need to design your own. Custom electronics wouldn\u0027t be necessary for your first rockets, but they would become increasingly useful as your designs advanced.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-23T14:38:39Z\u0022 title=\u002209/23/2014 02:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 23, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by |Velocity|\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xmaslightguy","CreatedById":75367,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-23T14:46:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you all of you for your advice so far!

But without any guidance or tracking system, if you want to recover your rocket, you don\u0027t have any choice but to handicap it like that. This is one of my main motivations for developing a guidance system- I want to launch rockets that go very high, very fast, and very far. I want the rockets to fly so high that the electronics must be heated \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
