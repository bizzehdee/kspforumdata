So after having read some on the forum, I\u0027m not the only one experiencing this. Others have come to the conclusion that if a flag is within viewing distance from your vessel, the game just tanks the framerate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo now my question is; How long are we going to have to wait for you to fix this, a problem that you introduced with the latest patch?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Flip665","CreatedById":104032,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-29T19:28:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot necessarily a flag issue._.
