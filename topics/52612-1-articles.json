Your Moho intercept burn should be occurring in Kerbin orbit, taking about 1750m/s of deltav to make an intercept (checking my savegame the next launch window for that deltav to Moho is about 20 days away). More fuel would be required for orbital burn, reentry etc so a 5000 m/s total deltav budget for the trip isn\u0027t particularly unrealistic. LV-N\u0027s (or addon parts with a similar ISP) are good for that kind of thing if you don\u0027t mind the low thrust to weight ratio \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LeFudge","CreatedById":74270,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-10T17:24:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s the extreme inclination... and it\u0027s proximity to Kerbol... and the lack of atmosphere...
