It was actually done by hand to learn all the techniques. Model made in sketchup (better suggestions for modeling welcome) with 4 side braces instead of 6. Texture made in paint.net using the layers then flattened down for the finish. The shading was actually done in Unity rather than blender because I couldn\u0027t get the smoothness from a normal map (my fault I suspect).
