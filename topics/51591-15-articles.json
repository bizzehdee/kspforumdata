Given that EC usage isn\u0027t monitored on relay vessels, a very viable solution to sending Science without worrying about EC running out is to just go on EVA and hit send. For example, I think I barely used 10 EC on EVA while transmitting a Munar surface sample via the capsules antenna whereas if I transmitted it directly from the capsule, I\u0027d run out of EC after like 5 packets had been sent (and both capsule and kerbal have 100 EC). Just some feedback on it because as a whole, I love the fact it\u0027s there, it makes things a lot more convenient. It just needs to be a bit more balanced and this is my suggestion. I\u0027m not saying it should be the same usage as kerbals have no solar panels or RTGs, just that it should take a large majority of the EC (maybe leave enough to transmit one EVA report or something?).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"toadicus","CreatedById":67745,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-31T17:18:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMeCripp\u003C/strong\u003E, looks like that answer is \u0022yes\u0022.

Back in the days of the first manned spaceflights, NASA was not dependent upon space-based infrastructure to talk to their pilots, but also had more than a 10 minute window to do so while they whizzed over Texas every hour or two. They used \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manned_Space_Flight_Network\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Esurface-based infrastructure\u003C/a\u003E to effect these early communications. The Apollo missions going all the way to the Moon also used surface-based infrastructure. IMO it\u0027s unreasonable to assume that the Kerbals do not have similar capacities even at the very start of a career save.\u003Cp\u003EWere I to add such a limitation, I probably would actually not allow any artificial point on Kerbin to act as a relay. Instead, I\u0027d require that an antenna be installed suitably close to KSC as \u0022the KSC relay\u0022, and thus require the player to develop every single point of communications infrastructure -- even the \u0022home base\u0022 antenna. But, IMO, that is not a fun or interesting requirement. Sending suborbital missions comprising an antenna on a parachute isn\u0027t challenging enough to be a fun task, and doesn\u0027t really contribute to the development of a meaningful skillset in terms of gameplay. If it\u0027s not well-founded in the \u0022reality\u0022 of the game world, isn\u0027t fun, and isn\u0027t educational, it\u0027s just busywork for its own sake.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI welcome discussion on this topic. Maybe there is a right way to make building a short range communications network in the early game a good addition!

Some people enjoy the relay option because it creates additional requirements and obstacles to overcome. Having an option that the relay must make it back to the KSC is just another level of obstacles that people like myself will enjoy. The KSC likely has antennas, there\u0027s no reason to complicate the idea. It\u0027s just a suggestion for one more level of precision. If you provide it, awesome.

By default, AntennaRange will not require line of sight, so a single communications satellite in low Munar orbit with an antenna big enough to talk back to Kerbin will provide a consistent connection for your rovers. At the Space Center, though, you can open up the AntennaRange config options (the icon is a little green satellite) and enable line of sight requirements, along with a handful of other options. I strongly recommend the line of sight option; it makes things much more realistic and at least a bit more fun. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wheffle","CreatedById":74893,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-06T22:48:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh!
