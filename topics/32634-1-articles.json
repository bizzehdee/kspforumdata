I built the rocket Scott Manley uses in his Minmus tutorial with a few additions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. ASAS with 4 RCS blocks right under the capsule separator. Good investment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Kerbal Engineer attached during construction just to see what the numbers looked like. Maybe I learned something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. MechJeb as a back-up to my seat-of-the-pants navigation, but mostly so I could get a 2nd opinion before I committed. Rather a mixed blessing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Stitched everything well up, which might have saved my bacon during the landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELift-off and initial transfer burn done by hand and all went well, but then I decided to see what MechJeb could do so I told it to refine my Minmus periapsis to 35km from the 150km I had already gotten myself. Oops! It put me in for a 3km periapsis. Egad, there are mountains taller than that. And of course I hadn\u0027t saved at all so far, and didn\u0027t want to waste fuel trying to solve this problem, so I took a deep breath and decided to see what happened. Maybe I\u0027d fly between the mountains and could do a gentle de-orbit burn on the other side.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs it happened, there was a big mountain in directly in the way so there was nothing for it but to land somehow, out in the hill country far from any of the flat areas I\u0027d been planning to land on. I had no idea how far I was above the ground so I killed almost all my horizontal velocity at about 10,000m and floated down vertically with the ASAS engaged in the minimal gravity, occasionally giving a blip of engine to keep the descent speed from getting about 50.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally I saw my shadow and for the 1st time realized how steep the hillside was, but there wasn\u0027t anything better anywhere around so a final blip and kill of the engine, and I was down. Then I waited for the lander to fall over. It sure looked like it was trying but it just kept flopping around while staying more or less upright. So I zoomed in from my shadow-watching distance to get a closer look.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI saw something I hadn\u0027t expected because I\u0027d never heard of it in any tutorial. The ship had only 1 leg touching the hillside, the rest in the air, and it was flopping around this single support, like a tied balloon in a breeze. I quickly deduced that this was because the ASAS was able to keep the ship pointed straight up (more or less) against the weak gravity. But EVA was out of the question because I figured the flopping ship would kick Jeb over the mountain as soon as he let go the ladder and I wasn\u0027t going home without planting a flag and taking pictures. Besides, taking off again looked chancy as well, so I had to do something. So, I used the roll keys to rotate the ship so 2 legs were touching the hill and 2 pointing downhill, turned off ASAS, let the ship fall over until all legs touched the ground, then quickly turned ASAS back on. This locked the ship perpendicular to the slope so it didn\u0027t fall over. It slid a few feet down the hill but finally came to a stop.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI waited a little while to see if it was stay there and then gave myself a pat on the back for cheating the reaper while making something of an emergency landing on my 1st attempt \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E. Then out came Jeb with the flag. In the pic below, you can see the hillside was about 35^ or so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.flickr.com/photos/39416639@N02/9027464832/in/photostream/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ehttp://www.flickr.com/photos/39416639@N02/9027464832/in/photostream/\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo now it was time to try to get home. I recalled from Scott\u0027s tutorial how you could lean over as soon as you left the ground on Minmus so I figured taking off under ASAS from the hillside was already a good start in that direction. But it also gave me a highly inclined orbit, so I came back to Kermin nearly over the pole. And I just came straight in without establishing an orbit, not wanting to push my fuel any more (only had about 1/4 tank left once I\u0027d established a highly elliptical Kermin orbit. Jeb experienced 24.8 Gs in the final descent, leaving white shockwaves behind the capsule after the fireworks of re-entry ended, but never completely stopped grinning, although he did look a bit worried. Still, he came home safe and sound and is ready for his next adventure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhew! Got that \u00221st landing\u0022 monkey off my back!

I know this trip was no big deal to even mediocre players but I\u0027m proud of it because it was my 1st.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suppose experienced players know all about the ASAS hillside trick I accidentally learned. Thus, I\u0027m wondering if you know the general parameters of where it will work on other bodies with different gravity. I suppose it might also depend on lander mass, hill steepness, etc. So is it limited to tiny landers on tiny rocks like Minmus or can you do it on Mun, say, with a bigger ship?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-13T01:46:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENicely done!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0022ASAS hill trick\u0022 is actually a new one for me, but that\u0027s mostly because I\u0027ve never actually tried landing on a steep slope if I could help it (and not necessarily because my landing site picking skillz are that good, mind you; I\u0027ve had to go all \u0022full throttle panic\u0022 for more hillside landings than I care to count \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E ).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd Minmus is definitely a great place for a beginner\u0027s landing.

I did try using the ASAS for some nifty tricks with rovers. This resulted in dead kerbals. As a general rule, I try to land in the flatest spots possible. I have had to ZOMGTHROTTLEUPHARD!!!! on even some minor hills. When I first started landing on Duna, hills were a concern. Since I play without mods, a parachute assisted landing on Duna has the tendency to place me in non-ideal locations. I actually used a couple extra landing gears in case I tipped over. Now I just use pretty wide gear setups. Hills scare me. When I landed on Ike, I was sweating bullets because the whole moon looks like a crumbled up mountain with very few flat places. It wasn\u0027t that bad though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jwenting","CreatedById":57735,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-13T10:08:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh, hilly Minmus.
