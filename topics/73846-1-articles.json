Serial staging is easy enough to handle, as is crossfeed/asparagus staging though it\u0027s more tedious, but for non-crossfeed core and booster setups you\u0027ll need to separately calculate how much fuel the core has used when the boosters separate. It also assumes constant specific impulse, which won\u0027t be the case when ascending through atmosphere, but launches tend to not be perfect anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo get the values from the game, the simplest methods are as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E, the specific impulse, can be read off the engine info in the VAB/SPH, or when the engine is running by right-clicking it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have different engines, the specific impulse used needs to be a weighted average. I\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s weighted by thrust or by fuel flow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Em\u003Csub\u003E0\u003C/sub\u003E, the initial mass, can be found in the map view during flight or in the tracking station. With the vessel focussed (used Backspace in the map view), open the information box on the right of the screen and you can read off the initial mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Em\u003Csub\u003E1\u003C/sub\u003E, the final mass, can be found by subtracting the fuel from the initial mass. You can use the resources panel with \u0022stage only\u0022 to read off how many units of fuel and oxidizer are available to the current stage, or if this doesn\u0027t work (or you want the delta-V you\u0027ll get from using a portion of your fuel) you can just right-click the relevant fuel tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, remember that 1 unit of either fuel or oxidizer weighs 5 kg, while 1 unit of monopropellant weighs 4 kg. Working out how much extra delta-V your RCS can give you is one of the main uses for doing the calculations manually, since most mods only consider main engines. (RCS specific impulse is 260 seconds).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-02T00:16:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, the rocket equation or using a mod.
