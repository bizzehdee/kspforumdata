Decided all was now right with the universe and updated a few mods I use and copied over my pinnacle of a save file (containing months of work). All was well as I fired up KSP, all flights still going strong. Checked in with 3 or 4 Kethane drillers diligently working away gathering the oh so great elixir for the multi-fuel conversion platforms I have floating in space. Decided to take a peek at one of the platforms. Did a Switch To and in all its glory, there it is......and 5 seconds later, the physics kick in and I get to witness the greatest and most detailed explosions I\u0027ve ever seen in KSP (thanks NVidia GTX 760!!!!). Ok, just a fluke I thought. Needless to say, after an hour of switching to each station or platform I have, they all have met with the same great fiery excitement of the first. WTH???? Decided to load one of the saved ship craft files. Looked beautiful in the VAB. Even better on the launch pad. Decided to not waste time with the launch and HyperEdited it in to orbit. About 5 seconds after displaying on the screen...yep...to oblivion!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMot sure why .90 doesn\u0027t like the .235 ships that are over 100\u002B parts, but at least it is consistent!! I\u0027d really rather not have to recreate everything from scratch. Has anyone seen anything like this or have an idea why the physics is tearing them apart in .90? I can build the ship from scratch in .90 and it works fine. But anything copied over from .235 gets obliterated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance!!!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"worir4","CreatedById":75980,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-09T18:12:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis happened to my space station =(\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suppose you are just best off starting from scratch and be prepared to do so until the final KSP release.
