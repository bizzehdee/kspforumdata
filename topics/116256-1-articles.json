Some of files have lost all of there tabs and are just a miss mash of information (i.e. the document is wide rather than long - if that makes any sense).\n\nAlso - it is only happening with Sub Assys and not other craft files.\n\nIs there something I am doing when downloading or copying over to my game save file that is doing this?\n\nOr is there a quick easy fix for this rather than manually editing the file to fix all the tabs (very time consuming)?\n\nAny help is appreciated.\n\nCheers,\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-18T19:04:50Z\u0022 title=\u002207/18/2015 07:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by frozenwatters**\n  \nAdded more Info"},{"CreatedByName":"ZLM-Master","CreatedById":185115,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-18T19:11:39Z","Content":"Yop !
