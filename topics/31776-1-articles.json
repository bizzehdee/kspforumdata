Even when you add things symmetrically, they sometimes group up as, say a bunch of 4 items in one icon, then sometimes they are 3 in one icon and one in another. It\u0027s arbitrary and happens with symmetrical additions sometimes. One thing I\u0027d like is if you could group icons of the same part kind (i.e. LF engines, SRBs, decouplers) together manually to fix this issue and also group stuff that wasn\u0027t added symmetrically, which I occasionally need to do.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HoY","CreatedById":57294,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-07T13:24:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor cases like you just mentioned, where there is one that just doesn\u0027t join the group\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt should, there\u0027s an easy fix. Lets pretend your working with 6 engines for this example. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo you place the 6 engines on the bottom of the tank closest to yourself, now staging shows a group of 5 and 1. If you mouse over the 1 engine in staging you will see the engine you placed highlight in the VAB. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the fix. Spin the camera around to the opposite engine, pick the opposite engine up and put it right back down so your 6 engines all appear. The staging will have changes from 5-1 to 6\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SuperFastJellyfish","CreatedById":57985,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-07T14:22:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Brok3n\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Brok3n\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m looking to consolidate my stage icons.
