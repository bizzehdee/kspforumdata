Since Duna isnt real its hard to make a scientific case, but Duna has a strong resemblance to Mars. On Mars (and Duna with the EVE Pack) huge sandstorms are covering large parts of the planet regularely. According to curiosity rover there are carbon based compounds found on mars, and i wouldnt see it much of a stretch to say that these are blown up into the athmosphere in smallish amounts. Very smallish maybe. Off course that could be yesterdays science tomorrow, and Duna isnt Mars 1:1. But from this (my) point of view this speaks for small amounts of karbonite to collect around duna orbit at 50-55km or so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs from the gameplay perspective... it depends how much you want to challenge (maybe frustrate) the player, in this case me again. From the planets we got, and if youre leaving the kerbin/mun system at all, duna seems to be one of the planets where a lot of gameplay happens. This is the place to be for bases, stations, supporting ressource networks and so on. And collectors imho. I had longtime bases on all capable planets, and there is imho only far away laythe as a close second for this kind of gameplay. With new biomes this will enhance a lot more of course.
