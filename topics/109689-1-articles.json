Then I proceeded to switch to my orbiting duna station, transmit the science that had built up. Switched to my orbiting Ike station, transmit science. Switched to Minmus station, transmit science. Switched to Mun station, realized I had no scientist there, no science to transmit, so I went back to space center. Checked out mission control, and no contracts - saved game and quit. I should not that after seing the contract fulfilled on the surface of duna, I never once hovered my mouse over the contracts tab in the UI.

Usually I am in system view and, suddenly, the  manuever nodes start running to infinite, or the view point starts behaving erratically, also running away to infinite. Whenever you notice strange things happening, just check your contracts, if they\u0027ve been \u0022cleaned\u0022 just don\u0027t svae the game and reload. If you already saved with empty contracts, go to last good game save, and copy the contract area, it is relatively easy to identify, and paste it on the current game file, ersing the new contract area. Takes a bit of time but it solves the problem. Never forget to keep multiple backup saves, of course."},{"CreatedByName":"Plusck","CreatedById":153264,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-22T23:43:32Z","Content":"I had the same problem a few months ago, and it was very much the same situation: orbits wonky, impossible to place nodes or get the \u0022switch to\u0022 box to come up, at which point I double-clicked or triple-clicked a ship to switch to it. Next time I looked at the contracts, they were all gone.\n\nAll I can suggest is: always make backups. If you\u0027re playing on hard difficulty, just switch to your OS and make a duplicate of persistent.sfs from time to time. Especially if things start looking odd, pause and make a copy of persistent.sfs before quitting back to the space centre or switching ships.\n\nAlso, although I can\u0027t really say for certain that this was the cause of the problem, don\u0027t try to \u0022force\u0022 a switch from one ship to another. If you can\u0027t get the box to show, go via the tracking station to be safe.\n\nOh and I too have a part listed as still being experimental. It hasn\u0027t adversely affected the game in the last few months though.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-22T23:46:33Z\u0022 title=\u002203/22/2016 11:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 22, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Plusck**"},{"CreatedByName":"Kuansenhama","CreatedById":114023,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-23T00:15:40Z","Content":"This happened to me awhile back.
