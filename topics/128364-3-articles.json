For every \u0022success\u0022 claimed by the U.N., I can name off an equal and possibly greater number of failures. Many of the upper levels of management in the United Nations is paid well above what their fellow countrymen make. Do not give me the line about them having more responsibility or more knowledge, or more risk than anyone else. It is a scam that seeks to dominate global political affairs. It will be the cause, as it has been in the recent past, of more wars than what it has served to avoid. Rwanda, Uganda, Ethiopia, Tibet, Lebanon, Croatia, Serbia, the Christian slaughter by ISIS have all seen the U.N. remarkably quiet without any real desire or goal to become involved. Now mention the Kyoto Accords, the Paris Accords, governance of the Internet, all of which will heavily tax the Western and industrialized nations of the world, and the U.N. immediately takes up ownership of the cause and prepares the coffers for the new taxes and fines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat drove World War I was the royal families of Prussia and Great Britain (the House of Windsor was originally the House of Hanover, a family with German lineage since King George I - long before WWI) were in constant competition for claims over the Benelux region. Both royal families sought to make various claims, then built up large militaries. While they did use nationalism to whip their societies into supporting the war, nationalism is simply one tool among many. What came next - the criminalization of opposition, the censorship of \u0022harmful\u0022 speech, the excessive regulation of the media to promote the host nation (which are contrary to pure nationalism where one thinks of their nation as the best and do their best to not cause harm to it), and then the series of secret treaties made with nearly every other European nation (under the guise of the enemy of my enemy is my ally) is what led to war.\u00A0 By the time of the assassination of Arch Duke Franz Ferdinand, all of Europe was divided between the House of Hanover or the House of Hohenstaufen. Again, this division was about two branches of Germanic nobility and had very little to do with nationalism.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe cult of the leader is more dangerous and is NOT nationalism. The cult of the leader allows the subject to overlook the leader\u0027s flaws where nationalism demands that leaders that fail the nation or fail the national standard be held accountable. The cult of the leader also causes fear within the opposition as they are deemed to be what\u0027s wrong with the nation, what\u0027s stopping progress, or any other thing the leader can sling at his/her opposition. Within U.S. history, nationalism led to the impeachment of Andrew Johnson. The American public rejected much of his political platform and theory; this empowered the Republican party to seek to oust him from the presidency. The cult of personality has been witnessed to some extend in four presidents: Grant, Wilson, FDR, and Obama. All four demonized their opposition, all four signed legislation that hampered free speech, and all four pressed beyond the bounds of their prescribed duties as president.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"saabstory88","CreatedById":110598,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-23T17:37:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222334186\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022128364\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221450887989\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002297649\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Apexazimuth\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Apexazimuth said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m a fan of SpaceX but I have to strongly disagree with the idea that they will be planting their flag on any planetary body first.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpaceX makes awesome rockets, but that\u0027s it. \u00A0There\u0027s a HUGE effort that must go into planning, training, preparation, and design of a mission that lands humans anywhere but earth.
