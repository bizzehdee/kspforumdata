While this is possible in real life, and in fact a telescope is planned for this specific orbit, it isn\u0027t in KSP. The reason is simple: KSP doesn\u0027t model more than one gravitational body acting on you at a time. You\u0027ve probably noticed this when you switch sphere of influence to another planet / body that you\u0027re acted on by that object\u0027s gravity only. It\u0027s not likely to be possible to do for a long time, either. This is due to two reasons:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. The L2 Lagrange point is unstable, it\u0027d have to have frequent small corrections made to its orbit to keep it there just like in real life. This would require some sort of mechanism to automatically control craft when you\u0027re elsewhere, which is troublesome due to the on-rails nature of KSPs engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. The most important reason is that increasing the number of gravitational bodies acting on your spacecraft would at least double the performance requirements of the physics engine. Even more importantly, it makes it so orbits aren\u0027t exactly predictable, so the on-rails system that saves so much performance power doesn\u0027t work again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry... =/\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes your telescope really have to have an eclipsing Kerbin?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-30T03:13:40Z\u0022 title=\u002206/30/2013 03:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 30, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by AceMgy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UmbralRaptor","CreatedById":2767,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-30T03:19:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe necessary orbit would be at the Kerbin-Kerbol L2 point.
