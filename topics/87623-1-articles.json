Twice now I\u0027ve launch a single manned pod into Kerbin Orbit. No problem getting there. Once I\u0027m done though and shut my engines off my final stage gradually starts a roll once thrust is gone... unless I compensate with MechJeb the roll will accelerate up to a maximum and just keep spinning. If I stop the craft from spinning and let go it starts up again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is not a \u0022My rocket is uncontrollable\u0022 problem. My rockets seem to work fine. I don\u0027t know if this is a problem with MechJeb or some other mod incompatibility. I\u0027ve never experienced this problem before and searching has only turned up threads dealing with uncontrollable rockets. This isn\u0027t that. The only way I can describe whats happening is that it seems like once I\u0027m out of the atmosphere my space craft start rotating in one direction, accelerating unless I manual stop it (which is hard) or use MechJeb SSAS kill Rotation. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese are the mods I currently have installed: Blizzy\u0027s ToolBar, AntennaRange, Chatterer, DaedlyReentry, DistandObjects, EVE(with Astronomer\u0027s Oblivion pack), FASA launch clamps, HGR (HomeGrownRockets), HotRockets, IFILifeSupport, KAS, KerbalJointReinforcement, KSOS, MechJeb2, PlanetShien, Procedural Wings, Procedural Fairings, RasterPropMonitor, RealChutes, SCANsat, SmokeScreen, StockDragFix, StageRecovery, TextureReplacer, and UniversalStorage. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anyone has seen this bug or knows what causes it, I would be very grateful for any help.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Axelord FTW","CreatedById":1896,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-17T07:38:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWith all those mods, I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if the culprit was among them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut here\u0027s something that happened to me one. I too had a phantom force forcing one of my craft to rotate.
