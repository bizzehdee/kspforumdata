I have a question for you. I want to make a tutorial that runs through a limited part count build and then fly it. When the flight is done I would like the tutorial to automatically reset to the building part. One more thing, it could also be a secenario, I don\u0027t care either way. Thanks everyone for your help!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T14:20:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome aboard \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, by \u0022tutuorial\u0022 and \u0022scenario\u0022, are you talking about making something like those provided with the game, complete with pop-ups explaining what\u0027s going on? I\u0027ve never tried to do that so have no idea. There isn\u0027t a \u0022scenario editor\u0022 per se in the game AFAIK.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut now you\u0027ve got me curious so I\u0027m poking around in the files.... OK, the stock tutorials are in saves\\training. This folder has a (tutorial_name).sfs file for each tutorial. It also has a subfolder called \u0022Banners\u0022 with the thumbnail pics for all the tutorials, and each tutorial has its own subfolder as well containing a persistent.sfs file like with any of your own saved games, defining what\u0027s in play already. And that\u0027s it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo it looks fairly straightforward. You start a normal career game and advance it to the point you want, then save it. This will get you the persistent.sfs file. You then need to create a saves\\training\\(tutorial_name) folder and copy your persistent.sfs file there. And take a screenshot, edit it to size and shape, and put it (appropriately named) in the \\saves\\training\\banners folder. That just leaves making the (tutorial_name).sfs file that goes in the \\saves\\training folder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoing this latter task doesn\u0027t seem too hard. None of these files are very big and you could probably start by renaming a copy of one of the existing files, then tweaking it. There are a number of variables in there that I have no idea what they do, or what the effects of changing them would be, but you should be able to figure most of them out with a bit of experimenting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I have no idea if any of this will actually work, never having done it myself. But that might get you started.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RJ9955hi","CreatedById":144142,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T00:26:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks, Geschosskopf. I appreciate your help! I wanted to know how I could modify the persistent.sfs file to the rules I wanted, but have the person doing the scenario actually build their own rocket. I\u0027m thinking maybe I could make the scenario have a limited price build and a set objective that restarts the scenario when done. Thanks again!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
