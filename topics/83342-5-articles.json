The situation I find myself in with KCT is reusable SPH builds ... planes. If I build a plane and land *safely* I should be able to reuse that same craft again. As it is, I have to wait for a new craft because KCT requires a complete rebuild. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs forsaken pointed out, KCT already has this taken care of. The whole point of the part inventory is reusable spacecraft/planes take virtually no time to \u0022rebuild\u0022 since they just need a little bit of repair.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do plan on taking this one step further and give the option to put the same craft out there with a further reduction in build time when you recover. I have some logistical issues with how editing a vessel works to figure out, otherwise I may disable editing the ship if you do that (since in some cases it recalculates the build time, which wouldn\u0027t be right given those parts with the further reduction in time). Note that this would put the EXACT same craft you recover, but with fuel filled up. If you break a part off, you\u0027d have to go into the editor to launch a new one.

I\u0027m not sure that KCT\u0027s Launch function works with KerbTown either. I do plan on trying to support it in the future, but I can\u0027t make any promises on that being any time soon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do want to take some time to do a bit more with simulations. In the near future I plan on making it so you can start them at any in-game time. So if you want to test your interplanetary stage on a Duna transfer, you can set the time to when the Duna transfer window is open and do the test directly. Want to test around the time the vessel will actually be finished? You could do that then (in fact, I plan on setting the default when changing the time to when the vessel will finish. Otherwise the default will be \u0022Now\u0022).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d also like to make it so you can start landed on any body you\u0027ve landed on. Ideally you\u0027d go into map mode and click on the location and then it\u0027d start you there. That won\u0027t be easy and will probably take me quite some time to get working properly, so that might be a whole update by itself.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Empiro","CreatedById":112072,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-12T19:23:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEven further reductions for space planes would be great.

My SSTO, the Sirius C, is a god send. I also just swap out payloads (like a minmus probe or an ion engine to test in orbit. It\u0027s also great for the \u0022Rescue a Kerbal\u0022 missions). Reusing just the craft itself takes only 2 days to build. A brand new one takes over 80. I end up spending about 30 days just adding a payload. Honestly, reducing the time for the vessel itself while adding a payload makes almost no difference. It might shorten the time by a day at most in this instance. With the defaults I\u0027ll have to do some testing. It may just be that when you want to add a payload you have to send it back to the SPH and \u0022build\u0022 it but if you want to send it out as-is you can do so very quickly (literally no repairs will be done. For instance, parachutes may not be repacked).

I have seen this before and have meant to bring it up in the VOID thread since I\u0027m not entirely sure what exactly KCT is doing that causes VOID to do that.

Unfortunately I can\u0027t do that on my end but it should be simple for the VOID developer to fix.

You\u0027ll be able to recover and refuel, but likely won\u0027t be able to add any parts to the vessel (so no new payloads). I haven\u0027t finalized anything on it though, so I may be able to come up with something that allows you to add parts as well. I had originally planned on making the EXACT vessel (plus fuel) be put out immediately, but I might be able to force you into the SPH/VAB to make any changes and forbid editing afterward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpeaking of funds, with the next update there will be a radical change to how funds work (as a result of integration into the Scrapyard API/developing a common base with Kerbal 4X). You no longer will receive funds for recovering vessels but only pay once for a part. Once it\u0027s in the inventory you never have to pay for it again. You\u0027ll also be able to sell parts. Oh, this also includes Fuel and other resources. So basically we (SiriusSam and I) are rewriting how Stock does recovery.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the second suggestion: Just prebuild your subassemblies, then Scrap them or edit them to add the payload/launcher. I do this all the time. Just build your payload (you can load subassemblies in the editor), scrap it so the parts are in the inventory, and then add that subassembly to whatever rocket/plane you want. Especially now that editing supports using inventory parts (until the 1.0 release you had to use exclusively brand new parts). People always ask for this because they don\u0027t realize that the inventory system was designed around doing this \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust remember that it\u0027s always more efficient to build everything at once (because of the square root in the BP calculation), so you shouldn\u0027t build the plane and the payload separately (exception: if you have two build rates and aren\u0027t using them for anything else, then building them separately is actually faster). If your plane is out doing other missions though, building the payload is worth it if it\u0027s gonna be a while before it\u0027s back (or if you need to use the plane for something else while the payload builds, like a \u0022Rescue a Kerbal\u0022 contract or another payload that\u0027s finished).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jacke","CreatedById":103694,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-19T06:00:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd toadicus already has a fix out. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022toadicus\u0022 data-cite=\u0022toadicus\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EGive \u003Ca href=\u0022http://ksp.hawkbats.com/dev/VOID.dll\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis development DLL\u003C/a\u003E a try and see if it solves the problem.
