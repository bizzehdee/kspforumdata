For the majority of the game, you are limited to a few possible engines for a given payload size, unless you duplicate small ones (expensive), or throttle down an overpowered one. If I happen to hit JUST the right TWR, I\u0027ll pin the throttle, but it\u0027s always based on the speed in lower atmo. Generally 250 m/s below 10k m, 550 until 35k, then floor it. Anything faster just leads to flips with even the simplest rocket designs. This is probably due to the capsules/payloads being too light for the rocket, but such is KSP. \u003Cp\u003EYes, I\u0027m aware of how to use fins to help, but these are essentially putting a brake on the entire rocket, wasting fuel, when you could just as easily slow down.

Fins add control authority as well if you use the right ones, and why worry about the added drag if you are throttling down anyways then you have the power to compensate. In real life, they have to be cautious about the effects of g forces on people and equipment, we don\u0027t need to worry about that. The way I look at it, my time is more important than fuel efficiency, and why go slow and spend more time in the thick atmosphere? I also usually use srb first to gain altitude before igniting main engine for better ISP. My gravity turns also start immediately off the pad.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Clipperride","CreatedById":149816,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-02T18:54:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo many methods for getting into orbit.

It is just an elliptic orbit with you getting 1g of radial acceleration at Ap (orbital velocity equal to surface).

Drag will sap around 600 m/s on a good rocket ascent! That\u0027s more than any reasonable cosine loss. When you GTFO of the low atmo like that, you tend to be on an overly high gravity turn trajectory. You want to reduce TWR so that your trajectory allows you to circularize your orbit without losing much speed from coasting.
