My technique is to push it with the grabber in free pivot mode, and \u0022herd\u0022 the center of mass to keep it on the maneuver node. It works but it\u0027s just really painstaking. I first tried a puller with massive arms but they weren\u0027t massive enough, though maybe they could be if I put them on the far end from the grabber and angled them outwards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what techniques are you guys using?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-04T16:40:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile I have not been able to put theory to practice (The next \u0027roid is 12 days away) I have the idea to use the KAS winches and attach points to pull the asteroid wherever I need it to go.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Th1rt3en","CreatedById":97264,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-04T16:49:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI used a similar technique of free motion and locking it square on the center of mass. Additionally, I built a ship that has 4 RCS grabbers just off the top (Claw, 2 medium RCS tanks, remote control core and 4 RCS ports. I come up on an asteroid, impale it with a couple of the RCS pods and then attach the main tug and align. Even with it a little off, the RCS will keep it aligned during burns and makes turning the thing much easier. Once attached, it sees the whole thing as one big ship and will use the RCS pods as needed as you can see from a couple pictures I took the other day.
