Absolutely yes. But since that wont happen and we have to live with the KSP 2 we are getting lets at make the game run fine enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe devs are really focused on finding the perfect solution to the wobbly rockets, but while they are using time on that the current state of the game is suffering strongly. Its time to be realistic and find a temporary solution.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI propose that a slider be added to the options menu where we can add rocket stiffness, let it go from 1x (default) to 20x or whatever no wobbly is. If its not too hard it could also be fun to let us set the slider to less than 1x and have absolute noodles just for the fun of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-10-01T01:10:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-10-01T12:35:30Z\u0022 title=\u002210/01/2023 12:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Oct 1\u0022\u003EOctober 1, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Superfluous J\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EBecause I can\u0026#039;t delete :)\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mikki","CreatedById":137508,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-10-01T07:44:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you look closely there is an option \u0022Unbreakable Joints\u0022\u00A0\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kdaviper","CreatedById":229094,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-10-01T09:45:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn order to have a custom engine from the ground up, you would first have to make the engine.
