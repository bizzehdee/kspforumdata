I have to hover my mouse over closest intersection to see the distance, then i have to slightly modify the manouvernode to see if this brings it closer or further apart, and move my mouse over to the closest intersection to check if im on the right track.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is not only for docking, but for doing things like reduce Pe when aiming at a body far away from Kerbin. I dont want to stretch the manouver node, and then hover my mouse to see if i did it correctly, i want to stretch the manouver node and immideatly know if im modifying the orbit correctly. I dont even know if there is a stock feature that toggles this hover option on and off (i wish it was), but i am curious if there are any mods out there that does this little useful thing for me?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts not easy to explain it clearly, so i can provide some pictures if you are having troubles understanding what im talking about \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"amorymeltzer","CreatedById":111542,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T16:44:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/18230\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKerbal Engineer Redux\u003C/a\u003E has the functionality you want... and then some.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Valkyria90","CreatedById":81931,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T17:09:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI already use Kerbal Engineer Redux, but i can honestly say i have never seen this option \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_ohmy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022:o\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnder which menu can i find this option?
