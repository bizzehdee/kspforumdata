No RTG\u0027s. As misfortune would have it, night was descending on the sea where my base is, so I had to land in the dark. As I approached, my batteries were getting critically low, down to about 1/5th capacity, so it was going to be a little bit tight. The sun was on the other side of minmus, but the solar panels were extended anyway. when I got to around 150m, suddenly the charge in my batteries raced up to 100%.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy only (according to real world physics) theory is that the reflected light from the frozen sea, that is, light from other stars and perhaps the Mun was reflecting off the ice and into the panels, which are pointing straight down. Their current exposure is 0.99, despite it being night time. I guess it\u0027s possible that minmus could be generating an electric charge by induction, if it had a strange metal core, but even in that case, I\u0027ve got no receiving core on my lander, except perhaps, the electric motor stators in my wheels, but that\u0027s a bit far fetched.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what\u0027s the deal?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johnno","CreatedById":67618,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-10T04:07:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESwamp gas reflecting the light from Jool.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Invincible Walnut","CreatedById":78210,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-10T04:11:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKerben\u0027s second moon might be one giant battery.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"painking","CreatedById":69085,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-10T04:12:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPossibly A terrain bug.
