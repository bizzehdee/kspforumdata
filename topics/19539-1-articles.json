I\u0027m eelikay. I\u0027m somewhat new to KSP. But after messing around with building ships and flying other peoples ships, I eventually started to seriously design my own orbiter rocket. It started with the \u0022A-1 Orbiter\u0022 design. Small changes here and there led to the \u0022A-5 Orbiter\u0022. Now at this point I still couldn\u0027t make it to a stable orbit and the rocket itself was very unstable. Then a big overhaul in the design dealt with the instability (This one was thus named the \u0022B-1 Orbiter\u0022) but I still couldn\u0027t get the rocket to orbit. It was an issue with fuel. So I made some small changes in the design and voila I ended up with the \u0022B-2 Orbiter\u0022. This model was capable of making it to orbit AND safely returning home. So that is the story of the Orbiter class.
