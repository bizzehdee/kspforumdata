She hops on a bus, and acciddentally ends up in the heart of the fighting: River City, the city that\u0027s split in 2 (Again, by the massive river). It\u0027s all still a work in progress, but I think that with some work it could maybe turn into something.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOK... my turn. I\u0027ll be honest, I\u00A0see both good, and not so good.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot so good, first. The terms\u00A0National States of Owlia and\u00A0United States of Owlia... too real life... I\u0027m afraid United States especially might cause problems down the road.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow... what I really, really like is the idea of River City itself... a city divided by a civil war. Not a country, or nation... but an actual city, split in half... talk about a gritty way of playing on the \u0022Brother vs. Brother\u0022 idea... this is good!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf it were me, I would forget about the nations, and focus more on just this... a city torn in half... friend vs. friend, brother vs. brother... neighbors now shooting back and forth across narrower parts of the river...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd don\u0027t even get me started on... bridges....\u00A0\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:0.0:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_shocked.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:0.0:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think it could really work!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
