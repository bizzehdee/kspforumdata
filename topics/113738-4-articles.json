Long may this continue.\n\nKSP has a LOT of bugs\n\nKSP is in continuous development and is constantly having bugs fixed. \n\nKSP is becoming available on multiple platforms. The developers can\u0027t possibly be getting the income that they once were from PC owners and so must be praised in their decision to continue KSP on other platforms. This will of course keep the Developer\u0027s love for KSP alive and keep KSP on PC alive.\n\nKSP has a huge player base now. That play base is still growing. I know a couple of people who are only just starting their KSP journey.\n\nI am still afraid to start another major playthrough. I want to build bases on other planets. I want to build so many more different types of rover. I want to have a station in orbit and a mining base on Eeloo\n\nI\u0027m afraid because of potential bugs in the existing version and because future updates may curtail a game I have in development.\n\nI\u0027ve been afraid to start a new game since 1.0.\n\nBut I miss playing.\n\nI miss the feeling of having a mission just beginning. The planning. The prototype building. Thinking that the mission ahead is too simple. Need a little more complexity and designing into my mission a little complexity which will be scary and fun.\n\nI miss the feeling of the mission objective achieved. So far from home.\n\nI miss the feeling of a successful return to Kerbin. Everyone safe and sound.\n\nSo many things that I still haven\u0027t done after so many hours of play.\n\nDone it on The Mun, done it on Mimnus now I want to see if I can fly a mission to Lathe, dock in orbit, land and return, all from IVA.\n\nI miss space planes. I want to build another. Not for Lathe, done that. but one that can pick up several stranded kerbonauts in one launch and return them safely back to kerbin.\n\nI normally play with mods, like Chatterer, Engineer, Environmental Visual Enhancements, RasterPropMonitor and Life Support.\n\nI like to build my ships with vanilla parts so that they might still be good to play with or re-engineer in future games. Modded parts can be changed or discontinued and not be up to date with the current version.\n\nHaving said that, I enjoy playing with Magic Smoke Industries Infernal Robotics and many other part heavy mods but I never think of any saved vessels as keepers.\n\nThe thing I really don\u0027t like is the pissing and moaning. PIssing and moaning because there hasn\u0027t been an update yet. Pissing and moaning because there has been an update.\n\nPissing and moaning because such and such is STILL broken! and everything done in the current update didn\u0027t include it.\n\nPissing and moaning that it might not be done in the next update either, because the Developers are concentrating on getting KSP working on the Latest version of UNITY.\n\nI love KSP and I want the developers to keep loving KSP and that any love that they might have lost over the years be reinforced.\n\nKSP is different. So wonderfully different. \n\nTo finish, I\u0027m going to start a new game. \n\nI will build a munbase. (got to have an Alpha)\n\nI will build a minmusbase (beta maybe?)\n\nI will build a bases on every world with docking land vehicles (Not grabbing ones) and a Space Station Refinery. (the kerbals I send to Eve may never return. I just have to make the base so good that they wouldn\u0027t want to.)\n\nIf while I am halfway through my odyssey you Developers feel the need to change something which will make all my work unusable then please proceed. Please go ahead and break my games. I had fun building them not from them being built. If you make it more. If you make it better. I for one will not be pissing and moaning.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-23T14:57:38Z\u0022 title=\u002206/23/2015 02:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Daveroski**\n  \nTypo"},{"CreatedByName":"steve_v","CreatedById":69272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T15:00:56Z","Content":"How about some \u0022pissing and moaning\u0022 because the latest patch doesn\u0027t fix the worst of the old bugs, and introduces a bunch of new ones?\n\nI\u0027ve been playing 1.0.3 for less than 2 hours: I\u0027ve already had to hand edit my save, and I\u0027ve already encountered a brand new bug in the brand new thermal system.

Although I know other capsules can re-enter and not burn up it felt wrong so I only ever use the pods. What I\u0027ve not been bothering with is the heatshields since they seemed completely unnecessary to me in 1.0.2, so I simply assumed the pods had inbuilt heatshielding.

If not I will wait a bit until I\u0027ve used the ones currently in orbit and replaced them with heatshielded versions.\n\nI do wish that rovers were more useful, got mine to Duna last night and after about 30 mins of crashing, getting bored at crawling along, crashing more...
