I would imagine the scheduling would have been way different if Apollo 1 had launched as planned... The first manned mission would have been 1 instead of 7. Would the lunar landing have been earlier than 11? If so, how much earlier?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mikegarrison","CreatedById":137807,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-12-02T09:32:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not sure it actually changed the schedule very much.
