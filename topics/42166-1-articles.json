At the opposite side of the orbit from your landing zone burn retrograde to place the Pe a few km over the LZ and coast. When you get to the Pe perform another retroburn, use the velocity indicator above the navball in surface mode (change between surface/orbit/target mode by clicking it) and kill the relative surface velocity. Next point radial (up, away from the surface), you can either slow down gradually or perform a suicide burn at low altitude.
