A corrugated tank would swell like a balloon under pressure, especially on upper stages that operate in thin or negligible atmosphere. The interstage only has to resist forces in the thrust direction so the lighter ribbed structure is better. A tank has to be strong for those compressive forces and the tension forces of the internal pressure they contain, so a cylinder is stronger in the right directions per unit mass.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheShadow1138","CreatedById":53694,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-06T02:39:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Camacha\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Camacha\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESure.

So these sections are where most of the mass for the stage is concentrated allowing them to build them with smooth skins while the sections between, and/or at either end of the stage, and the interstages are shells, with no top or bottom, where conserving mass would be easier to accomplish. Thus it would be these sections where the stringers, or ribs, would be a better choice for lightweight, but strong structural sections. It may be because building the tanks as the interstages are built would mean that they would not be strong enough. We have to remember that the tanks endure radially outward forces exerted by the expanding fuel and oxidizer as well as longitudinal forces during flight whereas the interstages, intertanks, and fore and aft skirt assemblies only have to cope with longitudinal forces during flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, I may be farther off base than I believe I am, so someone feel free to correct me if I am incorrect.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
