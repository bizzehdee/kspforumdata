We\u0027re still working out how to customize certain aspects, most notably the size of the embed, but it\u0027s all looking smooth so far. Let me know if there\u0027s any problem with the albums. \n\nHere\u0027s an example of the new embed, it works just like the old one and all existing albums will now also show up in this format.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
