Same with engine power. It\u0027s not the fastest plane but sticking another engine on the back would mean it could barely lift withotu another vtol engine, which would make it wider etc. You get the idea. It\u0027s this im trying to improve in version 3."},{"CreatedByName":"spudman2","CreatedById":84199,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T21:45:14Z","Content":"Smexy!
