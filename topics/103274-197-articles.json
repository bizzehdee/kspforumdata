I might just do that my self lol. Also I think once it\u0027s offically out, being as the demo will also be 1.0, I\u0027ll likely post it on my FB (separate from the \u0022OMG 1.0 is here\u0022 post lol).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a side note, another thing I just thought of (which also might have been mentioned already) it would be neat if Squad had an app that would generate notifications right as the game is officially released.
