This is my story of my first ever attempt at a full scale Duna mission on career. Actually, it\u0027s my first attempt ever. And I wanted to show it in a book like, RP story. I\u0027ve seen other missions like this, and have always wanted to do one of my own. As seen below, segments will be put into chapters, for convenience, since this is going to be a long story. Also, each chapter will come when it\u0027s good and ready, so if a certain chapter takes a while, just try to be patient and I\u0027ll get it out soon. So, without further ado, let\u0027s get this party started! To start, we\u0027ll go from a Prologue and work our way to present time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:24px;\u0022\u003EOperation: Red Rust, Chapter 0: Prologue\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/c1huhXz.png?1\u0022 alt=\u0022c1huhXz.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003ETime: Year 2, day 300 since the founding of the Kerbal Space Program. In that time, the KSP has made many successful missions involving space stations, landing, and colonies. However, there has yet to be any Kerbal to have gone farther than Kerbin\u0027s SOI. With the technology available at the time, the people down at the Kerbal Space Center didn\u0027t dare take the risk. But, with new advancements in tech, and more confidence on bringing kerbals back alive, they\u0027re in the middle of the plans to land a team of kerbals on a whole other planet. After some debate, it was decided that the best planet for this mission would be Duna. With a launch window about a year away, the KSC team has already gotten to work. They have named this mission \u0022Operation: Red Rust\u0022 after the red iron-oxide surface of the planet.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThe plan was to send 7 kerbals to the planet, have 5 on the surface and 2 in a space station. The kerbonauts for the mission were chosen long before a planet was specified, but some of them had been flown to either the IKSS (International Kerbin Space Station), Mun Station or Mun Colony and are now unable to join the mission. So, in light of the public announcement of Operation: Red Rust, and a schedule to start keeping track of, a few new kerbals had been chosen to take their places. The final list of kerbals is:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBill Kerman.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E Role: Mission leader. Bill wasn\u0027t exactly too excited when he heard he would be chosen as mission leader, but he accepted anyways. He later comments, \u0022I think it\u0027s because I\u0027m on of the \u0027original three,\u0027 whatever that means.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPatsby Kerman.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E Role: Lead scientist.

Dudcott wasn\u0027t too exited at first, saying he just got back from the Mun, but he wanted to be the first to study up close rocks from anther planet.

To specify each role of each kerbal, a special spacecraft had to be constructed, one that hasn\u0027t been done before.

The core consists of a 3-man command pod, hitchhiker container, 6 nuke rockets, escape pods, and plenty of docking ports. 4 Kerbals will be in it during takeoff: Bill, Corbus, Patsby, and Alner. Bob Kerman was accompanying them as they went to the rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlner: \u0022C\u0027mon, Bill!

Just let me have my seat alone in the hitchhiker.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter everyone else got into the rocket, Bill and Bob had a quick chat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob: \u0022So, leaving for Duna, huh? Must be tough to be leaving this place for a while.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill: \u0022Yeah, I try not to think about it.

Something to note is that the shuttle and refueling station won\u0027t come until a few IG weeks after the core and gas station arrive.

Anyways, we preformed the aero break successfully. Heading out of the atmosphere, we have a nice moon rise of Ike in the distance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qWa3qDC.png?1\u0022 alt=\u0022qWa3qDC.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESoon after, the core was in a stable, circular orbit around Duna. Now, it\u0027s time to get serious.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, the plan was when the Core got into a stable orbit, the first thing that would be sent down was the Sandstorm. It would fly over and try to pick out a good spot for a base. After that, it will try to land at or near the location. The chosen pilot was Alner Kerman. However, since he\u0027s had his nightmares, he\u0027s been very nervous about it. Even now, as he\u0027s preparing to leave, he\u0027s doing his best not to show it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill: \u0022Ok, Alner.

I\u0027m so stoked!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill: \u0022Now, you know the planned landing site. Make sure to choose the best spot.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlner: \u0022Oh, yeah. I got it. No problem.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore leaving, Mitrim stopped Alner.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlner: ..?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMitrim: \u0022I know you\u0027re feeling nervous.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlner: \u0022Wha- no!

How\u0027d you know?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMitrim: \u0022In case you didn\u0027t notice, I\u0027m a doctor. Anyways, you have no need to be nervous. You\u0027ll land that thing like a pro.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlner: \u0022I only hope so...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlner then started the slow float to the Sandstorm.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FJHt8m8.png?1\u0022 alt=\u0022FJHt8m8.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, he boarded the sandstorm, and Bill undocked the 2 ships. Alner carefully backed up. All the while, Ike looms in the distance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qM1Dfzf.png?1\u0022 alt=\u0022qM1Dfzf.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill: \u0022Remember, use your RCS to deorbit to save fuel for flying.

So far so good, he thought.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, his dream that he had in the ship had started to become a reality. The radio came on, with someone trying to communicate. Then, like in the dream, he started to loose control.
