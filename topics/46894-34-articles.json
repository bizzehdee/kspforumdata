Come .24 with the economic aspects, and you suddenly have an incentive to not always use the best possible parts - because they will cost more. And after people run out of cash for the first time because they built something unnecessarily over-engineered and then screwed up their launch a few times because the staging is wrong or they forgot to hit T, they\u0027ll gain a heightened awareness for previously underutilized parts. Suddenly that other engine with 10% less Isp starts looking great if it only costs half as much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs such, if mods require rebalancing, then I\u0027d wait until .24 if I were the author.
