As 1.0.5 is working pretty well, there\u0026#39;s no pressure to fix something quick. So, take as much time as you need, and then take some more.

I typically end up doing quadrillions (ok, I might be exaggerating here, but only slightly) of part testing contracts early in the game although they start to get boring pretty soon, simply because most of them can be done with extremely cheap unmanned crafts, but still pay out a nice amount of funds. If now the frequency with which other contract types are being shown decreases too much, it might become a very frustrating experience once one does no longer need to rely on part testing contracts to survive financially.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSomeone suggested in this thread that it\u0026#39;d be nice to have some way to influence what kinds of contracts show up, by defining goals for the space program.
