Stop with this \u0022think of it with timewarping, it\u0027s op, that\u0027s will be exploited a lot\u0022 thing!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sick of this! That\u0027s not an excuse to not do this! There are several way to make it working time depending and not exploit it, for example placing a science cap like any other experiments, make the process slower as the time pass to a point that is near 0, apply some heavy rescource needs like 50 electricity/sec in order to work or a totally new resource that the station need to be resupplied constantly in order to function like instruments, test subject, new materials for testing, and so on... Timewarping is op is not an excuse, u just need to be creative. Space labs imo have the potential to even rework how technology is resarched. With contracts is easy to setup a mission to \u0022bring this cargo module containing this new gigantor solar panel to a space station lab and test it until u apply 100 science to it in order to unlock it\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"allmappedout","CreatedById":57281,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-07T11:51:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat would be much, much better, would be you fly experiments up to a space station and perform them, but they can only be performed on a space station module (ie: the big science lab). Each experiment gives you a fixed amount of science, but it is a one-shot thing, and there\u0027s a cost/weight/difficulty built into each one so that they can\u0027t all be run straight away to just max the skill tree. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s how science works in real life, and it makes sense, particularly with contracts and the proposed interchangability of money and science.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
