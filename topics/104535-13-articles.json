The old message used to just mention directly, but a lot of players took this to meaning that adding a truss between the robotics part and docking port would be fine (since it wouldn\u0027t be directly connected any more). This would still cause problems, hence indirectly being added to the warning."},{"CreatedByName":"Demuder","CreatedById":144165,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T14:34:33Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E IR parts can freely be used on craft with docking ports, but as you noted, you should avoid having a docking port at the end of a robot arm.

The grabbing arm is a special type of docking part, right? (Similarly for the winches in KAS/KIS)? Does it count for this warning?\n\n2. Is this specifically about moving docked ships around attached with docking ports? As you have stated it is not the presence of the IR parts, just if you use then in conjuncture with a docking port. So can we have extendable, adjustable docking port that is locked and never used while docked?\n\nHalf of the IR designs I have seen have a docking port being attached to some IR parts.\n\nAnd a more general question. Any links to design ideas? Really cool mod, but I am just drawing a blank on how to use them. A walker is cool, tho probably not as practical as wheels. Was that lander using engines attached to some sort of rotators? Now that is cool (tho I am surprised they do not flop around or rip off).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-06T00:45:21Z\u0022 title=\u002206/06/2015 12:45  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by wisnoskij**"},{"CreatedByName":"Master Tao","CreatedById":110410,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T20:46:19Z","Content":"That depends on whether you mean the stock [Advanced Grabbing Unit](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Advanced_Grabbing_Unit) or the Grabber from ZodiusInfuser\u0027s [IR Rework](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/65365). The AGU functions as a single-sided docking port, merging two craft in flight, and it does cause problems with robotics parts.

The parts slowly move away from each other and then if I stop the time warp things stay the way they were. My stream from Saturday night can show the failures involved with this. For some reason when the parts started to seperate then i tried to fly the vehicle in space, everything just started wobbling like a Wii character and nothing I did could stop the harmonics...they all seemed to build off each other and it built in strength the longer the vessel flew.
