As you probably expected, we love video games here at the KSP HQ and today we celebrate because it is the 34th anniversary of the Japanese release of the classic arcade platformer \u003Ci\u003EMario Buraz\u0101zu\u003C/i\u003E, also known as\u003Ci\u003E Mario Bros.\u003C/i\u003E The game, developed by legends Shigeru Miyamoto and Gunpei Yokoi, is one of the first platform games ever created, along with \u003Ci\u003EDonkey Kong\u003C/i\u003E. It also introduced Mario\u2019s brother, Luigi, who was created for the multiplayer mode by doing a palette swap of Mario. Similarly, the game brought up several elements that were later adopted by its successors, such as the \u201CPOW\u201D blocks and the Shellcreepers, the conceptual ancestors of the Koopa Troopas. The game came out in the same year as the North American video game crash of 1983, so it wasn\u2019t a major success there, but its modest success in the Japanese arcades was enough for the company to continue with what is today the most recognizable franchise in video game history. To date, \u003Ci\u003EMario Bros.\u003C/i\u003E has been released for more than a dozen platforms and is considered as one of the most memorable arcade classics. But after this small homage, let\u2019s move on to KSP and the development progress.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe QA team has been busy \u003Cb\u003Etesting fixes and improvements for the 1.3.1 patch\u003C/b\u003E, looking for more candidates for inclusion from the public reports, and of course giving the whole thing a thorough workout. In their search for issues they\u2019ve been using forum posts as clues, trying to find unreported bugs in 1.3.0 to get fixed for the upcoming patch. Meanwhile the devs worked on completing the localization of tutorials and scenarios for 1.3.1 and QA have begun the process of putting them through their paces in each of the languages.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cb\u003EConsole testing is again very much in our purview\u003C/b\u003E, so together with the external test team, intensive testing has produced a wealth of reports and feedback for the developers. It is difficult to divulge just how far along the process is, but for those of you that are concerned, we can say that things are looking good. We are aware that you are keen to see the results, and we\u2019re excited about the progress. Please bear with us while we endeavor to polish and resolve the obscure edge cases which on consoles can be so unforgiving and equally difficult to patch post release.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn Making History news, the devs have been \u003Cb\u003Elooking into methods for making the mission flow logic easier to use\u003C/b\u003E for the mission creators, as well as tweaking and improving the design of various elements found within the \u003Ci\u003EMission Builder\u003C/i\u003E. Additionally, the team completed \u003Cb\u003Eadding the ability for multiple vessels to spawn into a mission\u003C/b\u003E based on where the mission creator has specified them into a mission. This includes landed anywhere, in orbit anywhere or on any Launchpad. While working on this, a bug was discovered whereby vessels will sometimes spawn below or above the ground when landed - usually when the player has changed their terrain settings but this also occurs regularly for recovery parts and Kerbal contracts that are landed on a planet; naturally the team got busy and are working hard on resolving the issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDevs also spent some time during the week\u003Cb\u003E reviewing code, functionality and making things work together\u003C/b\u003E in the expansion for what we have already delivered. Similarly, reviewing and iterating on how vessels and their parameters are specified in the UI by mission creators and working on iterative design was part of the agenda.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u003Cb\u003ECelestial Body viewer in the \u003Ci\u003EMission Builder\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/b\u003E got some attention, too. The biome selector is ready and \u00A0the team made several changes internally to allow additional modes for the future. The team also worked in a new in-house solution to the TrackIR plugin that solves all the issues with the x64 builds so you guys can continue playing KSP in any version you prefer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u003Cb\u003EEndNodes features for the \u003Ci\u003EMission Builder\u003C/i\u003E were completed this week\u003C/b\u003E. This feature allows the mission creator to specify which nodes in their mission signal the end of the mission and to define the conditions of how the mission ends, whether that is a successful ending or a failure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the artistic side of the development, \u003Cb\u003Ethe art team worked on the vernier engine to go with our RD-107 analogue\u003C/b\u003E. One of the challenges with this part was balancing something that would be recognizable as part of an R7 rocket, but also keep the \u2018lego\u2019 feel our players are used to. \u00A0To achieve this, we decided to split the verniers out as a separate part, so players could choose to either use them in a configuration reminiscent of the R7, or in other interesting and creative ways. The flip side is that you lose some of the unique asymmetric aspects of an R7 booster (including the handy notch that fits the verniers on the central stack of the rocket). \u00A0This is a theme you\u2019re going to see quite a bit of as the parts for \u003Ci\u003EMaking History\u003C/i\u003E progress. \u00A0While we want parts to be recognizable, our direction is one where we aim for taking heavy inspiration from vs. building precise replicas of historic craft and parts, with the primary goal being to provide new parts that are flexible, balanced, and fun to use for both historic as well as player generated missions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe vernier itself is a liquid fuel engine with a single axis gimbal with a 45 degree range (22.5 degrees each direction), making it an excellent form of control authority (we include a total of twelve of these on our Vostok 1-inspired engine), as well as an interesting engine in its own right that I expect our players will find many creative uses for.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/DbY5Fw6.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHere\u2019s a pic\u003C/a\u003E of its current state, along with a pic of how it would be used on our Vostok-inspired craft file, and examples of the gimbal range. \u00A0There\u2019s still some work to do on it, but we suspect most people will appreciate seeing the current progress.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd that\u2019s not all, the team started \u003Cb\u003Etexturing the Vostok 1\u003C/b\u003E-inspired\u003Cb\u003E IVA\u003C/b\u003E. The UV mapping and the normals paintings are almost finished. We also started a \u003Cb\u003Enew stage in the UI for the \u003Ci\u003EMission Builder\u003C/i\u003E workflow\u003C/b\u003E, with most of the screens and UIs currently built from wireframes, the team started placing final assets on them. Here\u2019s some preview \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/tTYXh\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eexamples\u003C/a\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNaturally, as more parts have been coming online for the expansion, testing and reporting on those has also been part of the duties. The QA team hears with anticipation from the devs that they will soon begin testing the fruits of their labors on the mission planning components.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, we encourage you to participate in our latest \u003Cb\u003EKSP Challenge\u003C/b\u003E - \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/163157-ksp-challenge-landing-on-duna/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E\u003Ci\u003ELanding on Duna!\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/a\u003E This time around, the challenge consists of travelling to and landing on Duna from the Kerbal\u2019s homeworld without using oxidizer of any kind and with stock parts only. We also want to remind you that from now on we\u2019ll spread out the completion time for each challenge depending on their complexity. This means that you will have more time to complete the challenges and we\u2019ll have also more time to think of better ones for you to try out. Are you up to the challenge?
