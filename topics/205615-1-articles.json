The idea is to give the player access to several new airbrake types that perform specific roles. I love the idea of airbrakes but the stock ones... kinda suck. They\u0027re too slow to react for a proper control surfaces and they\u0027re too fragile for a proper re-entry assist, so I decided to break them up into some new parts that each perform very well in one category rather than acting as heavy drogue chutes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003ECompleted:\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFast Twitch Control Airbrakes-\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0 Very fast actuator speed, relatively small.
