It should be possible to change the resolution by pressing the button really, really often (like 10 times just to increase the resolution by one step). Another workaround would be to change the resolution in the launcher or direct in the settings.cfg (in line 127 \u0026amp; 128).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"envelope91","CreatedById":146026,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-14T14:20:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWow!
