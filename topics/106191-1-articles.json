If you can\u0027t get the patcher/launcher to work, download the 1.0 files from the KSP store (same place you got KSP from) and pick the file that isn\u0027t the installer. It is a zip file containing the 1.0 executable and game data. Unzip it, and replace your 0.90 stuff with the 1.0 stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RiggerLee","CreatedById":110780,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T03:35:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo joy with the patcher but down loading the file directly worked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELee\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T05:01:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPeople are reporting problems with the patcher. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeanwhile, this thread has been moved to Kerbal Network.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
