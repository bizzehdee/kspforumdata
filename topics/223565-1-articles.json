However the issue which is covered in this bug report has started to be a significant issue for me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/219210-ksp2-is-calculating-the-physics-of-all-parts-of-all-crafts-whether-they-are-rendered-or-not-reducing-performance-of-all-scenes-at-all-times-updated-to-0140/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ehttps://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/219210-ksp2-is-calculating-the-physics-of-all-parts-of-all-crafts-whether-they-are-rendered-or-not-reducing-performance-of-all-scenes-at-all-times-updated-to-0140/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn my savegame I have 25 vessels total of which 5 is small satellites with few parts. The rest are mostly interplanetary vessels with typically 20 of the medium hydrogen tanks, 10 nuclear engines and various other parts. My way of playing the game might be a bit unique, but not an unreasonable number of vessels or parts in the big picture.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLast night I had an idea to start a separate empty save to design and test vessels to get a break from the poor performance I have played with for a bit now. When I went back to progress on my main save it really hit me how bad it had gotten. The game does 12 fps on the main \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E screen and 7-8 fps when I launched my latest vessel. In my empty save I had 20 fps while launching the same vessel which felt fine. I\u0027m considering taking a break until some significant improvement has been done on this issue.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWanted to make this post to hopefully bring it higher up on the priority list in case more people are experiencing the same thing. There are many things to work on, but for me it would be a game changer to fix this issue. The game is significantly better now in terms of bugs then at the beginning of early access. The bugs can be annoying and a bit time consuming at times, but they can usually be worked around. This issue is constant and the only workaround is doing a 180 on my plans and make fewer and smaller vessels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere are my computer specs for context:\u003Cbr\u003E\nRyzen 5800X\u003Cbr\u003E\nRTX 3070\u003Cbr\u003E\n32GB RAM\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"linuxgurugamer","CreatedById":129964,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-02-07T23:00:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou need to provide a log file\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spicat","CreatedById":228085,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-02-07T23:06:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s currently the second most upvoted bug report. I think it\u0027s pretty much a priority and with colonies coming it will be the main thing to overcome in the coming months. I would be surprised (and disappointed) if they don\u0027t release huge performance improvements about part count and background craft processing for colonies and interstellar.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224365069\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022223565\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221707346820\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022129964\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022linuxgurugamer\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n6 minutes ago, linuxgurugamer said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou need to provide a log file\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s not a bug report, I don\u0027t think it\u0027s necessary here, devs are pretty much aware of this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-02-07T23:07:57Z\u0022 title=\u002202/07/2024 11:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Feb 7\u0022\u003EFebruary 7\u003C/time\u003E by Spicat\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
