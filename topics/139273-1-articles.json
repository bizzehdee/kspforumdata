There is no such thing as OP\u0022. (OP, by the way, means \u0022overpowered\u0022 in game speak, for those of you not as geeky as I am).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd you\u0027re right. The Mobile Processing Lab is not as OP as, say, a \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.wargaming.net/en/Tank:R38_KV-220_action\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKV-220\u003C/a\u003E, but it really imbalances the science and career games. Hear me out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTake a lander to Minmus. Have two Sc-9001 Science Jr\u0027s, two Goo Modules, a thermometer and a Barometer on your lander. Visit two biomes on Minmus, plus temp and pressure readings in atmosphere and in orbit. If you want to, take four goo modules and get science from the atmosphere and in orbit from them. Of course, get samples from your landing zones too, and crew/EVA reports from wherever you can (you can only store one crew report for the Processing Lab, but that\u0027s ok).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReturn to orbit, dock with an orbiting Processing Lab. Unload all your science into it. of course you should have two scientists on board. I have two level-1 scientists on mine. It\u0027s easy to level the scientists to 1 star just by getting them into Kerbin orbit once and returning.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat science may be\u00A0all you need to fill out the entire tech tree.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd I haven\u0027t done the maths, but I suspect you could do it with only science from \u003Cem\u003EKerbin\u003C/em\u003E, in a Processing Lab sitting next to the launch pad. It would take multiple biomes, though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, to me, that seems a bit much. The science you get from the Processing Lab is very, very good. It multiplies the science you get by two or three, or more. Again, I haven\u0027t done the maths, but I am currently sending a probe to Bop. I did as I described above before I left. I\u0027ve done one more mission to Eve and Gilly since then. Every 350 days or so, on the way to Bop, I go back to the Processing Lab I have in orbit and transmit the science. I get 500 science from it every time. I started out with 750 data (from the Minmus mission), and have already transmitted 1000 science back. I still have 500 data to work with (it converts \u0022data\u0022 to \u0022science\u0022 at some multiple, more than 2-1), and I haven\u0027t even processed all the data I got from Minmus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI should really do the maths here. But I\u0027m lazy. I did this in my last career, and it was the same kind of thing. A mission to Minmus (or the Mun, if you prefer) that would normally return 300-400 science returns thousands of science after processing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, I\u0027m not complaining, necessarily, but it does seem to be an astounding return for the effort you put into it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThoughts are welcome.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-08T02:32:07Z\u0022 title=\u002205/08/2016 02:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 8, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by RocketBlam\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Glaran K\u0026#039;erman","CreatedById":146334,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-08T02:50:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think you may be commenting on\u00A0the overall freestyle nature of\u00A0KSP gameplay and not noticing it.

But for the average player, playing the average Career campaign on Normal difficulty, it makes a lot of sense.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor instance, I\u0027m running a somewhat-heavily modded Career save in 1.1.2 (actually started it in 1.0 but didn\u0027t get very far, fiddled a bit more in 1.0.4, then took a long-ish break until the 1.1 betas, but anyway ...). Since late March, I\u0027ve\u00A0played a few hours every few days, longer on weekends. When I got back to my game with the 1.1 betas, I had only unlocked the first couple tiers of the tech tree. Having played the game for over three years now (since 0.19), I\u0027ve \u0022done it all\u0022 with only a few exceptions (never done a single-mission Grand Tour, or bothered beating my head against the \u0022Eve Return\u0022 brick wall). But I\u0027ve been to all the bodies in the system including Tylo, done Laythe and Duna colonies, established resource mining bases (with Kethane before stock resources were a thing).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI say all that to underscore this: I know what *can* be done, if I want to just mine Science!\u2122 instead of play the game. But most average players, the kinds of people who only hit up a forum to troubleshoot a problem, won\u0027t know how to do this thing. What they\u0027ll do is something like what I have ended up doing late in my own Career save. In my case, I\u0027ve visited Eve and Gilly\u00A0with a couple probes, done a flyby of Moho (screwed up my dV estimates and couldn\u0027t make orbit - feel like a n00b again), landed a probe on Ike and a crew on Duna, have another crew en route to Jool for Science!\u2122 around as many moons as I can manage before hitting my dV budget, and have a probe en route to Dres. So I\u0027m now with only a few top tier nodes left (all requiring 500 - 1500 Science\u2122 each) I have a choice: I can spend\u00A0the couple of game-years between transfer windows\u00A0grinding through stupid contracts ferrying tourists, rescuing buffoons or doing silly tests of landing gears on escape trajectories out of Minmus just to earn millions of Funds, or I can load up a couple Labs on stations with Science!\u2122 and then warp a month to the next mid-course correction or SOI change for one of my missions and gain enough Science\u2122 to maybe finally unlock another one of those high-tech nodes.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrankly, either approach isn\u0027t \u0022realistic\u0022 in the sense of how humans run space programs. But both represent viable ways to play KSP, depending on how one chooses to define \u0022fun.\u0022 For me, sometimes I want to do space rescue silliness, so I\u0027ll go rescue Idiot Kerman from low M\u00FCn orbit. But other times I\u0027m impatient to get my lander to Gilly or get a probe to Jool, so\u00A0\u0027ll timewarp to an SOI. But if I\u0027m going to \u0022waste\u0022 that time, I might as well simulate the general advancement of science and technology that occurs with the passage of time in a progressive civilization.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo in that sense, I don\u0027t mind checking in on my labs every month or two, getting 300 - 500 Science!\u2122 each time so I can unlock those last few nodes and finish out my tech tree, thus enabling my \u0022end game\u0022 of colonies on Minmus, M\u00FCn,\u00A0Duna and maybe Laythe, mining stations on Minmus, Gilly, Ike and the Joolian moons, whatever.
