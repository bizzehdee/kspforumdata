Maybe (I won\u0027t complain about changes here) score for high G-load at: sea level Mach 0.6; sea level Mach 1.5; 10km Mach 1.5; That would give stuff like my \u0022Firecrown\u0022 less score, due to not being able to pull as much at low speeds, as well as designs that lock up at high speeds.\n\n- Sustained turns (= with positive specific excess power).\n\n- Roll rate (allthough lowish priority), if we find a way to measure it."},{"CreatedByName":"Halsfury","CreatedById":54576,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-24T18:52:45Z","Content":"Fair enough tetryds, perhaps the rule should just be hit the min standards in the least amount of money.\n\nbonus points could translate into negative funds, so if you hit the standard for the bonus point that deducts a certain amount of cash from your score.\n\nalso so I don\u0027t have to write out scores like 50,000 or 150,000 how about every 10,000 credits equals 1 point, with the objective of having the least points?\n\n@ FourGreenFields maybe the maximum cruise altitude could be calculated, I find that some craft aren\u0027t able to sustain cruise speed past a certain alt due to area ruling and aerodynamic issues.

It allows for tight maneuvering without losing control, especially considering that SAS does not exactly qualify as a proper stability control.\n\nI have been working on my most recent plane, which is based on the Adder at its fuselage, but employs a completely new wing layout. For some reason, though, adjustable landing gear as started acting very strange with this craft on landing, inducing flat spin when braking... I haven\u0027t been able to figure this out, considering there should be no real issue here.\n\nIn Goldstein FAR, the plane had the stupid low wave drag of just under 0.3... It was almost difficult to keep subsonic, but was actually difficult to slow down before I started adding airbrakes, which oddly further reduced its drag. In Haack, however, it\u0027s wave drag is around 0.7. I\u0027m not sure exactly how it\u0027s being treated differently, as the other iteration of the plane has the same drag area it did before of 0.5; and the Adder went from around 0.7 to 0.9.\n\nThis will be fun to experiment with."},{"CreatedByName":"Halsfury","CreatedById":54576,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-26T19:17:38Z","Content":"Thanks for offhandedly mentioning that FAR was updated, just downloaded it.\n\nAnd it\u0027s such a relief, Goldstein had a problem where it leading edge slats made from multiple parts would stall asymmetrically for no good reason. Haack has fixed this, so my Su-27 will finally super-manoeuver.\n\nBut not the Su-27 which I showed earlier, I threw that one out but took the lessons learned from it to build this\n\n![BLgpEc8.png](http://i.imgur.com/BLgpEc8.png)\n\n![hcbZs4x.png](http://i.imgur.com/hcbZs4x.png)\n\nIt\u0027s considerably more robust, and I hope to have it posted soon, one of it\u0027s cool features is the flare deployer on the boom at the very back, this ensures that the flares cross through the engine plume for maximum confusion factor for sidewinders.\n\nAnother thing which happened with Haack is that the F-18 I redesigned with Darth had it\u0027s C of G moved forwards, or the C of P was moved back, but either way I just split up the 400 units of fuel in the tanks into 200 in the front of the nacelle and 200 in the back.\n\nThe F-16 which everyone liked so much is still a great flyer, and might have had a performance boost with the patch\n\nNow everything is flying much better, I really like the update, it makes flight more smooth in all regimes but especially in high AoA which us fighter builders really benefit from\n\nAlso here\u0027s the updated F-18, it comes with a bunch of stuff for updated BD armoury too, I hope you like the layout\n\n[http://www./download/b19r3s4mqmawcs9/FAR_BD_FA-18J_Super_Hornet.craft](http://www./download/b19r3s4mqmawcs9/FAR_BD_FA-18J_Super_Hornet.craft)\n\nThe F-16 was unaffected by Haack as mentioned above\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-26T19:26:12Z\u0022 title=\u002208/26/2015 07:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Halsfury**"}]}
