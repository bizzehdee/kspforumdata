Then I launched a new tanker design, 10 full orange tanks and 15 LV-Ns in Kerbin orbit. Sent it to meet my mission at Tylo, and topped off all the tanks. The tanker\u0027s still sitting at Tylo with some fuel, but not enough for a complete refueling. We\u0027ll see after the rest of the moons if I need to send another tanker out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI now have the mission in Laythe\u0027s SoI about to aerobrake/burn into orbit. I don\u0027t expect a lot of trouble with Laythe since I managed to keep that one extra stage intact on my lander (which is the entire reason I had so much trouble with Tylo). Though taking off from Tylo revealed it\u0027s really not balanced well at all. I have to keep the RCS on to keep it pointed the right way when all three engines are going. But I only need the one central aerospike this time, and I\u0027ll be dropping that last stage probably during or after my deorbit burn.
