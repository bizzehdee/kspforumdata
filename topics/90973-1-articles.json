Allow transfering them via pods / kerbals so flights that are built together in space still work, but it would not only prevent finishing missions with things already at the target, it would too make the missions tab during flight more lucid.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBtw the whole reputation / science / money gain needs some kind of balancing-love... I\u0027m meanwhile playing on hard setting, reduced rep and science gain to 50%, and it still feels pretty easy. The begining is challenging, not much place for exploding rockets until you get to mun. But once i was there (without the repeating missions cheat), i am again at the point where my science is high enough to get to Jools moons, rep is nearly at max, and money is high enough so that i can fail at the next 8 big rockets launches without getting into problems. Not sure what the goal is of career mode, but currently it feels like \u0022race to the mun and win\u0022 - and that\u0027s not something that can be balanced with the options slider, if i reduce the income even more, it just becomes unprogressable at the begining. (my above solution for repeating missions would make that more balanceable too in my opinion. When missions are assigned to a spacecraft, the game could handle loosing or recovering a pod with an unfinished mission as a minor failure - mission should still stay open, but it would cost us reputation)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-23T07:27:13Z\u0022 title=\u002211/23/2014 07:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 23, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by thyriel\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-23T21:52:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn long-running campaigns, there needs to be some sort of on-going source of income, so I don\u0027t see this as a problem.
