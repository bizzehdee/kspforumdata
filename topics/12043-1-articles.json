The SAEV then lights up the main engine and escapes the atmosphere and gets into a 1,500,000m orbit with around 1 1/3 tanks left for deorbiting. Finally the lander section of the SAEV activates detaching the tanks and main engine modules then 3 remaing winglets are exposed for an accurate landing on kerbal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ES.A.E.V. track history:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuccessful takeoffs: 57/68\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuccessful staging breakoffs: 56/57\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuccessful orbits: 56/56\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuccessful re-entries: 53/56\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuccessful landings: 47/53\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall i love my S.A.E.V. \u0026lt;3 \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"deadshot462","CreatedById":13659,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-03T23:25:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi and welcome to the forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027m assuming this is an actual KSP craft, which would mean that you\\\u0027d want to post your rocket descrption in this forum:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?board=15.0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?board=15.0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, please include pictures and a download of your craft file in your post next time so it can be shared and be allowed to be posted in the Ship Exchange Forum.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
