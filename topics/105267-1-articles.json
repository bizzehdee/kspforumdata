The aerospike used to be an unrealistic IWIN button for Isp. I\u0027m happy to see it got made realistic. Aerospikes are not magic devices that can break the laws of physics and give you higher Isp at a given pressure than reality allows. Instead, they let you have near optimal *for that pressure* Isp at most any ambient pressure.\n\nA bell nozzle at its optimal pressure will always be more efficient than an altitude-compensating nozzle...but the latter is liable to be more efficient everywhere else. For instance, see what happens to the LV-T45 on Eve, compared to the Aerospike. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Torham234","CreatedById":58574,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T21:26:11Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Poodle Isp is no-existent at ASL: 85 and just ok at Vac: 350 but it now weights only 1.75 ton!

Here is some samples I have done so far. The best by far are the aircraft wing sections. They are very light and very heat resistant, and have great surface area and heat radiation capability.\n\nEach screenshot was taken when the temperature maxed out and started decreasing. As you can see the wing section managed to cool the nuke while still running.
