From rare glimpses into this age before a wizard war obliterated the planet changing the layout of the continents and plunging the survivors into a classic medieval fantasy setting, the civilization flourished, with huge metropolises containing skyscrapers and with cars and passenger planes all created and powered by magic-users. They explored other planets and other dimensions and made things like computers, music players, cars, passenger aeroplanes, tanks and rifles powered by magic that could be used by anyone. Basically, imagine what would happen if we suddenly discovered a source of (nearly infinite) energy that can be manipulated by individual people\u0027s minds. We would certainly find a whole lot of \u0027scientific\u0027 ways to use them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a series of novels by John Ringo called \u0022The Council Wars\u0022, which is set in a far distant future. People have colonized the solar system, have advanced nanotechnology and teleportation and everything on earth is controlled by an all-powerful AI called mother. People can modify their own bodies at will, and some have adapted themselves to live underwater. Others turned themselves into mythical-looking creatures like centaurs, flying snakes and even dragons, purely on a whim. The chimpanzees have been genetically modified for purposes of war a long time ago and have since limited contact with Humans, keeping to themselves and calling them self \u0022Elves\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then everything collapses in civil war, power becomes scarce, many die and others are stuck in forms they were in at the time of the collapse.
