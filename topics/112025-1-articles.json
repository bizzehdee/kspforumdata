Due to my understanding of how KSP ground coordinates work (which is limited so take this for what you will), it should be projected as a cone. Therefore a higher orbit will a) have a larger area to cross and ![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) will be moving at a slower velocity relative the ground, making it a preferable choice.\n\nI\u0027d say the best solution, while still keeping your orbital period down so as to not burn clock time needlessly, is to use a Molniya lightning orbit (skim the north pole with a periaps \u003C80km, then shoot up to a high apo almost as high as keostationary while over the south pole) for maximum loiter time with minimum orbital period."},{"CreatedByName":"jackless","CreatedById":141394,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T03:06:37Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E consider the sector to be a hypothetical object on stationary orbit, and then pretend you\u0027re doing rendezvous to it.\n\nI can select the sector as a \u0022navigation beacon\u0022 but not as a target.

Sending another one would cost more than the cancellation cost and success is not guaranteed. \n\nThe Molniya orbit helped a lot but could not get close enough to activate the entering sector message.\n\nThe last pass I was able to be at around 50km laterally (lateral distance taken from the Waypoint manager) from one of the targeted sector while I was close to the apogee of a 8h orbit (did not note the actual altitude when that happen).\n\nThe waypoint manager mod helped me with the distance check also.\n\nAs for the shape of a sector, I will try to repeat the experiment but with one on the equator.\n\nThanks for the help."}]}
