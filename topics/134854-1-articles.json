If ship b and c travel to opposing ends of the galaxy their spacetime hypergeometry begins to start diverging (and not only this but we cannot see them and we cannot realize the differences in warping). We have tested relationships of a few kilometers, communication seems to work, but anything beyond that distance and entangled particles become unstable, they don\u0027t last. For the scheme above to work the particles are trapped in state of non-interaction, but the problem is that to accelerate, carried some place, and decelerate the particles are interacting and therefore one or the other will be resolved sooner or later.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second problem is that for b to communicate with c is that b and c have to have a common ancestor and a shared devotee that protects their non-state. That means that communication requires a preparative process, but not only that, meaningful resolution may require some simultaneous observation.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSuppose this scenario we fix these problems.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe send out a colonization ship that wakes in say 10000 years, far beyond rf range, and in that ship there is a box, and in the box there is a matrix of say 1000 B[] and in each B[] there are a million B\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo then A knows when the ship arrives and settles, careful estimates of the space time geometry are assessed, the were probes sent from time to time from both parties to calibrate any unknown irregularities that have occurred.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nB[]1 is configured and gets a 30% bias, which means each bit needs to be repeated 10 times, with a parity bit to check for errors, thats 90B per byte of information. So the first message can be 10,000bytes long. The last sentence in the array is how long until the next message is sent, its repeated several times so that any nonsense is weeded out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA[]1 is then resolved and received. It now knows when to open A[]2. It also knows that if it wants to send a message back it has to before B[]2 is sent, because once B[]2 begins resolving its either set or not, As B[]2 is being programmed, the programmers realize it is set, so they read that message and then program B[]3 instead, and back and forth in this way communicating.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is not a declaration that the problems of communication can be fixed, but if they are fixed, this is how quantum entangled communication might work.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn the same comoving reference frame resolving simultaneity is not that difficult because there is no relative vector differences, but once the comoving references start changing. If B and C need to be observed simultaneously for communication to work B being set and C being read, then communication is a highly improbable event as spacetime diverges.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-22T21:08:52Z\u0022 title=\u002206/22/2016 09:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 22, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by PB666\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KAL 9000","CreatedById":140704,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-24T14:05:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI want to respond, and I know the concepts of entanglement, but I\u0027m afraid I don\u0027t know all that jargon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mikegarrison","CreatedById":137807,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-24T15:03:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell I\u0027m no expert on this, but everything I\u0027ve ever heard is that it is impossible (in theory or practice) for any information to be send via quantum entanglement.

Entanglement purification for quantum communication.\u003Cbr\u003E\nPan JW1, Simon C, Brukner C, Zeilinger A.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFrom Abstract: Existing general purification protocols are based on the quantum controlled-NOT (CNOT) or similar quantum logic operations, which are very difficult to implement experimentally. Present realizations of CNOT gates are much too imperfect to be useful for long-distance quantum communication. Here we present a scheme for the entanglement purification of general mixed entangled states, which achieves 50 per cent of the success probability of schemes based on the CNOT operation, but requires only simple linear optical elements. Because the perfection of such elements is very high, the local operations necessary for purification can be performed with the required precision. Our procedure is within the reach of current technology, and should significantly simplify the implementation of long-distance quantum communication.\u00A0 11323664\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNature. 2003 Jan 23;421(6921):343-6. Experimental extraction of an entangled photon pair from two identically decohered pairs.\u003Cbr\u003E\nYamamoto T1, Koashi M, Ozdemir SK, Imoto N.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFrom abstract.\u00A0 Two polarization-entangled photon pairs are generated by spontaneous parametric down-conversion and then distributed through a channel that induces identical phase fluctuations to both pairs; this ensures that no entanglement is available as long as each pair is manipulated individually. Then, through collective local operations and classical communication we extract from the two decohered pairs a photon pair that is observed to be polarization-entangled. 12540894\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis paper basically argues that the more you try to lower noise in you particle selection process, the more simultaneous your reading operations have to be. That would be problematic for galactic transcommunication schemes because of the time and space would require excessive screening and but the ability to read simultaneously becomes less and less probable with distance. This basically argues my point, that communication on very recent timeframes may be possible, but at very distant timeframes may be statistically impossible.

Long distance quantum teleportation in a quantum relay configuration.\u003Cbr\u003E\nde Riedmatten H1, Marcikic I, Tittel W, Zbinden H, Collins D, Gisin N.\u003Cbr\u003E\nA long distance quantum teleportation experiment with a fiber-delayed Bell state measurement (BSM) is reported. The source creating the qubits to be teleported and the source creating the necessary entangled state are connected to the beam splitter realizing the BSM by two 2 km long optical fibers. In addition, the teleported qubits are analyzed after 2.2 km of optical fiber, in another laboratory separated by 55 m. Time-bin qubits carried by photons at 1310 nm are teleported onto photons at 1550 nm. The fidelity is of 77%, above the maximal value obtainable without entanglement. This is the first realization of an elementary quantum relay over significant distances, which will allow an increase in the range of quantum communication and quantum key distribution.

Limit on nonlocality in any world in which communication complexity is not trivial.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBrassard G1, Buhrman H, Linden N, M\u00E9thot AA, Tapp A, Unger F.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBell proved that quantum entanglement enables two spacelike separated parties to exhibit classically impossible correlations. Even though these correlations are stronger than anything classically achievable, they cannot be harnessed to make instantaneous (faster than light) communication possible. Yet, Popescu and Rohrlich have shown that even stronger correlations can be defined, under which instantaneous communication remains impossible. This raises the question: Why are the correlations achievable by quantum mechanics not maximal among those that preserve causality? We give a partial answer to this question by showing that slightly stronger correlations would result in a world in which communication complexity becomes trivial. 16907289\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNature. 2008 Aug 14;454(7206):861-4. doi: 10.1038/nature07121. Testing the speed of \u0027spooky action at a distance\u0027.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSalart D1, Baas A, Branciard C, Gisin N, Zbinden H.\u003Cbr\u003E\nCorrelations are generally described by one of two mechanisms: either a first event influences a second one by sending information encoded in bosons or other physical carriers, or the correlated events have some common causes in their shared history. Quantum physics predicts an entirely different kind of cause for some correlations, named entanglement. This reveals itself in correlations that violate Bell inequalities (implying that they cannot be described by common causes) between space-like separated events (implying that they cannot be described by classical communication). Many Bell tests have been performed, and loopholes related to locality and detection have been closed in several independent experiments. It is still possible that a first event could influence a second, but the speed of this hypothetical influence (Einstein\u0027s \u0027spooky action at a distance\u0027) would need to be defined in some universal privileged reference frame and be greater than the speed of light. Here we put stringent experimental bounds on the speed of all such hypothetical influences. We performed a Bell test over more than 24 hours between two villages separated by 18 km and approximately east-west oriented, with the source located precisely in the middle. We continuously observed two-photon interferences well above the Bell inequality threshold. Taking advantage of the Earth\u0027s rotation, the configuration of our experiment allowed us to determine, for any hypothetically privileged frame, a lower bound for the speed of the influence. For example, if such a privileged reference frame exists and is such that the Earth\u0027s speed in this frame is less than 10(-3) times that of the speed of light, then the speed of the influence would have to exceed that of light by at least four orders of magnitude. 18704081\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScience. 2012 Jul 6;337(6090):72-5.

Notably, observers of two or more entangled particles will find correlations in their measurement results that cannot be explained by classical statistics. To make it a useful resource, particularly for scalable long-distance quantum communication, the heralded generation of entanglement between distant massive quantum systems is necessary. We report on the creation and analysis of heralded entanglement between spins of two single rubidium-87 atoms trapped independently 20 meters apart. Our results illustrate the viability of an integral resource for quantum information science, as well as for fundamental tests of quantum mechanics.22767924\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMore later.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.nature.com/news/2008/080813/full/news.2008.1038.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.nature.com/news/2008/080813/full/news.2008.1038.html\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.isciencetimes.com/articles/6986/20140324/scientists-demonstrate-three-way-quantum-communication-light-speed.htm\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.isciencetimes.com/articles/6986/20140324/scientists-demonstrate-three-way-quantum-communication-light-speed.htm\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.sciencemag.org/news/sifter/physicists-break-quantum-teleportation-distance-record\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.sciencemag.org/news/sifter/physicists-break-quantum-teleportation-distance-record 100km.\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://science.sciencemag.org/content/336/6086/1280\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://science.sciencemag.org/content/336/6086/1280\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere is an example of interference based forcing of quantum entanglement\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://science.sciencemag.org/content/345/6201/1132.6.full\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://science.sciencemag.org/content/345/6201/1132.6.full\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are much better articles by I have to find them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPhys Rev Lett. 2015 Dec 18;115(25). Significant-Loophole-Free Test of Bell\u0027s Theorem with Entangled Photons. Giustina. . . .Zeilinger A\u003Cbr\u003E\nAbstract: Local realism is the worldview in which physical properties of objects exist independently of measurement and where physical influences cannot travel faster than the speed of light. Bell\u0027s theorem states that this worldview is incompatible with the predictions of quantum mechanics, as is expressed in Bell\u0027s inequalities. Previous experiments convincingly supported the quantum predictions. Yet, every experiment requires assumptions that provide loopholes for a local realist explanation. Here, we report a Bell test that closes the most significant of these loopholes simultaneously. Using a well-optimized source of entangled photons, rapid setting generation, and highly efficient superconducting detectors, we observe a violation of a Bell inequality with high statistical significance. The purely statistical probability of our results to occur under local realism does not exceed 3.74E-31, corresponding to an 11.5 standard deviation effect.\u00A0\u00A0 26722905\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-25T15:39:22Z\u0022 title=\u002203/25/2016 03:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 25, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by PB666\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-24T23:09:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as I\u0027ve been led to understand, the reason communication via entanglement is currently impracticable is because the particles don\u0027t spontaneously tell people on opposite ends what their states are.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo if I have particles A and B entangled, and I measure particle A, I immediately know the state of particle B.

He could measure particle B, but in so doing he would change its state and most likely break the entanglement - and also wouldn\u0027t be able to tell whether he was receiving information from A or generating it on his end and sending it. I could call him up and tell him what\u0027s what, and he would then agree, but that would provide plenty of time for light to catch up.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe seemingly obvious solution is for us both to measure at preset times, which we calculate in advance: I measure particle A at 5:00 and he checks B at 5:01. But wait! 5:01 for him is entirely liable to be before 5:00 for me! We can do all the math we want, but at large spacelike distances, the order of events is dependent on who\u0027s observing. Someone could easily drive by in a spaceship and prove that particle B was measured first. Therefore, were either of us to receive messages at all, they would arrive at unpredictable points in time - possibly years before or after they\u0027re relevant.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes but there are apparently third party ways of determinism, that means that if particle A can be determine then when B reads the determinism of creates the anticorrelation B. Again, I have seen two papers on this in the last 3 years but I have to find them. The order problem is a problem, but one of the abstract mentions that quantum entanglement at great distances is problematic, this is because the interference that space-time creates, notably all the other events going on in spacetime. The nonlocality problem loopholes have basically been a fight to extend the entangled distances to the point that decision making on one side does not affect the other sides registration.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat you are refering to is the loopholes, because early experiments had particle measurements going on at very short periods after entangled particles are generated, now they are registering them at great distances, IIRC in the canaries or meridian islands they sent photons between islands so that there were completely different sets of instruments. I have to find the paper but I believed they used third party particles to communicate.

By consecutive generation of the two required photon pairs and space-like separation of the relevant measurement events, we also showed the feasibility of the swapping protocol in a long-distance scenario, where the independence of the nodes is highly demanded. Because our results already allow for efficient implementation of entanglement purification, we anticipate our research to lay the ground for a fully fledged quantum repeater over a realistic high-loss and even turbulent quantum channel.\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 26578764\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNature. 2012 Sep 13;489(7415):269-73.

Here we report such an experiment, using active feed-forward in real time. The experiment uses two free-space optical links, quantum and classical, over 143 kilometres between the two Canary Islands of La Palma and Tenerife. To achieve this, we combine advanced techniques involving a frequency-uncorrelated polarization-entangled photon pair source, ultra-low-noise single-photon detectors and entanglement-assisted clock synchronization. The average teleported state fidelity is well beyond the classical limit of two-thirds. Furthermore, we confirm the quality of the quantum teleportation procedure without feed-forward by complete quantum process tomography. Our experiment verifies the maturity and applicability of such technologies in real-world scenarios, in particular for future satellite-based quantum teleportation.PMID: 22951967\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is one of the papers. The boundaries of FTL may be questionable in this case, again in quantum length scale these are tremendous differences, but I think the appropriate measure would be a natural log scale that would determine the rarity of finding (selecting particles) capable of maintaining pure entanglement at these distances. At least there is the plausibility that you could engage in FTL with appropriate selection and a repeater but the difficulty would be scalar with the log of distance (and the probability that some other interaction or interference occurs). I read this paper now and I am less certain of FTL communication.

In the incompleteness of answers paradoxes arise, its sometimes a good idea to be the devil\u0027s advocate in order to force the more likely theory to come up with irrefutable proof and to close up on its holes. Intuitively I think that the quantum state is determined at its formation or pairs (deterministic) but then I also believe the universe is fundementally non-deterministic, consequently either one or the other is wrong.

The reason for this that even on the large scale such distributions are rather characteristic of our world. However determinism may only exist at some unknown boundary at some rational translation of quantum space-time, the problem is that we have no measures of quantum space-time, we have no verification, it is also a question.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe perceive the quantum mechanical world to be different from our own. For example, it is not possible in the classical world to go back in time or for a particle to be in two places at once, or for superposition of particles. But then if we try to rationalize statistics based upon distribution we frequently find that are rationalization of the distribution is imperfect (Black-swan theories). With a classical view we tend to see the center of the distribution not the distribution itself, we tend to calculate the distribution based on observations of the center and the areas of maximum likelihood, which in the rest of science has generally produced errors and exceptions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
