I don\u0027t think they can be scaled with a config, so they need their own code. IR is already notified on rescale, we can limit the node sizes there. This extra manipulation will not break TweakScale because it reads the original sizes from the prefab part. \u003Cp\u003ESo is there a consensus that nodes on IR parts should globally be limited to size 2?
