I would like to require the destruction of some AA sites using TAC Self Destruct as a \u0022C4 Charge\u0022. To do that requires KAS also to be able to carry the Self Destruct module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy question is should I go with the option that requires two mods to complete or just allow a more stock option of disabling the AA sites once reached by a Kerbal?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suppose the heart of the question is really whether or not requiring 2 additional mods to complete the challenge will be a deterrent for participation or not.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"worir4","CreatedById":75980,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-14T21:00:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think more people will take part if you do not make the mod needed.
