(Though really the LV-06 was overkill.) The launch was not perfect, unlike so many previous ones, and the launch software had to be aborted part way to orbit. (The LV-06 is apparently tragically short on attitude authority. It was able to pitch over to 45 degrees, but after that refused to budge. Again this seems to be a failure of the gimbals on the particular AIES engines the vessel uses.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe orbital insertion was completed in a \u0022supervised\u0022 mode, where ground operators were sending signals directly to the craft. Had it been left on internal controls it would have burned up in the atmosphere... Some revisions were in order for the \u0022launchmath\u0022 script as well.

The target for this mission was the center of the M\u00FCn\u0027s Left Eye, also known as the NorthWest Crater. The two-step would ensure the P-4 was landing in a zone far from the steep southern walls of the large crater, and would improve the chance of finding a landing zone that was relatively flat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160225_ksp0427_p-4.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022588\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160225_ksp0427_p-4.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220160225_ksp0429_p-4.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://0div0.org/images/ksp/forgot/20160225_ksp0429_p-4.jpg\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe orbital capture burn was completed in the dark, as is only right and proper.

The probe reached its target orbit a comfortable 18 minutes after leaving the surface.

The orbital module would (hopefully) burn up in Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere and not contribute to future space debris problems.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe burn to return to Kerbin occurred in the dark, as is only fitting and proper.

Back when biomes were first added (the original Squad ones, not the ones added later by Tanuki Chau), I sent an ABISS probe to each one. There are spots where some of the surface biomes intersect with water biomes, ones I refer to as \u0022wet\u0022 versions of each - and they count for extra science points too. Wet Badlands, Wet Deserts, Wet Tundra, etc. So in a way we do have ocean biomes, just not vertically by depth as I would expect them to be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-28T15:48:19Z\u0022 title=\u002202/28/2016 03:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 28, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Cydonian Monk\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TopHeavy11","CreatedById":154744,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-01T00:19:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoar?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cydonian Monk","CreatedById":69224,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-01T00:22:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222435976\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022126972\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221456791548\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022154744\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TopHeavy11\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n9 minutes ago, TopHeavy11 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoar?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMight be a couple of days.

So the decision was made to press ahead with a conventional solution for the Silicon DSH\u0027s in-system drive section. This drive would stay behind at Kerbin when the ship left for Jool to be used as a heavy tug, so it wasn\u0027t fitted with the radial \u0022drop socket\u0022 docking ports that would be used on the final drive.

The LV-07 Crescendo required a small \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E kick motor to keep its thrust-to-weight ratio above 1.05 at liftoff (bringing it to a healthy \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E of 1.1~), so the design teams opted to leave off any nosecones or payload fairings.

This prompted a discussion as to what would happen should the launch fail... with mixed conclusions. It was hoped the bluetonium pellets in the AIES RTGs would sink into the ocean in the even of an accident, though there was always the possibility of the rocket crashing on land, as with Silicon 1.
