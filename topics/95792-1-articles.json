As life imitates art sometime games imitate life and I was trapped in my real mindset of fix not fly build not run. In the almost two years I have been loving this game I have almost exclusively ran with MechJeb, and I was fine with that. Recently though I have been working on getting my Engineer\u0027s License Third Class Unlimited for ocean going ships and I have been struggling with it, the entire concept of running things rather than fixing has been beating my behind. That is until recently, with the update to Beta I couldn\u0027t install MechJeb for a little bit and had to fly manually and I just kept flying manual. Strange as it is to say but flying without autopilot help change my mindset about being a Engineer rather than a Mechanic and I have able to get more of the concepts and study easier. So thanks you KSP and Squad for helping me become a better operator. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL:DR Thanks KSP for making me a better sailor\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
