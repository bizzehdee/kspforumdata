This plugin did not work with 0.20.0 due to the new file structure required, and incompatibilities with the source code and this new method Squad has introduced. People have been really wanting this to work and have certain functionality. I downloaded the source from a patched revision (I don\u0027t remember which one, unfortunately, I\u0027m sorry. I know TheDeadFish had his hands in this), and added a few tweaks, then submitted my own revision. I have sent a private message to Deadbeef within this forum requesting if I can take over this project, but as of yet, have not received a reply.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout me:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been a developing software, all tools and utilities, since the Commodore Vic-20 days. I\u0027ve seen a lot of languages, and have used a few of them. I\u0027m brand new to C# and Unity as of KSP 0.20.0, although I have used C/C\u002B\u002B back in my college days. I haven\u0027t decided if that counts yet. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E I feel this is an awesome start for me to learn the ins and outs of two new (to me) technologies. I am NOT, nor claim to be proficient with C#, so don\u0027t laugh too hard when you see some of my code in this language.... or laugh if you must, but at least don\u0027t be eating or drinking while looking at the code.

Doing otherwise WILL BREAK your fuel lines and struts on your sub assembly. This technically isn\u0027t a fault of SAL but in the way KSP handles moving ship parts around. When you select a part of your ship to remove it from the rest of your ship, you will notice that ALL your fuel lines and struts become disconnected. SAL will save that assembly in that bad state, unfortunately, and this is due to the parts not having an end point to connect to at that time. I\u0027ve not found a way to enforce a reconnection of those pipes and struts on a reload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2\u0026gt; Categories cannot be deleted\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETypos happen.
