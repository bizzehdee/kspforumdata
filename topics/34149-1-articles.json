I was really excited because SNC, NASA, and JAXA were going to launch the maiden flight of the Dream Chaser. When it launched we decided to catch it with our jetpacks and grab it and ride along. however, once it was around 80 km up, an attitude jet started sputtering and the ship looked like it was failing to orient itself. I tried to give it a push and accidentally sent it into a flat spin. I felt sick to my stomach. the ship was going to re-enter, so my friend and I rode it back to the surface and crash landed it on a freeway and made a huge mess. Our power-armor was dead so we ditched it and began hiking up the freeway trying to bum a ride. The FBI contacted us using a nearby video billboard and told us to remain where we were and that we were under arrest for international treason and violating some FAA regulations. Then one of the engineers from JAXA came on the screen and he was holding my empty bottle of jack and yelling NOOOOOOOOOOOO. Then I woke up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jones-250","CreatedById":24123,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-21T19:57:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEh...
