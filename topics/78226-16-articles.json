A quick press of a button to \u0022flag\u0022 the ship to stay loaded, and another quick press to \u0022unflag\u0022 it and put it back to the normal physics range.

You can make nearly any part a root part, so you don\u0027t have to use a command pod (you could use a light probe core, or even an SRB, or even any non-radial part as the root part using the root tool [hotkey 4]). If you want to get an idea of the difficulty of procedurally determining stages, just read today\u0027s dev notes. Those guys are professional programmers who are paid to spend their time developing for KSP and it\u0027s still a challenge for them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy suggestions are to use subassemblies once you\u0027ve got a setup that you know will work, and to use the root tool to make just the section you care about the root part. Any of the \u0022floating\u0022 parts in the editor aren\u0027t used in the calculation, so you can make a stage the root one, remove all the other parts, calculate everything, then replace and reroot the old parts. Or build from the bottom up, doing the same thing. Or standardize your designs. Or use the real chute mod and manually designate your chutes to land things at the right speed (what I do).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do want to add better editor features at some point, but it\u0027s a lot of work and I don\u0027t have the time for it right now. Plus, the current ones work just fine if you take time and carefully design your craft. If you want to quickly build things and toss out stages without testing and other preparation, that\u0027ll generally work just fine too, but you\u0027ll probably have somewhat lower refunds. StageRecovery is fairly forgiving. The kind of funny thing is that you often end up losing more funds by recovering SRBs than you do by tossing them \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: I did a bit more work on FMRS support.
