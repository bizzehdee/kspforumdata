The \u0022Parts:999\u0022 that was in the part\u0027s stats. What I\u0027d be very interested in would be a mod that allows for this, by making a recovery allow you to reuse the same parts for a fraction of the cost. For example, a \u0022space shuttle\u0022 recovery would allow you to either re-fly the whole craft, with a given name even, for a fraction of the launch cost for the orbiter, OR you could pry the recovered parts apart- this would mean that if you pried that orbiter apart and then used those parts to just fly the same orbiter, it would cost a bit more. This would mean that you could fly a Gemini-style capsule up, like Gemini 2, and then you could refurbish it, allowing you to send up another mission- like\u00A0OPS 0855- using the same capsule. Another option of the mod would be renaming the part- that is, it would function like a separate part with only the cost,\u00A0amount of resources in the capsule, and name changed- for example, \u0022Mk1 Pod \u0027Atlanta\u0027\u0022 could be one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-26T08:18:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbal Construction Time does this. Well, sort of.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe parts still cost the full price when they are reused, but you have to keep in mind that they have to be recovered before you can reuse them, and recovery returns up to the full price to your funds account. So a cost reduction for reuse does not even make sense, unless part recovery didn\u0027t return any money in the first place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat KCT does is letting you keep recovered parts in stock, and upon constructing a new vessel that uses those parts, they will contribute almost nothing to the time requirement. So if you have a spaceplane, it might take a very long time to build initially, but after you recover it, every subsequent launch will involve just a few hours of what you can roleplay as \u0022basic maintenance and fueling her up again\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI often use this to keep my construction lines busy even when I\u0027m not currently needing them. I\u0027ll just go to the VAB or SPH, stick together a random assortment of parts which I know I will eventually need, let it build in the background, put it on the pad/runway, and just recover it instantly for a full refund and a nice stock of pre-built parts. Especially useful for consumable parts, like tanks, rocket engines and decouplers, which you don\u0027t get back from returning missions. Things like pods and science equiment and parachutes on the other hand tend to return anyway, so you don\u0027t need a big stockpile.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-26T08:20:37Z\u0022 title=\u002202/26/2016 08:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 26, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ETypos, typos everywhere!\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tangle","CreatedById":66808,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-26T08:23:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, I was thinking of KCT but I was entirely unsure of if it was able to do so, and figured I should ask first.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
