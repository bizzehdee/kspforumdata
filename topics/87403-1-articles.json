However, some of these are rather old, and do not reflect recent lighting changes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECase in point: about a month ago, I was driving through West Texas on I-10 and I-20. The area used to be very dark. However, since the last time I drove through the area (no more than 3 years prior), we\u0027ve undergone a MASSIVE oil boom in the US, enabled by the new \u0022fracking\u0022 technology. EVERYWHERE along the interstate, there were brilliantly lit tank farms and drilling operations- and I mean BRILLIANTLY lit. And they were lit from the bottom, too, so the lights were shining up into the sky or at angles. One particular tank farm was so brilliantly lit that, despite being a mile off the interstate (at least), its glare interfered with my ability to see the road. (No one was there, which begs the question why in the hell they have to light it up like they\u0027re playing a football game?!?!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother drilling operation had a \u0022problem\u0022 with their lighting. Most of the places they were drilling/fracking/whatever were lit from all sides by brilliant, upward-directed floodlights; however this particular tower had lights only illuminating it from one side. \u003Cem\u003EI could see the shape of the drilling tower cast upward into the sky.\u003C/em\u003E It was not foggy or hazy out, the only air pollution was whatever the crap the oil wells are releasing into the air. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then there were the places where the sky was glowing orange. That\u0027s where they are flaring/wasting the unwanted natural gas that also comes up with the oil.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was unreal. A place that was pristine and dark just a few short years ago is now lit up like New York City. I stopped for the night in Odessa, TX, where I was told I was \u0022lucky\u0022 to find a room at one of the 10 brand-new hotels that had just been built for housing all the oil workers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a reason that gas in this country is going down. We\u0027re going through a nationwide oil boom enabled by fracking. That\u0027s a good thing overall, it helps our economy and helps to put more pressure on the countries that don\u0027t like us so much. But it\u0027s coming at a price- many dark areas are NOT dark anymore. If you live in an area where fracking is going on, you can\u0027t trust your light pollution maps anymore, not unless those maps are \u003Cstrong\u003Ebrand new\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"montyben101","CreatedById":74173,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-15T18:28:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat lighting map is horrible to use... zoom is nasty\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AngelLestat","CreatedById":58968,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-15T18:36:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethe light pollution can be mitigated with appropriate luminaire and avoid over-ilumination.
