You want to be going the same speed in the same direction before you warp to it. Warp to the sun and let it pull you in the direction the target planet is moving until your vertical velocity is the same as it\u0027s velocity. Horizontal velocity seems to be really crazy when near the sun so I think you can ignore it. Sometimes it takes a few jumps. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen when you get to the target planet you might have to warp around it and use it\u0027s gravity to speed up or slow down a little. I try to warp to a spot around it where my velocity relative to the planet will put me in an orbit. Jool has very powerful gravity so you can use it to change a lot of velocity, dres or something really small just takes too long.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a good section on the github wiki that shows what you need for a micro power network. I use 3 ground stations 3km from the space center, beaming about 40 gigs or power to help takeoffs. It\u0027s good to have around 70 gigs in orbit around Kerbin. Then you can start launching trans sats to other planets that you are going to do a lot around. Depending on how the planets are aligned right now I have around 100-200 gigs around Kerbin or Jool, or any planets that are close to those. And 60 gigs beaming at Eve. Any planet you are going to land on needs at least 3 relay sats around it. I put them farther out than is suggested on the wiki, it\u0027s easier to keep them aligned and less hassle if they drift a little. Like 1000km from Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot the best picture but this is a trans sat with 2 large fusion gens using uncharged particles. It beams about 60 gigs. Most of those big liquid tanks will break away, it\u0027s on it\u0027s way to Eve. It has 2 relay sats attached that will also break away. So the power sat plus the relay sats will be the 3 around eve. It uses some of the super huge radiators they dissipate a lot of heat but don\u0027t store as much as the normal huge ones. So it has a couple of the normal huge ones too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2EOGP6s.png\u0022 alt=\u00222EOGP6s.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sisyphean\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sisyphean\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eso im having a bit of trouble.\u003Cp\u003E for some reason i cant get any antimatter. i have a collector station with 32 collectors on at 900km orbit of kirbin. my storage tanks are powered and set to charging and my collectors are saying they are producing 3.98 mg of antimatter per day and yet after 3 days i have zero antimatter. anyone tell me what ive done wrong? or is this a bug?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Escreenies of the station:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/21yPjfY\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/21yPjfY\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/WJ1LmQB\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/WJ1LmQB\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/SLEF7Yk\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/SLEF7Yk\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre those arms with the collectors connected by docking ports?

Seems like it just takes a bit of practice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne sort of related thing...and this probably revolves more around navigation skills. When I first warp to a planet, I often end up in a position that\u0027s not ideal for either the orbit or the velocity I\u0027d like to achieve. I can use the warp drive to jump to a new point, but it\u0027s difficult to tell which direction on the navball to follow to get to that point. Possibly I just need to understand this better, but my guesses as to which direction to point the vessel are only a vague, and often wrong, approximation. I think if I could set a target somewhere in empty space that lies in the direction I want to warp, I could figure it out, by pointing at the target and heading target prograde. Sadly, I don\u0027t think I can set an arbitrary target that\u0027s not an object. So within the SOI, navball 90 degrees down is directly at the planet, 90 degrees up is directly away, and the navball equator represents a plane that\u0027s perpendicular to the line connecting the vessel with the planet, I think. Beyond that I get somewhat lost, and when I\u0027m not that lost (trying to figure N/S/E/W along the navball equator, or moving away from the equator) it doesn\u0027t seem to go quite where I want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m playing with a rudimentary microwave network.

Direct conversion is for using a generators charged particles, only charged particles. There is an amount of..I think charged and thermal power displayed in the vab when looking at a gen, and it\u0027s different depending on the fuel type you are using sometimes in different reactors. It will be something like .2 charged particles and .92 thermal or something, it\u0027s not something that needs to add up to 100. AM only produces thermal, so a direct conversion gen won\u0027t produce any power from it. Direct is good for something like AIM or a fuel type with lots of charged output, because the gen can turn more of that into electricity(has a better efficiency). Most of my ships just use the thermal. You can right click a gen in the vab and switch type from solid state(thermal power) to direct conversion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlasma engines have their uses, they are great for takeoff and landing on planets that have an atmosphere, because you can use scoops to replenish the fuel(argon) when on the planet, and argon has a much higher thrust output(and lower ISP) than liquid in a plasma.

When warping somewhere remote, I have sometimes only gotten 30 thrust out of each engine(with liquid) because they need so much power. Vista\u0027s just take 2.5 gigs each, and will also each produce 1100 thrust with just that much power(if you don\u0027t push the throttle all the way they actually use the same power, and just have higher ISP). Whatever you are going to tug will to rendezvous with the tug though if it\u0027s carrying Kerbals, because neutrons or something from the vistas will kill Kerbals that are within 2.3km that aren\u0027t attached to the ship when the engines are active.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor aiming when warping, mechjeb \u002B lots of ships around planets help.

Direct Conversion genes convert charged particles produced by the reaction directly into electricity. Since a heat differential is not necessary to collect charged particles, DC genes are much more efficient. Heat is the only byproduct of AM reactions (in this game) while fusion reactors produce both charged particles and heat.

You can line your view along the ship. You want to get as close to the planet as you can, without actually hitting the atmosphere. That is very bad.

From THERE i wanna collect water to refill my Water Storage Tank. (I use water to make liqued fuel with the ISRU from the interstellar mod). i know i have to be kinda close to the coast, but what items would i need to collect the water from the sea and back to the water tank? I know the ISRU on the water could possible do the work, but i wanna keep that on land. is it possible? \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003Eother ideas are welcome too \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003ETHanks alot for viewing my post.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"undercoveryankee","CreatedById":103505,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T21:01:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Wowfreakstar\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Wowfreakstar\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EHi every1! \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003ESo i wanna go to Laythe with my spaceship and land on a small island.
