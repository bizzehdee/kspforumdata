For some reason, my visual mods started failing (one of which is \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E) for no apparent reason, so i tried installing AVP. It did work, kind of. kopernicus said a custom planetary system was not loading. yet, i dont have any. and i didnt see a plantary mod in the dependencies of AVP.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe next problem is \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E. i tried removing it to reduce GPU usage, which wasnt the problem, however, when i tried reinstalling it, the thing didnt work. it said there were no configs, except the configs are in the folder of ksp. ive installed \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E 2 times now with the same result. can someone help me with this? and the more critical problem is the kopernicus\u00A0 error, which prevents me from playing entirely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nit would be greatly appreciated if someone can help. have a good day!\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: from the menu screen, it seems \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E is not working. however, i can semi load the game (semi load as in its just the hud and a black screen) and go to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E settings, where it no longer says no configs. And also, i looked in the files of AVP and found Neidon rings, which is from a planet pack. i installed that and it still resulted in kopernicus\u00A0 saying an error resulted in the planetary system not being able to load. could this be because\u00A0 i downloaded the wrong AVP?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-05-11T06:16:51Z\u0022 title=\u002205/11/2022 06:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EMay 11, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Pandor1on\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
