Farmer, no. Farmers do Agriculture, which produces Organics (a precursor to Colony Supplies, which allow you to reset Habitation and Homesickness timers when consumed in a Medbay), so unless you\u0027re shipping substrate and water up to your station, they won\u0027t do much. Biologists do Agroponics and Cultivation, which produce Supplies, so they\u0027ll be helpful.\n\nBasically, low-end supply production (basic foodstuffs) use algae farms to create N.O.M.S. High-end stuff with farmers gives Kerbals a taste of home, with real food, is how I look at it.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-03-17T07:24:26Z\u0022 title=\u002203/17/2017 07:24  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 17, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by FirroSeranel**"},{"CreatedByName":"FirroSeranel","CreatedById":144343,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-17T07:51:50Z","Content":"I\u0027m having an odd issue where when I load the game and/or switch to a crewed vehicle with Habitation and Recycler modules, those modules are all turned off (meaning Kerbals can be on strike, or even \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Missing in action\u0022\u003EMIA\u003C/abbr\u003E or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Killed in action\u0022\u003EKIA\u003C/abbr\u003E given certain settings, through no fault of my own).\n\nInterestingly, if I switch to them, turn the modules on, then switch to another craft, even far enough away that they unload, the modules continue to function in the background.

Also recyclers, you need one good recycler like the RT-5000 to set the recycling cap and then add small recyclers (RT-500) until supply usage doesn\u0027t go down anymore (about 1 RT-500 per crew, which is 10x lighter than spamming RT-5000).\n\nFor hab time, yes you\u0027ll need to spam hitchhikers and cupolas.
