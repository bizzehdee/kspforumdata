Turn it on and try to go up, you get the thrust effects but he doesn\u0027t move. Try to jump and he can\u0027t get more then a kerbal foot off the ground. Switched back to the craft and it looked like it was showing g-force at 1 which would be kerbins gravity, not the mun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t have any planet mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLooks like maybe the gravity is not the problem because the ship can still take off with just a spark engine.
