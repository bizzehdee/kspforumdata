That will mean your WasteHeat bar will always be somewhat filled rather than ideally empty. The result will be that generator efficiency properly depends upon heat rejected and more radiators will always give some kind of efficiency advantage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERadiator ratings won\u0027t change, the VAB heat dissipation rating will simply be the maximum possible dissipation at 100% waste heat. If you keep an eye on the megawatt radiator ratings compared to the reactors rating and leave yourself some spare capacity, you won\u0027t go far wrong. Once you get the upgraded parts, you can make do with a lower proportion (maybe 50%) due to increased reactor temperatures and generator efficiencies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor solar panels, the energy flow is assumed to be in KW, since the radiators are generally dissipating MW or at least significant fractions of one then you\u0027d need a truly impressive solar array to task any radiator at all, at least near Kerbin. Of course, solar panels are tricky to deal with universally because you can move them around, a ship that has no heat problems near Kerbin could easily have problems near Moho, for example.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThorium reactors give 1.38x more power and 1.17x higher temperature, which translates to about 8% more specific impulse and about 27 % more thrust. Thorium reactors also use less than half the fuel compared to Uranium reactors but the power output will begin to drop after even a small amount of actinides accumulate, so you\u0027ll need to reprocess a lot more to maintain the power advantage - probably every few months.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-08T16:35:07Z\u0022 title=\u002212/08/2013 04:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 8, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Fractal_UK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Myrten","CreatedById":92200,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-08T19:54:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Fractal_UK\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Fractal_UK\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDid you set the compiler for .NET 3.5?
