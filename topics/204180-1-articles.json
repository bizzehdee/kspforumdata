The experience sticks with them and changes them and their behavior ever after.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn real life: A person experiences a severe dramatic test or tragedy. It changes them temporarily, making them act out of character for two weeks straight. Then slowly but surely they revert to their old self.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nBy the way, the IRL experience was my own. I have seen that in fiction, characters most often become just what is needed to enable the plot, all their ups and down have brought them to the penultimate moment to prepare them to fit the role the author had in mind all along.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo often because of that character changes stick in fiction. IRL? Not necessarily, as character development IRL is slow and often difficult too.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nMy experience occurred after the death of a family member. For two weeks straight I acted so out of character, trying to send thank you cards and gifts to people that had helped me in the past that had nothing to do with the memorial service, and one that did.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt was so strange that I literally became upset when a person refused to give me an address of one person I did not know that I wanted to send a gift to. I knew at the time that I was slowly but surely reverting back to the old me, and the newfound magnaminous generousity would not last for long.... so I was trying to use it for good while I still had it.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThr five stages of grief... really only four for me occurred in this order:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n1. Denial. Did not last longer than secibds though.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n2. Anger. Came again and again. I was sweeter toward those I felt warmth to, and those I disliked or that mistreated me in both the past and the present I tended to grow openly wrathful with... which is not my usual self.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n3. Acceptance. Death is as easy to accept as it is that we cannot fly like Superman. It is a lack of power to prevent the inevitable that we are forced to accept.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n4. Depression. This lasted the longest of them all... perhaps I was being generous in part to compensate for my own grief. It did make me feel good doing things for others.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo I guess my point is that IRL we make the plot more or less, so character development is far more fluid and changeable than fiction where characters are often static in nature and unchanging.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nReal people either get better or worse.... staying the same only lasts for a while before circumstances enforce changes they should have already made.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor example a young man or woman may eat unhealthy in their twenties, but as they age their body will force them to make dietary changes or else\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhat times in your life developed you as a character? Did the development stick or was it temporary?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
