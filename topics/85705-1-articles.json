It\u0027s forced while in the editor but once you get to the launchpad they are all individually set. I\u0027d like to be able to toggle this on or off when dealing with IR parts. I\u0027m close to giving this idea up and suggest users to use the wonderful PartWizard plugin for their non-symmetrical needs. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Diazo","CreatedById":81549,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-29T17:49:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure if I have an answer for you, but here is what I know:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn Editor:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESymmetrically set parts all refer to each other via the List\u0026lt;Part\u0026gt; symmetryCounterparts property.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor four way symmetry, each part in the symmetry has the other 3 parts in that list, there is no \u0027parent\u0027 part to the symmetry as far as I am aware.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause of that, I speculate that under the hood in code, there is an event that fires every time any value on the part (including in it\u0027s partModules) changes that updates all other parts in the symmetryCounterparts list to match. I am not aware of any way to stop this update from happening or that any of this is exposed where a mod can access it. Note that this updating of symmetryCounterparts does not seem to carry down past the partModule level, this is why actions assigned to action groups do not update correctly when you change the symmetry on a part you have assigned actions on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other possibility is that under the hood there is only a single part and that the symmetryCounterparts list acts as a \u0022clone-location\u0027 type thing where the same part is displayed multiple times in the Editor. I consider this unlikely however based on my own experiences with symmetry for my Action Groups mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have not checked out any of the mods that remove symmetry (StripSymmetry is the one I remember) to see how they handle the situation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn Flight:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn flight each part is its own self-contained part regardless of the symmetry settings as you have noted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe interesting bit however is that symmetryCounterparts is still populated, if you want you can affect all parts in symmetry with the selected part by referencing this list.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL;DR: In answer to your question, I do not believe it is possible to affect data stored in a partModule for a single part in a symmetry placement in the Editior without removing the symmetry via StripSymmetry or similar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ED.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedit: It looks like all PartWizard does in terms of symmetry is add/remove parts from the symmetryCounterparts list. That supports the theory that each part in symmetry is its own part and the data across all parts in the symmetry update any time data on one of the parts changes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-29T17:57:25Z\u0022 title=\u002209/29/2014 05:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 29, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Diazo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sirkut","CreatedById":57229,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-29T18:36:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI figured as much Diazo but I just wanted a second opinion/view on the matter.
