It didn\u0027t even produce all that much heat.\n\nI\u0027d have expected it to burn up or break apart but nothing happened. Now I wonder if this is just some freak phenomenon that applies to small probes or if it is something that could theoretically be (ab)used for general reentry.\n\nHere are some pictures of what I did: [http://imgur.com/a/G0iOW](http://imgur.com/a/G0iOW)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-21T20:20:46Z\u0022 title=\u002206/21/2015 08:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by rofltehcat**"},{"CreatedByName":"Old Foxboy","CreatedById":141736,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-21T14:58:55Z","Content":"The probe is too small.
