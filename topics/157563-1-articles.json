This mod relies exclusively on the the AWESOME Telemachus mod to pull KSP data from the game and provide it externally over http. \u00A0While designing new features to KSP-PAO, I realized that some of them I had been planning on being part of the externalized portion of the code in JavaScript - I realized that \u00A0I could include some of it \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EIN GAME \u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003Eas another mod so that other people could use it, and I could get some new\u00A0experience.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe functionality I\u0027ve\u00A0started playing with is a kerbal biography generator. The game keeps interesting stats on Kerbals that my KSP-PAO should talk about, but what about... where they were \u003Cu\u003Eborn\u003C/u\u003E? or went to \u003Cu\u003Eschool\u003C/u\u003E.. or what \u003Cu\u003Edegree\u003C/u\u003E(s) they obtained?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe next version of KSP\u00A0has been Internationalized and localized (a process which I have professional experience with) and I wanted to create a way todynamically and consistently create Kerbal biographies in ANY language. So, I\u0027ve started designing the code to be able to just that. Eventually this mode will allow you to look at the mini-biographies of any of your Kerbals and utilizing the string tables for localized versions\u00A0for all the KSP supported languages.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Kerbal Chronicle contest really got me thinking about the backgrounds and back stories of not only the four veteran Kerbals, but all of the Wily, Thermin and Belka Kermins out there!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll be documenting the development of the mod here on the forums. \u00A0All that being said, when the next\u00A0version of KSP comes out, I\u0027d like to know how/learn to\u00A0to....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nget the list\u00A0of all the localized name pre-fixes and suffixes, and their appropriate enumerators.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nget the list of all the localized location names in KSP (DSN names and contract locations)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, I\u0027ll be asking for help with:.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\ngetting some localized grammar structures for three or four sentences I\u0027ll be heavily reusing.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n...and eventually some great suggestions and additions to the list institutions of higher learning\u00A0I\u0027ve started. The list currently includes:\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cul style=\u0022margin-left:40px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nKerdue University (more Kerbonauts have graduated from here than any other school!)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe Kerbin Institute of Science\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nJoolian Polytechnic.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll be also be learning how to create/use some in game UI elements for the first time. Eventually, my KSP-PAO will use this mod, via Telemachus, to read out the biographies of Kerbals from time to time, during a launch or EVA.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rock3tman_","CreatedById":158421,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-10T15:33:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI love this idea!
