I carefully design my rockets, so the stages will burn in atmosphere. At least theoretically. But once i entered tracking station, and had chosen to view debris, only to find, that some of the debris with periapsis below 25 km, is still there!. How that can be? I checked if the debris was from the last launch, as the orbit could somehow not decay by one revolution, but, no it was from the old spacecraft, and the debris was orbiting several times around kerbin, until the moment i checked it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo my question is: Does the debris is physically simulated while i don\u0027t view it/make it active vessel? And if it\u0027s simulated then why does aerobraking is not working?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-24T03:49:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0027s going on is, when an object passes outside the physics range of your active craft (~2.3km), that object is put \u0022on rails\u0022 and becomes a data point in a fixed orbit. Unless it either enters another body\u0027s sphere of influence, collides with the parent body, or (on planets with an atmosphere) passes below the point of 0.01 atmospheric pressure (~23.1km for Kerbin), it remains in that orbit, and no physics is simulated for that object.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bilfr3d","CreatedById":75448,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-24T04:04:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI never even knew that...
