However, most scientific experiments grant me 0 science (All reports while landed/splashed at Earth). Is this a bug or intended (its still called \u0027Kerbin\u0027 in the laboratory). And how is it possible to get me through the carreer this way? Or is it just not intended to use it without Realism Overhaul (I installed that one, but was a bit dazzled by all the new options and things).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother question, what will happend when I install RSS to my normal KSP directory, will the saves I have going in the Kerbal solar system get bugged?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThanks alot!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MaxL_1023","CreatedById":152317,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-09T22:00:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn RSS you get no science from the surface of the earth - I am pretty sure that is intentional. You have a lot more science instruments though (Geiger-Muller, Micrometeorite and Telemetry Scan for example) so you get more once you launch something.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-09T22:01:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. I had thought that the zero science landed/splashed was something we did in RP-0, not RSS itself.

If you do load a save it will--a lot of the orbits will be under the surface of the planet after loading, so all those craft will be destroyed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CitizenVeen","CreatedById":154777,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-10T16:45:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks guys!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI dont have RP-0 installed (which mod is that?), and all the extra science experiments are in Realism Overhaul I think, but I only installed RSS (just increasing the planets and changing their looks to match Earth, Mars etc.), but I guess they are balanced to work togheter, not saparate...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-10T22:57:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOhhh I see the problem.
