I am not sure if this qualifies as support as its not a bug or a glitch or anything acting up with the game. I have put a station into orbit in my sandbox save file, and it is working wonderfully. I want to put the same station into orbit in my career mode save, but, would prefer to NOT launch this thing a 2nd time, as it causes nearly 100 debris items go flying off in all directions once I cut its supports away with explosive bolts. Is there a way \u0026lt;i am sure there is, but, I am not familiar with editing the save file beyond speeding up jeb, bill and bob\u0027s returns from the grave lol\u0026gt; to do take the station in ORBIT and transfer it via like copy/paste to career mode?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOH to the lovely moderator staff: if you feel this needs to go to support, feel free to transplant this \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethanks\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedit: not sure why it went into italics near the end, there is no [ I][/ I] in the text lol\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: 130 views and not a peep?
