It\u0027s going to go through a bit of a revamp soon, but currently you can do simulations for a large range of time limits (with increasing costs), can start them at any time, and can start them either landed on Kerbin or in orbit around any planet/moon you\u0027ve visited. When I rework them in the next update you will also be able to start simulations landed on any planet. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimulations cost funds based on the time, celestial body chosen, and cost of the vessel (smaller ones are cheaper), and anything that happens during a simulation doesn\u0027t get kept.

I\u0027d also like to see it tied in with science - the more information you have on a planetary body, the more accurate the simulator becomes. For example, in planning an Eve mission, you might initially just have very rough guess about the gravity and atmospheric dynamics, but if you sent a probe out and reported some readings back, the simulation would become much more accurate.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-14T16:35:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe visuals should be 3D wireframe on a monochrome screen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EOnly kind of joking.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-14T16:37:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESeriously though.
