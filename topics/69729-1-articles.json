I\u0027m sure it\u0027d help, but evenly distributed weight throughout your body is not exactly the same as weight you wear on your body. One problem that jumps immediately to mind is blood circulation. You heart has to constantly combat gravity to pump blood into your brain and out of your legs. At 40% gravity, heart wouldn\u0027t have to work nearly as hard. That can cause all sorts of problems, including serious ones like arrhythmia. It might be possible to offset that with exercises, of course, and it might be possible to deal with all of the effects of 40% gravity, but my point is that it\u0027s not going to be as simple as wearing a weighted suit. Though, that may be a start.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENibb31, there are, without a doubt, problems with low gravity. What we don\u0027t know is how severe they are, and which ones are reversible.
