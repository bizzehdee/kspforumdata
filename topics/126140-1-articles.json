Also, it\u0026#39;s not like you\u0026#39;re getting outstanding capability in exchange for this - apart from aerobatics perhaps - they have no cargo and don\u0026#39;t go to space.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIncidentally, I\u0026#39;m working on my first aircraft since the 1.05 patch, just a mark 1 testbed to try out wings that are pre-pitched with incidence. It\u0026#39;s meant to be a no-compromise, super efficient airframe, but I honestly think it\u0026#39;s way easier to take off and land than the Ravenspear. It\u0026#39;s also rather crashworthy, which helps.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[URL]https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BworS5V0CvPcNEU5UDktN3NJY0U/view?usp=sharing[/URL]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[URL=\u0022http://s1144.photobucket.com/user/narostel/media/2015-11-22_00005_zpsjqjlub9h.jpg.html\u0022][IMG]http://i1144.photobucket.com/albums/o492/narostel/2015-11-22_00005_zpsjqjlub9h.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nMostly, Jeb flies this when he wants to go Skiing.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[URL=http://s1144.photobucket.com/user/narostel/media/2015-11-23_00020_zpsf184zvft.jpg.html][IMG]http://i1144.photobucket.com/albums/o492/narostel/2015-11-23_00020_zpsf184zvft.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut it is capable of reaching higher altitudes.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nMy method (not necessarily the best, i\u0026#39;m still learning to fly this plane)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n1. apply nose up trim 2 notches from max\u003Cbr\u003E\n2. set prograde on autopilot\u003Cbr\u003E\n3. press 1 to start the Rapier and throttle up\u003Cbr\u003E\n4. the natural initial climb rate seems to be about 50m/s and 20 deg pitch, the autopilot has a tendency to hunt up and down below 5km, so you may want to apply your own inputs to supplement the AP and damp out the zoom climbs it likes to do.\u003Cbr\u003E\n5. the AP will take you supersonic at some time between 10km and 16km depending on phugoids. I prefer to apply manual inputs and keep the nose up , delay supersonic till 16km, i think it saves fuel\u003Cbr\u003E\n6. once you\u0026#39;re reaching 290 or so, you\u0026#39;re crossing the sound barrier, get it over with as fast as possible to avoid loosing too much to drag. release the back stick inputs until 430 or so, then back stick again to come out of the resulting dive\u003Cbr\u003E\n7. once you\u0026#39;ve levelled off, press ALT \u002B X to set the TRIM back to neutral.\u003Cbr\u003E\n8. it should climb and accelerate by itself, hitting 1000 m/s by 20km up.\u003Cbr\u003E\n9. at this point you want to level off a bit and reach 1200 before passing 23km when the engines really start to loose power, but in practice i\u0026#39;ve not managed that yet.\u003Cbr\u003E\n10. i usually end up overshooting past flameout altitude (29.5km) , but your second dip into the atmosphere should take you over 1200. Just don\u0026#39;t drop too low, stay above 20km at all costs or you\u0026#39;ll blow up.\u003Cbr\u003E\n11. Finally, you will pass your flameout altitude again at \u0026gt; 1200. Now press 2 to ignite the nuke. Be prepared for a slow, slow trip to orbit. Overheating is a worry, because we\u0026#39;re doing this without using any oxidiser at all, you might want to pitch up a little bit, above 1400 m/sec you do not want to drop below 30km,\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-23T05:47:51Z\u0022 title=\u002211/23/2015 05:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by AeroGav\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"2001kraft","CreatedById":120475,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-23T06:01:55Z","Content":"\nFinally, for a complete experience, purchase the feature-complete empty craft file for only $0.00!\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe package includes:\u003Cbr\u003E\n- no more problems to fix\u003Cbr\u003E\n- freedom\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u017E\u00C2\u00A2\u003Cbr\u003E\n- ability to build a normal, useful aircraft\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nOrder now and get a Kerbal test pilot for an additional $99.99!\u003Cbr\u003E\nCall 1-800-CRAFTFILE now!\u003Cbr\u003E\nThat\u0026#39;s One Eighthundred Craftfile!\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nP.S.

After landing, hit the brakes and then pull up. At high speed, that is mainly because it will pull your nose up and thus increase drag. At lower speed, it\u0026#39;s a combination of drag on the elevator itself, plus adding a force on the rear landing gear which improves traction -- your brakes are more effective.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n2. Before landing, you can bleed off speed by pulling up hard, then going back into a descent just in time to avoid stalling. The danger is that if you do stall, you\u0026#39;ll be too low to recover but too high to land softly (that cost me a materials sample just recently; the rest of the plane survived).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSimilarly I am too impatient for a civilian-style half-hour descent, so I dive from 10km to 500m or so and pull hard. I\u0026#39;ll be going about Mach 0.8 and *bam* I drop the speed to 70 m/s, pulling 10g\u0026#39;s. Or if I misjudge, *bam* zero m/s and lots of explosions. YMMV.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n3.
