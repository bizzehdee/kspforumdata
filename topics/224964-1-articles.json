However, it appears they do not work with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E: using the parts produces the wrong aerodynamic center icon (it has lift) and it causes some nasty aerodynamics issues.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know, in principle, how to fix it by looking at my existing mods and how they created \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E compatibility. I have searched the forums, and the firespitter thread seems non-existent and the ColdWarAerospace thread has no mentions of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E or Ferram.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am wondering what to do though if, since you aren\u0027t the mod author, you do not know how to fill out the chord sweep, chord length and all those details.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nI see that B9ProcWings does not define such for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E, and simply says \u0022ForceUseMeshes = True.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWould this approach work for the aforementioned 2 mods as a potentially hacky fix to this user\u0027s problems?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
