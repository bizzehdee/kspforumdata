I have a tempature increasing every frame by a bit in a function which runs every frame by the if-statement in the onUpdate() function. For some reason the onUpdate isn\u0027t called even once after I load it to the editor. Also, I would like to see how I could make it not explode in the editor, which it would probably do if I would get this working. Also it should use 1 Electric matter and 20 Antimatter every second. HOW DO I DO THAT. HELP. SOrry if this post contains bad English.
