But the only things I got were, Convertotron 250, Convertotron 125, small holding tank, the GRAVMAX thing, and something that says radial holding tank, but has a picture of the drill. when I go to build I could use this piece and when I launched a small structure (command module and the drill/radial holding tank) to test it acted as if it were the size and shape of the drill, but only had the properties of the radial holding tank. Also, to be clear, the drill is extended rather than closed. Has anybody seen this before?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ultimate Steve","CreatedById":161505,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-13T21:22:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is odd.
