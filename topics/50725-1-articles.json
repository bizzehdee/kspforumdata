Fuel lines are like struts except they are yellow and they have a specific flow direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen placed, fuel will flow through a fuel line from the first point placed to the second point.

If you hold down the alt key and click on two different tanks on the same craft, then you are presented with a menu which allows you to tranfer the resources. This works on all containers like RCS, Xenon, and even batteries.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is how you can refuel a craft by docking with another one that has fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThats basically it in a nutshell hope this helps.
