I just spent over half an hour building a large wing with tanks that got attached radial when I started and I didn\u0060t notice it. When I wanted to finish both wings with struts I found out that I can no longer mirror struts on the wings. That made me slightly upset but I thought I can just detach the whole thing and reattach it with the right symmetry mode but that\u0060s the moment when the game decided to say \u0022.... you\u0022 and simply won\u0060t attach the wings at all. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach wing had maybe 20 parts on it, the editor started to lag heavily and when I tried to attach them they were shown attached for like 1 second and then detached immediately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince I use Editor Extensions I have known this functionality for a long time and it worked wonderfully while it was still part of the mod but the way Squad implemented it just doesn\u0060t seem to work. I don\u0060t really need it that often so I would really like to know if there is a way to disable this feature in the configs or wherever?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way I never had this problem while building in the VAB, it only happened in the SPH. In fact I don\u0060t remember ever being able to attach things with mirror attachment in the VAB when I tried since 0.90.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Engineer of Stuff","CreatedById":106757,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-28T19:36:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPress \u0027R\u0027 to change the attachment mode.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Keras","CreatedById":114511,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-28T19:55:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Engineer Of Stuff\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Engineer Of Stuff\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EPress \u0027R\u0027 to change the attachment mode.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I said, once a part is attached you can not attach parts to that with a different symmetry mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis means that since the wing was incorrectly attached in radial mode I can not attach struts to it in mirror mode.
