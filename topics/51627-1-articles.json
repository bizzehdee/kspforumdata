(And believe me, I am a huge fan of Nuke-It-Lots plans).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever and somewhat contrasting with the first statement, 250km, isn\u0027t -that- big.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI mean. Make no mistake, it\u0027s an extinction event for the unprepared.

Scotland.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt reasonable speeds I think thats far from planet disintegrating.

I guess, someone would have to try to make some sort of closed loop ecosystem/biosphere underground, send a couple of construction equipment that eat lunar regolith and spit stuff and send a couple of colonists and tell them that they are soon are going to be the only surviving humans in the universe and somehow must learn to colonize the moon and then system, with naught but a couple of rocks and 3d printers from the sounds of it. Also that after the impact there might be a bit of a fragment rain and that the moon has no atmosphere to stop them. No pressure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, that would actually be my plan \u0022B\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMuch more worth looking into, would be plan \u0022A\u0022 which would be surviving... right on Earth!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I said, 250km isn\u0027t -that- big. It is not going to turn the entire crust into lava or something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy first thought is Underground, fully sealed cities, with nuclear reactors and stuff. Someone could definitely do that in a much larger scale than the moon, and cuts off the super hard \u0022escaping the damn gravity well\u0022 bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Underground\u0022 is probably a terrible idea tho, since small as it might be, the impact would probably create the MOTHER OF ALL EARTHQUAKES. So perhaps floating city-ark things instead. If the ejecta rain is calculated to be very bad, then perhaps that could be, submersible float city ark things! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is going to be a redunkulous amount of heat released from the impact, so all the more reason to make them submergible in fact. Heat amounts so great, a good chunk of the oceans would probably evaporate. So all the more reasons to be nice and cosy inside your water cooled, submergible city arks. (this actually makes for an awesome sci-fi universe)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt that point humanity would be split into two factions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEpic city ships, roaming the dark oceans, under a dark sky, which would remain so for over a 1000 years. Wither the atmosphere would remain breathable, or wither the oceans would fully evaporate would make a huge difference. Interestingly, after the heat wave, they\u0027d basically have to deal with a total ice age. Everything is going to be concentrated around the warmth of the nuclear reactor hearts of the city ships. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd much smaller, tinier, population on the moon, with a great view.
