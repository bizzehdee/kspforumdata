The problem I am having is that, my floating Laythe base seems to crash into the water whenever I load it from another scene. That is, if I load the quicksave file, the ship is fine (I quicksaved directly after landing it), but after I switch scenes, say to an orbiting ship, and then switch back to the base, the ship appears slightly above the waterline, crashes into the water, and then the exterior parts break due to splashing down hard. I have tried save-file editing to change the status of the ship to \u0022splashed\u0022 and I have also tried changing the \u0022alt\u0022 value on the ship, but to no avail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI figured I would attach my persistence file, hopefully someone will be able to diagnose my problem! Here is a link to my persistence file: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/50345936/persistent.sfs\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/50345936/persistent.sfs\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
