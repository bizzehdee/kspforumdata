To my mind that means the ablator isn\u0027t doing enough. I figured the temp would stay down until most of the ablator was gone. Maybe it\u0027s because RO combined the CM and Heatshield into a single part? I mean, it was a successful landing but coming within 40 degrees of blowing up and with more then 99.5% of the ablator left to burn off, just seems like the ablator isn\u0027t doing what it\u0027s supposed to.\u003Cp\u003EAs for the fairings, so far I\u0027ve been using the pre-built FASA Saturn iB Apollo and FASA Saturn V Apollo Lunar craft files so I haven\u0027t had to build the craft myself.

For the real Apollo, only a few (dozen?) kg of ablator mass was actually lost, so you\u0027re seeing the correct amount lost. A substantial portion of the ablator acts to shield the rest of the capsule from the heat of re-entry.

Looking back, I would probably set the max temp a bit higher to allow a higher rate of ablator loss, rather than the part exploding.

I just did a reentry. Normally when I do a reentry, I turn on Descent mode and SAS and with the Mercury and Gemini capsules, there was enough RCS fuel to get me down without issue. But with the Apollo I used up all the RCS fuel while I was still over 70km up. Still managed to land fine but the capsule turned sideways which I think resulting in high G\u0027s for the reentry (maxed at 5.8 which was higher then my Gemini capsule sustained).\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe RCS thrusters on the Gemini \u0026amp; Apollo are \u0027re-entry orientation thrusters\u0027 meant to be controlled manually.

I get that there is more ablator then absolutely required but if I\u0027m quickly approaching maxtemp, and staying basically at maxtemp, wouldn\u0027t you burn off more then 0.4%?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd shouldn\u0027t the ablator be keeping you below maxtemp since it is supposed to be cooling as it ablates? During my reentry trials I was seeing the same amount of ablator loss whether I reached maxtemp (and therefore exploded) or stayed at 99% of maxtemp. I get that coming in too steeply would cause the pod to heat up faster than the ablation could shed heat. But by that same note, I would think that coming in just slightly too steep would result in more ablation loss (even if the end result was still exploding) then if you came in on the proper trajectory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the RCS, I understand what they are for. I\u0027m just pointing out that the RCS thrusters on the CM seem to use up fuel a whole lot faster than the RCS thrusters on the Gemini. I guess what I\u0027m asking is, were the RCS on the Apollo CM really 3.72x more powerful (0.4137kN vs 0.1112kN), and less effecient (100-100isp vs 100-283isp), than the RCS on the Gemini? Actually, the isp might be the issue. I\u0027m guessing that the Apollo wasn\u0027t supposed to have 100-100isp which is what the information panel is telling me. But when I go into debug and look at the actual part in the database, I see an atmosphericCurve for the ModuleRCSFX of:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ekey = 1 100\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ekey = 1 275\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe my issue is just that there is a bug in how the atmosphericCurve is being updated?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I thought I should add, I tested on a clean install of KSP with just RO, RP-0, all required (but no recommended or suggested) mods, plus FASA and got the same result. The Apollo CM RCS thrusters have a 100sl ISP and 100vac ISP.

Different fuels have thrust multipliers, so a 111 Newton thruster might have 7 Newtons with Nitrogen by 80 Newtons with Hydrazine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) In your situation, you had a several ton craft being maneuvered by a 7 Newton thruster.... wholly insufficient. I recommend creating clusters of RCS thrusters until you gain the tech to use higher thrust fuels.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MatterBeam","CreatedById":133334,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-02T01:58:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there ANY way to edit the avionics capabilities of the various probes?
