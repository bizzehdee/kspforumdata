An example would be landing on the Mun.\n\nSo i need your help, how do you land on the mun with maximum efficiency taking with you the most science possible.\n\nNote: only early career and rentry advice would help\n\nThanks!![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-15T23:20:29Z\u0022 title=\u002206/15/2015 11:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MokieMan**"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-15T22:35:16Z","Content":"To the Mun:\n\n1. launch to lowest possible circular LKO\n\n2. do a single prograde burn that takes you to the lowest possible periapsis on the Mun\n\n3. at munar periapsis, burn retrograde to circularize\n\n4. at appropriate place, do a small retro burn to lower your trajectory into the surface at the desired spot\n\n5. suicide burn to surface.\n\nGrab all the science that you can. Crew report, EVA, surface sample, every science instrument.\n\nHomeward from the Mun:\n\n1. launch and immediately turn due east, burn to lowest possible circular munar orbit\n\n2. at appropriate spot, do single prograde burn to give you a munar escape and take your Kerbin periapsis to ~32 km\n\n3. aerobrake and land"},{"CreatedByName":"Orbital Vagabond","CreatedById":145561,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-15T22:35:45Z","Content":"Well, maximum efficiency is going to require tech beyond early career. So, trying to give advice within your requested parameters: \n\n\\*Take as many science experiments as you can with you. \n\n\\*Suicide burn to land\n\n\\*Aim for surface TWR on the Mun of ~ 2 (No higher than 3, and no less than 1.5). \n\n\\*Take a scientist with you the lander, and try to hop between a few biomes on the surface of the Mun\n\n\\*Skip the Mun and hit Minmus for way more science for less effort. All previous advice remains consistent, except don\u0027t worry about your TWR\n\nHope that helps."},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T00:10:49Z","Content":"Depending on your experience, I suggest *not* aiming for maximum efficiency if you\u0027re new to some stuff, but rather over-design a little to give yourself some room when anything unexpected happens (which is more likely to happen when not experienced)\n\nFor science, I suggest just to make sure surface sample and material bay (aka science jr) are done. It doesn\u0027t matter too much if you miss one or two other instruments - instead of struggling getting a particular late instrument for your mission, most of the time it\u0027s better off just reaching Mun/Minmus as early as possible, and grab science with the equipment you have."}]}
