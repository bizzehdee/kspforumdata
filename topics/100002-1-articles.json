At least the other two are called \u0022Modular Girder Segment\u0022s and not struts. Though we already have things in the game called Girders and while they serve a similar purpose they have very different appearances.\n\nThis kind of junk was okay when Squad was futzing around in Early Access, but they\u0027re about to release the game and these (and a thousand other little problems) are the things that make the game roughshod and confusing.\n\n**EDIT:** I checked and girders aren\u0027t named \u0022girder.\u0022 They\u0027re named I-Beam which is fine.

Hence, \u0027cubic\u0027. It\u0027s like a cube. I always took the naming scheme the be the Octagonal Strut came first, then kerbal scientists made a version that looked more like a cube, and being kerbals, called it a cubic octagonal strut. It\u0027s the Cubic version of the Octagonal Strut (but there\u0027s no excuse for the Strut part.. they\u0027re trusses. EDIT: Though they\u0027re manufactured by StrutCo. I think actually StrutCo is confused as to what they\u0027re making...).
