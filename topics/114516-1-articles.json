For one, ISRU is in the stock game now. Two, Karbonite has pretty much overtaken it as the mod option for ISRU.\n\nWhich is a shame, naturally, because Kethane is one of those mods that hits right in the nostalgia."},{"CreatedByName":"ezequielandrush","CreatedById":144736,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T04:27:45Z","Content":"Thanks for the quick reply!\n\nI am relatively new to KSP, but Kethane was love at first sight for me and it\u0027s a pity we can\u0027t use it anymore....\n\nThanks and good gaming!"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T05:20:44Z","Content":"Mod question moved to the mod subforums."}]}
