By this I mean wheels that attach directly to an axel, instead of having to have these weird attachment systems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI bet this would be a very popular parts mod. The current rover wheels are not compatible with many aesthetic aspects of car-like constructions etc. I myself have no skills in modding KSP so I am simply throwing this out there as an idea. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe it would be possible to make a few variations aswell. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- A variety with no steering, with just a direct attachment to an axel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- A variety with just steering.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- A variety with steering and an electric motor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- A variety with two attachment points so can be used as stack-connected parts. (Like double tires in lorries)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe it is easiest to make them into a single part with tweakable options, but these are the options I would like to see. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, if they could be made to look more like modern car tires...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tweety","CreatedById":115567,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-17T08:19:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think I\u0027ve ever seen modern car like tyres on any real life rover. Regardless you can make a decent enough axle in stock by using one of the radial decouplers on the bottom of the \u0027chassis\u0027 and snapping on 2 girders and then the medium dark grey wheels. You then have the shock absorbers in the wheels plus the single axle roll that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had a screenshot somewhere of one I made as I described.
