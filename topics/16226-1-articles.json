How could he have been so stupid?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut as he went through the last day\u0027s events, they made a perfect--if terrible--sense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore Lem took the lander down to the planet, he had surreptitiously taken one of the keys from the main engine interlock. It was the right thing to do. There was a reason Jeb had never been promoted to Commander; as amazing as his piloting skills may be, he couldn\u0027t be trusted with authority. If he had left Jeb that key, he was sure the orbiter would have been long gone by the time he returned from the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen the lander\u0027s antenna had stuck. The lander had come down hard--those engines were still a problem--a connection had broken, and the key was the perfect tool to bridge the gap. His foresight in bringing the key had saved the day again. Of course, he wouldn\u0027t forget the key--he wrote \u0022GET KEY\u0022 in huge letters on the cover of the ascent checklist.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then, as he was making his way back from the frozen Ammonia lake, it happened. His radio crackled with a warning tone and a recorded \u0022fuel low\u0022 message. There was a leak. It had been leaking since he hit the surface, he was sure, and it must have been too slow for him to notice earlier. He raced back to the lander, powered up the engine--there was no time to follow the checklist--and shot back to the orbiter as fast as the engine would take him.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven then, it wasn\u0027t enough. The engine ran dry before he had reached orbit. Fortunately, he had enough RCS propellant to finish his rendezvous, but it was a close thing. He climbed back aboard the orbiter to cheers and pats on the back...and then...it hit him.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe had been an idiot. Had he simply left the lander on the surface, he could have recharged his maneuvering pack, grabbed the key, and flown up to meet the orbiter. His older brother had escaped from the Mun using an EVA pack, and orbiting Minmus was far easier. Losing the rock samples and photos would have been a small price to pay. But now...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe would have to attempt it. There was no other way. If his brother could do it...still, this would be even harder. His destination was well south of their current equatorial orbit, and he had to not only reach the surface, but do so with enough fuel to return to the orbiter. It would take a miracle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObjective: Return to the lander on the surface of Minmus. Operate the antenna (ladder).

The idea behind the Minmus mission is that there is a \u0027key\u0027 located in the lander down on the surface (not the ascent stage floating next to the orbiter), and that key must be obtained before you can fire the orbiter\u0027s engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe most straightforward method would be to drop a Kerbal from the orbiter to the landing site, then fly back up to the orbiter.
