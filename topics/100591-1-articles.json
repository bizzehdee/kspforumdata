You lock in a target relative to your current position, the drive \u0027spins-up\u0027 for some amount of time, then you are translated directly to the target location. You retain your previous inertia. (I\u0027m basically talking about an instant-travel version of the Alcubierre drive from the Interstellar mod.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, the topic I want to discuss is the navigational mechanics of using this drive. Let\u0027s say you\u0027re warping home from another star system, and the relative speed you enter the Sol System with is extreme. Unfortunately, your main thrusters are offline for some reason. We need to use the gravity of celestial objects for thrust in order to put ourselves into LEO for rendezvous with a rescue/repair vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the simple way to do this would be to use the sun\u0027s gravity to bleed off our entry velocity, then warp around the sun a bit more in order to get near Earth velocity, then warp to Earth and do some corrections to get into a proper orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, there\u0027s another major problem that needs dealt with: you have a studio pass for the new Red Dwarf / Firefly crossover that begins filming \u003Cem\u003Etomorrow\u003C/em\u003E.

So, you emerge from interstellar warp in the solar corona and \u0022fall\u0022 straight up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo bend your course to match your target, dont be EXACTLY straight up- the horizontal momentum you\u0027ll keep as you bleed the vertical.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022einsteiner\u0022 data-cite=\u0022einsteiner\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf you can truly warp anywhere you want, you can warp deep into the sun\u0027s gravity well such that your velocity points away from the sun, and use its gravity to slow down. When you have the velocity you want you warp out to LEO with just the right velocity to be in a nice, circular orbit.\u003Cp\u003ETo find the optimal maneuver you take the final velocity you want minus the velocity you have to find the velocity you need. You warp to the proximity of the sun with sun\u0027s gravity pulling toward that dV vector. To do this fast you want to be as close to the sun as possible. If you can survive being right on the surface you will get an acceleration of 274.0 m/s^2, decreasing as you fly \u0022up\u0022 away from the sun. Use the time spent flying up to spool up your jump drive. If you need more dV use it to jump back down to the surface of the sun and repeat until you have the velocity you need, then jump to LEO. You can adjust the amount of dV you get per jump by jumping further from the sun. Your crew won\u0027t experience any g-forces since you\u0027ll be in free-fall the whole time. You\u0027re only limited by how close you can get to the sun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis whole thing obviously violates conservation of energy and momentum, but so does the jump drive. \u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou two are thinking about what I\u0027m thinking about, but the approach described could have problems because the target is in motion while the gravity maneuver is taking place. (This is where I\u0027m chewing on it.) If the solar gravity maneuver took almost the whole day, for instance, then the Earth will have moved through its orbit by slightly less than a degree, which means that the velocity vector on arrival could be incorrect. A single degree probably isn\u0027t a huge hairy deal, but if the target were a faster moving body then the change could be fatal. For instance, if the target were the moon then a single day would include a near 1 degree change from the Earth\u0027s orbit as well as a 12 degree change from the moon\u0027s orbit. Aditionally, when entering foreign systems, the parent body may be less massive and the maneuvers could take a lot longer, meaning that the target position will have changed more drastically.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I\u0027m trying to sort out in my mind is: If I set up the maneuver such that it works for the target\u0027s current position, then the time the maneuver takes will make it incorrect, but if I calculate that time and then aim for the target\u0027s expected position then there\u0027s a decent chance that the new maneuver will take a different amount of time and again be incorrect (though probably closer to correct). It seems like there\u0027s an in-between solution there that will give a \u0027correct\u0027 solution, but I don\u0027t know how to get at that formulaically. There\u0027s an absolute minimum distance to the star determined by heat level and gravitation tolerance. Orignially I was thinking that the effect of gravity would be more severe when the craft was moving away faster, but then I actually engaged my brain and realized that the force due to gravity is not affected by relative velocity, but only by distance. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow that I\u0027m thinking about it again, I just realized that the direction of velocity is very nearly irrelevant unless you\u0027re aiming for a specific direction of orbit. As long as speed relative to the target body is correct, you can simply warp to the correct position to turn it into a circular orbit. -.-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat being the case, I guess the optimal solution would simply be to warp to the nearest safe position to the parent body that puts it retrograde and then it just becomes a matter of determining how often is the most efficient to warp back to that position rather than simply coasting. Eventually you\u0027ll reach the relative speed required and can just translate to the correct orbital position immediately. That approach actually has a decently sized safety-window, as well, because you\u0027ll transition through the higher speeds that simply correspond to higher orbits. The only thing to watch out for would be to make sure that you don\u0027t pass through the window too near to the parent body, where it may pass too quickly for a precise jump.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-25T18:05:31Z\u0022 title=\u002202/25/2015 06:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Khatharr\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PB666","CreatedById":107380,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T18:55:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Khatharr\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Khatharr\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E If I set up the maneuver such that it works for the target\u0027s current position, then the time the maneuver takes will make it incorrect, but if I calculate that time and then aim for the target\u0027s expected position then there\u0027s a decent chance that the new maneuver will take a different amount of time and again be incorrect (though probably closer to correct).
