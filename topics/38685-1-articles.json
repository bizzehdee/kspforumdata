I did not pay attention to the crew loadout yet. The spaceplane eventually crashed. Thats not a big deal, I thought, happened dozens of times before. Except now, I suddenly have a Crew member who is permanently dead. Not just any crew member, either, but the most iconic of all Kerbals.

If a kerbal was killed, their status code was changed to \u00273\u0027, only used for dead kerbals, and their \u0027ToD\u0027 field was changed to the time that they were killed at. They still stayed in the persistence file, though, even as replacements were added.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe functionality itself really hasn\u0027t changed, just the particular implementation of it, and they\u0027ve added a UI that lets you see the stuff that was already there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d been looking at it in notepad anyway... I do manual persistence and craft file hacking occasionally, usually to fix something that broke. (IE: Earlier I hacked a craft file to remove mod parts from it, to determine which one was breaking the game. It was mechjeb, as it turned out, since fixed).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Just to point out, the only really \u0027new\u0027 thing that isn\u0027t just a UI, mechanics-wise, is that it gives you a list of kerbals and lets you pick which ones to put on the flight team, instead of just automatically generating a new one when it was needed.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-25T11:05:44Z\u0022 title=\u002207/25/2013 11:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 25, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Tiron\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ASnogarD","CreatedById":70903,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-25T11:08:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou guys seriously crying because you lost Jeb / Bill / Bob ?
