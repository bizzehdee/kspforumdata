Tracks off a modern MBT(M1A2 Abrams, Leo2A6, Challenger II, JGSDF Type 10, Russian T-90, etc). 60 ton weight limit, blisteringly fast.

There\u0027s something in that plugin that does the splashing effects, but I never really liked them much. For starters, when \u0022floating\u0022 on the water, you do not need to see or hear a \u0022big splash\u0022 every time the simulation detects that you\u0027re touching water and not-stationary.

Thus, your camera would collide with the underside of the water and not clip back to the over-world. at least, that\u0027s how I gathered it. I never really bothered with subs considering that KSP is about space and planetary surfaces, but with so little detail in kerbin\u0027s above-water world, I decided it was unlikely that the bottom of the sea was detailed enough to bother, if it even had a collider for the landscape below the water at all.
