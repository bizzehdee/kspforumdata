In general, PhysX 3 is about 15-20% faster than PhysX2 due to optimizations, anything beyond that requires the ability to run multiple threads, which can\u0027t be done for a single craft.

Procedural wings/structural panels/girders/fuel tanks/ect would go a long way to at a bare minimum reduce the lagfest we have with extremely large builds. The only way right now is welding mods, but those are both buggy and have their own limitations."},{"CreatedByName":"THX1138","CreatedById":113955,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T04:46:31Z","Content":"Will KSP use multiple CPU cores?"},{"CreatedByName":"Hotblack Desiato","CreatedById":93895,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T05:15:38Z","Content":"of course... it does even now usw multiple CPU cores.\n\nthe only problem is physx, which does the largest chunk of calculations and can just use one core, and is therefor limited to the single-core-performance of the CPU."},{"CreatedByName":"TheXRuler","CreatedById":125517,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T10:15:20Z","Content":"@panzer1b yes, it does suck in a way, but remember, KSP is not a starwars/EVE/battlestar galactica simulator ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nThe idea has always been to build the only lego-style space programm simulation out there. And as with lego, big ships are problematic, as they break easily (or in ksp they break the framerate). It makes me sad as well, since I don\u0027t build capital ships but I love building Ginormous interplanetary motherships with tons of landers and station modules etc etc etc. Luckily with those it is possible to split them up (which can\u0027t really be done with big caps)."},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T13:51:02Z","Content":"The faster load times and smaller memory footprint in 1.0 means it should benefit lower end machines compared to 0.90.
