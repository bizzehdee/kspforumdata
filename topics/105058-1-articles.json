Procedural wings/structural panels/girders/fuel tanks/ect would go a long way to at a bare minimum reduce the lagfest we have with extremely large builds. The only way right now is welding mods, but those are both buggy and have their own limitations.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"THX1138","CreatedById":113955,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T04:46:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWill KSP use multiple CPU cores?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hotblack Desiato","CreatedById":93895,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T05:15:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eof course... it does even now usw multiple CPU cores.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe only problem is physx, which does the largest chunk of calculations and can just use one core, and is therefor limited to the single-core-performance of the CPU.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheXRuler","CreatedById":125517,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T10:15:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@panzer1b yes, it does suck in a way, but remember, KSP is not a starwars/EVE/battlestar galactica simulator \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea has always been to build the only lego-style space programm simulation out there.
