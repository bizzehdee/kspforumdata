He\u0027s a gamer, a fellow KSP fan, and an all around nice guy. He\u0027s starting a series where he\u0027ll be colonizing the Mun, but in a BIG way that should make it all more interesting. This isn\u0027t his first KSP series but he\u0027s trying things a little differently this time, with his videos, and would appreciate the comments and support as he continues his series. For now, he\u0027s keeping the videos short and sweet, allowing the progress of his mission to be easier to follow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHis colonization mission is in a modded install of KSP, so you know ahead of time, but he is running all his launches/mission clean from start to finish. So this means he\u0027s showing what happens from launch to landing, and beyond. Lets give him a little support.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHis mission starts here, with his first launch video:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[h=1]\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/cNSScp9z_cw?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E[/h]\u003Cp\u003EAnd don\u0027t worry, his spelling and grammar is better then mine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E:edit: Why do I suddenly feel like a poorly done infomercial? huh...\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
