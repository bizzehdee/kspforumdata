It all seemed to go pretty well, until the burn was almost complete the resulting transfer orbit around Kerbol was not the same circle as the one the manoeuvre node plotted, and I was going to be late getting to Duna. I think I\u0027ve managed to tweak the orbit with a couple of transition burns on route - but I\u0027m wondering if my approach to timing burns is correct? This approach has worked out with Mun and Minmus - probably because the capture windows are bigger, there\u0027s less dV, and shorter burn times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, question:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo I start a 4 minute burn 4 minutes before the node?

For such complicated combinations, MechJeb handles these calculations on the fly pretty well at the cost of messing up the display of the required burn time.
