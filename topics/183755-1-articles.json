Also I have noticed that the raised decoupler doesn\u0027t want to be attached to a fuel tank and/or a booster/engine.

You enable them by updating your construction building (I think), there are the basic action groups and the advanced one. With the basic you can already deploy panels and stuff. During the rocket assembling you\u0027ll see the action groups window just beside the \u0022crew\u0022 and \u0022building\u0022 tabs. You just have to choose an action group option (lights, for example) to add your panels and etc. Then the\u00A0next time you turn on your lights, the panels will be deployed as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
