If you\u0027re close enough (I\u0027d say within about ~10km or so), then yeah, you should be able to get a small amount of thrust going in the direction of your target that will let you drift closer.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PirateAE","CreatedById":57902,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-28T16:41:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat you need to do is figure out if your are \u0022chasing or being chased, (IE is it more ahead or behind you), if your chasing it, lower your PE seme to catch up, then kill relitive once your closer, rinse repeat till yoru in about 1 KM of your target, if its chasing you, make your AP higher so it can catch up. again aim for about 1 KM seperation, the nod editor really helps with this as it will show you intercet points where your orbit crosses that of your target.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
