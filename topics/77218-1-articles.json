It generally takes more than one measurement to get all the science from an instrument. Thus, unless you have multiple command pods/have a science lab/have a kerbal in a command seat, it\u0027s generally best to have multiple science instruments. Especially given how the smaller ones are massless and thus there\u0027s no downside to taking more of them (At the moment.

The method is to take 6 or more lander cans with docking ports each side and a reusable lander assembly with gear, rcs, lander engine and one of each sensor you\u0027ll need. The mothership houses the fuel and science lab for scrubbing the equipment between landings. That way after you reach orbit you can detatch the lander module, bring down a lander can, collect the science and load it onto the can, return to the mothership, rinse, and repeat with a new lander can. You can do the same doubling everything if you want to do low-orbit science over each of these biomes. Once all of your cans are filled you can trek back and aerobrake\u0026gt;rendezvous with a parachute assembly in LKO to bring down just the cans.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vallius","CreatedById":100188,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-11T21:49:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy not just take 1 lander (and maybe 2 command modules to store experiments), and reuse the same lander for each biome?
