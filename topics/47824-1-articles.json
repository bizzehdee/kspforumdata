I now have an operational space station and outposts on Mun, Minmus, Duma and Eve. And lots of dead Kerbals obviously. However, the one thing I\u0027ve not been able to get to work yet are the nuclear engines - I really want them for interplanetary travel due to the high impulse but the wretched things always seem to explode on stage separation when I use them. Can anyone explain what I\u0027m doing wrong?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"3_bit","CreatedById":52836,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-09T16:42:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst off, welcome! Nuclear engines in real life don\u0027t use oxidizer, but the ones in game do as of now. if you\u0027re clustering multiple together, that is most likely causing the explosion-the fairings that go on them tend to collide with others if they\u0027re close together. I might suggest if this doesn\u0027t help you to add a picture (I use Imgur) so I might be able to help. Note that those large gray structural parts can\u0027t have fuel go through them. I also suggest you put a normal oxidizer/liquidfuel tank right above the engine and see if anything comes out the other end. If it doesn\u0027t, you probably have a bad install and should redownload KSP. Note that if it does come to this, you can always copy your save folder over and keep what you\u0027ve accomplished.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBest of luck and once again, welcome!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3_bit\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Warpedone","CreatedById":83414,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-09T22:16:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethanks - I\u0027ll try spacing them out as I normally put 3 or 4 together in a mid stage stack\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-09T22:45:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can rotate them in such a way that the fairings will blast free. I don\u0027t have a picture of this at the moment but the best description is that they should be offset on a 45* angle with that orange thing aiming to the side. not straight out, not straight in, off to the side by 45* and they should be mounted then to the cluster adapters in symmetry.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Warpedone","CreatedById":83414,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-10T20:32:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewell, I tried mounting the nuclear engines out on struts (pointing straight) and they work a dream - as a result Jool Research Orbital Station is now in place and I still had over 25% of my delivery stage fuel left after using Duma for a slingshot approach.
