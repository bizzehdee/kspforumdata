For example, I\u0027ve put a craft into an orbit with a roughly 160km perigee and apogee and within a quarter of an orbit the perigee is down to 150km and the apogee is up at 170km. I think Principia is causing this because the flight path prediction displays the changes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-06-20T10:48:22Z\u0022 title=\u002206/20/2022 10:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EJune 20, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by theaexperiment\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-06-20T16:10:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat sounds more like a phantom force than a problem with Principia. If you use the \u0027set orbit\u0027 cheat and position an identical probe in a similar orbit, does its orbit also change?
