I wanted to build a space station and I tried to attach it on one side to my station core and on the other 5 sides docking ports, but I can\u0027t seem to get anything attach to the sides of it, just the top and bottom.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a setting or something that I need to do so I\u0027ll be able to attach parts to the sides? I can put parts at the sides of fuel tanks and so on, but there are no snapping points. With the HubMax it just won\u0027t snap\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECake\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Francesco","CreatedById":58274,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-12T12:04:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyeah that thing likes to misbehave, try rotating it (wasdqe) and attach it in a direction different from the \u0022fresh out of the box\u0022 one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eit should become green.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EndlessWaves","CreatedById":41302,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-12T14:19:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELimitation is the current node system unfortunately, it will be rewritten sooner or later but as you can imagine it doesn\u0027t seem a particularly high priority.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly two orientations of node (\u0026amp; surface) work when attaching a part to another part, for the HubMax it\u0027s the top and bottom ones so you need to rotate it so that either the top or bottom node is the one you\u0027re attaching with (you can have that node pointing sideways, but it has to be one of the one that start in that position).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
