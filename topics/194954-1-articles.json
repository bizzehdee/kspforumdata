I need to explain why i made it like that. Originally, there was only one thruster, and its purpose was to right the rover in case it capsized. only later i realized that since i already has a rocket and a fuel tank, it would be easier and cheaper to strap on some additional engines and make the rover fly than it would be to design a whole cruise module and a landing module and adding them to launch mass. but \u003Cu\u003Ei still need the rocket to work as anti-capsizing mechanism, so i still need them to be able to point upwards\u003C/u\u003E. also, the hinges allow the rockets to be safely retracted to be protected by the landing struts in case of capsizing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthe original plan called for intentionally capsizing the rover in order to take off (i know, it looks silly \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:blush:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:blush:\u0022\u003E). but the rover will just lean on the side, and it\u0027s quite hard to take off like that. so, i had to include the possibility to rotate the thrusters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni could try to control the vibrations and asymmetrical thrust with a big reaction wheel. i could also use the stronger, heavier hinges. but i\u0027m quite reluctant to add even more weight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthe push asymmetry could also be controlled by manually setting a thrust limit for some of the rockets, but it needs to be fine-tuned, and there is no way to do the tuning without firing the rockets and seeing if the push is uniform. if it\u0027s not, it\u0027s generally too late to fix things. and of course it must be continuously changed to accomodate shifts in the center of mass caused by fuel consumption. so, it\u0027s virtually impossible to make it work in practice\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003Ec) the rover still breaks for taking a bump at high speed\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthe safety struts work very well under normal conditions. i run many tests accelerating to 30 m/s (which is basically top speed with those wheels, and anyway it\u0027s top speed on most planets because low gravity will make the rover unstable; in fact, on mun it\u0027s hard to drive above 20 m/s for long without capsizing), and i never had any damage. directly slamming on the ground is another matter, though. in particular, taking a bump in the ground at high speed can break the front wheels, if the bump was steep enough. i tried putting the front low struts to try avoiding this problem, but turns out they also can\u0027t support a direct impact with the terrain at high speed. i may just have to drive more carefully around rough terrain, if there is nothing to be done about it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nany suggestion on fixing those issues without creating more problems somewhere else?
