Connect 6-symmetric struts from a wide point near the middle to the highest point on the craft you can. this will help keep it rigid. It\u0027s OK if the struts connect parts from separate stages. they will automatically disconnect. Try putting 4-symmetric canards at the highest possible point. They will be dead weight for the rest of the mission, but they work wonders for stabilizing tall rockets. Also, whenever you have stages connected to the sides, go ahead and use struts to connect the side stages to eachother at the top and bottom, and connect them to the main rocket at at least one place. SAS will be most effective in the middle of the rocket. Try using two or three SAS modules.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tigga","CreatedById":31224,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-16T21:59:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s hard to say too much without seeing your ship, but as a rule if it isn\u0027t pretty close to symmetrical you\u0027re going to struggle out of the atmosphere unless you\u0027ve spent a lot of time tweaking it. If your ship is symmetrical try adding stiffening struts as nhnifong suggests. A third alternative is to use gimballed engines which, if you\u0027re using ASAS or flying manually, should act to reduce the roll.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIncidentally, I think it\u0027d be a great addition if the were to improve the ASAS module so that it could control engine thrusts individually as well. It\u0027d have to be a lot more gentle then it is with RCS and control surfaces, but it\u0027d really help to sort out craft imbalances. Either that, or we need engines with a much higher directional thrust ability.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hjalfi","CreatedById":40378,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-17T10:25:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI had \u003Cem\u003Etonnes\u003C/em\u003E of trouble with my Behemoth lifter (still trying to live up to its name; so far, 15 tonnes to a 100km orbit, which is pants) with this. As soon as you start the gravity roll you begin tumbling, yes?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI believe that it\u0027s a combination of lack of control authority and the vehicle weathercocking in the upper atmosphere at high speeds. Once you start turning, the air\u0027s coming from the side of the vehicle, the upper tanks are empty and therefore it\u0027s tail-heavy, and so the nose gets pushed round so that you\u0027re going tail-first. Which never helps. If your vehicle is asymmetrical it\u0027ll probably make things even worse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the only solution is more control authority. I did a bunch of experimentation with SAS modules and RCS and control services and I found that what worked for me were winglets, placed as low down as I could manage for maximum leverage.
