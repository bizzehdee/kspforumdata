The reason is the inclination of your approach does not match the inclination of Eve\u0027s orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI see you are going pretty much straight from Kerbin to Eve and aiming for the AN or DN without adjusting inclination, (which is in my opinion the best way to do it). But this approach leaves you with a large difference in velocity between yourself and your target in the \u0022vertical\u0022 direction (North/South, or normal as they call it). This large delta-V in the normal direction means you can never have a low inclination orbit when you arrive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInclination changes are costly, but if you were to do an experiment where you first match inclination with Eve\u0027s orbit, then I think you will find that when you reach Eve you will not have much normal velocity relative to Eve and your orbit around Eve will be nearly parallel to Eve\u0027s plane around Kerbol, or can be adjusted with small burns to be so.
