Raising your landing gear has other issues (the plane may not rest on the gear bay; wheels may clip into the ground). Using landing legs isn\u0027t very good either (they lower when you raise the gear after takeoff thus consuming action groups to rectify; they\u0027re rarely able to be perfectly placed, causing the plane to bounce around as they are lowered/raised; I\u0027ve seen damage to the landing gear occur as everything bounces around; increased part count for something that is so basic).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SuperWeegee4000","CreatedById":71621,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-26T21:54:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis already exists.
