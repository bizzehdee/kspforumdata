Why? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, I landed on Gilly yesterday and was able to mine Kethane, but the landing part was quite time-consuming and difficult due to the low gravity. Hell, even MechJeb\u0027s auto landing function failed (it would just burn fuel by hovering). If you haven\u0027t landed there, basically just jumping is enough to send a Kerbalnaut into orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo... why not introduce a harpoon / grappler for low-gravity landings?
