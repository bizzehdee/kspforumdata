And I think crash tolerance, maximum heat, and maybe even science gain from experiments should be improveable as well, but obviously it shouldn\u0027t be overpowered.

But i already have problems with getting enough science. I was wondering if you could do an xp setting instead. so when a part has been in orbit around for example kerbin it gets some xp. and if its recovered, if it has gotten enough xp, you can increase a stat. for example an orbit or landing on mun would give more xp than orbiting kerbin. and landing on eve or orbiting jool would get even more xp and so on. but you have to recover the part, or have an engineer make a service report and transmit that back for lesser amount of xp, to improve the part. nice day.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, I had a similar idea: Maybe we could track in which conditions each part was used or how long (like it is done in the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/99043-105-testflight-v14-22-nov-2015-bring-flight-testing-to-ksp/\u0022\u003ETestFlight\u003C/a\u003E mod), to gain some practical experience with the part. The xp-gain can simply scale with the difficulty factor of the target-body that already exists to scale science-gains in the vanilla game. Upgrades could then require not only science points but also a certain amount of practical experience. Without practical xp the science cost could be significantly higher.
