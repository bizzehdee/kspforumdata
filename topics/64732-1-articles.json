In real life, however, the astronauts who went to the Moon would take grab samples from multiple locations for study back on Earth. I would like to be able, if the option to take multiple Science-yielding surface samples in KSP were never pushed, to know where the borders of the different biomes are so I can plan landings accordingly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing this tactic, one good EVA can provide multiple surface samples for more Science.
