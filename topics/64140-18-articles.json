There are some issues with Modular Fuel Tanks if you are not running the correct version of MM, make sure you are using the latest version in the mod packs you have installed, rather than the most recent dev release version of it.

Very obvious example that fails: a 3.75m diameter surface-optimized SRB has a max thrust of 2975 kN. The Space Shuttle 5-section SRBs (3.71m diameter) have a real world liftoff thrust of between 14,012kN and 15,617kN depending on time period. And the proposed Advanced Rocket Booster SRB design has a projected 20,015 kN in the same diameter. Are you sure that you aren\u0027t calculating the max allowable values in tons-force instead of kN in the math for the code? 15,617kN is 1,592 ton-force, which would fall right in the range being set for the SRBs in game \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OtherBarry","CreatedById":100948,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-24T21:09:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RaccoonTOF\u0022 data-cite=\u0022RaccoonTOF\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E@K3|Chris: The reason they are separate parts is because the tankage mass for RCS tanks is a different weight than normal fuel tanks per volume...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually, the dry density of a fuel tank is based upon which resource is in it.

I have similar \u0022unreal\u0022 issues with the secondary standard kerbin install that I also have though, though I didn\u0027t check exact numbers there.

The tank(part) type determines the basemass per tank(part) volume, and the resource within the tank(module) determines the tankage mass for the tank(module) actually chosen. The \u0022default\u0022 tank type is 0.000625 tons per total liters of tank volume, while RCS tanks have a base mass of 0.0016 tons per total liters of tank volume. This is without ANY resources added to the tanks, it is the base mass for the empty part itself. (In RealFuels these numbers are 0.000011 tons per liter total volume for the default type, and RCS is 0.0004 ton per liter volume - stock tanks really have WAY too much of their mass in the structural part of the tanks compared to real life tank weights). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Oh, and with neither Modular Fuel Tanks NOR RealFuels installed, just using PP, they are different as well - dryDensity for Liquid tanks is .1089 t/kL and for RCS tanks is 0.22 t/kL.

You\u0027re right, in realfuels and MFT mass is partially dependent on thentype of the tank.
