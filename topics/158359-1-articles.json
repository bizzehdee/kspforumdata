Have no idea what could possibly be causing it.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI built a super low tech plane, weighing in at around 3.5 tons total, to move around \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E and the surrounding area collecting early game science points. The only problem? It won\u0027t move faster than about 2-3 m/s. The stock .625m jet engines are pumping out ~18 kn a piece to no avail. Put bigger .625m mod engines on it, 40 kn each. Still nothing. Even bigger radial .625m ones that pump out 45 each. Nothing. Drop fuel to almost empty.. nothing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen, the radial engines actually burned my horizontal stabilizers off the rear of the plane.. and it jumped from 2 m/s to about 100 m/s almost instantly. Poor Jeb did not survive.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThinking it was some problem with that particular part\u0027s drag coefficient or something (though I think it was a stock piece), I swapped it out for a normal wing section with a control surface. Identical parts to what the wings on top of my little cesna style plane were made of. Surprisingly, I got the same result. Hardly any movement at all. Take those parts off the rear, and boom.. it roars down the runway like normal.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnyone have any ideas what could possibly cause something like this? So far as I know I don\u0027t have anything modifying the stock parts or aero, so I can\u0027t imagine what sort of mod could cause this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jas0n","CreatedById":57441,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-29T04:42:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan you send a picture of your plane? My guess is that the horizontal stabilizer is blocking the thrust from the engines, and once it exploded from overheating, the thrust is no longer blocked, resulting in the sudden acceleration. I would suggest off setting the horizontal stabilizers so that they\u0027re not right behind the engine\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Enorats","CreatedById":141841,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-29T05:34:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll have to try that. They were directly in line with the engines, but quite a distance behind them. roughly a full mk1 liquid fuel tank\u0027s distance back, perhaps more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThat was indeed the problem. Moved the two \u0022basic canards\u0022 I was using for horizontal stabalizers up slightly and now it works fine. Can\u0027t believe I\u0027ve never run into this problem before with all the planes I\u0027ve made. Suppose I normally put engines at the rear, not under the wings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-29T06:24:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe good news is, you can get really creative with tail designs to make it fit any engine layout.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedOther ipsEmbeddedOther_limited\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?app=core\u0026amp;module=system\u0026amp;controller=embed\u0026amp;url=http://imgur.com/OdvPU6I\u0022 style=\u0022height:537px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
