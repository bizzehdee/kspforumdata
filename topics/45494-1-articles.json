If you\u0027re struggling with docking, you probably want to look at tutorials for that before you start trying to dock the Big Orange Tanks.

In other words, the refueling tank rides into space on the bottom of the command module and then is moved to the top once in orbit. There is a T45 rocket motor between the two fuel tanks in the center section that is accessed by jettisoning the lower docking port after moving the refueling tank to the top of the command module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/612776963377058110/4C1176781C2F62CC2D84A2050EF02CB4BF0B0E4A/\u0022 alt=\u00224C1176781C2F62CC2D84A2050EF02CB4BF0B0E4A\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA work in progress, but it already functions as an orbital refueling station.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"allmhuran","CreatedById":66124,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-10T07:04:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUse your station tanks as fuel for the lift and then refuel it with multiple smaller launches?
