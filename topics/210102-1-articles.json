Problem though: I can\u0027t find them. The Forum\u0027s search feature is either not very good or I can\u0027t use it correctly. Where are these BDArmory players?

FJR and Son of Smith are probably the biggest ones. Scott Manley also hosts the Runway Project through his Twitch channel sometimes. His tends to have more goofy gimmicks for the lulz, while the other two are more straight-ahead air combat. I can send Discord invites if you PM me. I\u0027m not really active in BDA lately, but I\u0027m still on the Discords.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
