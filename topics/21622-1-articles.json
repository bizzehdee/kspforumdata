But then, to explore the planet, it would become time consuming to run around the surface. I had to get a rover up there. DEMV rover looked fun and had a good crew capacity, But how do I bring it? It had to land efficiently and properly on any body (with or without atmosphere). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I finally got it to work! =D I had to use the DEMV rover mod (obviously), and i also used the HKM LFE G1 mod for the engines. I used those engines primarily for low fuel consumption, but i realized i have enough fuel on board to use stock engine that has a similar thrust. I also used the aviation lights mod to give it a retro-look \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first stage is the orbital stage. It has enough fuel to get into kerbin orbit. Hoffman transfer to another planet\u0027s orbit (i can get to Jool\u0027s inner moon Laythe\u0027s orbit using the first stage only). The stage separates and you have your lander stage with the rover attached at the bottom. If the planet has no atmosphere, you open your lander legs and land the ship directly to the surface. then decouple the rover. Or if there is an atmosphere, you can decouple the rover while you\u0027re in space, and the rover\u0027s parachutes will open and bring it safely to the surface while you land. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is enough fuel to bring the ship back to kerbin. but i\u0027m not using any docking mods so the rover will have to stay. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s some pictures! =D\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i48.photobucket.com/albums/f204/mars90000000/screenshot27_zps77dcba64.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot27_zps77dcba64.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i48.photobucket.com/albums/f204/mars90000000/screenshot26_zpsf34013f1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot26_zpsf34013f1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i48.photobucket.com/albums/f204/mars90000000/screenshot25_zps27b244c6.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot25_zps27b244c6.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i48.photobucket.com/albums/f204/mars90000000/screenshot24_zps593e5859.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot24_zps593e5859.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i48.photobucket.com/albums/f204/mars90000000/screenshot21_zpsd2484bd5.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot21_zpsd2484bd5.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i48.photobucket.com/albums/f204/mars90000000/screenshot20_zpse4e8a4c5.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot20_zpse4e8a4c5.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i48.photobucket.com/albums/f204/mars90000000/screenshot19_zpsf85830bf.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot19_zpsf85830bf.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i48.photobucket.com/albums/f204/mars90000000/screenshot22_zpse4642dc5.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot22_zpse4642dc5.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i48.photobucket.com/albums/f204/mars90000000/screenshot23_zpsb15faddc.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot23_zpsb15faddc.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Destroyer","CreatedById":36109,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-07T19:29:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI dont really \u0022Approve\u0022 Of using those engines, byut heck, you had fun, and you just wanted to rove, so good job \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mars90000000","CreatedById":27349,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-07T19:34:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELike i said, the rocket works with stock engine as well, and there is enough fuel.
