Some say you remove it. Some say you sync crafts together (the way DMP handles it) and others have their own concepts but many of them don\u0027t work and the biggest reason why is because KSP is designed from the ground up to be a singleplayer game. Unlike another popular sandbox game, Garry\u0027s Mod (GMod), that was designed with multiplayer in the forefront whereas multiplayer capability hasn\u0027t for KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn my personal opinion (and solely that), I don\u0027t think multiplayer will release for KSP1. Instead with T2, Squad will develop KSP2 and that will have multiplayer compatibility built it from the forefront. Attempting to modify KSP in it\u0027s current state is insane as the patch fixes and updates have created a disconnected array of additions to the game. It\u0027d be easier and simpler to build a game from the ground up to offer multiplayer.
