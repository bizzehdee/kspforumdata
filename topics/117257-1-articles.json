The farthest moon of Kerban. Some say it tastes like mint chocolate chip ice cream, I can prove them wrong. There are no chocolate chips on Minmus. Here on the dwarf moon, things are silent. No birds chirping, no kerbals rambling on about \u0022MORE BOOSTERS!\u0022 well.. okay maybe a few. But we are here to prove that this moon is not a dead husk of a rock like you think it is. Today, something was born here. Something that you cannot see or describe, nor I. It is a force that will live and grow here, and will die here. And it\u0027s the only thing that can live and thrive throughout the cold, clammy confines of space. That force is love, and simply the essence of it being here is enough to prove, that with this \u0022love\u0022 even the most desolate, polluted wastelands can become a safe haven for a closely knit community of Kerbals, Jebediah Kerman, Plants, Amoebas, whatever you want. Today, we are here to prove that Minmus is beautiful, and I think we\u0027ve done just that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/s6MVUox.png\u0022 alt=\u0022s6MVUox.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I can see the KSC from here!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -Newbas Kerman\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far, the base is not complete, only having two landers and two hab modules.
