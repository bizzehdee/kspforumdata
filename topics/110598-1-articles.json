Place 3 satellites in an equatorial orbit at about 650km in a triangular network. At this range, the omni antennas will maintain connection with themselves, mission control, and anything in Low Kerbin Orbit or on the surface with the exception of the extreme polar regions. Aim the DTS-M1\u0027s at active vessel and it will get everything out to Minmus. However, that altitude can be tricky to get them in perfect position as their line of sight will just barely cross over the surface when all 3 are in sync.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough you now have communications out to Minmus, there is still a problem, the Mun and Minmus will not only block your signal but you also have to carry heavier more expensive antennas to get back to Kerbin on every ship. You can put the same satellites around them both, but at 1000km (this makes it a little easier to position than Kerbin). This time aim the DTS-M1\u0027s at mission control which will automatically bridge back to the Kerbin network and the omnis will communicate with the local network and anything in orbit or on the surface with the exception of the extreme polar regions.
