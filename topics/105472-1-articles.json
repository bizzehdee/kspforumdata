This bug dates back to 0.25, actually. Was in an expedition, reverted, and when I viewed my money and reputation in-flight, they were reset to zero. But as soon as I accomplished a contract or went back to KSC it would reset itself to normal."},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRender","CreatedById":10651,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T00:16:18Z","Content":"It\u0027s a purely aesthetic bug, fortunately. There are a number of points where the refresh routine for funds, reputation, and science should be called, but are not. Another one is after accepting a contract: reputation and science don\u0027t get updated, though Funds do. So if you have a strategy that converts funds to reputation or science, you won\u0027t see the change (or have access to the benefits) until you switch to a scene that refreshes those two values."}]}
