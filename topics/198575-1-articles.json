Docked and I have the asteroid in tow. I have circurarized around Kerbin. It\u0027s a class A asteroid so weighed 5 t. I thought using a command pod could land it without mining. Well it couldn\u0027t. So I sent a ship, docked and mined it dry. Asteroid weight showed 0.7t. At this point I had command module, parachutes (about 12), large reaction wheel, some solar panels attached. Just the basics. It still wasn\u0027t slowing down when I tried to aerobrake about 20 times. This is when I noticed under staging that the total weight of the asteroid and the command pod was about 160t.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI undocked the command pod, showed as 8t. Asteroid showed as 0.7t. I docked again and the weight jumped up to 160t again. Am I going mad? Does the game think it\u0027s a class D asteroid? How on earth can I land it like this? I am losing my mind.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"18Watt","CreatedById":198538,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-12-07T21:04:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately, it appears this is a known bug: \u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/25730\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/25730\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you read that bug report, Neilski posted a method which may have worked temporarily for him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MZ_per_X1","CreatedById":199474,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-12-08T08:46:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the link.
