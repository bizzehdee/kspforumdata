You got like a dozen different cylinders with fuel in it, for example.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt makes searching for the right barrel really annoying. Also in the aerodynamics section the different wing types are hard to differentiate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing is that for example all the side-mounted fuel tanks are monoprop only.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow about that: You cut down the number of those items that are very similar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo you got the short, the medium and the long barrel and make them scalable in diameter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo lets say you click the long fuel tank, a popup opens up, there you can select diameter and contents: Empty, Monoprop, Biprop, JetFuel\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScalability works for almost every items.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis also goes for rover wheels, adapters, stack modules etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurthermore, all the items that are unique (in size) like say the different modular girders or the wings will be available in many more sizes, thus multiplying the amount of possible playercreations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI for example like those swept wings very much, but they are only usable for rather small planes. Or I want to side-mount my favourite fuel somewhere, but they all are filled with monoprop.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy system brings the following benefits:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaking the part menu vastly more accessible and well-arranged.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the same time, increases the total amount of parts by a LOT.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELimitations like wing size or fuel contents make stock-only players (like me) somewhat frustrated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOthers will modify the parts or use modded ones, therefore even more obstructing their UI\u0027s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd about execution, its not really a big deal. For most items you wouldnt need to make \u0022scalable items\u0022, but just rearrange the ones already existing into my system. The unique parts would require the scaling system. But even if they were done in the different sizes manually, it would not be too much work for a single person and would seriously pay off.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-08T22:54:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou are talking about tweakables and procedural parts. The former is planned but not for a while. The latter is not planned for the stock game as the community is way too divided on it. I personally love procedural parts but I like having a choice. There are plans for better organization and part sorting in the parts menu already, they just haven\u0027t come yet. With the massive part load expected to come from .22, you can probably expect some part menu organization work done by next update.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wallace","CreatedById":77574,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-08T23:22:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat annoys me is, mono-propellant tanks are in propulsion, and RCS schnozzles are in control.
