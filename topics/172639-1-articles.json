BE WARNED scaling everything can and does have weird results, wheels dont like it too much, it will break IVA views etc as long as part is scaled. Scale with caution\u00A0 , Also that in scaling ALL\u00A0 you may be scaling parts that really should not be, so any oddness is very much on you as the user .\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode prettyprint lang-html prettyprinted\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022pln\u0022\u003E@PART[*]:HAS[!MODULE[TweakScale]]:FINAL\n{\n    %MODULE[TweakScale]\n    {\n        %name = TweakScale\n        %type = free\n    }\n}\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NoXion","CreatedById":7454,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-21T00:55:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you very much!
