Since the introduction of Valentina Kerman (so named due to the first female human in space being Valentina Tereshkova), female Kerbals are common (maybe not 50/50 but definitely more than 33%) in the roster of Kerbal recruits available at the Astronaut Complex at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. Their stats (Courage and Stupidity, regardless of archetype) are applied at random and in my Space Agency, it\u0027s a meritocracy - the more courageous and less stupid you are, you\u0027re hired.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are female Kerbals in KSP2 already - you need only pay attention to the art style of the Kerbal portraits. At the moment, outside of aesthetics, gender has no bearing on capability as Kerbal XP is not yet implemented (if it\u0027s even going to be). And even in KSP1, Kerbal gender has no bearing on how \u0022good\u0022 a Kerbal is. It\u0027s easier to see in the EA Release Trailer, highly recommend watching 5, 6 or 7...maybe even 8 times. Song is catchy...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically, if they have eyebrows and a more rounded jawline - they\u0027re female Kerbals. Not as sure on the hair department, however the female pilot in the trailer (who I assume is Valentina - in which case, where are Jeb, Bob and Bill? If not, who is she? And who are the scientists?) has a shorter hairstyle (at the back) with a fringe, while the female scientist has pig tails. The male scientist, by comparison, has no eyebrows, a squarer jaw and what I can only describe as a \u0027Rick Astley\u0027 hairstyle (though the \u0027traditional\u0027 Kerbal Widow\u0027s peak is also an apparent male Kerbal favourite). Having said that, I\u0027m sure someone will correct me if I\u0027ve assumed something I shouldn\u0027t have - but I feel that\u0027s the aesthetic the art team were going for.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOutside of gender symbology, I\u0027m not sure how one would be able to specifically depict a non-binary Kerbal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tw1","CreatedById":59717,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-01T12:30:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224248568\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022213877\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221677672884\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002212297\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Cailean_556\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n35 minutes ago, Cailean_556 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOutside of gender symbology, I\u0027m not sure how one would be able to specifically depict a non-binary Kerbal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere isn\u0027t really one non-binary look or set of features, so as long as none of them explicitly were saying they\u0027re gendered either way, any of them could be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut we\u0027ve had female kerbals for years.

And I know the Kerbal effect, which is why this issue is so important.\u00A0 I\u0027m glad your KSP1 roaster is two-thirds female; that\u0027s awesome for KSP1. However, this is a KSP2 suggestions forum and our KSP2 roaster has been, at best, 10% female, which is the point that I\u0027m making. Why has KSP regressed on this? What possible reason do they have for tweaking the algorithm on the ratio? I\u0027m not suggesting some conspiracy at the developers; I\u0027m sure it is an oversight. But it seems like one that is easy to fix.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou can argue the semantics of \u0022gender\u0022 and the technicalities that the Kerbals don\u0027t have an explicitly assigned gender. But none of that changes the fact that my little one looked at the list of Kerbals, and she concluded that female Kerbals can\u0027t be Kerbonauts. Obviously, this is anecdotal, and I care more because it was\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Emy\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Ekid, but I\u0027d be very surprised if she were the only one that landed here.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI understand the devs have a long list of more important problems to fix right now. But to my 5-year-old, this is more important than the terrible maneuver nodes or the Kraken consuming our rocket (which, with the attached mythos of \u0022the Kraken\u0022 seems more of a feature than a bug as far as she is concerned). I\u0027m not trying to create moral outrage about this or suggesting I\u0027d boycott the game because of it*, I\u0027m simply forwarding feedback in the\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Esuggestions forum\u003C/strong\u003E. If this game lasts as long and has as much of a profound impact\u00A0as the first one, the views of her demographic are not only valid but important.
