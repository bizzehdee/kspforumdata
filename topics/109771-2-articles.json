I haven\u0027t played with KSPI in quite some time, though, 0.23.5, I think.\n\nWell the default ISRU refinery is a 2.5m by 1m with a mass of 1 ton (original 2 ton). I intend to make it scalable like all KSPI-E parts, allow it to shrink or scale up to desired size. Originally it could also extract directly from the atmosphere but took that out and demand you require atmospheric scoops for this. Specificaly for the ISRU I developed the Interstellar Fuel Switch, which is a modified FSFuelSwitch with additonal feature which make it more usefull for ISRU.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-18T21:56:51Z\u0022 title=\u002205/18/2015 09:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FreeThinker**"},{"CreatedByName":"DBowman","CreatedById":122106,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T01:06:45Z","Content":"A few numbers pulled from DRA5:\n\nISRU\n\n- 17.86 kW 492.0 kg Atmospheric acquisition - all for \u0027Microchannel CO2 absorption pump\u0027 (I think Zubrin proposed for CH4 just feeding the reactor \u0027raw\u0027 atmosphere and letting chemistry take care of not reacting with N2 etc, the \u0027waste stream\u0027 would have much higher N2 concentration for crew buffer or whatever)\n- \\_2.59 kW \\_38.8 kg Oxygen via solid oxide electrolysis\n- \\_2.90 kW \\_34.0 kg Liquefaction - most for O2 a little for H2(? a little H2O making?) \u0026 CH4(keeping what they brought cool)\n\n1 Hab for 6\n\n12 kW\n\nall up\n\n- 27 kW nuke\n- 100 kW solar (since it\u0027s dark sometimes...)\n\nISRU strategies evaluated:\n\n- 27 kW O2 only\n- 32 kW O2\u0026CH4 Earth H2\n- 64 kW O2\u0026CH4 Mars H2O regolith @ 3% H2O by mass\n- 49 kW as above but @ 8%\n- they had all the ISRU done before crew arrived so sequential not parallel power requirements\n- I don\u0027t think they had details for H2O from regolith mass required\n\nmass estimate power:\n\n- 22 ton for solar - includes batteries \u0026 emergency power gen\n- 7.8 ton for nuke - seems a lot heaver than SAFE - why? maybe mobility and cabling are included?\n- 4 ton for radio isotope if you get 8 of the 5 kW units they were thinking of - but they were not thinking of using them for \u0027general power\u0027\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-19T01:08:51Z\u0022 title=\u002205/19/2015 01:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by DBowman**"},{"CreatedByName":"Raptor831","CreatedById":68286,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T01:09:48Z","Content":"This\u0027ll get you Water Electrolysis:\n\n    MODULE{  name = ModuleResourceConverter  ConverterName = Water Electrolysis  StartActionName = Start Water Electrolysis  StopActionName = Stop Water Electrolysis\tAutoShutdown = false\tGeneratesHeat = true\tUseSpecialistBonus = true\tSpecialistEfficiencyFactor = 0.2\tSpecialistBonusBase = 0.05\tSpecialty = Engineer\tEfficiencyBonus = 1\t INPUT_RESOURCE\t {\t\tResourceName = Water\t\tRatio = 1\t }\t INPUT_RESOURCE\t {\t\tResourceName = ElectricCharge\t\tRatio = 600 // ~300 kJ for each mol of water\t }\t OUTPUT_RESOURCE\t {\t\tResourceName = Hydrogen\t\tRatio = 560.2164723\t\tDumpExcess = false\t }   OUTPUT_RESOURCE\t {\t\tResourceName = Oxygen\t\tRatio = 271.2712953\t\tDumpExcess = false\t }}\n\nI forget what exactly the RO translation is for EC, but I seem to remember it was EC = kJ or something similar.

Titan (Sol system) does not.\n\nIntentional, the current (Kerbol) definitions are for testing. I\u0027m hoping that CRP or some other mod will handle Kerbol system resource definitions (I\u0027m pretty sure CRP handles a few already) although I am not above supplementing those definitions if needed.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E **Part proposal:** \u0022Atmospheric Processor\u0022. Uses cryogenical processes to separate gases from planet atmosphere (real prototypes exist). Also can be used to liquify them. I see it as 2.5m assembly of 2-4 comparatively small tanks and some covered aparatus with animated fan intake and \u0022steam\u0022 emitting cryogenous exhaust.\n\nWell, the idea would be to have it as two separate parts for flexibility. You would have the cooler/heater for converting fuels to and from cryogenic state and an intake for pulling in resources from the atmosphere.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E **Question:** Are there any plans about dividing asteroids to C, S, M types?\n\nAt some point. Have to see how the resources are handled and may take some code. At this point I\u0027m going to assume they\u0027re all the water-rich class (C, I think?)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E **Question:** Any way I can be of help? May devote my weekends to model something.\n\nModeling is the biggest hurdle this mod has. I myself might even boot up my old copy of Lightwave and see what I can come up with. Right now I\u0027m learning myself how these chemical processes produce their extra energy and how that is converted into energy by the ISRU system. Doing it right is very important for this mod.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \u0022fuelCrossFeed = True\u0022 might be also needed for surface-mounted ISRU units.\n\nGood point, I\u0027ll look into that\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-25T21:50:42Z\u0022 title=\u002205/25/2015 09:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by regex**"},{"CreatedByName":"SpacedInvader","CreatedById":106018,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T02:48:23Z","Content":"Will this be integrated with a remote sensing mod like ScanSat?

Kerbol system is quite playable with FAR, RT, RF while RSS seems to be always under construction.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Well, the idea would be to have it as two separate parts for flexibility. You would have the cooler/heater for converting fuels to and from cryogenic state and an intake for pulling in resources from the atmosphere.\n\nSo... You are about implementing PSA/VPSA units? They look almost the same except for not being able to output liquified gases.\n\n[http://www.uigi.com/noncryo.html](http://www.uigi.com/noncryo.html)\n\nMolecular sieve membranes (filters) on the other hand, despite being much lighter, are not the way to go for ISRU systems due to their limited life cycle.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E At some point.

Though I wouldn\u0027t call C-class \u0022water-rich\u0022. They have SOME and that\u0027s much better than nothing. Abusing C-class asteroids for fuel will call for implementation of CO\u002BO2 engines IRL, as carbon is much more abundant in them than hydrogen/water (oxygen is plentiful in ANY type of asteroids).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Modeling is the biggest hurdle this mod has.\n\nJust give me some descriptions or sketches or photos of what it should look like. Modelling is comparatively fast and easy... what can\u0027t be told about texturing...\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I myself might even boot up my old copy of Lightwave and see what I can come up with.\n\nBlender is recommended. Most sane controls I ever saw in 3D-editors plus easy volume calculation and \\*.mu import support.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Right now I\u0027m learning myself how these chemical processes produce their extra energy\n\nAnswer is simple: heat. Exothermic processes produce heat, endothermic processes consume it. Electrolysis is more \u0022physical\u0022 process than \u0022chemical\u0022.\n\nHm-m-m... Can Regolith converter heat production values be negative? If they can - it may be used to simulate endothermic reactions.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E and how that is converted into energy by the ISRU system.\n\nThat\u0027s a hard one... Stirling engine or thermoelectric generator may use that heat, but only part of. Most heat will just dissipate.\n\nA good idea, however... Abusing stock heat conduction mechanics to generate electricity. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-26T06:51:02Z\u0022 title=\u002205/26/2015 06:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Dr. Jet**"}]}
