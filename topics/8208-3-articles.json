I\\\u0027d like to make some, but the idea is only starting to come together in my head. The real trouble with tracks is that they don\\\u0027t turn well (without consuming a lot of energy and sliding in weird ways) This turning would likely prevent their use in larger vehicles even if a good set were put together. Turns would apply dangerous loads to your chassis and require a lot of power. There\\\u0027s some coding effort that\\\u0027s required to make a system that would angle it\\\u0027s track section level to the ground, but I think I know how to do it with a pair of wheel colliders, perhaps with a set of three. Because of the different sets of problems and the limit to vehicle scaling, I think this would be best as an independent modification of the cart plugin to make a treaded cart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you meant like a train... It might be, but I honestly wouldn\\\u0027t know how to have the vehicle access pieces of the track, which might even belong to other vehicles. (This is a mod I\\\u0027d love to see, but I think difficulty-wise it might be right up there with 3rd party docking plugins.) That said, I\\\u0027m not convinced either is impossible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sting_auer\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sting_auer\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould you add wheels that are attached at a 90 degree angle?

I was able to coax it off the launchpad, but only just. Next time I understand the computation of drive direction I\\\u0027ll try to keep this in mind to enable proper control of this type of vehicle. I think it\\\u0027s just an issue of allowing the other directions to contribute to drive instruction (pitch, yaw, and translate up) by allowing them to contribute to the desired drive vectors, the wheels should then be able to drive properly... fingers crossed. Thinking more on the omni-wheels, they don\\\u0027t feel Kerbal, and I haven\\\u0027t really been able to draw any omniwheels with convincing suspensions or reasonable animations. I\\\u0027m happy I got the plugin to the point where it would support them because I feel that means it supports non-steering wheels, complex friction behavior and pretty much maximises the utility of the plugin, but I don\\\u0027t really want to maintain the part. I\\\u0027m going to add an archive folder and keep using them to test the plugin, in case anyone wants to build on it, but I\\\u0027m not going to maintain the part specifically.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"drewmacrae","CreatedById":7532,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-02T04:54:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPushed the V0.3 update to Github and now you should be able to build sideways rovers which drive a bit more intuitively as rovers (less sensible as crawlers).
