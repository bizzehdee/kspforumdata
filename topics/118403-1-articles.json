I\u0027ve launched rockets this big and bigger before and not had a problem, and I haven\u0027t added any mods in the meantime, so I am struggling to find what the problem is. Staging still works fine, but even after dropping the 1st stage the upper one just does the exact same thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mods I am running are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAIES\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB9 Procedural Wings\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEVE\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChaka Monkey\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECommunity Resource Pack\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECross Feed Enabler\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECrowd Sourced Science\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDmagic Science\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFASA launch clamps\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirespitter\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInterstellar Fuel Switch\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFAX\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Engineer\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Joint Reinforcement\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKlockheed Martian Gimbal \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKW Rocketry\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMod Oriented Tech Tree\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModule Animate Emissive\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERLA Stockalike\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProcedural Parts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProcedural Fairings\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETweakscale\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUbio Welding\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVens Stock Revamp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see none of these are the kinds of mod that limit control of a craft based on anything. I\u0027ve tested with lots of different engines and it happens with all of them on this particular rocket, and on the last rocket I made, but when I quickly chuck together a pod, fuel tank and engine it works fine and I have control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have tried adding control surfaces but they just wobble from side to side and give me no control either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have been adding and removing mods and have had no difference in this, finally at my wits end and worried its something glitching with stock.

Klockheed Martian Gimbal was my next suspect but control surfaces were bugging out too and I\u0027d had it for ages (it is used by some other mods to give extra gimballing options such as only allowing gimballing in a singular direction) but I am now deleting it and trying again. I forgot to mention in OP that I\u0027d already tried unplugging and replugging my keyboard, wasn\u0027t that. I will upload a log in a second once I check everything is still not working.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe engines don\u0027t gimbal until activated and don\u0027t do it if SAS is deactivated either so I guess it is just the engine doing it to keep the rocket going straight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just tried removing Klockheed martian and it\u0027s still not working so I\u0027ll upload the logs onto pastebin or something now \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAH-HAH! While I was typing this I decided to try changing the staging, if I activate the engines THEN remove the clamps I have control, so it\u0027s something to do with the clamps glitching it seems!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Estill have no idea what is happening, I have had a LOT of problems with clamps, both stock and not, them arriving all over the place, exploding my vessel randomly, all kinds of things, but I have never had this as a glitch until now!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Whoops got ahead of myself, it\u0027s actually SAS being active that causes the problem, turned on SAS and lost all control again, I have a suspicion it might be a reaction wheel I have since the same one is used on both vessles that had this problem, and I haven\u0027t used one on any other crafts, so I shall explore that avenue now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Yep it\u0027s either the AIES Reaction Wheel or it\u0027s the fact that it was tweakscaled, but I tried tweakscaling a different reaction wheel and didn\u0027t have the issue still. Doesn\u0027t mean I can confirm it was the part itself because tweakscale seems the more likely culprit, but I will experiment a bit more and try to confirm the problem before updating this to solved and putting my conclusion in the OP incase it happens to anyone else\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-13T21:09:15Z\u0022 title=\u002208/13/2015 09:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Squiggsy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T21:55:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh go figure.
