I\u0027ve launched rockets this big and bigger before and not had a problem, and I haven\u0027t added any mods in the meantime, so I am struggling to find what the problem is. Staging still works fine, but even after dropping the 1st stage the upper one just does the exact same thing.\n\nThe mods I am running are:\n\nAIES\n\nB9 Procedural Wings\n\nEVE\n\nChaka Monkey\n\nCommunity Resource Pack\n\nCross Feed Enabler\n\nCrowd Sourced Science\n\nDmagic Science\n\nFASA launch clamps\n\nFirespitter\n\nInterstellar Fuel Switch\n\nFAX\n\nKerbal Engineer\n\nKerbal Joint Reinforcement\n\nKlockheed Martian Gimbal \n\nKW Rocketry\n\nMod Oriented Tech Tree\n\nModule Animate Emissive\n\nRLA Stockalike\n\nProcedural Parts\n\nProcedural Fairings\n\nTweakscale\n\nUbio Welding\n\nVens Stock Revamp.\n\nAs you can see none of these are the kinds of mod that limit control of a craft based on anything. I\u0027ve tested with lots of different engines and it happens with all of them on this particular rocket, and on the last rocket I made, but when I quickly chuck together a pod, fuel tank and engine it works fine and I have control.\n\nI have tried adding control surfaces but they just wobble from side to side and give me no control either.\n\nI have been adding and removing mods and have had no difference in this, finally at my wits end and worried its something glitching with stock. I was wondering if anyone has experienced something similar and if so what was done to fix the problem?\n\nIf you need any more information please ask and I shall try my best! I looked in the logs and found nothing that was forthcoming it didn\u0027t seem to register anything was going wrong at all but if needs be I can supply logs ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-13T21:00:47Z\u0022 title=\u002208/13/2015 09:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Squiggsy**"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T20:39:01Z","Content":"The engine gimbals are drawing circles you say?

Again try a stock install.\n\n Thats for the fast response! Klockheed Martian Gimbal was my next suspect but control surfaces were bugging out too and I\u0027d had it for ages (it is used by some other mods to give extra gimballing options such as only allowing gimballing in a singular direction) but I am now deleting it and trying again. I forgot to mention in OP that I\u0027d already tried unplugging and replugging my keyboard, wasn\u0027t that. I will upload a log in a second once I check everything is still not working.\n\nThe engines don\u0027t gimbal until activated and don\u0027t do it if SAS is deactivated either so I guess it is just the engine doing it to keep the rocket going straight.\n\nI just tried removing Klockheed martian and it\u0027s still not working so I\u0027ll upload the logs onto pastebin or something now ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nAH-HAH! While I was typing this I decided to try changing the staging, if I activate the engines THEN remove the clamps I have control, so it\u0027s something to do with the clamps glitching it seems!\n\nstill have no idea what is happening, I have had a LOT of problems with clamps, both stock and not, them arriving all over the place, exploding my vessel randomly, all kinds of things, but I have never had this as a glitch until now!\n\nEDIT: Whoops got ahead of myself, it\u0027s actually SAS being active that causes the problem, turned on SAS and lost all control again, I have a suspicion it might be a reaction wheel I have since the same one is used on both vessles that had this problem, and I haven\u0027t used one on any other crafts, so I shall explore that avenue now.\n\nEDIT: Yep it\u0027s either the AIES Reaction Wheel or it\u0027s the fact that it was tweakscaled, but I tried tweakscaling a different reaction wheel and didn\u0027t have the issue still. Doesn\u0027t mean I can confirm it was the part itself because tweakscale seems the more likely culprit, but I will experiment a bit more and try to confirm the problem before updating this to solved and putting my conclusion in the OP incase it happens to anyone else\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-13T21:09:15Z\u0022 title=\u002208/13/2015 09:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Squiggsy**"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T21:55:05Z","Content":"Ah go figure.
