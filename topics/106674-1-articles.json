But that\u0027s where it goes wrong. I just always seem to run out of oxidizer and can\u0027t achieve orbit let alone anything else...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking for tips really.

You\u0027re main wings have what is called anhedral. They are tilted downward. This places your center of lift below your center of mass and makes your plane want to fly upside down. Try dihedral (wings pointing up) instead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. The Intakes you\u0027re using (the silly rounded ones) are not designed for high speed and altitude. Also they are a source of unwanted drag. You should only need 1 good intake per engine and it should probably be the shock or ram intakes. A number of the smaller intakes that you have would also be fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Planes are even less forgiving then rockets with respect to drag. You NEED a good ascent profile. 1st get up to 10k. fly straightish until you get to 500m/s and pitch up between to around 15 degrees. Turn SAS on and let it fly. You\u0027re AoA will increase steadily as will your speed. You\u0027re aiming at around 850m/s at 25km. That is where you switch to rockets. Close your intakes and fly at about 10 degrees above your velocity marker (the yellow circle) until 35km and then just fly like a lawndart until your apoapse is 85km. It will fall until it reaches around 80km. wait until then and circularize.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. If that doesn\u0027t work you wil likely need more fuel. I calculate you need 2500 m/s dv with rockets. I got that value from Kerbal Engineer Redux.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"daveo132","CreatedById":142504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T09:30:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi thanks for the reply.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have since done a rework and I\u0027m now using the ram intakes which is giving better results.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far I\u0027ve had no issues with stability but I see what your saying about the wings.
