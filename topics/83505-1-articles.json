I have two heat radiating parts from two different mods (which we will surreptitiously call mod A and mod \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E. I really like how mod A looks visually but I need the functionality of both A and B for my purposes in the same part. However I am noticing that when I put the module of the part from mod B that does the functionality I want, I can no longer deploy the part from mod A.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there any reason for this? Is there a way around this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny insight would be greatly appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-01T02:17:58Z\u0022 title=\u002209/01/2014 02:17  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 1, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by JSArrakis\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-01T02:35:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBest guess is it\u0027s the name of the MODULE is tied to something in there plugin, can think of only 2 mods that have stuff like that and thats NearFuture and Interstellar.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-01T02:49:36Z\u0022 title=\u002209/01/2014 02:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 1, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Mecripp2\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nli2work","CreatedById":106805,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-01T03:04:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyou have to be more specific about which modules you are combining in a single part. some combinations are possible while others are not. it\u0027s a case by case basis and not a little bit of trial and error.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
