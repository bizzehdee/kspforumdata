I\u0027m back from my time away and have resumed work. I\u0027ll be updating the imgur album in the first post as development continues.\n\nToday I\u0027m investigating identifying individual props in the IVA as a way to allow jumping into an empty seat without needing colliders to be added to each seat in the craft. To aid in this, I\u0027m making a GUI to allow cycling through the various props and selectively hiding them. This may be useful for those developing IVAs or for creative use in video making.\n\nEDIT: Pictures!\n\n![r7tTPs4.png](http://i.imgur.com/r7tTPs4.png)\n\nThe handle is a separate prop within the IVA and can therefore be disabled. No more floating handle!\n\n![TTW3s6O.png](http://i.imgur.com/TTW3s6O.png)\n\nThe new developer GUI for testing the seats and various internal props. The seat detection checks the InternalSeats in the craft, popping up the message if the camera is pointing at a 0.3m sphere centred on the seat\u0027s origin, within a distance of 1m (both soon to be configurable). The GUI can be used to browse through the renderers of the IVA and hide them. In future, this code could be developed to allow customising IVAs. This seat has no flight controls installed!\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Oooooh! The cutaway shot gave me a great idea... You could render the IVA view to another texture, \u0026 use the alpha component on the textures for parts to render the insides using that texture (using screenpos co-ordinates in the pixel shader).\n\nPainting internals onto externals! I like it!\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Can we use the transparency effect for windows so that we can finally have see through glass in our craft to see the interior from the outside?\n\nIt\u0027s not transparent (the IVA is in front of the actual craft), but see above!\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Is there away you could use something like Advanced Landing Capsule where you can open and close the hatch that would be great ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nThat\u0027s the plan!\n\n\u003E \n\u003E How are you going to handle various non-habitable parts that are supposed to be passable? Like that 6-node hub, big probe core with tunnel in middle, etc.? Ideally simple IVA should be modelled for each, but that would be very time consuming. MAube generate simple procedural cylinders with some details on edges? Like it is done in B9 procedural wings.\n\nThey\u0027ll all need their own IVAs developed. They are complicated and varied enough that a procedural system may be more effort than it saves. I\u0027m not a 3D modeller myself, but I\u0027m sure I can put something passable together. It\u0027s a long way off anyhow.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Do u plan on adding a button where u can lock the view or position? It\u0027ll be very nice for IVA cinematics\n\nI\u0027ve had to make something to lock the view already. It\u0027ll be in the next release as Shift \u002B Y. It\u0027s very hard to see the results of clicking a GUI when your craft runs away when you move the mouse ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Any plans on a sort of transfer tunnel that can be built between modules? or even attached like a strut? (I have no idea how you would make a working collision mesh or a procedural IVA but i bet you could somehow.)\n\nCurrently the plans are to only connect modules via hatches. Boring randomly through existing IVAs wouldn\u0027t be pretty, and your lab will have difficulty operating if you\u0027ve just put a door through all the equipment!\n\n\u003E \n\u003E That\u0027s true - it would be nice to have a \u0027docking mode\u0027 where the IJKLHN keys control the ship instead of the camera.\n\nI plan to have the ship controls unavailable to you when you\u0027re physically away from them, but that option can be made available for those who need it both ways for video making or similar.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E were can i download this mod? cant find the download link. and i really want to try this mod.\n\nI\u0027ll add the link to the front page.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Do you think anywhere down the line there\u0027d be someway of implementing any kind of rudimentary physics into this? So one would float and bounce off the walls while in 0G?\n\nThat\u0027s one of the goals of this project. While running around with noclip on can be fun, it doesn\u0027t make for much of a game.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E This is amazing.\n\u003E I had some ideas after seeing this image:\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://i.imgur.com/9EUo0JM.png](http://i.imgur.com/9EUo0JM.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E First, what about adding a \u0022glass\u0022 overlay on the top of it? that would make it easier to see the craft I think.\n\nI\u0027m not sure what you mean here. Could you expand on this?\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Also, what about having it a-la thesims mode, where you press a button and move the mouse to show the IVAs of what is by the mouse?\n\nCheck out Space Station Simulator that [MK3424](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/131439-WIP-Enhanced-IVA?p=2145466\u0026viewfull=1#post2145466) posted about. It has lots of ideas for what could be done with IVA in KSP in a management sense. That\u0027s beyond what this mod will do, but I hope it opens the door for others to take things a step further.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E And what about also having internal views for parts like fuel tanks? this way you can have a full X-RAY view of your craft, the fuel tank view could show how much fuel it has if that is not too complicated.\n\u003E There are so many possibilities, Kerbals moving around with an AI on a massive station, or even doing stuff, I can\u0027t wait to see what will come from this mod.\n\nIt would make a nice perk for having an engineer on board! It\u0027s beyond the scope of this mod however. I haven\u0027t ventured into the realm of 3D modelling yet, and this idea would require a lot of it!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-31T22:18:19Z\u0022 title=\u002208/31/2015 10:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by pizzaoverhead**"},{"CreatedByName":"Sir_Tramalot","CreatedById":62713,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-01T16:44:25Z","Content":"I love the idea of this, well done!"},{"CreatedByName":"kiwiak","CreatedById":82796,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-01T17:27:49Z","Content":"great work so far"},{"CreatedByName":"MrHappyFace","CreatedById":76365,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-01T17:44:34Z","Content":"Would you consider adding a mirror download, I can\u0027t download from mediafire for some reason."},{"CreatedByName":"pizzaoverhead","CreatedById":26349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-01T17:57:20Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Would you consider adding a mirror download, I can\u0027t download from mediafire for some reason.\n\nSure:\n\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7wRgLdaxUSdOGdzSzNtQk5rVDg/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7wRgLdaxUSdOGdzSzNtQk5rVDg/view?usp=sharing)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-01T18:02:03Z\u0022 title=\u002209/01/2015 06:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by pizzaoverhead**"},{"CreatedByName":"pizzaoverhead","CreatedById":26349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-01T20:00:10Z","Content":"Today\u0027s goal: Allow getting into a different seat to the one you started out in.
