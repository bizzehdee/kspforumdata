If you build a sub-assembly with a command pod/probe in it and then build a new craft that uses that sub-assembly as the first/root piece, you will get all kinds of weirdness when trying to launch. If you see the ship at all it will be high in space and covered in re-entry effect, even though it\u0027s not moving, there may be no planet, the map will centre on the sun and you won\u0027t be able to use any keys except the F keys and escape. If you saved the ship, reloading it will look like it has worked until you realise none of the parts are actually connected. Sometimes trying to launch such a ship will result in having no option but to hard-quit KSP by ending the game from windows task manager.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI discovered this by making a satellite, saving it as a sub assembly and then using it as the first part of a launch vehicle so it would be at the top. Even though I added a new probe body underneath the sat the game still thought there was no command pod/probe. I had an extensive list of mods at the time, but I\u0027ve tried this with stock parts and it happens every time, so I\u0027m guessing a clean install would also exhibit the bug.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously it\u0027s easy enough not to build ships like this, so it\u0027s not a priority to fix, just thought I\u0027d let people know.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BudgetHedgehog\uFEFF","CreatedById":104112,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-27T23:58:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow are you getting a subassembly as the first piece?
