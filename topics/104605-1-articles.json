You\u0027d need to increase the physics distance and/or bring two planets close together. I guess with hyperedit or using the process behind mods like RSS that reconstruct the solar system you could put two planets close together and make them tidally locked. But you\u0027d need a physics distance greater than sum of the tallest mountains on each planet (or very smooth planets). Then you\u0027d need some very long parts, like several km each or you\u0027ll have a silly part count. Even with all that (and partly because of all that) you\u0027re going to get some really odd bugs, glitches and probably a small puddle of molten plastic and metal that was once your computer.
