I am just starting in career mode, and I go to launch something, and the first time I hit map view, I am looking at the far side of Kerbin, and I have to scroll the view around to properly see my ship and apoapsis and the like. And it does this with every new launch. Is there a reason for this? It is by no means game breaking, but it does cost me an extra couple of seconds (which can be very precious sometimes) to swing the camera around.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ferdoni","CreatedById":140765,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T06:52:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDo you only have the problem with night launches?
