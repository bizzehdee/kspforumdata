Open the port, select \u0022control from here\u0022, watch the navball jump by the expected 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, and bring it in on translational RCS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGot a beautiful approach lined up, closing speed 0.2m/s, flying with the yellow circle perfectly centred on the purple circle, and \u003Cstrong\u003Eboing!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt bounced off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022That\u0027s odd\u0022, I think, so I try it again, with the same result.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next time, I turn the camera to see the two ports approaching and see the problem. Despite having control from the docking port, the navball is apparently lining up my \u003Cstrong\u003Ecockpit\u003C/strong\u003E with the station\u0027s docking port, leaving the plane\u0027s docking port a few metres away, bouncing off the side of the space station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this a well known bug that I\u0027ve only just encountered? The navball switches its horizon to where I would expect it to be, but not its point of view, as it were. This does make using the inline docking port rather more of a challenge than it would otherwise be!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoboRay","CreatedById":46556,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-24T12:01:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot only that, but your NavBall target indicator also seems to center on the target\u0027s center of mass rather than the docking port you select. The NavBall will only give you a perfect alignment if your docking port is in-line with your cockpit and the target\u0027s docking port is in-line with its CoM (or maybe it\u0027s the target command pod, not sure).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suggest trying out the Lazor Docking Cam for precise docking.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-04-24T13:20:38Z\u0022 title=\u002204/24/2013 01:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EApril 24, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by RoboRay\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ComradeGoat","CreatedById":59041,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-24T12:15:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks.
