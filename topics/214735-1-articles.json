Though I have yet to play the second game I do love the new procedural wings. Idk why they didn\u2019t get added stock in the first game but these are probably one of the best features in the second game for me who builds planes. If possible could you in a future update add more plane parts specifically wide body passenger and cargo modules and wing boxes in varying sizes. Mods like Airplanes Plus have added this in KSP1 but I\u2019d like to be able to have them in the stock fame in KSP2. I also like to make the 747 and other large jet replicas in the first game but since you kind of require part clipping to make an accurate model which makes them heavier than the Goliath engines can provide, it can be a real pain in the ass to build and fly them. And finally as an also shuttle lover could there be shuttle lifting bodies, heat surfaces like in the real shuttle that get added? If these can get added into KSP2 stock that\u2019ll be greatly appreciated since I love to go into the little detail in airplanes.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-03-08T12:26:18Z\u0022 title=\u002203/08/2023 12:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 8, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by CaptWhitmire\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"aNERVASman","CreatedById":211629,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-09T12:22:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nround 2.5m plane parts and attach nodes on wings for inline engines would be useful\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EdwardB3020","CreatedById":223607,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-09T13:32:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224255430\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022214735\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221678364553\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022211629\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022aNERVASman\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, aNERVASman said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nround 2.5m plane parts and attach nodes on wings for inline engines would be useful\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh hell yes I would absolutely love these!
