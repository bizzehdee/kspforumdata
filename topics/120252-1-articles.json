It is one of those films that, for me at least, will churn in my thoughts for a day or two. I am actually surprised that there isn\u0027t already a thread on this forum about it. It would seem to be the type of movie that would appeal to at least some around here. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the reviews that I read described it as a modern variation on \u0022Frankenstein\u0022, which I found interesting. And the film\u0027s story almost seemed to be a bit \u0022self-aware\u0022 at times, with references to techniques for deception that were also being used by the film\u0027s script writer. It had flaws that my friends and I commented on during the movie, but overall it was enjoyable. It also touched on issues with AI that we\u0027ve discussed over in the Science Labs sub-forum in a way that sent chills down my spine once or twice. That and we noticed a subtle nod to the film \u0022Close Encounters\u0022 in a couple of spots.
