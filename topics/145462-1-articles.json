The bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Two cities decimated by two bombs. The effects still linger today, in Japan, America, and all across the world. Many people died in the belief that the war would come to a swift end. Although that is up to debate, this thread is not for that. It is to remember the lost lives of the citizens of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Cloud.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://www.atomicarchive.com/Photos/Hiroshima/images/Cloud.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\nMushroom cloud of Hiroshima\u0027s Little Boy\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/120478.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/120478.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\nMushroom cloud of Nagasaki\u0027s Fat Man.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n(Sorry about it not showing up)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-08-06T00:33:42Z\u0022 title=\u002208/06/2016 12:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 6, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by HoloYolo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cubinator","CreatedById":150330,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-06T01:58:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese technologies can be extremely useful for spacecraft and alleviating the ever-looming threat of climate change, among other things.
