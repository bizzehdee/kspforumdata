No tampering with physics, savegames, part values and such. Not sure how could it help, but please don\u0027t touch the debug menu either.\n\n**Background:**\n\nLet me skip names and details for plausible deniability. Our company recently acquired a nice, equitorial facility that will house our shiney space program. We also managed to sign a contract with a certain \u0027J. Kerman\u0027 - totally not the Kerbin-famous pilot. One of his (not *his*) terms of employment was to only use spaceplanes for whatever we do, as vertical launches bore him to death. To show our goodwill, we decided to ritually demolish the buildings required for using conventional rockets before he arrives to our premises. But efficiency is the most important thing for our company, so we are looking for the least demanding solution for this task.\n\nYour efforts will be well rewarded - we thought of handing out nice looking badges. Feel free to grab it from my sig. What\u0027s more - the winner will get one embrodied with **gold**en colored thread. Deal of the century I must say.

As much as you want, though if you check the scoring equation, you\u0027ll notice that each unlocked node increases the number by 5% - and the lowest one wins. I hope the 1.05 multiplier allows enough flexibility while rewarding low-tech solutions. Of course, the initial level 0 node doesn\u0027t count as \u0027unlocked\u0027 - I edited the OP for disambiguation.\n\n2. I don\u0027t think CTT touches the default nodes, even less likely that it tampers with the early ones. It\u0027s OK.\n\n3. I\u0027d rather ban KJR - it falls in the \u0027physics/part changing\u0027 category. C\u0027mon, those joins shouldn\u0027t last all the way to Jool or something. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\n4. Sure thing, I wouldn\u0027t limit someone\u0027s explosive creativity. The upgrade cost shouldn\u0027t be included in the score either - that would be too costy. Makes me wonder if leveling the target structures makes them any sturdier...\n\n5. I\u0027d rather disallow Stock Bugfix. It just does too many changes for me to check how it affects the challenge. The sticky launchpad bug is only relevant with a lv2 pad and a pretty heavy rocket. I assure you, that\u0027s not required to complete the task.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-18T16:41:57Z\u0022 title=\u002207/18/2015 04:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Evanitis**"},{"CreatedByName":"imaspacestation","CreatedById":145609,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-17T15:39:14Z","Content":"Oooh, this is interesting.

Wouldn\u0027t unlocking all tech nodes result in a significant score boost?\n\nI think you misunderstood - I blame my rusty English. Probably I could have worded better. Since the base of the scoring equation is the craft cost, lower final numbers are better. Unlocking nodes results in a higher number, while untouched (locked) nodes make no difference.\n\nEDIT: Nope, **you were totally right**, it was my rusty math skills. I was thinking about a multiplier of 1.05 and not 0.05. Sorry about that, it was like 10 years ago when I had to do math the last time. Hope I didn\u0027t cause too much confusion. Editing the equation in the op with the correct constant.\n\nAlso, the sticky launchpad bug is indeed affecting light rockets too. But I still think that working around it is more fun than just a fix.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-18T12:53:17Z\u0022 title=\u002207/18/2015 12:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Evanitis**"},{"CreatedByName":"Evanitis","CreatedById":145424,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-18T14:52:20Z","Content":"Phew, done it.
