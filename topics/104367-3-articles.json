Fairing *panels* aren\u0027t independent parts, they\u0027re sub-objects of the fairing until you deploy them. A fairing that is 10 sections high and divided into 4 sides would have 40 panels, yes. How many objects this will produce on deployment depends on how they group together (that\u0027s next up on my to-do list actually).\n\u003E As for how the broken-off bits behave after deployment, they are handled as solar panel pieces or engine fairings. They aren\u0027t fully persistent (which is good if you like 2 digit framerates). That doesn\u0027t mean they aren\u0027t solid objects, however. Point away from face.\n\nSo it doesn\u0027t increase part count until separation... On a side note, if mods could use/access this code we could have procedural wings break into segments as well upon impact ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"GusTurbo","CreatedById":57552,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-18T15:56:33Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I don\u0027t know what that is.

I don\u0027t think they count as parts.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E why bother caring when your gonna install the mods that give you the fairings youve been using for x amount of time anyway? hell i delete most stockparts and replace them with what I want from mods.\n\nNot everyone mods their game so heavily. For example, I don\u0027t use any part mods because I like to share my crafts with others.
