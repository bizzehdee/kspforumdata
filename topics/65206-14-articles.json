I know everyone always takes 0.64 but 0.625 is more accurate. The other thing is, unless were getting a new command pod, were going to have to scale down relative to the current 2.5 meter one (meaning 62.5% trick won\u0027t work here). So this would give a size of 4.2 meters. Equation is 2.5/x = 5/8.4; x is the value that needs to be found, and 4.2 is the answer. So 4.2 meters would properly size the SLS core stage to KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECoincidentally (or not), GusTurbo did some calculations earlier on another thread and found that the parts are about 4.125 meters.

I have to, once again, thank Squad for all their hard work on this. I mean, asteroids in KSP, that you can research and pull into other orbits (i.e. off rails)? That\u0027s awesome! And they\u0027re working with NASA, too. Sweet!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey have the asteroids down perfect, and the new parts are almost perfect. The claw is sweet, the launch escape system is sweet... the only thing I have to nitpick on is the new engines. And they\u0027re very small things, too. These are: the engines on the most powerful one here have engines that are not aligned in a 2x2 square - they\u0027re canted outwards like the old SLS design with five engines. So, they got the 4 engines correct, but the orientation is a bit off. I know it\u0027s not a replica (as far as we know/are guessing), but it still irks me somewhat. I\u0027d like to see it \u0022fixed.\u0022 (I say this because technically, Squad has already done a fantastic job).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other thing is, the engines on the new part, the one with 2 engines on it, look a little small. The nozzles look about the same size as the ones on the bigger engine; I\u0027m assuming they\u0027re based on the F-1B \u0022Pyrios\u0022 boosters, which are derived engines from the almighty F-1 from the Saturn V. So they should be a big bigger, it also might bulk up the look and make them look more powerful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut in the end, these are all minor things. Squad has done a fantastic job, I\u0027m just pointing out the things that my attention to details notices. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-24T21:17:47Z\u0022 title=\u002203/24/2014 09:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 24, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Woopert\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Giggleplex777","CreatedById":29829,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-24T22:02:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was slightly disappointed to find out that the clustered engines were one whole part.

The goal was to reduce our need for ridiculously complicated asparagus stages and rows of boosters, and make vertical stacking more viable in the game. For that, you need thrust. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor comparison, if you want to look at the Saturn-V, each of the five engines in the lower stage (Rocketdyne F-1 engines) put out something like 6700 kn of thrust. Each. Of course things are scaled down a bit here in comparison, but the lifting thrust on the Saturn-V at the pad was in the ballpark of 33,500 KN. To get that with Mainsails, you need at least 22 of them. Like I said, I know we\u0027re scaled down, but it\u0027s worth taking into consideration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Unless you\u0027re talking about the new 2.5m engine pairs specifically... yeah, if they replace mainsails altogether, that might be a bit OP.
