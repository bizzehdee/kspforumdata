Humans are one of the most manipulative, environmentally exploitative, resource-heavy dependencies of any species that has ever lived on the planet. We leverage our intelligence with machines, beasts of burden, irrigation systems, roads, shipping. The most social ant in the world cannot skype another ant on the otherside of the world asking for advice on how to deal with anteaters. Other animals manage to leverage their cognitive facilities in a few directions. Crows are of advanced EQ and they can take clams and bust them on rocks, find clever ways out of cages, octopus are great at getting into things and escape and mimicry artist. Dolphins are able to sense prey blind and feed as if they had x-ray vision. Wolves work together in packs to take down prey several time their composite size. All these measures of skill and learning are not to be discounted. But the day the first human sat down and crafted an adze, hollowed out a canoe and went beyond the line of site to a new land, where he and his mate(s) learned to exploit new resources human-kind would see the power of serial problem solving that is magnitudes above the manipulative ability, at its peak in societies, compared to other animals.

There are people working on it. There are mechanisms whereby they could be partially falsifiable, or where certain versions could be falsified. For example, the existence and potential detection of magnetic monopoles is a prediction of several versions of string theory. Attempts at detecting monopoles have thus far been unsuccessful, which falsifies certain versions of string theory which predict a high density of detectable monopoles. However, there are other versions which predict lower densities, which are not falsified.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are certain versions of quantum gravity which predict asymmetry in particle energies under certain circumstances. These predictions were not immediately testable or falsifiable at the time they were made, but now there are ongoing experiments at the Pierre Auger observatory and elsewhere which could falsify these predictions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAsking whether a theory itself is falsifiable is a little bit tricky.

Some have claimed they can cipher relationships up to 3.3 billion years in structure of proteins and/or genes. If quantum gravity is a major or primary\u00A0 source of information in the universe, its similar to the first cell that gives rise to all other cells. . . .once you get to that cell you can\u0027t really do much more phylogenetics, even protein and DNA phylogenetics would begin to loose power and eventually you cannot reconstitute life any farther back in time despite the fact you know it exists. This is called the coalescence wall. This was faced in human male lineages for a time because coalesces times in males were much more recent than in females; however it turned out, luckily, to be a sampling problem. The problem with things that coalesce to a single entity is that for example a single cell or a small set of proteins in that cell, is that you cannot see concurrent parallels. For example a line of dinosaurs that goes extinct is black to the molecular record, but the simplist microbes aren\u0027t megafauna and don\u0027t leave DNA lying around either (that we know of).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would argue that with regard to string theory, there is not one string theory but many, so if one string theory is correct, the others are incorrect and vis-a-vis the \u003Cem\u003Egrecan god argument\u003C/em\u003E why are not all of them incorrect. So from that point of view, apply Occam\u0027s razor and wait for some evidence to guide the selection.
