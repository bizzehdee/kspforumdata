I know it\u0027s always possible to open up the part.cfg file and check out the TechRequired (though sometimes it\u0027s re-arranged due to the various tech tree mods switching up node locations), but I just wanted to find out if an add-on like this existed. I play with a pretty heavily modded (mostly part mods too) game, so it\u0027s difficult sometimes to find out where to invest my science points because I want to unlock a certain part without going over each node (sometimes they are re-arranged via \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E patches too so they aren\u0027t always obvious).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnyways if it exists I\u0027d appreciate a link, tried searching a handful of combinations of terms in google to find something like this but came up empty. If it doesn\u0027t exist, well, then there\u0027s an idea for an add-on \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
