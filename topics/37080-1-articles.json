Go to \u003Cstrong\u003EGamedata-\u0026gt;Squad-\u0026gt;Parts-\u0026gt;Aero\u003C/strong\u003E, and select a nose cone. Open its part.cfg, and find the values for \u003Cstrong\u003Eminimum_drag\u003C/strong\u003E and \u003Cstrong\u003Emaximum_drag\u003C/strong\u003E. If you put a minus sign before the values, the part will actually have a negative drag, leading to better aerodynamic performance on a vessel. It\u0027s not perfect, and definitely not realistic, but it works for now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor some fun, give a cone -10 drag, and decouple it from a pod on the launchpad with a separator.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Eric S","CreatedById":57117,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-14T23:05:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESadly, this is pretty much true. The solution to making nosecones work involves either redoing the entire aerodynamics portion of the simulation, at which point you\u0027ve recreated FAR, or you give nosecones negative amounts of drag, opening you up to some insanely oddball behavior.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
