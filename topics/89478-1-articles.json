You just have to make the two SOIs of Eeloo and \u0022Kosma\u0022(idk, Charon analog name?) touch exactly, and they each orbit around a hidden Barycentre gravity source. The trick is that you can\u0027t get close to the Barycentre without being in the SOI of Eeloo or Kosma. This WOULD, however, mean going away from the normal mathematical formula for SOIs, you\u0027d need to fine-tune the SOIs so that they work in this special way.
