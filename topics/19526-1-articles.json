Your sidebars have too much fluff in them, which is distracting. I\u0027d rather have black bars than a KSP logo on them. Also, why add \u0022Subscribe\u0022 everywhere when you already have about 1000 subscribers?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2 You should only go for the partnership when you have enough videos and views to attract more people. Sure, you might want a few dollars a week, but if you start early for partnership and don\u0027t be consistent, people will turn away from you. Like an air-breathing engine/scramjet, use the partnership to turbocharge your channel and maximize output (revenue, views, etc.), but it only works when you already have an audience and you have their full attention.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2 Add tags and a good description. This is key to getting viewers since the search engine/indexer knows how to categorize your video and connect it with other KSP channels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBusiness might run a bit slow since there are many Minecraft and KSP channels out there, but keep up with your videos and people will find you soon!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
