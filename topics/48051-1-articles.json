I had a few launches, built a couple of rockets and ships, travelled to the Mun, etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo i decided to do something new - build my first orbital station on the Kerbin\u0060s orbit. For this, i need more effective rockets, to bring the parts up there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo my problem is\u0026gt; my rockets are starting to spin, roll - they are unstable becouse i can\u0060t toggle the thrust vectoring of the engines even when they have it already enabled. I am using v0.21.0.272. I tried toggling the gimbal and lock/free gimbal - not working. I have mounted S.A.S module - tried it enabled/disabled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo why it won\u0060t work?

Or, keep an eye out for wobbling, that encourages rolling too. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOR - perhaps your payload has snapped off the rocket during ascent, and it is now an uncontrollable piece of flying debris pushing you upwards, and rolling as it goes?
