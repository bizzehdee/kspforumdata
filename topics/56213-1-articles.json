Basically what you want to do is launch from your crater going any direction you want really. Almost as soon as you are off the ground perform your gravity turn (this will save some dV). Next thing you want to do is plop a maneuver node on your orbit and play with it a bit to see what happens, also try to get your Pe as low as possible (without changing Inclination). Execute the node. If your Pe is outside the atmosphere wait until you are outside the Man\u0027s SOI then burn retrograde. If your Pe is inside the atmosphere, sit back, relax, and don\u0027t forget to deploy your parachutes (and dump any unneeded stages just before reentry)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Grover","CreatedById":11972,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-15T12:27:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe simplest way to get your brave kerbal(s) home is to launch as normal, heading at 90 degrees, then when youre passing over the equator, raise your apomun right up to the top of the muns SOI, then fiddld with a manouver node to both set your inclination to zero, and circularise your orbit in one burn, then return home as nirmal (just from a much highrr munar orbit)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason this works is because you will have very little orvital velocity at your extremely high apoapsis, so changing your inclination takes very little fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd you havent wasted any fuel by climbing to a higher orbit since youre going to eject anyway, youve just used your fuel early to make your actual ejection burn (the one that sends you home) very small from the high munar orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe same principle also applies to other planets, except you can also use moons to sling around and get some free dv \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-15T14:32:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEven for landing on pole, the following approach applies.
