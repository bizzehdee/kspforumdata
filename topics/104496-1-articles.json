Take some fuel out of your early ships so you can get the rewards for 10, 25, and 50km in sequence. If your first shot breaks the atmosphere, you\u0027ve lost your chance at the later runs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Prioritise upgrading your mission control, and tracking station to tier 2. This will give you the ability to take more missions at once (more profit!) and make manoeuvre nodes. Munlandings are practical with tier 1, but anything beyond is risky.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Beware of the MK3 parts. The joints are weak, and the wings/wheels/engines currently available aren\u0027t big enough for them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- SAS doesn\u0027t work without a pilot kerbal, or a probe that specifically says it has SAS (the Stayputnik does not!), so your early missions will probably have to be manned and flown by Jeb, or some other pilot you hire. Bill and Bob tend not to get a look in until you have multi-man capsules.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Remember you can\u0027t EVA or take surface samples until you upgrade your astronaut complex. See tooltips in KSC for details of how to unlock these features.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hcube","CreatedById":137241,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-20T10:54:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022eddiew\u0022 data-cite=\u0022eddiew\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAFAIK there\u0027s been no word on a 1.0 release date, so if the OP feels like KSP \u003Cem\u003Enow\u003C/em\u003E, then I\u0027d say it\u0027s a fair call to start.
