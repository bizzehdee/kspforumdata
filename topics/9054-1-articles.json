I\\\u0027m after a height at which I can orbit Kerbin in a circular orbit, lower than the Mun\\\u0027s orbit. This means I will be travelling faster than the \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMun. After catching up with the Mun I want to be in a circular orbit around it with no extra burns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

What height and orbit speed will I need to attain?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know there are some clever people out there and I would be grateful for your help.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xazas","CreatedById":7761,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-03T11:44:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EInteressting idea... i try to figure this out, from my first feeling this should be possible... but not easy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: it is not possible without an extra burn. Max altitude over Kerbin to get captured: 14430 km, speed 484,7 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMin altitude 9570 km, speed 598,2 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMuns orbital speed: 529,3 m/s (should be right)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo after entering Muns SOI will will have a maximum speed of 68,9 m/s wich results in a periapsis of 78,71 km (wich is quite not circular)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo make a \u0027circular to circular\u0027 manouver you need an extra burn of 88,5 m/s once you are captured.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENotice, this is only the theory, for practical issues you should make the capture altitude a bit closer to the Mun or the orbit will be very unstable and you get back to Kerbins SOI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould someone please review this and correct me if i am wrong?
