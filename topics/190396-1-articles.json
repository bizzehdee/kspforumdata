You normally don\u0027t notice it, because most of your connections go to the ground-based tracking station dishes on Kerbin, which are orders of magnitude more powerful and dominate the pairing completely. But when you try to communicate from one ship to another, you\u0027ll quickly run into range limits. You can find infos on antenna combining and range calculations here:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/CommNet\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/CommNet\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour vessels have antenna powers of\u00A0~8,294,457 (the rover) and\u00A0~23,784,142 (the relay). By comparison, the basic tracking station in career mode has 2,000,000,000, the level 2 upgrade has 50,000,000,000, and the fully upgraded one (also when playing sandbox or science mode) has 250,000,000,000.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, there are two solutions. One obvious one, and one less obvious one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSolution 1, the obvious one: moar \u003Cs\u003Eboosters\u003C/s\u003E antenna power! Ditch the communotron-16S unless you need it to maintain comms during launch (generally not required in most cases). It is\u00A0good for having a small profile and being practically indestructible, but unfortunately doesn\u0027t combine at all with other antennas. Instead, mount better antennas. For example: even though the HG-5 is only partially combinable, each one of them is still better than seven communotron-16. If instead of one HG-5 and eight communotrons on the rover you had just two HG-5\u0027s, your antenna power would actually increase (very slightly). Bringing three or more would help a lot. Even better, though, would be the DTS-M1, which weighs less than a HG-5 while being four times as powerful. If you don\u0027t have it unlocked yet, welp, then HG-5\u0027s it\u0027ll have to be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSolution 2, the less obvious one: fix your relay setup, you\u0027re doing it wrong\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u00A0Think about it: you want your rover to be able to talk to Kerbin. But if your rover happens to be facing Kerbin, it already has a connection to Kerbin by default, because it can connect directly to the tracking station. So, why is your relay in Kerbin orbit? The only way your rover can see the relay is when it is looking at Kerbin, and then it will have the tracking station to connect to!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo, your relay should actually be in Mun orbit. This is the far superior choice for multiple reasons. Reason one, your rover might be able to see the relay while it cannot see Kerbin. If the relay however \u003Cem\u003Ecan\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0see Kerbin at that time, the signal can bounce through the relay and let the rover talk and transmit science while Kerbin is below the horizon from its point of view. Reason two, the rover and the relay need\u00A0much less antenna power to talk to each other at 100% signal strength, because the distance between them will be far smaller. That means you need to spam fewer antennas. Reason three, you leverage the huge power of your tracking station by letting it cover the large distance between Kerbin and the Mun. Whenever possible, you should have the tracking station field the largest single leg of the communication path, because it will be stronger than almost anything you can build. And the few things you can build that are stronger will require combining many, many of the best antennas into large arrays.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-12-16T10:25:26Z\u0022 title=\u002212/16/2019 10:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 16, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"VoidSquid","CreatedById":196199,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-12-16T10:24:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs per your screenshot, your rover has a direct connection to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, here\u0027s how a connection via relay antennas looks like, you see the additional icon in the middle of the five icons:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022screenshot3-png-Windows-Photo-Viewer-201\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002263.40\u0022 height=\u0022291\u0022 width=\u0022459\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.ibb.co/Wc7DJjP/screenshot3-png-Windows-Photo-Viewer-2019-10-29-13-08-43.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can hover your mouse over the icons to see the way your signal travels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AHHans","CreatedById":197939,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-12-16T11:31:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223717772\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022190396\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221576483892\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022201851\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Hdeedose\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, Hdeedose said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut I can only receive less than half the total of the science .\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow much science you get out of an experiment doesn\u0027t depend on the quality of the radio connection at all. Even the weakest connection will give you the full transmittable science if it is good enough to connect at all - and your electricity doesn\u0027t run out, but that\u0027s another topic. Some experiments (e.g. crew- and eva- reports) will give 100% science when transmitted, others (e.g. surface samples, but also mystery goo observations and science jr. materials studies) give only a small fraction of the total science when transmitted and not recovered.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn your first screenshot you see that if you recover the mystery goo observation you get 40 science, and if you transmit it you\u0027ll get 16.8 science.
