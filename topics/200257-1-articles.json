Here they are:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1: sometimes, I will scroll close to a vehicle\u00A0\u00A0and then even when the camera\u00A0is not touching the ship, the ship disappears. I googled the problem and found almost nobody else with this problem. I have only one mod: BDarmoury. Is it maybe this being the problem?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2: I landed a craft on the Mun with some kerbals to start a new Mun base.\u00A0 Then I launched the next vessel to the Mun.\u00A0 All was well until the vessel got around 100KM from the other vessel landed on the surface. There the ground vessel blew up without warning. I tried again, this time with no time warp. No luck. The ground ship blew up and I have still not found the source.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf anyone out there could help me with the problem that would be really \u00A0Nice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you and take care.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
