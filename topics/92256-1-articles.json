Do not beat yourself up on what the prolific posters think or do, again, just not worth it. The sad truth is, that, it seems like, those with 1000, 2000 or MORE posts are seen as authorities on the forum and almost sin like to be different than them. It has sparked fights on this board, when say, mr 5000 posts says one thing, and you, with 10 posts says something that is 180 degrees off of what they said, and you get flatly ignored.
