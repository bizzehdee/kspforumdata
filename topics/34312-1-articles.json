That means the rate at which your engine consumes propellant at 100% thrust will be constant, but the maximum thrust the engine puts out will vary with altitude. In a vacuum, you\u0027ll get the rated maximum thrust, as defined in the config file. At sea level, you\u0027ll get the thrust you \u003Cem\u003Eshould\u003C/em\u003E get at your engine\u0027s maximum fuel flow, based on the sea-level Isp defined in the config file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the screen shot above, you can see a static test of the LV-T30 engine from the stock game. The T30 has a rated maximum thrust of 215 kilonewtons, and a vacuum specific impulse of 370 seconds. That means at 100% throttle, the engine will consume about 59.25 kilograms per second of propellant/oxidizer mix. Its sea-level Isp is 320 seconds, and 320 seconds times 59.25 kilograms per second times \u003Cem\u003Eg\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u0161\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u003C/em\u003E gives you 185.95 kilonewtons of thrust. In the unmodded game, the T30 will still give you 215 kilonewtons of thrust on the launch pad; it\u0027ll just consume \u003Cem\u003Emore than its maximum fuel pumping capacity\u003C/em\u003E to do it. But with my plugin installed, in static testing the T30 develops 186.4 kilonewtons of thrust on the launch pad at its maximum fuel-flow rate of 59.17 kilos per second of fuel mix. It performs slightly better on the pad than predicted because \u003Cem\u003Ethe pad is slightly above sea level.\u003C/em\u003E Cool, huh?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EYou might notice the discrepency between the predicted fuel mixture flow rate of 59.25 kilos per second and the rate reported by the game of 59.17 kilos per second. There\u0027s a simple explanation for that: The game is wrong.

To convert kilograms to newtons, the game should multiply by 9.80665 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 but ModuleEngines multiplies by 9.82 instead.

GetInfo() is the method called on PartModules to generate the VAB GUI. You know, the little window-like things that pop up when you mouse-over a part in the part catalog section, that tell you Isp and thrust and whatnot. If I\u0027m correct \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC and I\u0027m \u003Cem\u003Epretty\u003C/em\u003E sure I am, as I\u0027ve done some fruitless screwing around with this \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC GetInfo() is only called once, at load time when the game database is being compiled.

They\u0027re one engine with a toggle-able mode, so their parts files have the parameters for jets (atmospherecurve with velocitycurve) as well as the parameters for a rocket (another atmospherecurve contained within its own ModuleEngines). From tests with other rockets I\u0027ve worked out how thrust is affected by this mod, and it seems pretty simple. I\u0027ll write it here, just in case I\u0027m wrong someone can correct me: The Isp atmospheric to Isp vacuum ratio is the fraction that the base thrust is multiplied by, when you\u0027re at 1 atmosphere. I haven\u0027t done any tests to work out how it interpolates to get the value at intermediate pressures, but I don\u0027t think it\u0027s relevant to figuring this out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore getting to what seems to be going wrong, here are (what I think) are the relevant lines from the B9 engine\u0027s part file:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(These are from the jet mode)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EmaxThrust = 640\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EatmosphereCurve\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E {\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E // Atm.P.

The Thrust Corrector mod works perfectly for the engine when it\u0027s in jet mode. On the runway, thrust is reduced to 88% (1600/1805) of its unmodded value. Switching to the rocket mode, I\u0027d expect the rocket\u0027s thrust to drop to 88% as well (330/375). The problem is, the thrust actually goes to a shockingly-low \u003Cem\u003E14%\u003C/em\u003E of its unmodded value on the runway. The only way I can think of to reproduce the measured thrust reduction is to use the %F multiplier from the jet engine when it\u0027s not moving (0.85), use the jet engine\u0027s base thrust instead of the rocket\u0027s base thrust (0.85*640/860), and then either the rocket Isp to jet Isp ratio for both components at sea level, or both components at vacuum (both ratios end up with a final thrust reduction of 13%). Obviously, something wacky is going on here, and it seems to be stemming from the fact that there are two ModuleEngines nested within one module that B9 uses to switch between engine modes. It just seems doubly strange to me because I would think that if the Thrust Corrector handles the jet engine correctly, then I\u0027d expect it to either handle the rocket correctly or treat the rocket exactly the same as it does the jet. Instead it seems to be pulling just one Isp value from the rocket, and otherwise pulling a bunch of data from the jet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anybody have any better ideas what might be going on, or what tests I could do to figure out what\u0027s going on? It\u0027s not the end of the world if I can\u0027t get these engines working, but they did look like they\u0027d be fun for good-looking SSTOs.
