The same ship. I\u0027ve rebuilt it three times, modifying what seems to be the problem every time. I built a rocket to take me to the moon with the lander attached. \n\nBasically, what happens is that random parts keep blowing up. For a long time it was one of the landing struts on the lander. It just kept blowing up. No reason, no warning, just BOOM! It happened after about 30 seconds no matter what I did. Even just sitting on the launch pad it would blow up. \n\nSo I rebuilt. Now, random things blow up randomly. But, more than that, my lander just falls apart. The service bay and the MK-2 Lander will just randomly detach from eachother. No reason I can find. They just all of a sudden slip off the fuel tank and engine assembly and either blow up if in atmosphere or fly off into space if in space. Heck, even if I\u0027m sitting at the launch pad it will happen sometimes. \n\nIs anyone else encountering random explosions or parts of your ship that don\u0027t want to stay attached no matter what you do? I have a feeling there\u0027s a bug in 1.04 with one of the pieces I\u0027m using. Nothing else explains it."},{"CreatedByName":"diomedea","CreatedById":93700,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T15:38:19Z","Content":"There\u0027s no use in posting about bugs in General Discussion. Have a look in [Support](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forums/7) (either the modded or unmodded sections, depending if you use add-ons or not) and you will find a number of reports already, some may fit with what you\u0027re experiencing. In case you have something to add, that may help diagnose your problem, you may do so in one of the threads already opened. If nothing fits, you can open a new one. But in any case, provide all the information as required in the guidelines for reporting bugs with those sections, Squad and any of the people providing support can\u0027t do much if those issues can\u0027t be replicated in a controlled situation. And sure nobody will try to fix something they can\u0027t see."}]}
