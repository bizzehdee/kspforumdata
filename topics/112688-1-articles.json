The issue is that Kerbin only has 1 super-continent which is draped over the north pole, from which 3 huge subcontinents extend southward. Only 1 of these reaches the south polar ice and KSC isn\u0027t on this one. Thus, you can cover the full distance and see both poles while keeping your feet totally dry, but you have to traverse the same subcontinent twice to do it instead of actually circumnavigating Kerbin. As for going by boat, this same pole-to-pole subcontinent has to be crossed at some point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, good luck.
