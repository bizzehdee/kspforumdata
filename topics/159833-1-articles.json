\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eis\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E significantly more challenging than getting a good Mun intercept in the first place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, the people who have

Kerbin (even if it\u0027s not what you originally wanted when you launched), so that it\u0027s reasonably rescuable.\u00A0 Shouldn\u0027t take much fuel.\u00A0 In either case, you then have a craft

As this was pre-Career Mode, there was no reason whatsoever not to use whatever booster I had laying around, so I mounted on top of an overbuilt Mainsail lifting platform. During the process of circularizing the orbit, I hit something...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know, I know -- this is \u0022impossible\u0022 due to the vastness of space and the relative velocities etc etc etc...but in my first save I always circularized at 100Km, tended to massively overbuild so I always had big lift stages still attached that I decoupled once I was there, and always had \u0022infinite debris\u0022 enabled. As I was near the very end of my burn, the relative velocity to my massive cloud of Kessler Syndrome was quite low.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was a one-in-a-million event, but that\u0027s cold comfort for Anand\u0027s remaining clones.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, long story short, the TIE fighter had (by definition) twin Ion engines, and could have recovered from a massively botched insertion -- except when I hit the debris, it damaged the TIE fighter to the point of being inoperable and also broke my coupling with the Mainsail lift stage -- inertia kept the TIE fighter pinned to the top of the still accelerating booster until all the fuel was expended...which, being a scale TIE fighter replica on top of a huge heavy lifter, was rather a LOT of extra fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy the time the booster finally ran out of gas, poor Anand was in deep Kerbol orbit, with a single, off-axis ion engine that could only spin him around and around like a top.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat kept him entertained for months, and I did stock the rescue drone with comic books...but poor little guy was left out there for all eternity. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022;.;\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;.;\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*Shakes fist at the uncaring Kraken*\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Jn-\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LoSBoL","CreatedById":174038,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-28T15:41:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI Guess you need to be a \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/174876-physics-student/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022174876\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/174876-physics-student/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Physics Student\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0 to do it with a Retrogade orbit \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/159838-the-goliath-challenge/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Leafbaron","CreatedById":167849,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-28T16:24:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCorrect me if I\u0027m wrong but doing a free return trajectory would mean you capture or not capture on the leading face of the body rather than intercepting on the trailing edge.

Additionally if one does not capture, the intercept would decrease your orbital velocity relative to Kerbin i.e. ensuring you \u0022fall\u0022 back to Kerbin rather than gaining additional velocity from the intercept and potentially being slung outside the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E of Kerbin. Regardless, my intercepts with the Mun typically happen at the Apoapsis of my orbit anyways and therefore any velocity received from the intercept is not enough to do anything to my orbit except possibly raise my perikee slightly.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Enorats","CreatedById":141841,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-28T18:43:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, that\u0027s about how it works. If your intercept occurs on the far side of the Mun then you\u0027ll end up getting a gravity assist to a much higher orbit.
