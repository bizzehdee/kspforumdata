I would very much appreciate if someone can rearrange it, showing all of the steps. I actually have an equation with n on one side, which I got with help fom Wolfram alpha. I just typed in my mass ratio equation, and it gave me different forms of the equation, and it showed what n was equal to. I then ran some numbers through it for a rocket I was familiar with, and the result worked. So I have the equation, but I want to know how to rearrange my mass ratio equation to end up with the equation for n. I won\\\u0027t post the equation here yet, so that those trying to rearrange the equation start off with a blank sheet.

You are correct that although TWR=2 is optimal in terms of fuel for ascending vertically in a constant-density atmosphere. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I mentioned above I tried attaching SRBs to the EZ Minimum II, which help by getting up to speed faster and saving a bit of fuel, but did not seem to make a lot of difference to the fuel I had remaining after achieving orbit. So that tells me you are close to optimal in terms of fuel usage. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking back at earlier calculations, I now see that your launch TWR of 1.5 is still within 90% of optimal, as the graph below shows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i47.tinypic.com/erlpow.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022erlpow.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(The fuel efficiency is proportional to Sqrt(1-r) / r where r is the Thrust/Weight ratio, so this is what I plotted). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see though, for a TWR below 1.5 the fuel efficiency drops off steeply as you spend more time hanging around fighting gravity and getting almost nowhere.

As we found in the Goddard problem mini-challenge thread, for a changing atmospheric density, the optimal speed for a vertical climb is equal to the local terminal speed, which of course increases with altitude, and the resulting optimal TWR required to \u0027chase\u0027 the terminal speed turns out to be 2.0 \u002B a/g, where a is the acceleration required to keep up with that increasing terminal speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing the exponential atmosphere model and a \u0027typical\u0027 sea-level terminal speed of about 100 m/s (it depends on the rocket\\\u0027s maximum_drag factors a little bit), I found that the optimal TWR as a function of altitude should be approximately given by:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETWR\u003Csub\u003Eopt\u003C/sub\u003E = 2 \u002B 0.1*Exp[\u002Baltitude / 5000] where the altitude is measured in meters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow 10000m the second term is small, but above that it begins to increase quickly, so you are right that above that altitude you need a TWR bigger than 2 (in fact closer to 3) at least until pitchover. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can provide the steps leading to this equation if anyone is interested - it just takes a little time to do the formatting. \u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
