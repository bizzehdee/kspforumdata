Good to know the Hubble is still hard at work. But I do agree that when the time comes NASA should replace it with another visible light telescope. If only for the sake of public interest.

There is something to be said for sticking with what works. Webb is not going to be a general use telescope like Hubble, and correct me If I am worng but it has a fluid cooling system which will require refueling. Webb is going to be more expensive to operate. 5 years after Hubble goes dark I predict that thier will be lots of regrets in the astronomy community. I don\u0027t think there is any other telescope in the history of astronomy going back 500 years that has produced so much public fascination as the Hubble, and I think the public takes it for granted that it will always produce or that ther will be a cheaper better replacement. One day they will wake up and find out that niether were true.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AngelLestat","CreatedById":58968,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-29T14:24:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAmazing picture, it gives a lot of clues on how the physics of that explosion work out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout cooling the James Webb, I dint read about that, but if you have energy, you always can pump heat from one place to another. So not sure why it would need extra helium for cooling, I guess the helium is used as \u0022heat carrier\u0022, nothing more.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
