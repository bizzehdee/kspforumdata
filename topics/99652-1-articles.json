I think it would be great if explosions generated shockwaves proportional to the size of explosions, which would push things away in a certain within a certain radius, maybe loosen a part or two sometimes. Because I know next to nothing about making KSP mods and I didn\u0027t find anything relevant on Google, I would like if somebody could make a simple mod to do the job. It would be appreciated. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Psycho_zs","CreatedById":137644,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T17:39:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree, exploding part gives no impulse whatsoever to it\u0027s neighbors, it is kinda dull.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIRL one of the leading versions of recent \u0022Progress\u0022 ship malfunction is an explosion of third stage fuel tank located on top of the stage.
