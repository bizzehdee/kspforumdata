It\u0027s surprisingly difficult to get an overview of what it does, the README is too much detail. e.g. it used to do gradual change in air density, instead of boundary shifts, and calculate drag based on cross sections, plus velocity dependent throttle efficiency. I\u0027m not sure what it stock now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd how does it now affect gameplay? I\u0027ve been using it out of habit, so if I remove it can I expect my launchers to go higher/lower, be more/less stable, reentry to be cooler/hotter/scarier?
