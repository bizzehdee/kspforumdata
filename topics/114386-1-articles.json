I\u0027m wondering what causes this, if it\u0027s an aerodynamic effect or if it has to do with the thrust/air intake at those speeds, or something else entirely. It\u0027s still in air-breathing mode too.\n\n![ZkJ2KDA.png](http://i.imgur.com/ZkJ2KDA.png)\n\n![QUJbsyj.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/QUJbsyj.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-27T22:52:20Z\u0022 title=\u002206/27/2015 10:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by LittleBlueGaming**"},{"CreatedByName":"anarkhon","CreatedById":22469,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T21:45:09Z","Content":"here is my 2 cents:its a bug or design error,sprites moving towards -Z too fast/too big acceleration"},{"CreatedByName":"clivman","CreatedById":139191,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T22:02:51Z","Content":"Happens whenever you use physics warp too."},{"CreatedByName":"koyoti","CreatedById":146859,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T22:33:20Z","Content":"I\u0027m no expert, but my guess is it\u0027s probably running out of intake air and changing to a rocket engine? \n\nI seem to remember you need the shock cone intakes to get max air breathing performance, but once the engine can\u0027t get enough air through the intakes it auto-switches and it\u0027s rocket engine all the way."},{"CreatedByName":"LittleBlueGaming","CreatedById":144665,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T22:48:40Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E here is my 2 cents:its a bug or design error,sprites moving towards -Z too fast/too big acceleration\n\nIf it were just the smoke trail, that\u0027s what I would have thought, but a crisp change in the sound makes me think it\u0027s something physics-related.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m no expert, but my guess is it\u0027s probably running out of intake air and changing to a rocket engine? \n\u003E I seem to remember you need the shock cone intakes to get max air breathing performance, but once the engine can\u0027t get enough air through the intakes it auto-switches and it\u0027s rocket engine all the way.\n\nStill in air-breathing mode, plenty of intake air.
