There are heat-effects flying past the ship, but the temp is the same as if there wasn\u0027t? I\u0027d like to see science-data added for that, for educational purposes. I know Kerbal isn\u0027t a 100% realistic simulation, but just like parachutes don\u0027t work on the Mun, the fact that reentry is HOT could be something kerbals and people alike could learn!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for reading, thanks for making the game!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
