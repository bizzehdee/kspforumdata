It looks simple and the overall shapes kind of are, but I have to constantly keep in mind that I\u0027m going to break things up into sections later. It\u0027s a bit of a balancing act. e.g. the wing base extends beyond the ends of the cargo bay in both directions. Now in order to make the wing mesh look smooth I can\u0027t just slice the whole thing exactly where the cargo bay ends. I\u0027ll have to cut a bit further. Luckily the Skylon cross sections show that\u0027s where the oxidiser tanks are so I\u0027m thinking the cargo bay part should double as an oxidiser tank. And there\u0027s still the issue of the heading/prograde discrepancy. I have one idea for that but it\u0027s a bit of a hack.

Some people will want this as a kit to fly a realistic Skylon, but it would be a bonus if the parts were also useful for building other craft. You\u0027re making a start on that by going with one of the existing part diameters rather than going with the exact 64% or 50% resizing. I think we should continue this a bit further - I\u0027d like to keep the fuel and oxidizer in the same tank/part, but that said, it doesn\u0027t change where you cut the parts. How much fuel/oxidizer goes into a part is controlled by the config file, not the actual volume of the part. We also only need to reach 40% or so of real world orbital velocity to get into Kerbin orbit, so having a bit less fuel than we could won\u0027t likely be a problem and should even leave a reserve for powered landings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thought, related to the previous - if you cut the nose cones etc. at points where the diameters match existing diameters then it would make the parts more reusable, for instance maybe parts like the nose core can be cut off where it reaches the 1.25m or 2.5m diameter point, even if it is a bit off from the logical divisions based on function. Same thing for the orbital maneouvering system, RCS and so on. I was going to suggest splitting the engine into two rather than three, but on second thought, doing it does allow someone to use the intake and engine without having to stick to the \u0022banana\u0022 shaped overall shape, so go with that. It would also make it easier for people to model the Lapcat, since the Scimitar engine doesn\u0027t seem to have the banana curve. With the forum down, this suggestion may have arrived too late, but if not, give it some consideration. As always though, this is largely your project, so the modelling choices are best left to the modeller. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Cpt.

Like I said before I think adding some seperate RCS parts is the best way to go. I\u0027ve seen Skylon animations showing propellant being ejected from both the nose and the tail but the docking animation doesn\u0027t show anything.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E \u003Cp\u003EYep, looked at the video, that and Figure 11 \u0022Suborbital deployment...\u0022 in the Skylon user manual definitely confirm the positioning of the pitch/yaw thrusters right at the bow and stern. That leaves the roll control up for question, but making separate attachable RCS for the wings and including roll thrust in the bow and stern would allow for both options.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Cpt.

There\u0027s some info about it in the tutorial thread, but if you have a problem you can always post a question.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll look at that for sure. Depending on when .22 comes out, we may not have to do that. If it should happen that different fuel technologies are part of the R\u0026amp;D tree (and I think that would be a realistic option to allow for developing more efficient engines), then we may have more options than just going with generic liquid fuel or making a custom hydrogen (Krydrogen?) resource. If not, then I should provide both options - hydrogen-based fuel tanks and generic fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow a last question - what colour should we go with? The black paint scheme shown in the RE videos is appealing, but should we consider going with a paint scheme that better goes the existing common colors? I expect that once/if Skylon becomes a reality, it would sport different colors for the companies that fly it, just like airliners, since it looks like they are expecting to sell them commercially. So we don\u0027t have to be tied to what Reaction Engines is using.

Kipard works on the real models; no intake animation on close/open and standard rocket fx. And with that I have been working on the Sabre engine; getting a better understanding of config files through experimentation and rewrites, fine tuning the performance to get it to as realistic a flight profile as possible, and lots of test flights of course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s my test plane and engines - I should have had the logo run along the side of the engine rather than around the circumference. I\u0027m not expecting this to be the final look (that is in the modeller\u0027s hands) but I needed to differentiate my test Sabre from the one in the B9 pack which I\u0027ve also been test flying for comparison.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zN6SABr.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022zN6SABr.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe widening of the engine from front to rear is a pain for putting onto planes built on 1.25m fuselage and the stock landing gear - the things tend to scrape the runway on take off. This won\u0027t be a problem with Skylon though as the fuselage is proportionately much bigger because of the low density of LH2 fuel and resultant high volume needed. But it could be for people who want to reuse the part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1NqeVYN.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00221NqeVYN.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now I\u0027m still using the LACE model (Liquid Air Cycle Engine - i.e. using a modded intake to produce oxidizer from intake air and an engine that really only works in rocket mode) for testing. But I\u0027ve been looking at the creative commons license B9 is packaged with and while I\u0027d like to get a confirmation from Careo or Bac9 (and if either of you read this, let me know if you mind please), I think that as long as we give due credit we can use the Exurgent Engineering .dll to get the true open/closed cycle mechanism. If not, I guess it\u0027s a crash course in C# programming for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd, another idea I\u0027ve been having - after doing all the research on Sabre, LACE,turborockets, scramjets, ramjets, ramrockets, air augmented solid fuel boosters and so on for this project, I have a hankering to make an add-on pack with all of those variations of engines. I\u0027ve had little luck with Eve landers so far and air augmented rockets would work great on Eve. You\u0027d need oxidizer but making use of that atmosphere as additional working mass will still result in higher ISP than conventional rockets. But that can wait until this project is done.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Requiem762","CreatedById":82185,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-08T18:38:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo is this mod dead?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-08T18:39:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELast post 8th October 2013, so probably not \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EatVacuum","CreatedById":72754,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-19T20:53:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Requiem762\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Requiem762\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo is this mod dead?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDeadish I\u0027d say.
