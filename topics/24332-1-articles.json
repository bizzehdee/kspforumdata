This gives 100 liters of liquid fuel for 0.772t mass. The Mk1 tank that you used is small and conveniently cylindrical, but it is has a worse mass fraction than the aircraft parts. It\u0027s heavier and carries less fuel than the Mk2 fuselage (or a pair of adapters).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I have less fuel in my final stage, and less mass throughout. Your craft is so heavy (relative to what 1 jet can lift at zero speed) that a significant amount of your jet fuel fights against gravity losses, and you spend more time at low altitudes where the jet\u0027s not as efficient. I also cut down on mass as much as possible by skipping the parachute (so even if I make it back to Kerbin I\u0027ll still need to have enough fuel left for powered landing. It should only need ~200 m/s for that, and cutting out the mass of the parachute gives me some of that for free), using the tiny struts to mount my intakes instead of the larger girders, 2 tiny decouplers instead of 3 medium ones, and the aircraft landing gear (which are currently massless in flight, and can stand harder landings too) instead of legs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Ridiculously many intakes, so the jet alone gets me past orbital speeds in the high atmosphere. I basically circularize an \u0022orbit\u0022 at roughly 40 km altitude, then keep going even faster to get the apoapsis up into space.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-04-29T14:15:57Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2013 02:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by tavert\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"occar","CreatedById":15056,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-29T14:37:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022planetx\u0022 data-cite=\u0022planetx\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027d love to see a picture of your craft.

You need to stay in the low 30\u0027s of km altitude until you get your jet\u0027s top speed, then start climbing again, slowly, as long as you can while avoiding flameout and eventually firing the rocket once you are as high and as fast as you can go.
