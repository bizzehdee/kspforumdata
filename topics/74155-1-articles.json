I\u0027ve got an entry tier craft that can make it to Minmus, land and return to orbit and then transfer to a low Mun orbit before returning home. I\u0027m currently parked in a low Minmus orbit after having landed once and I realised that I didn\u0027t really need to land the craft, I could just do an EVA landing. So Jeb went EVA and descended to the surface and got another surface sample and EVA report from a different biome before jet-packing back up to his craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I can just keep doing this and hit each/most of the biomes on Minmus (gaining about 190 points each time) without actually expending any of the crafts resources. When Jeb re boards the craft his EVA fuel is restocked and he can depart again. I\u0027m essentially making use of a pool of totally free dV. So, is this an exploit that enables me to gain more science than I really should?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a flip-side to using this free dV: returning to the craft is not all that easy. You have to rendezvous with the craft by eye, there is no nav-ball to guide you, so you have to use landmarks to get the right heading. You can plot M-nodes but you can\u0027t orient yourself to them and the time to node isn\u0027t displayed. EVA thrusters can be controlled from in map mode, so you can make adjustments to bring you close to a planned maneuver, but sometimes your heading drifts off while in map mode so you have to be careful not to suddenly veer off course and waste fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve done 3 EVA landings now and each time I\u0027ve returned with only just enough EVA fuel, so it cuts it pretty fine. It\u0027s a fairly risky way to get those precious science points.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what do you guys think? Are EVA landings a \u0027cheaty\u0027 way to gain more science, or do the extra challenges posed by them make it an acceptable approach?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my mind I\u0027m justifying the use of this \u0022free dV\u0022 because its kinda tricky (and also quite fun) and also by offsetting it against the RCS fuel in the command pod as well as some of my main fuel. I plan to return with a bit of excess fuel to roughly account for the mass of EVA fuel that I\u0027ve consumed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpenSpaceCorp","CreatedById":98977,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-04T23:55:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think it is justified (partly because Minmus is one of the few bodies that can allow that), but I would like to see in the future EVA fuel use resources such as monopropellant from the tanks or default little bit in each capsule.

That means with a sufficiently light craft, a kerbal constantly climbing a ladder and pushing against some bit that\u0027s connected to it, they create a constant thrust. Not much mind you, but on a sufficiently light craft: enough. Pretty sure that one was an Eve return.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPossible, but considering the thrust generated and acceleration, along with the fact that it seems to break under time acceleration (x2/3/4 physics accel, not \u0027on rails\u0027), it takes some pretty serious patience.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wilt57","CreatedById":64653,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T13:39:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d say it\u0027s an exploit as far as using an inexhaustible amount of fuel.
