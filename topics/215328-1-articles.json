In interplanetary space I redocked the 2 ships, quick saved, quick loaded and all the struts were still there despite the crafts having undocked and the framerate tanked to about 5-10 fps. this poor framerate stays there in different planet systems. the framerate before undocking was about 15 fps in interstellar space\u003Cimg alt=\u0022image.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002248.17\u0022 height=\u0022533\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/783832416031735840/1086313569836077106/image.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
