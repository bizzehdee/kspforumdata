Put a port somewhere on your plane that\u0027s reasonably close to the ground so an EVA Kerbal can reach it while standing beside the plane. Make a fuel bowser rover with a KAS winch on it. Land the plane. Drive the rover to the plane. EVA a Kerbal. Kerbal connects winch cable from bowser to port on airplane, which effectively \u0022docks\u0022 the rover to the plane. Transfer fuel from bowser to plane using right-click menus.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Seret","CreatedById":41409,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-11T17:22:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOr just build the plane and fuel truck as a single vehicle, so that you know the docking port lines up.

My preference is horizontal... you just need to keep fiddling with the height of the docking port on the tanker until it is correct. To be one the safe side, bias the docking port on the tanker to be a little lower. Then, when aligned, retract the nosewheel of the aircraft, so that the docking port lowers and locks into place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample... docking port on tanker is a little low.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7300/8747436398_7ee167035c_z.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00228747436398_7ee167035c_z.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter retracting the nosewheel, it docks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8278/8747436656_8734f48137_z.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00228747436656_8734f48137_z.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVertical docking example below, courtesy of Brotoro.
