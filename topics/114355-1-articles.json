But recently I noticed something odd.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I\u0027m in a equatorial orbit and I point normal or anti-normal and go to warp, my craft keeps it\u0027s direction and just rotates around normal axis, returning to the same attitude every orbit, as expected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, when I tried the same thing with a polar (90deg) orbit I noticed my direction spiraling farther away from normal with each orbit. When I looked at the skybox with camera in locked mode it seemed as if my craft was rotating around celestial north-south axis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, does that mean that craft frame of reference is rotating with respect to the orbit/celestial sphere frame of reference?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr am I missing something?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-29T08:56:44Z\u0022 title=\u002206/29/2015 08:56  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Silias\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T16:15:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not clear exactly what you\u0027re describing, but when close to the poles in some camera settings, the camera POV will rotate around the craft.

When you have time warp on, all rotary motions are stopped, so your craft always points the same way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason for this is simple: When on an equatorial orbit, you\u0027re on a 0 degree plane relative to it\u0027s center of mass. However, in a polar orbit, moving above that 0 degree plane will change your aspect angle relative to the 0 degree plane, and the planetary center of mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe game handles time warping in the coordinate system by calculating each position of the polygons that are on your craft, and doesn\u0027t let them change angular degrees relative to the center of said coordinate system, which can be anywhere.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Senormeens","CreatedById":145344,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T16:53:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eif i am understanding correctly, heres an explanation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are in a close to polar orbit and you use time warp, icons on the naval can seem to just change as you go around the planet. It isn\u0027t actually the craft changing direction, it is the fact the since you are in a polar orbit your position relative to the Body whose SoI your in changes. So say you\u0027re orbit kerbin passing under the south pole, it you point at the south pole then time warp to when you are above the north pole, your craft is still pointing the same direction but most of the points on the naval have changed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain i think this is what your asking about\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Yasmy","CreatedById":79995,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T20:07:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EImagine you are in a polar orbit of Kerbin, and the orbit is aligned with Kerbol. You go from directly between Kerbin and Kerbol to directly behind Kerbin from Kerbol in half an orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImagine also that you are pointing normally to your orbit. Thus you are pointing 90 degrees away from Kerbol at all points in your orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn a quarter year, you should be still be pointing normal to your orbit, but since Kerbin rotated 90 degrees around Kerbol, you now point directly away from Kerbol.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA quarter year later, you\u0027ll be pointing 90 degrees away from Kerbol again, and after a total of 270 degrees, you\u0027ll face Kerbol for a while.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt all times, you should still be facing normal to your orbit, even though the navball swirls around the entire time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Silias","CreatedById":116950,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T08:56:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the answers. After futher testing I thing it might be some bug, because it\u0027s not happeneing to every craft.
