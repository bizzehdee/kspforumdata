Even if you find some super cost effective way of doing it, 5 gallons is just not enough. So we will have to have a formula to calculate the winner. Say, (fuel \u002B oxidizer) / (COST / (fuel \u002B oxidizer)). This should encourage a good size payload so we don\u0027t constantly have to dock small ships with small payloads to unload a small amount, even if it is cost effective.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rules:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.
