Also, be aware that RCS monoprop will cross feed across stack couplers and drain from the top tank as well. To save its fuel for your probe or command module stage for later in your flight, you can disable the tank with a right click and click on the fuel option until you need it. That way, the thrusters will use fuel from the lower tank. Fuel lines are only needed when you want to connect tanks or engines across stack couplers for specific needs such as asparagus or onion staging and for drop tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ElectricCake","CreatedById":70972,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-19T22:46:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere is a tip, try to start on a simplistic design, test different variables of it, and when you finally get into orbit, but can\u0027t exactly get to the moon, just add more fuel, and you might just get there.
