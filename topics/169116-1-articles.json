The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E is temperature dependent higher temperature means higher \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E. But the engine is damaged by high temperature, so the temperature is a function of heat flux, Some other gases of choice. CO2 is not\u00A0 a gas of choice its M is 44 SQRT is 6.63 so about 1/3rd the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E of helium. It decomposes at 3500K and 68 ATM to about 20% CO and O2. Neither of which really help CO is extremely stable. Methane at higher temperatures decomposes to 2H2\u00A0 -\u00A0 and C at 1073 k but carbon polymerizes and forms carbon tubes (not desired). However this can be prevented by discharging large amount of electons into the gas\u00A0 at the chamber outlet. Methane can control temperature since is absorbs heat and turns it into chemical energy, giving a slightly better throttle range, but for the most part when you are running the engine you cannot throttle without slowing the reaction down and waiting for the heat to dissipate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I imagine that the way they run a nuclear engine is that the trigger the uranium, they wait for heat to climb, then open the throttles until temperature and mass flow equilibrate, before shutdown do the opposite, silence the uranium, wait then back off on fuel flow until its safe. In the equation on nuclear rockets T is preset, I\u0027m sure that its not and since it is not it will be difficult to throttle, at least without some lag. I don\u0027t know but I can be pretty sure that throttling and controlling T are not the same as in a chemical rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PB666","CreatedById":107380,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-01T16:33:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223257335\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022169116\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221514798340\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022176203\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022T-10a\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n6 hours ago, T-10a said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHey there!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m trying to calculate the thrust of an NTR (to assist in Module Manager configuration of Atomic Age, Ven\u0027s Stock Revamp and Stock NTRs).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve got the exhaust velocity (and therefore specific impulse) from \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/engines.php#thermalve\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere at Atomic Rockets\u003C/a\u003E.

But the NTR has a higher exhaust velocity because it uses low molecular weight hydrogen as propellant, instead of that high molecular weight water that comes out of the SSME. So the NTR has a theoretical maximum exhaust velocity of around 8,000 m/s while the SSME is lucky to get 4,400 m/s.

Doing the math for a liquid or gas-core NTR nets better ISPs (1486s for liquid, around 1700s for a closed GCNR), but development for those is about as near future as everyone claims sustainable fusion reactors are.

Its better to have your late circularization engines to give you a apogee somewhere beyond GSO where you can fire it and no-one will really figure it out until months later.
