But isn\u0027t RCS usage only an indirect effect? In space, the things that matter are momentum/impulse/time - time not being taken into account by either KAS nor KIS, but the effects of momentum/impulse were always a limit on how big (heavy) parts one could move with KAS. Light parts just work, medium parts can be done (up to maybe half a ton if one is careful or \u0022cheats\u0022 by preserving momentum/not changing direction after picking up the part), but for anything heavier than that I found it easier to just \u0022attach\u0022 the not-yet-detatched part in steps towards the target position than actually picking them up. So 1t is already pretty heavy as far as I am concerned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other limitation in space is the biological limits of the body - bringing things into the exact right position is still very much limited by the amount of controlled force you can apply and the ability of your body to tolerate said force without taking damage. The regular EVA suit doesn\u0027t help with that, and the limit would probably be less than factor 5 above what one can move in the natural gravity environment the body is used to. Now, if that kerbal had not just a wrench, but also an exoskeleton...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would also be interesting to see whether it could be allowed to connect (attach/weld) parts together which are already in the correct position (like \u002B/- 10cm, \u002B/- 10 deg). In that case one could argue the remaining position adjustments are taken care of by properly placed anchors/threads/screws. Let\u0027s say I wanted to connect two asteroids using girders (because claws are a buggy nuisance) - it isn\u0027t really that difficult to bring the parts into position using tugs, but right now probably neither KAS nor KIS can be convinced to let me put the screws in place. (Current workaround: KAS-grabable standard docking ports. Trusses with two winches should work even without MM, but .. part count.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully next week I\u0027ll have time to actually play around with KIS and look into the container-conversion-problem.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Svm420","CreatedById":136047,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-22T17:08:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KospY\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KospY\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs KIS and Kerbalmass changing the same part variable (part.mass), it seem difficult to resolve this kind of conflict.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, the default kerbal mass is hardcoded in KIS, so I can add a parameter in settings.cfg, so you will be able to change the kerbal mass to what you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease do that is all I need.
