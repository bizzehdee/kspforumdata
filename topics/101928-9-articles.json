As it is, kerbals can carry a lot of stuff, yet that stuff doesn\u0027t seem to take up much space.\n\u003E You could probably get away with kerbals only having 1/3 of the storage volume, and adding a slightly shrunk version of the old carryable containers to use as backpack.\n\u003E \n\u003E Carryable containers were fun, it would be a pity to do away with them completely.\n\nBesides the \u0022realistic/weird\u0022 problem of carrying containers on back, there is also a gameplay problem. KSP is all about building vehicules. It seem logical to use rover for moving containers for me (and it give purpose to them) and you can also use KAS magnet to lift them. With bigger containers incoming, that will be the only viable solution anyway. \n\nIn fact thinking about how to move containers is part of the game for me ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nFor container manipulation in space, it\u0027s always possible to use some kind of \u0022space motorbike\u0022 : \n\n![o9vvVef.png](http://i.imgur.com/o9vvVef.png)\n\nYou can even build it from containers parts.\n\nAlso, the eva tether will be another solution to move containers around later.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Any ideas why some parts are ok to place on the munar ground (and be there after the next reload WITHOUT weird jumps or explosions) and others do strange things after a reload or explode right away?\n\u003E Just the thought of getting this mod krakenfree would be fantastic ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nIt\u0027s a KSP engine problem here, nothing I can do for that...

That was not a problem on KAS because grabmodule was added to stock parts. \n\nHowever, I want to avoid \u0022patching\u0022 every part of the game for mod compatibility and simplicity. Only some dedicated part will be attachable on static (like the pylon on KAS).\n\nFor KIS, we are working on a new part for this.

Recover Experiment X at Kerbin.\n\u003E \n\u003E So Get my rocket into orbit, out goes the engineer and places experiment X (POSA I / PPMD) it does its thing and runs the experiment. When complete and finalized, engineer goes out and recoveres the experiment and store it in his inventory. The ship lands on Kerbin, and I recover. I get the science from the experiment, condition 1 of the contract is completed, but not condition 2. It is as if placing it into the inventory hides the part from the contract gods.\n\u003E \n\u003E It is a trivial matter as I force complete in the debug menu.

But isn\u0027t RCS usage only an indirect effect? In space, the things that matter are momentum/impulse/time - time not being taken into account by either KAS nor KIS, but the effects of momentum/impulse were always a limit on how big (heavy) parts one could move with KAS. Light parts just work, medium parts can be done (up to maybe half a ton if one is careful or \u0022cheats\u0022 by preserving momentum/not changing direction after picking up the part), but for anything heavier than that I found it easier to just \u0022attach\u0022 the not-yet-detatched part in steps towards the target position than actually picking them up. So 1t is already pretty heavy as far as I am concerned.\n\nThe other limitation in space is the biological limits of the body - bringing things into the exact right position is still very much limited by the amount of controlled force you can apply and the ability of your body to tolerate said force without taking damage. The regular EVA suit doesn\u0027t help with that, and the limit would probably be less than factor 5 above what one can move in the natural gravity environment the body is used to. Now, if that kerbal had not just a wrench, but also an exoskeleton...\n\nIt would also be interesting to see whether it could be allowed to connect (attach/weld) parts together which are already in the correct position (like \u002B/- 10cm, \u002B/- 10 deg). In that case one could argue the remaining position adjustments are taken care of by properly placed anchors/threads/screws. Let\u0027s say I wanted to connect two asteroids using girders (because claws are a buggy nuisance) - it isn\u0027t really that difficult to bring the parts into position using tugs, but right now probably neither KAS nor KIS can be convinced to let me put the screws in place. (Current workaround: KAS-grabable standard docking ports. Trusses with two winches should work even without MM, but .. part count.)\n\nHopefully next week I\u0027ll have time to actually play around with KIS and look into the container-conversion-problem."},{"CreatedByName":"Svm420","CreatedById":136047,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-22T17:08:29Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E As KIS and Kerbalmass changing the same part variable (part.mass), it seem difficult to resolve this kind of conflict.\n\u003E \n\u003E However, the default kerbal mass is hardcoded in KIS, so I can add a parameter in settings.cfg, so you will be able to change the kerbal mass to what you want.\n\nPlease do that is all I need.
