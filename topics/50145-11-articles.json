I like the size of the windows but the ladder rungs \u002B hatch should be the same size as the stock ones. Windows can be any size whereas pieces kerbals interact with need to be a certain size for ergonomic reasons.

I agree that the bits kerbals would interact with should be standard stock size, like the hatch and even the ladder rungs.
