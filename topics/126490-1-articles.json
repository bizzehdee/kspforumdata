Really handy. A few additional tweaks would make it even handier.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[B]Stack trace.[/B]\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhen it logs an exception: Please include the stack trace in the logged message? [I]Please[/I]? Telling me that \u0022some code somewhere, in somebody\u0026#39;s DLL (maybe mine, maybe not), threw a NullReferenceException\u0022 is not particularly helpful.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[B]Log message filter.[/B]\u003Cbr\u003E\nUnfortunately, there\u0026#39;s just one log, and everything writes to it, and it scrolls past, and often when I\u0026#39;m debugging I would really really like to filter the view so that it only shows the lines I\u0026#39;m interested in.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt would be really nice if that tab had a little edit box at the top where you could type a string, and it would filter the view to only show messages that include that string. (Bonus points if you can actually put a regex in, but I\u0026#39;d settle for a simple literal string).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[B]State persistence.[/B]\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis last one is a fairly minor nit, but it would remove a source of annoyance. It would be nice if the debug menu could remember its location from one play session to the next, and also remember its am-I-scrolled-to-the-bottom-or-not state. Debugging a mod involves endless cycles of \u0022make code change, rebuild, copy DLL, restart KSP\u0022. Every single time, after pulling up the debug menu, I need to drag it to where it needs to be and then drag the scrollbar button to the bottom. Yes, I know, it seems like a little thing, but it gets kinda old when I\u0026#39;m on the umpteenth iteration of restarting the game and every little bit helps. :)\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hermes47","CreatedById":57627,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-26T06:27:36Z","Content":"\nWith your first point, it already does.
