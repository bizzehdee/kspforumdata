When I start KSP today, it says \u0022Checking for updates\u0022. It has been this way for hours. I\u0027ve spent the last 12 hours shutting down KSP and restarting it to get it to connect and get the new version, but to no avail. It just sticks there forever.\n\nIt says if you\u0027re having trouble with the downloads, try the KSP store. The only option is to purchase another copy. If I go to support, only my original 0.23 is available and there\u0027s nowhere on the site to download the 1.0 version that I can find.\n\nIt was my understanding that the 1.0 version would be released to all customers who\u0027ve been part of the program since the beginning. Is this not the case? Do I need to repurchase it? How is everyone else (who is NOT on Steam) getting it?"},{"CreatedByName":"Mulbin","CreatedById":55562,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T08:14:35Z","Content":"1.Go to the main website\n\n2.Click the \u0022Store\u0022 tab\n\n3.Log in with your email and password\n\n4.Click on \u0022my account\u0022\n\n5.Click download button next to kerbal space program."},{"CreatedByName":"Reactordrone","CreatedById":110060,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T09:08:42Z","Content":"This might be why,\n\n\u003E \n\u003E [h=1]Server Migration[/h]Kerbal Space Program website is in maintenance mode while we are performing a Server Migration.\n\u003E We appreciate your patience.\n\u003E \n\u003E - Squad Team"},{"CreatedByName":"Mulbin","CreatedById":55562,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T09:11:29Z","Content":"Reactor, the migration finnished yesterday and the website is visible to 99% of people now.
