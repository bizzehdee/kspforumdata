The only caveat is that you need to unlock docking ports so you can run a more efficient series of missions (and as many science parts as possible that actually work on the Mun). If you milk the Mun dry of all of its science, it will give you about 500 science shy of what\u0027s necessary to unlock the entire tech tree. Minmus and Kerbin are more than capable of picking up the slack there, and are good choices for getting the science necessary for docking ports and science parts for your big Mun mission.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lammatt","CreatedById":21777,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-21T05:34:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei did a Jool system probe, and transmit a couple times of everything i got, and it gave me like ~2000science\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebut then one land-and-return from Mun gives me 500ish\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Crowdpleaser","CreatedById":79992,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-21T05:36:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBut again i have to ask: When you are so keen on maxing out your Science and Tech Tree so quickly, why not play Sandbox instead?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lammatt","CreatedById":21777,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-21T05:40:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Crowdpleaser\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Crowdpleaser\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBut again i have to ask: When you are so keen on maxing out your Science and Tech Tree so quickly, why not play Sandbox instead?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewell....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eisnt the only use of the tech tree is to let you unlock things?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Crowdpleaser","CreatedById":79992,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-21T05:48:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022lammatt\u0022 data-cite=\u0022lammatt\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ewell....\u003Cp\u003Eisnt the only use of the tech tree is to let you unlock things?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECorrect, but i think the point is to learn the Game and the Parts.
