There is no need to paint the tank since it just reduces the amount of payload you can lift. Paint may not sound like a major amount of mass but consider the amount you would require to properly cover an 8.5m booster core. The artists\u0027 renderings seem to be going for a publicity angle to try and hark back to the Saturn V. The only reason I can think of for them to paint the tank would be to protect against UV damage if the stack was going to be left out in the sun for months on end.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Notably, the SLS stages will depart from MAF without any white paint, despite NASA images showing a \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CSaturn V\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 type paint scheme for the monster rocket.

For the longest time, in the Trainz/Tomas community (when I was like, 8 or something), it was Diesel 10. For the KSP Forums, when I first joined, it was a proper replica of the Saturn V. Old versions that were broken beyond use where available, but they didn\u0027t work in the newer versions. Then someone started on the Saturn V again, released one, and then gave up before it was finished. And then, finally, OLDD and FASA made their Saturn Vs. Now it seems the *Diesel 10 Project* is SLS.\n\nGood for you for releasing finished parts in bits so we can enjoy them! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Exterior was orange on Ares family rockets, which was very similar.

All of the drawings and concept art of Space Shuttles showed a white external tank. It\u0027s publicity. THey want you to think of the glorious Saturn Vs. Maybe the first few SLSs will be painted with black and white stripes, but eventually when they want to lift something at the limit of an SLS\u0027s cargo capacity, they\u0027re not going to paint them anymore."},{"CreatedByName":"sashan","CreatedById":98897,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-12T17:38:41Z","Content":"Do you mean they would fly unpainted, like Atlas?

But the SLS has insulation inside, as far as I know.\n\nI believe you are mixing up paint (white or black stuff like what we see in current renderings and what was on the Saturn V) and the foam insulation which is orange.\n\n From what I have read [here](http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2013/03/maf-major-modification-work-sls-production/) the SLS tanks will most likely be unpainted, as in you will see the exposed orange foam on them. Ultimately painting them would be majorly impractical as it would add a not insignificant amount of unnecessary weight to the vehicle.\n\n The only instance I can foresee them actually painting the SLS would be if the lower stack or any part really is going to be spending a significant amount of time outside exposed to the elements, in which case some kind of additional coating would indeed be needed. That and maybe the first couple of launches where delta-v requirements are well within the capabilities and margins of the vehicle and they are looking for a publicity angle, trying to harken back to the days of the iconic Apollo program. Similar to STS-1 and STS-2, they had their external tanks painted white. Not painting them saved around 272 kilograms (600 lb) according to [this wiki article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS-2) and is why every shuttle mission afterwards didn\u0027t."},{"CreatedByName":"Sampa","CreatedById":130079,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-12T18:51:55Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Modified for the KSO, looks better than the stock KSO booster IMO ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\u003E [http://i.imgur.com/mVyoxis.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/mVyoxis.jpg)\n\nWow!
