I have been toying with this, but it has certain distinct drawbacks, some notable being that you do not take advantage of the speed of the body you are on (for the same reason most rockets launch east) and that intercepts are a bit harder to achieve, as you do not \u0027chase\u0027 your target along a trajectory but only briefly cross them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt offers some advantages too, most notably that no other bodies are in the way. You can argue about the practicality of that though, considering space is predominantly empty.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hawkinator","CreatedById":57569,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-05T07:09:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, I\u0027ve used that one several times in KSP. It seems to work especially well in the Jool sytem, probably because of the Laplace resonance of the moons and whatnot, although this is pure speculation.
