Better results are observed when placing them close to the CoG (on the longitudinal axis). Sink the Slat in the leading edge for better results. Most impressive results are with really really heavy planes powered by those weak jets (think 100 tons mk3 planes with airliner wing).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProperly simulated consequences are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EHigher lift for the same speed (aka, lower take-off and landing speed).

Which is really weird visually, and quite a shame when trying to do multi-positions flaps. However you can have several flaps along the wing and have them bound to different action groups. This way you have the desired intermediate lift/drag configurations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could provide pictures if someone is interested.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
