Even if you recover every stage, most of it will be below the 98% maximum return value unless your rocket never leaves the vicinity of KSC, and it will also have 0% of the 30%-or-so fuel cost returned. Also you can \u0022exploit\u0022 the return mechanism with any sort of SSTO rocket or space plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think a better solution would be to slap a refurbishment cost of 30-40% to anything returned.
