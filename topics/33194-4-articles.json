I am however having some issues and was hoping you could provide some insight. In the SPH/VAB the rockets are showing the activated animations, I can see the rocket burn. This is also occurring on the runway and launchpad. I have not experienced any issues up until I installed Ferram Aerospace, perhaps there is an incompatibility there?
