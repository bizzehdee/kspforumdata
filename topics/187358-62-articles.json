If when a player time-warps all of their vessels, all planets and moons, and all other players vessels don\u0027t move naturally along their orbits then you\u0027re not working within a consistent physical system. That makes it very difficult to do any of the things that a game like KSP requires--rendezvousing, docking, planning for transfers and organizing supply routes. T_v\u0027s cyclic/local bubble idea has its pros and cons but it does at least function. They accomplish this by breaking the game into a series of different realities. When a player enters a new \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E the objects in it become visible and their positions are transposed onto that players timeline.

There\u0027s another bubble-reality thats created when you enter the physics range of another players vessel as you are teleported to its position as viewed by its owner. Now... is this slightly confusing? Maybe, but so would be managing a 4d reality shared by multiple players. It does at least allow players to time-warp at will when they need to without anything wacky going on. When Player 1 enters a rendezvous maneuver with Player 2\u0027s station both objects move naturally along their orbits even if both players time-warp. They don\u0027t have to sit and wait for 30 minutes while the approach happens in real time, or worry that the target might suddenly vanish and reappear somewhere else because its owner timewarped.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-11-28T15:07:11Z\u0022 title=\u002211/28/2022 03:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 28, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vl3d","CreatedById":219348,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-11-28T15:10:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224203661\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022187358\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221669647856\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022105624\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pthigrivi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n10 minutes ago, Pthigrivi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen they time-warp all of their vessels, all of the planets, and all of the vessels in that \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E move relative to their progress through time.

All of these systems allow people to easily abuse time warp to hinder others, if someone is determined enough.

In those models each player has their own timeline which splices into others whenever they interact with a new \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E or another player\u0027s vessel. Player A is working in and around Kerbin and Player B flies out to Jool and back. When Player B arrives back at Kerbin they synch in real-time. That means a few in-game days or hours have elapsed for Player A and 6\u002B in-game years have elapsed for Player B. Neither \u0022Start time\u0022 nor \u0022Conditions met\u0022 are fixed or comparable points in time for all players. In my example above when Team 1\u0027s mothership arrives 300 days have elapsed for one player, but zero time has elapsed for the other 3 because each of those team members exists in their own distinct timelines. Because you don\u0027t have a single, coherent reality you end up not measuring victory the way a space-race works--an actual race against a shared clock--but based entirely on how a team happens to have allocated jobs.
