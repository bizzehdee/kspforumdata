I have been making the parts in blender and have made objects that I have imported into KSP. I want to make a ionEngine. I have made the object, applied the script and imported in to KSP but it has no thrust. The engine uses power and fuel but I am not getting lift. I have looked around on this topic a bit and lots of people are putting their objects in unity. Am I sup post to do this as well and if so would some one be able to tell me what to do. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers, O.C.R\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-21T05:44:01Z\u0022 title=\u002210/21/2013 05:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 21, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by O.R.C\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Milkshakefiend","CreatedById":70644,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-08T12:39:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHave you not been importing any objects into Unity before this?
