Once you drop below escape velocity, then suddenly it counts as atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, prior to 1.0 you couldn\u0027t use a pressure meter in vacuum. It wouldn\u0027t let me take a measurement until my speed dropped below escape. Now that they\u0027ve relaxed that requirement, I\u0027m not surprised that they\u0027d give a reading of \u0022space.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not clear to me that this is a bug-- may be by design. The point of having different science results for different situations is to add a level of challenge/difficulty to the game (e.g. you don\u0027t get science for landing until you are up to the challenge of landing without going splat). High-speed flybys are easy, and making them so that they just happen to graze the atmosphere isn\u0027t any harder than going by in a vacuum. Being able to brake until you\u0027re captured is more of a challenge, so it makes sense to me that they\u0027d want to say \u0022you don\u0027t get credit for being in atmosphere unless you\u0027ve successfully managed capture.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhether it\u0027s a bug or by design, though, it certainly has potential for confusion-- i.e. isn\u0027t clear to the player \u003Cem\u003Ewhy\u003C/em\u003E it\u0027s saying space.

Now the instruments are inconsistent, which is bad, and seems likely to be an oversight by Squad rather than a deliberate choice. The only question is whether they should all say \u0022atmosphere\u0022 or all say \u0022space\u0022 when you\u0027re physically in-atmosphere but on an escape trajectory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, my own preference would be to just say things act like they\u0027re in atmosphere if they\u0027re in atmosphere, regardless of trajectory. It\u0027s what a player would expect. If for gameplay reasons you want to put some sort of limitation (e.g. \u0022this instrument only works at speeds under X\u0022, then say that in the part description and give a \u0022speed is too high\u0022 error message when someone tries it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
