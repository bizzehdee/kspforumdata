I have the Kerbal Engineer installed, no other mods. Has anyone else noticed this, a bug maybe..?\n\n![screenshot1.png](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-s2QYzmVAqB0/VVOCMkXCbdI/AAAAAAAAGe8/b3YsG4TnVzs/w1680-h1028-no/screenshot1.png)\n\nThe materials study seemed to work allright, telling me that it\u0027s in the upper atmosphere, just the little instruments were saying they\u0027re in space."},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T19:28:11Z","Content":"Did you try that before or after your velocity dropped enough that you\u0027re no longer in an escape trajectory?\n\nI\u0027ve noticed this behavior around for a long time: if you\u0027re still going so fast that you\u0027re on an escape trajectory, it doesn\u0027t matter whether you\u0027re physically in atmosphere or not, the instruments think you\u0027re in space. Once you drop below escape velocity, then suddenly it counts as atmosphere.\n\nFor example, prior to 1.0 you couldn\u0027t use a pressure meter in vacuum. It wouldn\u0027t let me take a measurement until my speed dropped below escape. Now that they\u0027ve relaxed that requirement, I\u0027m not surprised that they\u0027d give a reading of \u0022space.\u0022\n\nIt\u0027s not clear to me that this is a bug-- may be by design. The point of having different science results for different situations is to add a level of challenge/difficulty to the game (e.g. you don\u0027t get science for landing until you are up to the challenge of landing without going splat). High-speed flybys are easy, and making them so that they just happen to graze the atmosphere isn\u0027t any harder than going by in a vacuum. Being able to brake until you\u0027re captured is more of a challenge, so it makes sense to me that they\u0027d want to say \u0022you don\u0027t get credit for being in atmosphere unless you\u0027ve successfully managed capture.\u0022\n\nWhether it\u0027s a bug or by design, though, it certainly has potential for confusion-- i.e. isn\u0027t clear to the player *why* it\u0027s saying space. Seems like there should be some sort of custom error message displayed, for cases where you\u0027re physically in atmosphere but on an escape trajectory, to let the player know what the deal is."},{"CreatedByName":"kurja","CreatedById":66303,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T20:34:08Z","Content":"On escape trajectory, I wasn\u0027t going to land, just getting a capture.\n\nIf it\u0027s by design it\u0027s not working correctly since some experiments show \u0027atmosphere\u0027 and some don\u0027t."},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T06:30:28Z","Content":"Yeah, looks like they missed a spot when they updated which science instruments work where.\n\nTry letting your aerobrake continue until you\u0027ve slowed to a closed orbit and see if it works then."},{"CreatedByName":"n0xiety","CreatedById":143324,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T06:50:42Z","Content":"Well it would be strange to be able to take a temperature scan from the atmosphere while you are burning in the atmosphere because of your speed.

And ofc what\u0027s even more weird is that the game allows me to measure the temperature of space around a celestial body while I\u0027m inside the atmosphere ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nIf you think it would be silly to measure the atmosphere\u0027s temperature during re-entry, think of it as a measurement of the craft\u0027s temperature or something. Apart from radiation sensors, temperature meters only measure their own temperature anyway, if you want to be technical about it."},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T17:43:40Z","Content":"I can think of three reasons why a particular behavior (about anything) would be implemented in-game:\n\n1. Because it\u0027s realistic, and realistic is good.\n\n2. Because it\u0027s a conscious design decision for gameplay reasons.\n\n3. Because... um... it just kinda happened because we forgot about this edge case and this is what it ended up doing.\n\nI see folks here making #1 comments and #2 comments, but I suspect that what\u0027s actually going on is #3. ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nPre-1.0, the instruments were at least consistent with each other, so I\u0027d guess it was a conscious game-design choice to make a gameplay decision that trumps realism. Now the instruments are inconsistent, which is bad, and seems likely to be an oversight by Squad rather than a deliberate choice. The only question is whether they should all say \u0022atmosphere\u0022 or all say \u0022space\u0022 when you\u0027re physically in-atmosphere but on an escape trajectory.\n\nPersonally, my own preference would be to just say things act like they\u0027re in atmosphere if they\u0027re in atmosphere, regardless of trajectory. It\u0027s what a player would expect. If for gameplay reasons you want to put some sort of limitation (e.g. \u0022this instrument only works at speeds under X\u0022, then say that in the part description and give a \u0022speed is too high\u0022 error message when someone tries it."}]}
