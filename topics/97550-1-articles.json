If that is so, do you think life - even if extremophile life - could exist there? And what of that life somehow got to the surface, was struck by a meteorite and, via panspermia, seeded Kerbin a long time ago?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy theory is that both the mun and minmus used to be a lot closer to Kerbin. Because of that, tidal forces warmed minmus\u0027s interior a lot more, while the Mun was volcanic like crazy. Back then, extremeophile life existed below Minmus\u0027s surface, in a gigantic underground ocean. But then geysers erupted and expelled microbes all over the Kerbol system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbin was seeded.
