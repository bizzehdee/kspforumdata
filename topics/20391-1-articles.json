A small car like this is very stable and fast, long as you dont turn at high speed, that is. Building larger carts has some stability issues, but I think I can fix those in the CFG file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo why the thread? Well, I wanted some suggestions. I\u0027m going to keep using these horrible primitives for now, with a slap on texture till I work out how to texture properly or anyone tells me how to do it, But basically I\u0027m asking what people may be looking for. So in the future, I\u0027ll get some nicer shapes, textures, etc, and make something people would want to use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the very first thing I\u0027ve ever tried to make as a mod or in blender, so I\u0027m absolutely new to this so far. But I\u0027m quick at picking things up, so I\u0027m hoping to have a useable release by next week.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MinerEdgar","CreatedById":21247,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-26T03:12:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethats cool\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tommygun","CreatedById":41293,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-26T08:16:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is one thing that has been missing and that has been tank like treads.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it is because, at least I suspect, is that the cart system doesn\u0027t support tread like steering.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps these types of treads could be done with the cart plug in?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERolligon tires where also once considered for a Moon type rover.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGrumman Dual Mode Rover is an interesting idea as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore ideas here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.unusuallocomotion.com/album/wheeled-robots/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.unusuallocomotion.com/album/wheeled-robots/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chev","CreatedById":34254,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-26T12:04:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EShape-wise, I\u0027d suggest funky space probe wheels like \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/08/08/mars_probe_cpu/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ECuriosity\u0027s\u003C/a\u003E.
