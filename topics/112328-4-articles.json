(yes i love spaceplanes ) but 1.5 will be cool (fiting into Mk2 Cargobay)\n\nWork is almost complete on a hitchhiker sized 3-kerbal in-line freezer. Followed closely by a single kerbal in-line 1.5M and probably? single kerbal 1.5M? surface attachable module.\n\nAlso waiting to hear back from Endurance mod guys about collaborating on a Endurance styled freezer.\n\n..and the big news, I\u0027ve just finished code testing changes to implement animated Cryopods, yes they will open and close.\n\nJust putting finishing touches on the models/textures and animations.
