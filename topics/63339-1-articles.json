I\u0027ve just started to use kethane, and don\u0027t know much about where it will flow to.

This will double as the habitation segment. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWill this kethane be able to be stored in one segment, and then converted to fuel in another, to the be stored as fuel in a third? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf not, would fuel lines from KAS be able to fix this? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPictures:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo could the Kethane from this\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Frhj6rA.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Frhj6rA.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBe converted here\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/uVK11tD.png\u0022 alt=\u0022uVK11tD.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then be stored here?\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bQA8enJ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022bQA8enJ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENotice the docking ports on both ends for the first two if i need to reearange. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd also, for the base, with KAS, could i pump mined kethane to a converter, to a connected fuel cell, from separate but connected modules?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks alot in advance, i just want to make sure this will work before i get to Duna:confused:\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-16T04:10:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would put a small grey tank on each segment that has a converter (And maybe a small RCS tank or two if you plan on doing that as well) this way, no matter how your station is configured, you will always be able to refuel everything (Via fuel transfers, I suggest getting \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/25823-0-23-TAC-Fuel-Balancer-v2-3-22Dec\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ETAC Fuel Balancer\u003C/a\u003E if you don\u0027t already have it)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr.Rocket","CreatedById":80241,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-16T04:17:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOkay, thanks.
