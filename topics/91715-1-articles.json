It matters as I\u0027m using KCT and Fine Print and the recovery of funds makes for great motivation for all those satellite missions. I had just unlocked the thermal turbojet parts in KSPI and tried, initially, to create an SSTO with those on it. Well, the first-tier fission engines suck, so that was a no go. After going through a range of combinations from the advanced jet engine, including the B9 jet engine D-30F7, I settled on a design with 4 D-30F7s and 2 KW rocketry engines. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was testing all the permutations with the \u0022simulation\u0022 feature in KCT so I could figure out what was going on. Turns out, I needed WAY more rocket help than I initially wanted to include. Also, it seems to be a new feature but the jet engines start losing power at a certain speed. The B9 engines I picked have the highest top speed even though they spin up real slow. The top speed \u002B lots of intakes and precoolers meant I could hang out at M=3.8 at 24km up before switching to the rocket engines. I gotta say, getting the thing to be stable on the way up and the way down with FAR\u002BDREC makes for some challenging gameplay and a very satisfying feeling when it all works in the end.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, the payload for the first few missions is a KSO communications satellite for RT2 so I can send probes out beyond Kerbin SOI (see above).\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"}]}
