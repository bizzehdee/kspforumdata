I want to reverse my orbit to make a landing on Ike before returning to Kerbal. I have about 5k delta-V. Is this possible? What is the most efficient way to do this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELonger version:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI decided to RP and do a \u0022realistic\u0022 mission to Duna. I built a large crew ship and a separate lander \u002B transport vessel - Apollo style. While I was waiting for the transfer window, I build 2 lander probes and sent them on a fast burn to scout a nice area on Duna and Ike. The Kraken ate one but I found some nice undulating hills on Duna with the other. I decided to up my game and launch a rover with sky crane (except mine ends up on the ground, so it\u0027s a ground crane - or just crane) to accompany my 2 planned big ships to Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI launched my 3 ship flotilla out of Kerbal SOI and felt very pleased with myself as they arrived in the appropriate order and I even did some nice aerobraking. That\u0027s when I started having some problems. I realized that it is much harder to place a heavy lander (my rover-crane) on a target when there is an atmosphere. Fine. Jeb can walk. Then transferred Jeb and Bob into the lander can and realized I needed a lot of fuel to slow them down enough to survive landing on Duna (far, far away from their Rover and my lander). They planted the flag, got up into LDO with just enough fuel and monoprop to execute some docking, crew/science transfers, and fuel balancing. Rover aside, mission objectives still look good. Then I started to plan a transfer to Ike orbit. Only to realize \u003Cstrong\u003EI was rotating in the opposite direction of Ike. I\u0027d areobreaked in the wrong direction.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried ditching my transfer craft and docking the lander to the crew ship and burning straight normal to my Duna orbit, hoping to flip over, but this is turning out to be a mess, especially since my crew ship is unbalance with the lander on it. Maybe I need a super elliptical orbit and then burn retrograde when my speed is the lowest?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny ideas on how to best reverse orbit with ~5k of Delta-V, a need to land on Ike and of course return safely to Kerbal?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd no, I don\u0027t have a save to go back to pre-aerobraking.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-25T17:03:30Z\u0022 title=\u002206/25/2014 05:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 25, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Zorgoth1\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FenrirWolf","CreatedById":72121,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-24T21:34:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E5k delta-v gives you room to do pretty much whatever you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d just transfer directly to Ike like normal.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-24T21:49:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s very possible to plan a maneuver node that transfers you to Ike such that your orbit when you get there goes the other way.

So, if you\u0027re looking to save dV on reversing your orbital direction, I\u0027d recommend that you push your Ap as high as you can/want/feel like, then burn retrograde until it\u0027s uh, prograde.
