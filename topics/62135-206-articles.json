What I did is remove all but the super 25 files and then resized the super 25\u0027s booster textures to 512 x 512 and saved it as 24 bit. I reduced the super 25\u0027s textures to 1024 x 1024 and saved it as 32 bit. Did the same for the normal maps and the IVA textures and normal maps. Then I removed the kso config in Active Texture Maps to let it compress textures even further as needed. That worked, and I am able to use the super 25. Leaving the textures alone and just removing the ATM config wasn\u0027t enough to work in my case.

Open up the craft files for the vehicles and note the orientation of the mark on the hub. For the truck tires the arrow should be pointing down. If I remember correctly, the sedan hubs had a red mark, however I forget which way they should be pointed. The rover hubs are currently bugged in v409 and have to point up to function properly (they point down in v408). I might post some screenshots when I get home from work for convenience since this gets asked a lot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Screenshots, just also found out the bug with the rover wheels seems to be because they flip once launched. Weird. Both shots are of the same vehicle both in the SPH and launched using version 4.09. So to recap: sedan wheels have a white rectangle that needs to point down. The truck wheels have a red triangle that needs to point down. The rover wheels have a white arrow that needs to point down, but place them pointing up because they flip for some silly reason when launched. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/por5b\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

They still have the FSwheel bug that might change the motor direction on launch, but at least the arrows point the right direction in the ship editor and it\u0027ll turn the correct direction on launch. Also noticed v408 does the flip bug as well (so they are really pointing up on launch in v408 even though they get attached pointing down). Not sure if helldiver wants to revert them back to v408 or not, though.

Snjo confirmed it as an old firespitter bug with the FSwheel module. Last I heard from snjo he hasn\u0027t had a chance to get to it. However, it can be worked around by just manually reversing back any motors that get reversed. It\u0027s just highly annoying to me, I guess. I posted a craft file in that thread as well that reliably reproduces the firespitter bug. It\u0027s not about reversed rover motors attached to a lander. It\u0027s about a rover launched on a lander resulting in some or all motors starting off reversed even though you didn\u0027t set them to reversed. The craft I posted launches with the wheels on one side reversed. As you can imagine, it doesn\u0027t drive well like that and would lead to confusion to the uninformed, especially when the context menu doesn\u0027t accurately report the correct state of whether it\u0027s reversed.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-13T02:19:14Z\u0022 title=\u002209/13/2014 02:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 13, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by qnistNAMEERF\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
