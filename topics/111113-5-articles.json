We are tuned to be empathetic creatures because it helps us socially, allows us to look out for each other etc etc which benefits the survival of the genome. With direct survival no longer being a factor that feeling of care now extends to other species which we find to be particularly interesting or cute (note that it is the cute animals that receive the majority of public donations) - it is an unintended consequence of the powerful survival instinct.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow you are the one claiming to know what ETs\u0027 motives are and are projecting ours onto them.

One spot of bright light on the sky caught my attention. At first I wondered if it was Venus until I remembered Venus would be lower towards the horizon. I wondered if it was another planet, but couldn\u0027t think of any that would fit the bill. The light was stationary. I couldn\u0027t figure out what it could be. I stopped and watched it for about 5 minutes wondering. Now, I live in a town where airliners fly over us every day and night on their way to the airports in the area. With their nav lights they\u0027re a familiar sight but I never saw a plane that didn\u0027t move before. This light wasn\u0027t moving at all, as far as I could tell, nor was it a planet, or a star.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell.... if I had gotten back on my bike, I wouldn\u0027t have known what this was and it was, by definition, a UFO. However, I did wait a few more moments and lo and behold, soon I could vaguely spot a tiny green light on one side and a red light on the other. The bright light had also grown in intensity but so slowly I hadn\u0027t noticed. Soon the bright light broke into 2 bright spots close together and it became clear this was another airliner. It just came in from a direction I hadn\u0027t seen they come in from before but soon after the airliner flew overhead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUp until I knew, this was a genuine UFO sighting.

On an evening over a hill we could first see one and later up to three glowing red lights. They looked somehow transparent (you could guess the clouds behind) and made erratic movements over a pretty bis area of the sky. The biggest light was about half the size of a full moon (as far as I remember). We could watch the spectacle for about 5 to 10 minutes and had at this time no idea what this could have been.
