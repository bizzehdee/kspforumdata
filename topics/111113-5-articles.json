Well, actually we can\u0027t, but if we would, you would not believe us! Why won\u0027t you believe us!*\n\u003E Call me optimistic, but I am certain that a single piece of good, solid evidence would sway a huge amount of scientists. There will naturally be a certain amount of scepticism to overcome, but that is only healthy. As has been stated, extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.\n\nEven though I agree, I have to chime in and say *he isn\u0027t wrong*.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The Loch Ness monster is known to not exist: full sonar sweeps have been done of the lake, multiple times, there\u0027s nothing in there. Regardless of that, there are plenty of blurry photos and eyewitness accounts, with more coming out every year. So here\u0027s something to start with; produce evidence more substantive than that for Nessie.\n\nIt\u0027s like saying \u0022there\u0027s a giant snake in my backyard but no known snakes like that are believed to have habitat here\u0022 before it was discovered that the large snakes originated from pets that were discarded, which started a colony."},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T23:18:43Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E What is proof, exactly?

Curiosity, as well. For a civilization that has achieved beyond the point of only surviving, why is it far fetched to believe that they would be doing things like we are? Nature preserves, studies on species and their development, etc.\n\nInvestigations into ETs have produced no scientifically valid evidence. \n\nI would argue that nature preserves etc are an extension of our survival instinct. We are curious because it is, or was, an advantage to our survival to be so. Obviously direct survival is rarely a key player in modern life, so that survival instinct gets diverted elsewhere. In fact that would be what I would call an empathetic survival instinct. We are tuned to be empathetic creatures because it helps us socially, allows us to look out for each other etc etc which benefits the survival of the genome. With direct survival no longer being a factor that feeling of care now extends to other species which we find to be particularly interesting or cute (note that it is the cute animals that receive the majority of public donations) - it is an unintended consequence of the powerful survival instinct.\n\nNow you are the one claiming to know what ETs\u0027 motives are and are projecting ours onto them. I say we can guess what their motivations might be. But I don\u0027t see how hovering over some people and drawing crop circles could be logical unless their aim is just to be spoooooky."},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T23:25:30Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E But still, what kind of substantiation?\n\n Do you have anything that\u0027s not eyewitness accounts or blurry photos?

I actually had something a little like that once. It was fairly late in the afternoon, and i\u0027m looking out my bedroom window (after watering the plants on it). I\u0027m looking around, and then I spot something weird. Up in the sky (about 50 degrees up) is a small black shape, pretty far away. It\u0027s moving very slowly to the left, and the shape appears to keep fluctuating very slightly, honestly looking like it was spinning a little. At first I thought it was just a helicopter but it\u0027s moving way slower than it should have been, and while it\u0027s impossible to work out exactly what i\u0027m looking at, it doesn\u0027t look anything like a helicopter. As a BTW, i\u0027m in England on the south coast so unlikely it\u0027s a freak rocket launch.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-30T08:14:58Z\u0022 title=\u002205/30/2015 08:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by randomness5555**"},{"CreatedByName":"LN400","CreatedById":140595,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T08:43:59Z","Content":"Just a very silly anecdote: A few weeks back, I was on my way home from college, riding my bicycle so I had a pretty good view of the evening sky. One spot of bright light on the sky caught my attention. At first I wondered if it was Venus until I remembered Venus would be lower towards the horizon. I wondered if it was another planet, but couldn\u0027t think of any that would fit the bill. The light was stationary. I couldn\u0027t figure out what it could be. I stopped and watched it for about 5 minutes wondering. Now, I live in a town where airliners fly over us every day and night on their way to the airports in the area. With their nav lights they\u0027re a familiar sight but I never saw a plane that didn\u0027t move before. This light wasn\u0027t moving at all, as far as I could tell, nor was it a planet, or a star.\n\nWell.... if I had gotten back on my bike, I wouldn\u0027t have known what this was and it was, by definition, a UFO. However, I did wait a few more moments and lo and behold, soon I could vaguely spot a tiny green light on one side and a red light on the other. The bright light had also grown in intensity but so slowly I hadn\u0027t noticed. Soon the bright light broke into 2 bright spots close together and it became clear this was another airliner. It just came in from a direction I hadn\u0027t seen they come in from before but soon after the airliner flew overhead.\n\nUp until I knew, this was a genuine UFO sighting. When I did know, it turned into an IFO, I got back on my bike and got myself home and forgot about it until just now when I wrote this post. Interesting while the wondering lasted, not really interesting when the wondering ended."},{"CreatedByName":"Heimdall5008","CreatedById":114990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T18:52:28Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E So, shouldn\u0027t we DISCUSS THESE INSTEAD :\n\u003E 1.

Try figure out what it is.\n\nOkay, I can deliver both [![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)]\n\nWay back, about 20 years I would think, I also saw an UFO together with my parents. On an evening over a hill we could first see one and later up to three glowing red lights. They looked somehow transparent (you could guess the clouds behind) and made erratic movements over a pretty bis area of the sky. The biggest light was about half the size of a full moon (as far as I remember). We could watch the spectacle for about 5 to 10 minutes and had at this time no idea what this could have been. After discussion some other people we knew not only we had seen it.\n\nTwo days later we could read the explanation in the newspaper (it seems a few dozen people had called the police) what the lights were. At the evening of the sighting a theater was opened about 20 km away. During the opening ceremony they showed an outdoor laser show (the first time I ever heard of such a thing). Due to really low clouds this evening some of the laser spots could be seen many kilometers away.\n\nThis was my first contact with a UFO. After this I started to read a whole lot of books about them [![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)].\n\nSince then I could watch some other strange things in the sky, but I could always iditify them:\n\n- reentry of the upper stage of a Russian rocket (this was really cool)\n- some bolides\n- a Black Hawk helicopter during dusk without lights (we have an US air base some kilometers away)\n- Lenticular clouds (they can really look like \u0022hard\u0022 objects, if you do not know them)\n\nSo for now no other UFO.
