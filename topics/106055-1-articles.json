Each explore contract has 5 instances of \u0022body = x\u0022, where x is the id of the celestial body. If you use the debug console to generate a DUPLICATE Explore X contract (like say, a second Explore Duna contract), then you will see TWO contract entries with the SAME \u0022body = x\u0022 number.
