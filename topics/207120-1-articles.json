I\u0027m a returning player from ~2015, never really got involved in the forums before beyond a bit of lurking and reading about mods. I\u0027ve dropped in here and there and I\u0027ve never uninstalled the game, I just, I guess, started playing less when life got in the way of shooting rockets around space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI see from my quick look of the game just now that \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EA LOT\u00A0\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003Ehas changed in terms of what you get in stock \u002B expansions.

I will definitely be checking out what\u0027s up with the most recent iterations of life support mods, but Kerbalism just seems a little bit too much like hard work right now - I could probably do without performing ullage burns...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m an astrophysics researcher in my dayjob so I\u0027m quite happy crunching all sorts of numbers and optimisation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know the answers to all these questions are probably on the forum already, but I did a quick search and couldn\u0027t find anything recent and obvious.
