Since KSP planes can have many parts, it would be almost impossible to do, as there is to much configurations for one plane. And computing things as the situation changes is out of the questions on PC\u0027s for probably maaany more years.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Most KSP part\u0027s and general rocket shape resulting from them is quite suboptimal (simplified shapes, lack of many transition parts etc).

Without preset properties for each part they wouldn\u0027t work as good wings at all, and then if they had one, interaction with other parts like more wings around or other parts placed on wing would be almost impossible to predict and include in the parametrers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is why only simplified modes will work, and Ferram has made excelent work creating one.

In the end we ended up with one wing as the most best option.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis means we need new base properties model for each plane configuration. Modern simulators have limited module count that allow every part to be computed for limited set of flight states it can get itself into. In KSP we can have 200 wing plane hit the launch tower and disassemble almost randomly, only the simplest flight models can compute flight properties on the fly for each separated element.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...argh didn\u0027t see Eric answering that one \u0026gt;_\u0026lt; , aw whatever posting my answer as well away ~weee\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Eric S","CreatedById":57117,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-22T23:21:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nao\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Nao\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...argh didn\u0027t see Eric answering that one \u0026gt;_\u0026lt; , aw whatever posting my answer as well away ~weee\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, but I liked your answer better, the real world implications of multiple wings is fascinating stuff.

Your description goes directly against Bernoulli\u0027s principle, or you are also describing it incorrectly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe air going over the top of the wing (standard shape) has to move faster than the bottom, which causes lower pressure on the top, and the higher pressure air underneath pushes the wing up. It has nothing to do with air being pushed down. This is why you can stall an aircraft from too steep of an angle of attack, because the air flow \u0022breaks\u0022 and you get a dead zone which breaks up the effect. Flaps (back of wing) and Slats (front of wing) will affect the shape of the wing to alter for changes in airspeed and the desire for more/less lift, but the principle remains the same.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-24T04:26:11Z\u0022 title=\u002212/24/2013 04:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 24, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Leatherneck\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"allmhuran","CreatedById":66124,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-24T04:15:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor the \u0022classic\u0022 airfoil shape both principles are in effect.
