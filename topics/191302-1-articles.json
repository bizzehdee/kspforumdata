Instead, I\u0027d like to \u003Cstrong\u003Eselect an option in a pop-up window\u00A0using a keystroke\u003C/strong\u003E. A simple example is the messages at the start of a fresh career mode telling you about each building the first time you use it. I would like the \u0022Enter\u0022 key to select the \u0022Okay\u0022 option and close the pop-up. This could be extended to the window that opens after collecting science. \u0022Enter\u0022 could select\u00A0\u0022Keep Experiment\u0022, \u0022Delete\u0022 could select \u0022Reset Experiment\u0022, and something else could be \u0022Transmit Experiment\u0022. This is nitpicky, but I think it would be worth adding. \u003Cstrong\u003EAn alternative could be using the arrow keys and Enter to navigate the options\u003C/strong\u003E. This might help with long menus like when right-clicking a command pod. It might be a problem\u00A0that multiple windows can currently be active at once. I feel this change would be minor, but I think players notice that this is not a feature.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Corax","CreatedById":11311,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-13T11:12:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNeeds more upvotes \u003Cspan\u003E: )\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
