Completed \u0022Crew a Space Station with 7 Kerbals for 1 Year\u0022 by warping through it. Upon completion, I couldn\u0027t exit to the Space Center, and had to force-quit. It saved it at that point though, and now I can\u0027t enter the Tracking Station, or the Vehicle Assembly Building, and I can\u0027t launch a new flight. If I enter the Contract or Science buildings I get stuck and have to reload. If I enter the Astronaut complex, I\u0027m able to exit, but then I can\u0027t click on any other buildings and the quit button in the bottom right is faded out. I\u0027m trying to get a log, but I think I need to at least get to a vessel somewhere.

I installed the latest update and once I started playing my memory leaked away like a waterfall. I couldn\u0027t even keep the game stable long enough to land a single craft from orbit. No logs, no errors that I could find other than the standard crash from memory. I had installed 2 other updates along with yours - Action Groups Extended and Ship Manifest - I pulled each off in order to test since I had no log files to point me anywhere. Long story short, once I reverted back to 0.7.10 the memory leak immediately stopped. I wish I had more for you to go on but thought I\u0027d mention it just so you\u0027d know it might be a problem.

I did get one exception error when I went in with my contract packs enabled the first time (Initial, Station, Tourism) and I\u0027ve pasted the body of the error message below in case you need it. I also noted there were several contracts I accepted that never showed up for me to complete after accepting them. Specifically, part tests were allowing me to accept the contract, gave me the advance money and unlocked the experimental part but the contract was never in my list to complete.
