Which is a bonus that lends itself toward safe landings for heavy SSTOs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course you will have to make something up or else deal with radiation exhaust... since with it landings won\u0027t be safe.

They have roughly just enough energy to deorbit, land, and reach orbit.... once.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeanwhile you stash the rest of your compact powerbanks in an orbiting small shuttlecraft, which waits for the mothership to rendezvous with it in orbit later.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis thus solves the problem of trying to land a spaceship with doomsday energy levels... since you are stashing all of that in low planet orbit in a small shuttle instead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo shuttlecraft are essential to spaceships with high energy compact powerbanks... since they are the perfect place to stash the explosive powerbanks when you want to land the mothership without the potential of wiping out a country.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInstead of that at worst if your ship blows up it will be like a Tsar bomb or close.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhich while still dangerous is a lot better than wiping out a whole country.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-03-19T05:53:51Z\u0022 title=\u002203/19/2023 05:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 19, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Spacescifi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JadeOfMaar","CreatedById":167617,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-19T07:01:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224262044\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022215489\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221679205141\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022197504\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Spacescifi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n42 minutes ago, Spacescifi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis thus solves the problem of trying to land a spaceship with doomsday energy levels... since you are stashing all of that in low planet orbit in a small shuttle instead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nActually, no.

If you can pack the energy (moreover, into a tiny volume) to land any capable sci-fi ship, you are already carrying doomsday levels of energy.

Carrying around or riding in something that will cause mass destruction if it breaks in the right way is a very normal issue for sci-fi things. The threat thereof, generally only happens if you have people who can and deliberately want to cause that kind of destruction.

You have to convert a significant portion of the rest mass into energy. These things cannot be made safe. Nor compact. They have to have the mass to expend into the energy you are trying to harness.

Lets say, the atmosphere absorbs most of that. There are about 10T of air above every square meter of the surface. It takes about 700J to heat up 1kg of air by 1K. So we\u0027re looking at an atmospheric temperature of well over 10,000K. That\u0027s hotter than the photosphere of the Sun and would give the entire atmosphere an average kinetic energy of the gas well above the escape velocity. That means, first, the surface would receive a massive burn from direct contact with a star twice as hot as our Sun, followed pretty much immediately by half of the atmosphere of the planet heading off for interplanetary space.

The thing that makes this so much easier to work with is that if you work with optimal light drive torch ship, a = 1ly/yr\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E, c = 1ly/yr, and v\u003Csub\u003Ee\u003C/sub\u003E/c = 1. So as long as you do x in light years, every other variable is 1 except for ln(m/m\u003Csub\u003E0\u003C/sub\u003E) which is the thing you need to compute.

Because people probably aren\u0027t that familiar with hyperbolic trig functions, while you do want to pull out a calculator (or do a couple of series terms if you know \u0027em) for low factors, cosh(ln(z)) tends to 1 \u002B z/2 for large z.

On the net, it\u0027s safer, and an accidental failure is likely to release most of the energy in a pair of beams. But that would make intentional release more deadly, potentially, as you can direct the peak output at the planet. So there\u0027s a pretty wide range here. But the ballpark should still be like what we expect from a matter-antimatter explosion, which I can give estimates for.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe output will be a gamma burst with a peak somewhere in tens to hundreds of MeV. Dental X-Ray is under 100keV. Nuclear blast mostly peaks in a similar range, with some radiation into low MeV ranges. So we\u0027re talking harsh gamma radiation. Now, lets look at the intensity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst, we need to know how big our ship is. Say we want to carry a crew of about 100. Now, I have no idea what the standards are going to be like for interstellar travel, but I think applying metrics for cruise ships should give us a ballpark. Typical occupancy factor is about 30kT per passenger, giving us a 3MT payload. Lets load it for a one way 10ly journey. Note that a 1g torch gives us a factor of a * 1ly / c of almost exactly 1. That means the half-way Lorentz boost factor is 1 \u002B 1ly/yr\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E\u00A0* 5ly / c\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E\u00A0= 6. (Oh, yeah, torch ships be scraping that interstellar space. We\u0027re not even talking about how to mitigate that here.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe relevant rocket equation for a light drive torch is v/c = tanh(ln m/m\u003Csub\u003E0\u003C/sub\u003E). And, of course, tanh\u003Csup\u003E-1\u003C/sup\u003E(v/c) = coth\u003Csup\u003E-1\u003C/sup\u003E(gamma). Or in other words, ln(m/m\u003Csub\u003E0\u003C/sub\u003E) = cosh\u003Csup\u003E-1\u003C/sup\u003E(gamma)\u003Csup\u003E*\u003C/sup\u003E\u00A0This gives us m/m\u003Csub\u003E0\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0for our hypothetical starship of about 12. Of course, then we have to slow down, so we have to square this for a total of 144.
