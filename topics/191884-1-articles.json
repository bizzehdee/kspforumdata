Currently, I have a single communications satellite orbiting at a distance of roughly ten million meters, with an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E-\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E difference of approximately fifty thousand meters. I plan to get four (or more) satellites into the same orbit, but said satellites \u003Ci\u003Emust\u003C/i\u003E\u00A0be positioned at certain angular intervals throughout said orbit.\u00A0I believe I can safely assume that, were I to set the original probe as a target and set up an insertion trajectory that would place a second probe at a point in the orbit\u00A090 degrees away from the former, I would not be able to rely on an \u0022encounter\u0022 distance marker; not only is the encounter marker solely used for\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eintercepting\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0spacecraft, but the distance between the two \u0022encounters\u0022 will be far too great and said marker would not appear.\u00A0How would an experienced player go about this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecondly, I ask a simple question related to a mod. Currently, mechjeb is incompatible with principia. Since physically controlling a spacecraft is not exactly realistic, I ask whether there is a mod that implements a principia-compatible autopilot. I also ask if mechjeb can somehow be altered into compatibility.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat being said, I have considered learning kOS, but for some reason this non-object-oriented amalgamation of Java and some other mysterious language has never caught on to me (though I do admit that it may be the best option).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you for your help and understanding,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMatuchkin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Draalo","CreatedById":158993,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-02-23T22:17:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGo to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E and try having a manouver for rendevouz encounter.
