I do know that some of these ideas may have already been implemented, so if you see me writing about an idea that someone else has already put into practice please tell me so I can go ahead and cross it off the list. Beyond that I\u0027m just looking for feedback on which (if any) of these is interesting and should be looked at further and additional suggestions on how any of these ideas (or just some of your own if you like). Some of the ideas I can implement, others are a bit beyond my ken. They are not in any particular order, I just happened to write them down here and there and then compiled them all together. Anywhoo, on to the list...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPlayer Created Ground Stations: \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E My first time playing RO I didn\u0027t have the remotetech transmission sites updated, so in order to launch unmanned craft I first had to built a base control station. It was an oversized ground vehicle with six kerbals on board along with the necessary antennas to communicate with the craft. I drove it about 5 km away from the launch complex but still with line of sight to the pad. This kept the vessel outside of the loading range from whatever active rocket the player is trying to launch (assuming the player still has the stock loading distances in place). This could be parlayed into another aspect of the game where not only are you setting up satellite constellations, but you are also responsible for setting up your initial ground control stations both local (at the cosmodrome) and remote (think Alice Springs, Australia during Mercury). This is achievable easily via reducing the number of static ground stations and/or severely limiting their transmission distance and providing enough parts early in the game for the player to make their ground stations. See the RemoteTech Additions section for relevant information concerning non-Line-of-Sight radios.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMood and Sanity:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E A psych or \u0022sanity\u0022 state for the kerbals as part of the life support system. Sanity being affected by things such as living conditions, enviroment, overall duration in a given enviroment type (no \u0022change in scenery\u0022). Factors:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cem\u003EMood \u003C/em\u003E- As a sanity affecting factor mood is weighted more heavily, happy people don\u0027t come unhinged as fast as unhappy people. Mood in general is an amalgam of the following factors, however other special events can have an immediate and overriding impact on the Kerbal in question. For instance they might be as happy as can be under STP, but for the 5 minutes they spend hurtling through the atmosphere on re-entry they could still have a rather significant emotional event.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-- Interaction - Social critters need to social. If there are no other critters nearby to make pleasing noises with then the next best thing is calling up other critters on a communication device and making pleasing noises by remote transmission. Basically don\u0027t leave your Kerbal alone and out of radio contact for very long, you never know what kind of mischief they might get up to. Very short clock on this one. Radio communication ameliorates isolation but is an imperfect solution and only decreases the penalty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-- Habitat Volume - How was your last airline flight? Much elbow or leg room? Want to stay in that seat for the duration of a 2 week mission? Well that was about the sum of things for the Gemini pilots. For very long duration missions you\u0027ll probably want more than a phone booth\u0027s worth of living space per \u0027naut. This factor is largely static and is directly based on the available crew volume in a vessel divided by crew members, perhaps done non-linearly. Two \u0027nauts might have to share the extra space, but at least it\u0027s still extra space so it isn\u0027t just a straight division.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-- Diet - Luxury or specialty food items selected by astronauts on the ISS are used to break up the monotany of the available food stuffs on board. I imagine a Kerbal equivalent would be a \u0022Mint Dessert\u0022 to break up the constant snackage. MD are prepackaged in single serving units and the Kerbonauts would be \u0022instructed\u0022 by ground control to \u0022open science mission package 327b and execute contained instructions...\u0022 which naturally would be \u0022Eat me.\u0022 \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E with an appropriate number of MD cakes (cake (mint dessert type), one (1x) per) would be consumed giving the \u0027nauts an appropriate boost to mood and will also reset a \u0022snack clock\u0022. At first the diet will have a net positive affect on sanity, however after a period of time (as the snack clock climbs) it will decrease, flatten out for a while, and then begin negatively impacting the sanity. As mentioned this can be reset with the application of suitable luxury food items.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-- Gravity - Major mood killer if you can\u0027t get out of your rack because Eve\u0027s gravity has you pinned to the matress like a cat to a car window. Low/no gravity can be initially very fun and a mood boost, but will gradually slide to slightly negative in zero-G as the physiological effects begin to take their toll. A centrifuge habitat can be used to raise it up to just a neutral effect. Heavy gravity is immediately fatiguing and so is an immediate and constant negative effect to mood.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-- Duration - How long has the \u0027naut been away from home, and also how long have they been in a given biome? Overall duration starts neutral and then eventually evolves to negative both in mood and in a slow but cummulatively relevant direct affect on sanity. The closer the local environment is to home, the slower this clock runs. Time in a given biome starts out with a positive boost to mood, and a slightly positive direct affect on sanity and then progresses to neutral and flattens there as the local scenery becomes common.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-- Distractions - Food for the eyes and mind. New movies, messages, pictures. Anything novel and interesting that can be digitized and delivered at 2.4GKz. Behavior similar to the desserts for diet but gives a slightly longer (but less intense) mood boost and also a direct positive sanity increase if the distraction is emotionally significant for the \u0027naut (letters from family, etc.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-- The practical effects of mood and sanity states could be displayed in a cross-grid, and possibly include spontaneous transmissions, varying levels of command compliance, positive/negative effect on craft and systems, et alii.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIntegration of Craft Parts Into Avionics Mods:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E In short limiting the information available to the player via MechJeb (or others) while in flight based on the available onboard (or offboard) hardware. As an example, MechJeb not being able to display the local temperatures without an on-board thermometer. Perhaps certain higher order maneuver planning is unable to be performed with the on board craft hardware and instead you need a radio link back to mission control where the ground based super computers can chew on the problem for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Other aspects would include integrating other mods together, such as the KerbalGPS system with RemoteTech and Mechjeb. Early hardware may prove insufficient for accurately plotting the ship\u0027s trajectory out beyond a certain distance and so instead of a nice orbital line being displayed the player instead sees an ever expanding cone from their current position to the point where the plot just ends because it has become excessively inaccurate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAblation Resource for Engines and Regenerative Cooling Failure:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInspired the cooling selection mod but primarily for those using RO or similar engine mods that already make large distinctions between fuel types and engine hardware. Add the ablation resource to ablatively cooled engines in much the same manner as for command pods thus giving them a very much finite run life. This could be the single major limiting factor in the reused of hypergol engines that are otherwise not restart-limited.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other side for regeneratively cooled engines, perhaps some catastrophic failure (due to rapid and extreme overheating, so technically the failure bit is already in game, we just need a way to activate it in particular situations) if the engines are run to propellant exhaustion and thus are deprived of coolant flow through the engine prior to flame out. So the player would either need to balance the tankage to be a little coolant heavy (so the engine flames out before losing coolant flow, assuming only one of the bi/tripropellants is used in cooling, not an available strategy for monopropellant engines like NTR\u0027s) or shut down and/or stage before total propellant/coolant exhaustion (probably the better idea).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAdditions for SmartStage Mod:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditional triggering parameters such as G-load, unifying the different parts into a single part with menu selectable triggering parameters (and attendant texture change to match), and perhaps allowing remote placement such as putting a tank resource Smartpart in the interstage IU and then just telling it which tank to monitor. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAdditions for RealismOverhaul Mod:\u003C/strong\u003E \u003Cem\u003EIf the improvement is specific to another mod RO alters that mod is listed in italics and underscored.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-- Being able to switch from the day 0 Julian-style calendar currently in game to the more familiar and thus intuitive Gregorian Calendar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-- Control Moment Gyroscopes of various gimballing function as a later upgrade from the basic (and extremely low torque) Reaction Wheels. In practical application this means just making a heavier reaction wheel module part with stronger torque.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-- A change to the saturation of reaction wheels, instead of having a torque consumable resource that slowly regenerates they could display the current reaction wheel speed and also its maximum and minimum speeds. As the reaction wheel does work it will be gradually speeding up or slowing down the wheel as needed and once it reaches the limit of its speed range it is no longer able to provide torque in that direction. At that point the player can execute a desaturation burn using the onboard RCS engines and thus \u0022reset\u0022 all the momentum wheels back to their starting speeds. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESingle reaction wheel/single gimbal CMG\u0027s to start with. Low mass, placeable as the player desires, and only able to affect a single axis of rotation (based on their mounted orientation). Combo units to follow after unlocking higher tech nodes. Single gimbal CMG\u0027s provide better torque, but you\u0027ll need more of them combared to a multi-gimbal CMG.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-- Flow limits on propellant lines. If you\u0027re feeding a big engine from another tank via a fuel line it would need to be sized up (and thus also it\u0027s mass) as appropriate to permit the volume necessary to run the engine. The size of the fuel line/utility tunnel would also affect the rate of resource transfer from one area of the ship to another if it is channeled through such a bottle neck. Flow rate from balloon tanks limited by the rate of tank pressurization (can\u0027t let the structure collapse because we\u0027re sucking the propellant out of it faster than the pressurization system can manage, this could induce players to choosing heavier tank types if they\u0027re feeding big engines or using tankage in a mass/volume restricted application.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-- Treating electrical charge like any other resource and requiring the appropriate resource connections to channel it around resource break points (decouplers) and the like.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-- \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003ETAC Life Support\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E - Resource consumption rate documentation so space craft can be appropriately designed for specific missions and duration (I\u0027m looking at doing an RO config for Universal Storage and will likely be looking up this particular information on my own and can probably just release whatever notes I write down for that purpose.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-- \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003ETAC LS\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E - Cabin CO2 needs to changed so it\u0027s displayed as a percentage of the cabin atmosphere, and not an alterable resource (you can\u0027t magically reallocate the CO2 out of the air in the cabin without either a chemical scrubber or atmospheric fractioning equipment, which would be heavy). CO2 needs to be constantly and immediately scrubbed so the CO2 absorbers need to be planned to last the entire mission. Any build up in the crew cabin would be detrimental to their health. CO2 gauge should be from 0.00% to 1.50% (or whatever is considered lethal). Kerbal suits should have their own built in systems and crew should be able to get into their suits if the spaceship life support isn\u0027t working (this idea is repeated below as it would be appropriate in a non-RO game as well). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003E-- \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003ETAC LS\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E - \u0022Life support\u0022 electricity should be broken down into detail so that select technology upgrades can be implemented and cause the astronauts to use less through more efficient lighting/heating/cooling. Crew capsules should also be temperature controlled, which would require greater amounts of electricity if the craft isn\u0027t setup to handle its own waste heat efficiently (radiators, etc., more energy used if you have to use a lot of heat pumps to move the waste heat somewhere else to be radiated, so on) \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF0000;\u0022\u003EApparently already does this.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-- \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003ETAC Fuel Balancer\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E - Should not be able to randomly dump certain resources (such as solid waste). Also needed are persistent settings per craft resource so that the tankage and such can be set up to operate in a specific manner (such as drawing RCS fuel from earlier stages so you don\u0027t inadvertently drain the tanks for your reentry control earlier in the mission) and the ability set them while still in the VAB/SPH. This second aspect would be beneficial for TAC FB in general, and not just in RO, and is repeated farther down for that reason.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-- Landing hazards presented by residual toxic resources on board, ergo, the necessity of dumping your remaining RCS propellants and what not before touching down on the ground. Failure to do so would render the craft \u0022toxic\u0022 and subject to a long and possibly costly reclamation process (basically a cool down timer and a cost penalty before you can recover the craft, the crew on board could still button up their space suits, get out and go get picked up on their own so they don\u0027t die from starvation and the like while the timer is still going.) Heat hazards after reentry might also be a consideration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-- \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003ERemoteTech \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E- Remote operations center (ie. any ship with six kerbals and a radio) kerbal skill requirement (ie. 3 engineers, 2 scientists and 1 pilot for a remote station, and a needed XP level for each).

Some with auto-tracking (similar to solar panel sun tracking, but oriented to the designated target) others without either need the spacecraft to point at the target (Voyager, New Horizons, etc.) or some other mechanism (Infernal Robotics?).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-- \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003EMOAR RemoteTech!!\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E - Different radio bands, some that do atmospheric bounce and scattering to allow non-Line-of-Sight communication on a planet without relays (void where prohibited and/or lacking an ionosphere and troposphere), and their associated propagation effects, transmitter power requirements (user adjustable on the fly, why put out enough RF wattage to reach Pluto when you only need to talk to Mars right now?), receiver sensitivity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-- \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003EMultistage Engine Start Up and Operation\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E: spin up turbomachinery first via compressed gas or gas generator, when the pumps are \u0022at speed\u0022 or the propellant lines read a certain pressure available then open the fuel valves to the injector and activate the ignitor system if seperate (the H-1 engine bled off gasses from the solid rocket motor gas generator that spun up the pumps and used it to also ignite the combustion chamber). On/off status should be independant of throttle setting and require a deliberate action (shutting the propellant valves). Some issues with start-limited engines in the KSP game are there are instances where the game may either bug out momentarily setting throttle to 0 and then back to the previous setting and there are instances with mechjeb (such as switching off the launch guidance while still in powered flight) that will also change the throttle setting and interfere with proper operation and often cause a failed launch. The game \u0022hiccups\u0022 can be resolved by allowing the automatic re-ignition and continuation of an engine that is already at speed (pump wise) and temperature (combustion chamber wise).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeing able to build an appropriate IU (Instrumentation Unit) for the different stages. Almost possible currently with smart parts. Being able to add additional tanks of high pressure helium and/or TEA/TEB to change the number of times an engine could be restarted. The Saturn V S-2 engines (five J-2\u0027s) only needed to light once, versus the S-IVB\u0027s engine (also a J-2) would need to be able to start at least twice.

On-board parts will also affect what flight information is available to the player via MechJeb and the like. Some other example parts include a radar altimeter (which gives you an exact true altitude) a barometric altimeter (which gives you a mostly accurate sea level altitude, but only if you\u0027re in an atmosphere to measure), a star tracker (which tells you where you are in space), attitude gyroscopes, a non-resetting mission clock (that basically just records how long that particular capsule part has been in use and doesn\u0027t get reset by things like docking and undocking) and the list just goes on and on with the only real limit being player desire for how far they want to take it.

Test stand can be as simple as your rocket stage being mounted to extra-strong, non-releasing launch clamps that also act as the probe core for control. As an addon for KCT, you could develop engines on a test stand to reduce their dynamic failure rate (rather than flying them to do so), and then also incorporate a minimum \u0022material defect\u0022 failure rate. To counter this you would test unique engines on the stands, verify they are good, and then install them on the rockets for use. A few special areas don\u0027t allow this though, such as the Lunar Descent Engine on the LEM. Due to the corrosive hypergol propellant and the ablative cooling it could only be fired once and allowed for no pre-testing, so while you might reduce the tech development failure rate with R\u0026amp;D and live fire tests you will be unable to avoid the material defect failure rate in certain cases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAdditions for Airlock:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnable to exit the crew capsule unless it is depressurized first, can only depressurize if everyone in the capsule is suited up.

On returning capsules, I set the pump level to zero, and let it fill up with waste before returning to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe best part is you can set the pump levels (and options of what to pump) in the editor before launch, or during flight, and they persist forever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe above works for separate parts, but since pods have supplies\u002Bwaste, I have to set the pump level to zero, let it fill up with all resources, then set the pump options to only pump food/water/oxygen, then set the pump level to 16. Result: pod full of waste and no food/water/oxygen. By default TACLS lets Kerbals survive for 2 hours without supplies, which is plenty of time to deorbit and land from low Kerbin orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy default it only pumps fuel but it\u0027s easily extended to pump life support and other stuff, even electricity.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Yaivenov","CreatedById":81754,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-25T05:49:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EExcellent, I\u0027ll give it a look when I get the chance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the moment I\u0027m knee deep in service module fuel cells and I might end up writing up an EPS sim concept to more accurately reflect their operation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFun fact i just learned: when additional load is put on the FC\u0027s it causes a voltage drop at the terminals until the engine case temperature can rise in response to the increased current output and in so doing brings voltage back up to nominal. You have to increase loads slowly or buffer the system via batteries to help support the load while the fuel cells adjust. Otherwise you run the risk of an undervolt situation that could damage stuff. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E and the reverse holds true when unloading the system, except overvoltage is the danger, though in that direction you can take one of your FC\u0027s off the bus in order to bolster the load on the remaining active cells.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-25T06:01:03Z\u0022 title=\u002208/25/2015 06:01  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Yaivenov\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ELearning is fun!\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
