The truth is, science, rep, and funds are easy to get so there is no need to convert them into anything really. The admin build has one good use, and that\u0026#39;s converting all science to funds after you finish the tech tree (once it has no other purpose). Overall, it\u0026#39;s one of the most useless complex features in the game.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-21T21:42:29Z","Content":"\nUsually after I get a good amount of reputation - above 500 - I go to the admin building and pick up the reputation-into-money strategy at the maximum committment level of 25% for a tier 1 admin building. Then I leave it like that for the rest of the game. I rarely reach the point where I need other strategies, like the one Alshain mentioned, because I tend to play with extended tech tree mods.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-22T00:34:50Z","Content":"\nI concur with Alshain\u0026#39;s assessment of the admin building\u0026#39;s uselessness.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI have no use at all for most of the strategies there. Except the one that turns cash into science, which is (for me) useless in the [I][U]opposite[/U][/I] direction, causing great streaming cascades of science to fall out of the sky. It was amusing to try once, for about half a career, then I got bored with it and restarted. It\u0026#39;s too overpowered, it\u0026#39;s a game-ruiner for me. If they had implemented it so that it was multiplicative instead of additive (i.e. \u0022you get N% less cash, and receive N% more science\u0022 rather than just converting every N funds into a science point, it might have been useful without being overpowered.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI love the [I][U]idea[/U][/I] of the admin building and strategies... it\u0026#39;s just the actual implementation that leaves me flat.

I used the Admin Building in playthrough #2, and have never felt the need to click on it again. It could be useful in balancing if your playstyle consistently leaves you with too much or too little money for your tech level, but I guess I adjusted my playstyle to fit the default balance instead. :)\n"}]}
