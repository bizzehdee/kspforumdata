I have built an asymmetric vessel, that has a spent decoupler on one side. The other part of the decoupler is on a probe it launched somewhere on the Mun. I am wondering how the weight of these sections is distributed. Is the weight divided evenly to the 2 parts? Does only 1 section have all the weight? Is the weight distributed according to the size of the decoupler parts?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are wondering what I mean by 2 \u0022parts\u0022 a decoupler, when it detaches, leaves a small section on the surface it detached from and a larger section on the surface it was detaching.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-13T00:26:33Z\u0022 title=\u002201/13/2015 12:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SelectHalfling0\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DeMatt","CreatedById":90539,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-13T00:10:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo the best of my knowledge, the mass of a decoupler entirely goes with the vessel that is detached, as does the official \u0022part\u0022 for recovery purposes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, looking at the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/TT-70_Radial_Decoupler\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ETT-70\u003C/a\u003E, the mass of the decoupler is on the \u0022plate\u0022 side, not the \u0022feet\u0022 side.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SelectHalfling0","CreatedById":105051,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-13T00:26:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat helps alot!
