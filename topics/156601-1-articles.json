It is also common knowledge that pushing on a SEPARATE VESSEL creates force. But this glitch has not been stabilized to be useable. I decided to use trial and error and stabilized the technology to be used as almost a thruster. It is still pretty unstable, due to the 32 g it put out under my tests. This makes it\u00A0prone to turning, and have a high chance of failing, exploding, or even ripping your vessel to shreds. But opportunity is in store for the long lost kraken drive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nimgur:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/gallery/9kR8j\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/gallery/9kR8j\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDownload:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalx.com/322997am/k-drive-1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://kerbalx.com/322997am/k-drive-1\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPS: i beat the record for the highest g\u0027s achieved with a k drive\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"322997am","CreatedById":146422,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-17T19:28:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDid I post enough pics\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"322997am","CreatedById":146422,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-17T20:31:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo\u00A0what do u think\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbalKore","CreatedById":165574,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-17T20:46:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is hope for the Kraken Drive!?
