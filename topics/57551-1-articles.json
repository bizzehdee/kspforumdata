If a Sepratrons exhaust nozzle is pointed at a fuel tank at a rather close proximity it can blow up the tank. (I learned this after trying to figure out why the middle stage of my rocket kept exploding at certain points when I jettisoned the outer boosters)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. If you double click a window while in IVA of the Cupola module it jumps the camera up to a position by that window, thus creating a new pivot point for the camera. (I am a bit curious if this is an early implication of enhanced IVA. Kind of like the kerbal going up to a window he wants to look out of)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: I just did some tests and this works most of the modules with multiple windows, such as the Mk 1-2.
