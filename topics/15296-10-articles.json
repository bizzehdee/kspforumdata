The only advantage of this is that it\u0027s cheaper, lighter, and you get it earlier in the tech tree. This sort of very simple engine is like early jet engines, hence it\u0027s early place on the tech tree. It would have a rather limited \u0022ideal\u0022 operating range in both altitude and airspeed. It would also consume significantly more fuel than it\u0027s counterpart. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs of the stock turbofan, it should be given the behavior curve a \u0022hybrid low-bypass high-compression turbofan\u0022 with a two-stage gearboxed compressor behind the turbofan compressor, a bypass port variable geometry and deactivation system for the turbofan and an adjustable-geometry output vent. This of course means much higher efficiency and more consistent thrust at all ranges and altitudes, at the cost of slower changes in speed, increased weight and increased cost. Efficiency should still cut-out pretty rapidly shortly above supersonic speed, but it should continue to function well into the hypersonic speeds. The same should happen at higher altitudes or any other time there is a shortage of intake air. (Reduction in intake air should cause it to change modes and divert it\u0027s bypass air to intake air.) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo do this with 100% accuracy, you would have to create pair of resource called \u0022Engine torque\u0022 and \u0022compressed air.\u0022 There would technically be two engines inside the engine, plus one added conversion part. One engine burns fuel and compressed air while generating torque and thrust, while the other just uses compressed to generate thrust, then there is an added conversion part that converts torque and intake air into compressed air. Torque cannot be moved and cannot be stored. Compressed air can be moved and stored, but the unit has minimal storage, and consumes far more than can be stored. It may be possible to even rig it so that you can limit the rate that it can be transfered to prevent the use of it for large engines, but allow it to be used for other usages if moved around.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mekan1k","CreatedById":48750,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-21T21:26:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso, is there any chance that the next version of this mod will utilize hotrockets?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mike9606","CreatedById":90275,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-21T21:38:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Justin Kerbice\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Justin Kerbice\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOk.\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s unbelievable and also quite a poor excuse, how it can be possible such bad parts can have been included as-is as stock \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E and NEVER FIXED !

Sadly the only information I can find on it currently is this little snippet \u0022The variable cycle technology used in the YF120 would be extended to not only turn the engine into a turbojet but also into a ramjet. In that mode all airflow would bypass the core and be diverted into the afterburner-like \u0022hyperburner\u0022 where it would be combusted like a ramjet.
