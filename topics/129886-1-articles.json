It is not so much the actual OS that causes resentment, but the whole shift to software as a service. Without setting up a personal WSUS server, updates are pushed to your device at will. Microsoft can and will change anything it desires and has shown to actually do this. This strategy massively compounds the telemetry issues, where data gets sent back to Microsoft HQ without the user having much say.

From a developer standpoint, I totally get the new monitoring and update systems. Being able to force people to stay up to date and give you feedback is the developer\u0027s dream, but as the consumer in this equation, I still hate it. It\u0027s my computer, and I am loath to give it an upgrade that will result in actions being taken without my permission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn any event, I\u0027ve looked at the actual upgrade process, and unfortunately, my PC is well into the quirky phase of it\u0027s lifespan, and after some work over the last couple days, I think windows update is a no go. I was able to squeeze a bit more life out of it, but it\u0027s back to it\u0027s old problems and is once again disabled, probably for good this time. Fortunately, microsoft did create a standalone upgrade installer, so assuming my windows 7 install doesn\u0027t have any other surprises waiting for me, I should be able to make the change without windows update.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am however certainly not going to trust the installer to not both fail and absolutely ruin my installation. That seems like tempting fate. However, it turns out that my steam installation is just small enough to be migrated onto my second hard drive, which will shrink my primary HDD bellow half space used, so I am planning to do that, and then create an image of my primary drive to act as a backup (will be stored on the same drive, which is why I need to get under 50% usage). Wondering if anyone sees a problem with that plan? (other than losing a TB of storage space)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am also wondering if the windows 7 image would still be usable even if the upgrade goes through, or will Windows invalidate the old install on me (the product key)? Even if the upgrade works, I will probably never be willing to throw out the backup image \u0022just in case\u0022, so I would like to create a dual boot, so that I can use either OS at my leisure (thus putting the backup to work). It\u0027s a simple matter of moving any programs/data I need to keep consistent between installs onto my secondary drive and then creating symlinks to them on both versions of windows (assuming my plan will work).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince I know it probably matters to whether that will work, my OS is an OEM version of Windows 7, so I am hoping that as long as I don\u0027t change out CPU\u0027s (which triggers the need to verify my windows installation) it will still work. I am hopping that the really weird way OEM versions of windows 7 are licensed will be a boon in this situation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: Something I just thought of. Does anyone know if I should expect to fail verification because I am using an OEM license on non original hardware? I think I can work around it if it does, since I have all the parts to reassemble my computer in it\u0027s original state, but it involves all the work of rebuilding my PC,\u00A0finding drivers for that CPU, and then hoping that microsoft support will re-verify my Windows 10 install on the other end after I put my computer back together in it\u0027s much improved state (which they might not do if I change the hardware out immediately after upgrading).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-15T22:59:47Z\u0022 title=\u002201/15/2016 10:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 15, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Randox\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wild Cobra","CreatedById":150214,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-17T20:49:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222360743\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022129886\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221452727058\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022126740\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Gaarst\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 1/13/2016 at 3:17 PM, Gaarst said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have W10, and I still haven\u0027t decided which one I hated more between W8 and 10.

Among them are several gigabytes of leftover install files that outright tell you to delete them, and some that you can delete if you don\u0027t think you\u0027ll be downgrading to win 7.\u00A0 Thought some might find this handy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
