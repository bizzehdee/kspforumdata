There\u0027s a couple of issues with laser targeting at extreme ranges - target movement aside:\u003Cp\u003E1) The laser is going to have problems with jitter caused both by vibrations from the vessel\u0027s systems as well as from thermal stresses as the ship contracts and expands. In fact all non-missile weapon systems are going to have that problem. I\u0027m pretty sure you can damper most of it, but not all. Thus I would speculate that the maximum effective range of a laser, under combat conditions, would be under 1 million km simply because precision at that range in combat conditions is likely not achievable. An error of 1/1,000,000 mrads at 1 million km means you miss by 10m. In comparison the ALS with its vibration isolated optical bench and beam steering mirrors are only capable of a maximum of about 1/6,000 mrads precision (it may be a little more, it may be much less... the info is classified); for those that think that 1/6,000 mrads precision is meh, consider that current high end stabilized weapon mounts struggle to get better than 1/2 mrads precision. So yeah, lasers are stupid precise compared to anything else. And remember, I\u0027m talking about robust ship mounted weaponized lasers, not fragile high maintenance hyper-accurate low power laboratory lasers on a planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Sensor error is another factor that we\u0027ve overlooked. I don\u0027t think there is any military-grade sensor that, outside of laboratory conditions, returns 100% accurate readings, and we\u0027ve not even bothered with EW and optical countermeasures. Those errors, compounded with the jitter caused by the vessel, will likely create an embarrassing number of misses at extreme ranges. I bet distant orbital path calculations are likely to have multi kilometre-radius errors, making my earlier theoretical area denial tactic even more difficult to implement... unless we\u0027re talking kilometres\u002B wide area denial weapons, in which case YIKES!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I had to speculate in terms of pK \u0026gt;0.5, I would say that Wedge is right in that we\u0027d see most engagements take place close in; I would speculate that we\u0027d see maximum ranges of about 100,000km (yes, the 1/6,000 mrads means that the ranges would be in low thousands of km, but we\u0027re talking way off in the future here where weapon mounts are vastly improved).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo people will see each other long before anyone can do anything effective to each other; and when they start to get close, it will be the ship with the most accurate sensors coupled with the most precise blinding weapon that will win. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B1, totally in agreement, the works. Still, a note on range. Long range for a railgun will be on the order of hundreds of kms, on account of evasive maneuvers alone. For lasers, that range jumps to thousands or tens of thousands of kms.

In fact, if the torpedo is launched from the side and turns on final before homing, it appears to come from a completely different direction than it actually did! Same deal in outer space.

The human ships, at least - they\u0027re fairly scientifically possible. Structural strength and compartmentalisation seem to be the key to being strong, while kinetic projectiles and nukes seem to be the best armament, with their own strengths and weaknesses of course. Would this be an accurate representation, or would maneuverable ships who can dodge anything be more feasible?\u003Cp\u003EBasically, I guess what I\u0027m asking is what would be the best design for a ship given what we know about science today.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first combat space craft will be simple, no-frills, function over form designs. Much like early orbiter designs. As technology improves and the need grows, so will the designs. Look at the leap from WWI in the early 1900s to the planes of WWII in the late 1940s. They went from being simple open cockpit bi-plane designs that were an engine, gun, and pilot, to aluminum and steel, with the ability to push the limits of the speed of sound. Then from the WWII planes to the jets of the Cold War. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou started seeing fighters becoming less about function over form and more about the \u0022look\u0022 and still maintaining the function.

But also no jet fighter can dodge an auto cannon. The idea behind dodging is not to evade a bullet/laser that is already underway. The idea is to be in another place when the enemy fires.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn a space battle you will not stay at the same course for any time longer the enemy needs to reload. You will jinx in completely random directions with completely random throttles of your thrusters. So the enemy computer can not calculate your position when the laser (or every other weapon...) would hit. So it goes down to randomly shoot a place in space where the enemy \u003Cem\u003Ecould\u003C/em\u003E be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo continue my space tactics from the last page:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. One fleet holds the orbit around a planet/moon/whatever and another fleet is on an incoming trajectory. I assume the attacking fleet used external tankers for their injection burn and have more or less full fuel tanks. The attacking force cannot hide their approach (stealth is impossible in space), but they will try to hide their strength. Maybe the first ship will dispose a constant line of countermeasures (flares, chaff, water vapor, EM warfare, ...) to give the rest of the fleet a possibility to hide behind this screen. Or they have a kilometer wide metallic sail in front of them (or bubble around them, when you assume perfect survaillance in every direction) that will hide their numbers and exact positions behind it (really useful, when you have a ship with 10 m diameter and the enemy can only shoot to a kilometer wide target, at least for the first salvos...). Maybe the defending fleet hides behind/in a space station or so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. A rather long time before the encounter (but still short compared to the travel time), say some days travel time out, both fleets will start kinetic weapons at the enemy (also it is much easier for the attaching fleet, as they already dive into the gravity well, so they need much less energy). They can range from the dumb tungston rod, to fragmentation munition, to nuclear weapons. The chance to hit something will be small. But it will force the enemy to react (navigate or shoot) which will tell their numbers and force them to use propellant. Or they risk that one unengaged projectile is really a nuclear weapon...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. The attacking force has to do their insertion burn. Of course they want to do this without showing their enginges in the direction of the enemy. So this will be a critical point in the tactics. Every side will want to enforce a resulting orbit that is good for their side.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. In orbit at some time (2 times an orbit at anticycloc orbits) they will come into laser weapon range. This is when the real fight starts. No ship will stay on the same trajectory for more than a second and randomly change course and constantly drop countermeasures to not be hit. At the same time the weapons will try to lock on a target that is to slow to evade. As stated it is not easy to aim weapons over such distances at a stationary target, much less on a randomly moving target. So most shoots will miss. So this becomes a fight of attrition. The first side that has not enough reaction mass to dodge will loose (the will also use reaction mass for open cycle cooling as radiatiors are by definition big and hot targets that no side will want to show during combat...).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. At this point the ship has about 3 possible ways to continue. Surrender, be destroyed or fight/flee with the remaning reaction mass and the real probability that they can never be reached by a tanker before the ship is lost in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt really close range also railguns could be a possible weapon.
