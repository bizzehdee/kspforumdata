Perhaps you\u0027re right. I just think that they have a good head on their shoulders and are much better than most other development teams I have encountered (not much I must admit). A reason I might not offer much criticism of them is because I am actually not that technically savvy. So even if I did spot a problem, I would have no idea how to even suggest fixing it (or even be able to discern if it is a bug or me just derping it up). Also I don\u0027t complain much about anything in real life so that might seem like I white knight for them as well.\u003Cp\u003EBut see, your criticism of me is the one I think should be levied toward the devs. You didn\u0027t insult me and you didn\u0027t form your opinion on me based on just a few posts. That is kinda why I might get a little involved with defending the devs. Much of the criticism levied toward them is overly harsh and based on perceived wrongdoing or some such. An example of something I would consider good criticism is all those people who have been talking about performance reduction with the new machine. I haven\u0027t noticed much ire over it just some disappointment. Same thing with the reduced textures of planets. It was something the devs attempted, and I think it is something that they didn\u0027t really implement correctly or shouldn\u0027t have done at all.

First, when I visited the forums then, it wasn\u0027t hard to find people, and the people I did find were much more in-tune with each other than those on the forums now since we all were closer. Things weren\u0027t as volatile. Second, we were mostly space enthusiasts. As a result, grasping some of the more difficult concepts of KSP came more easily. This made discussions on the forums a bit clearer and more filtered. People could jump right in to a discussion and understand what was going on without too much trouble, and the developer-community interactions were much easier since everyone was more familiar with the subject matter. Finally, we didn\u0027t have too many polarizing entities around to create divisions. There just wasn\u0027t enough stuff in KSP at the time to do that sort of thing. It was too simple to divide everyone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously, things have changed. Now, when I enter a thread I see numerous names I\u0027ve never seen before, many of which have less than 50 posts. This isn\u0027t an insult to anyone who fits that bill, though. It just shows that we have an influx of players. But as a community grows, problems arise. The once close forum members get spread apart by newcomers, for one, and so the forum slowly seems less personal. An effect of this depersonalization is that the self-stabilizing effect of a close-knit community fades away. It\u0027s easier for people to be harsh when the user(s) they are angry with are completely unknown to them. And this is aggravated by controversial issues such as bugs in ambitious updates, user generated content such as mechjeb, and the moderation of an ever-growing community. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing about those three examples in particular is that they come from 3 different sources: The development process itself, the community, and those who watch over the community. It would be incorrect to paint one group as responsible for the current state of affairs. My take is that the original issue was that newcomers didn\u0027t have too much to guide them. The wiki was under constant assault from spammers and was often totally closed and in a state of total disarray. The original tutorials barely covered the bare bones, and although they have improved significantly, they still have a long way to go before effective at teaching everyone who wants to play. And so this presents new, not so space-oriented players with a problem. It\u0027s very difficult to learn and very difficult to find a good teacher, so what\u0027s left? One thing could be asking for more assists. Before maneuver nodes were added, there was much debate on how to handle this, and it could sometimes get heated. The addition of mechjeb into things only fueled the fire, and soon you had one end of the spectrum calling the other clueless, spoon-fed and idiotic, while that end in turn responded by claiming its attackers were elitist, dictatorial and opposed to fun. This, I feel, is the biggest divide in the KSP community. It\u0027s the smaller, older, more technical group versus the quickly growing, less experienced leisurely group. And because the latter is growing more quickly (since there simply are fewer space experts than there are laymen), the personality of the forum has changed markedly over KSP\u0027s two years since .7.3. It\u0027s simply not a given anymore that forum goers will be able to easily grasp and fully understand some concepts of the game and its development anymore, and so developer-community interaction breaks down. When that happens, the forum just gets even more crazy. People start shouting their ideas and wishes louder, hoping that someone hears them, for one thing. Arguments ensue. Fears that the game will go down a dark path spring up like no tomorrow. The forums become a generally hostile place. Moderation has to crack down, and so now things get even more tense. It just keeps spiraling downwards until people start to avoid the place. I don\u0027t personally think that the forums are beyond saving yet, though. But it requires some work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, the users need to pitch in. Simple things like searching for something before posting, listening to an argument and understanding it before responding, and emotionally detaching oneself from problems or suggestions are big things. The first point stops you from annoying everyone with an idea that has been brought up and put down a thousand times, the second makes sure you have a good, intelligent discussion and don\u0027t just make projections, and the third will prevent you from sounding \u0022entitled\u0022 as some people would say. Then, the moderators and the community team as a whole need to help, too. Being curt and unprofessional are the biggest no-nos I can think of here. A model for what\u0027s RIGHT in my opinion would be sal_vager; I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve ever seen him do a forum goer wrong when assessing an issue. Another thing is closing threads - I think this needs to be treated as more of a nuclear option than the first response to intense discussions. Individual offenders should be picked out first and warned on a private basis, and if that fails, punishment on a private basis should follow, but the thread, as long as it stays on topic or is not a repeat of some sort, should stay open until it is beyond a shadow of a doubt that it is simply a breeding ground for wrongdoings. I think that just these two things would allow for amazing headway between the users and moderators. The next thing I would say should be on the list of things in need of review for the team is the stream. It\u0027s probably one of the best ways to get information from the devs to the users, and so it definitely needs to be up to par. And unfortunately, I personally do not feel that it is, and I would venture to guess that others think the same. BEfore Damion left, I felt like it was not what it could be, but at least functional and capable of providing information to viewers. But after his resignation, it\u0027s fallen on rough times. Admittedly, any transition is a bit difficult, and it being timed near the .20 release only worsened things. But I don\u0027t think it was handled well, honestly - at least the dev and community streams. I DO think the idea of having prominent streamers having time on the air on the channel is good. But back to the dev and community streams, while I know that Skunky has been an important part of KSP for a long, long, loooooonnnng time, and that he is well liked by many, with all due respect and courtesy I would feel better with someone else in the dev streams. There was a lack of decorum of sorts I felt which went unchallenged in the stream, but in the chat, similar things were cracked down on. Obviously, as one of the Captain\u0027s first streams, it\u0027s impossible to expect perfection. But I still think that the dev and community streams need to be seriously restructured in the wake of Damion\u0027s departure, as simply transitioning the duties to Capt\u0027n Skunky has been rocky. If the streams can be improved and the impression of a repressive moderation team can be lifted though, I think everything will be on the right track. Actually, just one more thing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, there is the development process itself. Since .7.3, we as a community have witnessed KSP evolve from its simple, small and bare-bones beginnings into a complex, massive and meaty game, thanks to the hard work of a dedicated development team that is striving to create a very rare type of game. Much praise is deserved for what has been added over the years. But while many things have been done to try and keep communication and interaction alive within such a large community, given the current state of the forums I think that there still is work to be done. But I do not think that the answer lies in more frequent dev blogs and streams - I think those just need more regulation. What I would do personally is make the tutorial system more robust, since given the current situation, the How To section, wiki and current tutorials aren\u0027t getting the job done. There are of course many other features that are of high priority, but I feel that tutorials need to be just as high as those too, because if the tutorials teach players well, the community is once again capable of easily grasping and understanding the issues at hand, like in ye olde times of the forums. Once that happens, it\u0027s very easy for devs and players to interact and understand each other and it\u0027s actually possible to cut down on the amount of communication because less is more when people know what you\u0027re saying. And that frees up time from tough schedules.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe forums are definitely in a tough situation right now. There\u0027s no one magic solution. If better tutorials are in place but players don\u0027t take advantage of them, then it\u0027s as if they never changed. If they do take advantage of them but then the forums are mismanaged, it\u0027s still just as hard to get points across. But despite this, I feel it\u0027s possible to fix the forums given how much they have been through over the years. It\u0027ll take more than struts, but it\u0027s by no means unachievable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MR4Y","CreatedById":66897,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-29T00:45:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E-snip-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for forum behavior, I wouldn\u0027t say it\u0027s going to be like Minecraft, but definetely some people shield the developers way too much sometimes. Even the alpha argument doesn\u0027t have to be said by anyone from the dev team, taking in consideration how often it is used to make people that are complaining stop. Which, as pointed in other post, demotivates people from reporting bugs, since \u0022It\u0027s an alpha release and bugs are expected\u0022, which sounds like a lousy excuse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for complaints, maybe the game shouldn\u0027t had gone to Steam so early? Considering how well estabilished the platform is and the huge amount of people that use it, as well as the amount of full games, both indie and from big publishers, in there that are almost at full release or still in Greenlight state but fully functional, KSP would end up with high expectations. People waiting for a full fledged game will find bugs, then complain and be told off by people with the whole alpha argument. Not only that, the Steam version has bug exclusive to that version as well, which makes matters worse. Maybe KSP should had evolved to at least beta state before going to Steam instead?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing that often happens is misinterpretation between people. Not bringing examples, but we all know that nobody really reads what someone else has to say entirely, before making assumptions and answering back, interpreting what was said in the most convenient way for themselves instead. I recall seeing someone complaining about devs moving out of the forum to post things, using blogs and other things instead, which in part ended up alienating part of the userbase (I think), since not everyone accompanies(or want to) the dev blogs and people that do seem to think their opinions are more entitled than the rest.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-29T01:13:17Z\u0022 title=\u002205/29/2013 01:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 29, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by KasperVld\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AmpsterMan","CreatedById":32671,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-29T00:50:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022_Aramchek_\u0022 data-cite=\u0022_Aramchek_\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E due to the nature of this game it does attract a subset of the populace with poor social skills, which could stem from any number of reasons really, but it leads to people ignoring the \u0022spirit\u0022 of posts at times in favor of an overtly guileless, by the letter interpretation.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think one of the reasons that miscommunicatoin happens so often in discussion forums is due to the fact that communication via text is only fruitful when both parties (ie, the reader and the writer) are skilled in putting their thoughts to word and putting other\u0027s words to thought.
