You using LV-30 which has reasonable take off ISP. But you would be better off with a SFRB like a \u002210\u0022 at the bottom to get you up before engaging those LV-30s. The problem is low ISP mean low thrust now, not just low efficiency and your time spent lumbering around over the launch pad is wasted delta-V. In your rocket design you should use disposable rockets to get you to 100 m/s as quickly as possible (2g if possible). LV-909 now cannot even get you off the launch pad with a pod and a small tank. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELook at your thrust as your rocket is going up and your g-forces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOver powering a rocket is also bad particularly now since drag is based on profile. Speeds over 100 at sea level and 160 at 5000 meters is the optimal lift with a CoD of 0.2, if you streamline your tanks you can lower the CoD and raise the velocity making the launch more efficient. For example your T800 can be replaced with an aerodesign that also has fuel in the fusiform section. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese, admittedly are guesses. I will take a look at several designs to see which is that case. Theoretically asparagas is bad design for launch vehicle because of the transverse segmental flexibility and drag interactions. Of course you could use jets to lift the vessel to 20k m and launch from that altitude. That would be very efficient.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mrklaw","CreatedById":143639,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T16:16:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy guess would be that your two 2.5m boosters would have way more fuel than the 8 1.25m boosters, so the main enter engine ca go higher before it needs to rely solely on its own tank, therefore lasts longer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedit: hmm - same amount of fuel? 4xX32 tanks or 16xT800.

But that doesn\u0027t tell the whole story. \u003Cp\u003EDrag should be close to a wash, 8 1.25m boosters have exactly the same frontal area as 2 2.5m boosters (not sure about the relative drag of the different nosecones, though). Edit: If fuel lines are as draggy as struts that might be significant, the asparagus design has more of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I think is happening is that the higher peak TWR of the large booster version is getting it out of the thick atmosphere faster, so the engines get more efficient with the falling air pressure more quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving tested several designs this appears to be close to the mark. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAsparagas works to improve delta-V but only with increases in fuel. In fact increasing side fuel tanks even without adding engines worked well if the launch engine had good take off ISP stats. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAsparagas will work for you but you will need aerodynamic launch engines. It worked best for highly aerodynamic tanks with drag lowered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETherefore the critical problem is TWR (ISP of the engines in particular) and drag resistence. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E_ I had a poodle on a bigorange with a F2 pod and covered by a fairing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- three side F1 rockets LV-30 with left 2200 dV at orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- 6 side side F1 rockets LV-30 (3-3 asparagas) 2600 dv at orbit \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- 8 side F1 rockets LV-30 (2-2-2-2 asparagas) 3400 dv at orbit \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of these required a large number of small boosters to get the craft up to 1000 meters or so, otherwise the super efficient poodle would not have enough momentum after the gravity turn to efficiently make orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- big orange on a F2 booster with high aerodynamic side fuel tanks 3400 dv\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-with Asparagas fuel tanks this produces 3500 dV in the orange tank at minimal orbit. {note the edit, the 5000 value appears to have been a glitch in MechJeb and could not be reproduced).
