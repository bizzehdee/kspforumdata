Since the same bar is also present both in flight and VAB, that means the player could edit the limit anytime, either before launch, or after launch (this can be usefull when building a spacecraft in orbit). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe limit you\u0027ve input would also appear on top of the engine icon. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, if I limit one engine to 50% and the throttle is at 100%, every engine would fire at 100%, except for that one, and it would have the number \u002250\u0022 on top of the icon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat way everyone is happy, and you also don\u0027t overwhelm the player with unnecessary information (which seems to be one of the\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/mXTxQko-JH0?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E).\u003Cp\u003EAs for the coding itself, well, there are some mods out there that already do this (although they are pretty confusing thanks to hundreds of windows just to change something) , so it shouldn\u0027t be too hard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and since science and tech tree is all the rage right now, maybe throttle control could be an unlockable, but I\u0027ll leave that to your imagination.\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chi","CreatedById":67720,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-11T06:59:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, funny how they actually did it in 0.23.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
