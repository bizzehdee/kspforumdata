You can become the single greatest military force on Kerbin- OR you can lead the world in your scientific discoveries! Or even simply become the terror or peace maker of Kerbin. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis forum is currently a work in progress and being made as of yet- and we are requiring members as we have very little as of yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere will be an economy system which will have you manage several resources: \u003Cem\u003ERaw materials\u003C/em\u003E, \u003Cem\u003Efuels\u003C/em\u003E, \u003Cem\u003Efood\u003C/em\u003E and \u003Cem\u003Ewater\u003C/em\u003E. Raw materials is what you use to make anything from buildings to crafts. Fuels is what you use to power your cities and move your crafts. Food and water is consumed by Kerbals everyday and failing to feed your Kerbals could lead to you becoming an evil tyrant running your country and having your Kerbals die of hunger/thirst.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou also have to manage your money and provide power! Power can be made from several places- it can be made from a Chemical Power Plant (equal to a coal power plant in today\u0027s world)- you can also make a solar or wind farm to collect power, doesn\u0027t require constant feeding of fuels, but it provides less power. All at the same time you have to manage your cash! Don\u0027t run yourself into an economic depression! Keep your money up and stay on top!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you get yourself into a military engagement- then you will have to defend yourself or begin as the assaulting force. This is where military engineers can dedicate their expert creations to dueling it out- in the skies, in the water, on land or in space. You can conquer nations- or defend key military installations, you can even assault major cities to weaken the morale of a nation. It\u0027s your army and your power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour creations within KSP can now be used in this world and you can create massive trade vessels to move resources to other nations, via by air, sea, land or space! You can also use your builds as a way to move your nation with cars, planes and TRAINS! Your creations can even be used for battle and war! So no creation can\u0027t be used- now everything can be used for anything and everything!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-02T19:16:07Z\u0022 title=\u002206/02/2015 07:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ZooNamedGames\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T22:53:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe rules disallowed Roleplaying a while ago, it caused some problems for some reason.
