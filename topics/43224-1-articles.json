Each satellite sends a unique, time dependent pseudo-random signal. The receiver compares the expected signal for that satellite to the received signal. The time delay between when the signal was transmitted and received is evident from the difference in the pattern. The pseudo-random nature of the signal also makes it difficult to jamb and easier to pick out the very weak signal from the background noise.
