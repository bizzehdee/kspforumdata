Also, managed to land safely on the KSC runway. \n\nI came up with a hare-brained scheme to shave weight, which didn\u0027t work out: I felt I didn\u0027t really need landing gear, as the engine has more than enough thrust to launch vertically from the runway. This plan didn\u0027t pan out for two reasons. First, the rules actually state you need to launch *horizontally*. The second (and more important) reason I didn\u0027t go this route is that the parachute only works if you still have landing gear underneath. The impact speed is too much for the rest of the vessel. So, had to put the landing gear back on, but no longer needed the parachute.\n\nMy entry is called \u0022Tiny SSTO\u0022, with a launch weight of 4.3T. It achieved orbit, with a PE\u003E70km, and was able to return to KSC for a safe landing on the runway. It is very stable (when empty) and also very maneuverable. The empty stability was very important, as I use wing loading to add drag as needed during the descent to keep the trajectory close to the KSC. With such a short plane, placing the COL close to the COM like I normally do caused stability issues at high angles of attack. So I ended up with the COL quite a ways aft of the COM.\n\nI play completely stock, no mods at all. So my ascents are not even remotely close to ideal, I just have to point it in the general direction I think will work, and hope for the best. With an ascent planner or a better pilot, you could probably get this ship to orbit with less fuel.\n\nThis is also my first attempt at embedding IMGUR stuff, hope this works..\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

I took a bit of advice on ascent paths from this thread, and it worked out well. The spoilers are very image heavy, covering the whole journey.\n\n![zQKXCY.png](http://i.cubeupload.com/zQKXCY.png)\n\nFirst, a glamour shot on the runway before takeoff. This is the Triangle, a one-man, drone-piloted spaceplane with a single turboramjet and four 48-7S engines for propulsion. Inside that bay is the probe core, solar panels, and batteries, for safekeeping against reentry heat. The plane docks with its nose, and doesn\u0027t carry any cargo. Some of the fuel in the central tank has been removed to reduce weight.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![EPkE40.png](http://i.cubeupload.com/EPkE40.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![ViAvOJ.png](http://i.cubeupload.com/ViAvOJ.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![jZWZYN.png](http://i.cubeupload.com/jZWZYN.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![myGtTu.png](http://i.cubeupload.com/myGtTu.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![YpjIpE.png](http://i.cubeupload.com/YpjIpE.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![o8sy3e.png](http://i.cubeupload.com/o8sy3e.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![b7e77d.png](http://i.cubeupload.com/b7e77d.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![pElxSU.png](http://i.cubeupload.com/pElxSU.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![QN0L4m.png](http://i.cubeupload.com/QN0L4m.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![q7aUQC.png](http://i.cubeupload.com/q7aUQC.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![4nLLWN.png](http://i.cubeupload.com/4nLLWN.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n![q9tgjr.png](http://i.cubeupload.com/q9tgjr.png)\n\nHere is the Triangle docked to Stopover Station, my current career mode space station at 100km circular orbit around Kerbin. I just docked, then undocked, without transferring anything. The Triangle flew up uncrewed, and the whole path is available in the spoilers above. In summary, however, I took off from the runway and immediately levelled out. Then, I built speed to about 340m/s, increased angle to 30 degrees slowly so as not to lose too much speed, then levelled off again around 11km. Here I built speed to roughly 1km/s, and began to climb again, trying to continue accelerating. I switched to map view, and tried to keep apoapse one minute away, firing the rockets when I needed to. I put the apoapse to 75km, coasted there, circularised, and then set up for docking. I had to turn my graphics down as the station came within physics distance... but I turned them up again once out of physics distance after separating.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![ldbx3Z.png](http://i.cubeupload.com/ldbx3Z.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![rZpAie.png](http://i.cubeupload.com/rZpAie.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![KOHTRK.png](http://i.cubeupload.com/KOHTRK.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![Yd544g.png](http://i.cubeupload.com/Yd544g.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![X8YJpv.png](http://i.cubeupload.com/X8YJpv.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![5FZVQI.png](http://i.cubeupload.com/5FZVQI.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![eACkfv.png](http://i.cubeupload.com/eACkfv.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![GOC2uq.png](http://i.cubeupload.com/GOC2uq.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![Ie7lF0.png](http://i.cubeupload.com/Ie7lF0.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![ffER83.png](http://i.cubeupload.com/ffER83.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n![jFHila.png](http://i.cubeupload.com/jFHila.png)\n\nFinally, here is the plane landed back on the runway.

There\u0027s still lots of excess fuel in the plane, but I might want to keep some of that as a safety margin.\n\nSo, I think this qualifies for Advanced Pilot Proficiency 1st class?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-31T15:15:53Z\u0022 title=\u002208/31/2015 03:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Concentric**"},{"CreatedByName":"boolybooly","CreatedById":6572,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-03T10:41:08Z","Content":"Congratulations to ...https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/11214-The-K-Prize-100-reusable-spaceplane-to-orbit-and-back?p=2158226\u0026viewfull=1#post2158226\n\nZaddy23 Utilitarial Commendation, Advanced Pilot Precision Award with the ship with no name.\n\n[kookoo_gr](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/11214-The-K-Prize-100-reusable-spaceplane-to-orbit-and-back?p=2158769\u0026viewfull=1#post2158769) with Valkyrie Mk-I.\n\n[hazard-ish](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/11214-The-K-Prize-100-reusable-spaceplane-to-orbit-and-back?p=2159569\u0026viewfull=1#post2159569) Utilitarial Distinction (Minmus mining base \u002B scansat) Advanced Pilot Precision Award with SSTO Shipment 1.\n\n[RexKramer](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/11214-The-K-Prize-100-reusable-spaceplane-to-orbit-and-back?p=2162487\u0026viewfull=1#post2162487) Advanced Pilot Precision Award with Tiny SSTO (minimalist record holder 4.3t).\n\n[TrainEngie](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/11214-The-K-Prize-100-reusable-spaceplane-to-orbit-and-back?p=2168418\u0026viewfull=1#post2168418) Advanced Pilot Precision Award 1st Class with KRS-1.\n\n[Concentric](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/11214-The-K-Prize-100-reusable-spaceplane-to-orbit-and-back?p=2171035\u0026viewfull=1#post2171035) Advanced Pilot Precision Award 1st Class with Triangle.\n\n... for completing the K-Prize mission successfully and thanks all for your mission reports I am sure aspiring spaceplane pilots will find them valuable reading.
