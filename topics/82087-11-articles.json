What I want to get out of it is a mechanic through which the game presents itself gradually to players, to not welcome you with an overwhelming wall of content right from the start.\u003Cp\u003EAs with the content, the tree itself is being designed to expand the further you get. At, first, you get a few general technologies to research, which in turn open up new nodes which are more specialized, and so on until you\u0027re getting to some really specialized stuff towards the higher levels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0027re assigning parts to each of these nodes now with this idea in mind, and so far I think it\u0027s going rather well. Each part seems to find its place nicely in the tree we have here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for how nodes will be researched, here are my thoughts:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe can\u0027t impose any amount of time to unlock something. You could just sit on the pad and timewarp if that were the case, and that\u0027s not the sort of gameplay we\u0027d like to see.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also don\u0027t like the idea of spending money directly to research something, as that would reduce R\u0026amp;D to be just a shop catalog.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstead, I think the most authentic mechanic would be for nodes to require a \u0027science\u0027 rating, which you earn through experimentation (flying) and gathering data (packing science gear aboard possibly). This system opens up a lot of very cool possibilies for later, which will give a lot of meaning to what you can do out there on your missions, even before we have an actual game economy or contracts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo paraphrase a friend developer, it\u0027s not about realism, it\u0027s about authenticity. Realism means putting you into a simulator cockpit and making you wait around for months to reach another planet. Authenticity means making sure what the game lets you do feels right, even if it\u0027s presented with some degree of abstraction, like using a numerical value to represent a more complicated process.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-19T22:07:12Z\u0022 title=\u002208/19/2014 10:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 19, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by GregroxMun\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"worir4","CreatedById":75980,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-19T21:50:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is always Orbiter.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"marce","CreatedById":110351,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-19T21:55:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022regex\u0022 data-cite=\u0022regex\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf we\u0027re going for \u0022unplayable without\u0022 then we\u0027d have to add Real Solar System to that list.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can live with an alternative universe.
