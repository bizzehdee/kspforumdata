I was watching from the can, and saw the water splash against the view port, and everything looked fine. When I changed to external camera, however, Jeb was no longer listed as an occupant of my craft. When I went to the space facility to call for a recovery, it only listed just the pod (1 part). Why did I lose the can part? It didn\u0027t break apart on splash down, and I landed ass-first, not on the side.

Ideally you should be aiming for 5m/s or less. Visualise a normal modern room, it is probably a little over 2m floor to ceiling. Now think of 4 times that height (8m).
