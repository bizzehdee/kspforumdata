I think, but really I\u0027m not 100% what\u0027s up with that. As for your docking issues, when in orbit, press v until the camera becomes \u0022Chase\u0022, then, if you put your camera behind your ship and looking forward, up will be up, down will be down, etc. Makes it a lot simpler, but theres not really any other way for now. I only use the navball during dockings when I do my final approach and I want to perfectly align my prograde vector with the target.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"purpletarget","CreatedById":57317,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-10T08:56:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a really good \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/30238-How-to-Read-the-Navball\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eprimer on reading the NavBall here\u003C/a\u003E. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the east line being reversed, that\u0027s sort of a paradoxical thing...the instrument is made on a ball, so our mind thinks the lines should like up similar to a globe, because that\u0027s what we\u0027re used to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, what the Navball represents, or tries to show us, is to imagine the ship inside of a sphere, and all around that sphere we are looking at the navball markings from the inside looking out.
