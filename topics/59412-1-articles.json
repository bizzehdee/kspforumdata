I came up with it when helping a friend learn KSP. It\u0027s pretty common to hear friends that haven\u0027t played before explain how the \u0022controls are awful\u0022 or \u0022inconsistent\u0022. Imagine trying to teach someone how to use the navball? It\u0027s not something you can teach. It\u0027s something you have to learn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThis NOT intended for veteran or even intermediate KSP players.\u003C/strong\u003E This is for any players who would struggle using the navball. I imagine this being a feature can be displayed while a hotkey is pressed, or toggled, or even always on. It might also have som: Opacity, Scale, (checkbox) Always show in docking mode, (checkbox) Rotate indicator icons (See image #2 below, compare to #4). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt may be useful even for those who know how to use the navball, however. Sometimes using the navball just shouldn\u0027t be necessary. If you just need to move over 1km to land on a hill, for example. Sometimes you just need to go in a general direction. You might just get some altitude and tilt yourself in an attempt to orient yourself, I\u0027ll bet you have all done this before - because you didn\u0027t know what way you were facing. This would solve that issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is what I imagine the feature could look like, I made a few examples that I hope demonstrate the purpose.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/EOstb\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
