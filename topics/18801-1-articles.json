Try getting about 1/8th of an orbit ahead of your objective, then brake while watching the map view. Keep your projected impact point a little beyond the place you actually want to land until you\u0027re down to the last few hundred meters (because it\u0027s easier and more fuel-efficient to slow down than to speed up again while controlling a descent), then steer directly toward the prograde marker to bring yourself to a horizontally stationary landing. \u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re trying to land near something else you\u0027ve already landed, move the camera until you\u0027re looking past the current ship at the target at a 45 degree angle. Then it\u0027s quite easy to see any drift to the sides or vertically. Steer toward the objective laterally, throttle up if you\u0027re coming too low, throttle down if too high. (Be careful not to bomb the previous ship with the ejected engine stage, though. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E ) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just tried it again, and the middle stage is a bit less efficient than I thought.
