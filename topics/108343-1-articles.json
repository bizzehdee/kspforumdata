I\u0027m noticing that several of the lines may have something to do with steering impacting the turning radius, so as your rover speeds up, you can\u0027t turn as hard. I think that by modifying the base value the wheel should turn much sharper at low speeds, which is what I\u0027m looking for. In addition I believe I made a suggestion thread about it a while ago and a mod author said he had a tweakable for the turning radius, so it might just be possible.
