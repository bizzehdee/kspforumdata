Informative, but doesn\u0027t do anyone much good (it also only covered one of the three chutes).\n\nSo I made another patch, which I tested successfully.\n\nAs a disclaimer: like last time, I just compared the drag of your chutes to stock chutes, then looked at what the diameter the RealChute\u0027s patch gave them, and scaled accordingly. This doesn\u0027t take into account differing Drag modifiers, which you lean on heavily. Granted, neither does it remove those modules, so they still apply, but I was under the impression they tied in directly to the drag applied by the Module Parachute, which has since been replaced by the Module RealChute. As I mentioned, I tested all of them successfully - the largest one is quite large in diameter; the cord for the parachute alone is 1.25m thick! Slows a Mk1-2 Pod down to something like 1.4m/s iirc.\n\nI made them all procedural, meaning they can be edited in the vessel editor with the RealChute editor, and to a lesser extent on the fly.\n\nIf you decide not to use the patches, for whatever reason, consider at least adding the line \u0022category:NEEDS[RealChute] = none\u0022 after your \u0022category = Utility\u0022 in your configs. The RealChute mod adds its own Parachute editor category, and currently your parachutes appear there and in the Utility category as well. The above line should, in theory, remedy that, as it\u0027s what is used in the patches below.\n\nOne last thing: you might see in the editor when first selecting/placing a chute an error in the console, \u0022Error: cannot find transform \u0027canopy\u0027 in the library.\u0022 I don\u0027t know what that\u0027s all about, but stock chutes do it too (RealChute\u0027s included chutes are the only ones that don\u0027t);
