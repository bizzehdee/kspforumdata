Current version I am playing on is 1.2.1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo here\u0027s the problem... no new mods added since the last time I played without any difficulty and suddenly every single time I EVA or undock two ships whatever I happen to be in control of suddenly flies out of control towards the nearest gravity well. This has happened on multiple ships in multiple spheres of influence. If I select another ship quickly enough (while still in range of whatever I just left) then I can go to the space center and the ship stops falling. However, if I try to fly it afterwards, the game crashes. Otherwise it tells me I cannot time warp while under acceleration (engines deactivated and thrust on 0) and trying to fight against the fall just burns fuel and doesn\u0027t work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMostly I\u0027m just wondering if anyone else has that happen to them, mods or not.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ghosty141","CreatedById":142498,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-03T17:11:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe need LOGS!
