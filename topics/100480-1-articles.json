I\u0027m not sure which mod causes it so that\u0027s why I\u0027m asking here and I know that it\u0027s a mod because Duna is back to normal on a stock install. Not sure if I followed the guidelines correctly but here\u0027s what I have.\n\n![l7s3BD3.png](http://i.imgur.com/l7s3BD3.png)\n\n**KSP:** 0.90 Windows 32-bit **ALSO USING OPENGL**. My KSP RAM is usually at 2.5gb.\n\n**Problem:** Very bright Duna surface\n\n**Mods installed:** Very long list so I just took a screenshot\n\nSome mods that are inside folders are:\n\nAstronomer\u0027s Interstellar Pack\n\nThe KerbTown folder is just KerbalKonstructs buildings\n\nHGR is just the IVA props for Snack Pack\n\nKopernicus is just OuterPlanets.\n\n![nOGnnHN.png](http://i.imgur.com/nOGnnHN.png)\n\n**Reproduction steps:** I guess just load up KSP with these mods? I\u0027m not sure how to reproduce it since it happens to me everytime.\n\n**Log:** [https://www.dropbox.com/s/99tbgd87oxr1eec/output_log.txt?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/99tbgd87oxr1eec/output_log.txt?dl=0)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-23T04:11:16Z\u0022 title=\u002202/23/2015 04:11  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by tygoo7**"},{"CreatedByName":"GiantTank","CreatedById":113180,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T01:28:23Z","Content":"Im not even sure what half those mods do, but it could be enviromental visual enhancements.

I wonder if I verify the game cache or whatever that steam thing is, will fix this. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nEDIT: Nope, still nothing.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-23T02:23:05Z\u0022 title=\u002202/23/2015 02:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by tygoo7**"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T02:30:43Z","Content":"How about planetshine?\n\nWhat other visual effect mods (besides the collision ones) are in there?"},{"CreatedByName":"tygoo7","CreatedById":57345,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T03:31:39Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E How about planetshine?\n\u003E What other visual effect mods (besides the collision ones) are in there?\n\nThat worked, I think. It\u0027s not pure red/orange anymore so that\u0027s good. Not sure if it\u0027s normal yet since I haven\u0027t been to Duna much. I *think* it\u0027s back to normal, but I just want to make sure.\n\nI have Texture Replacer, EVE (not the problem), Hot Rockets, Smokescreen. That\u0027s pretty much my visual effect mods.\n\n![i6y3kvR.png](http://i.imgur.com/i6y3kvR.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T04:02:34Z","Content":"Looks okay.
