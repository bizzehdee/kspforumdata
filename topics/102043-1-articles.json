They are always, unchangingly, the same. For awhile, we had alternis kerbin if we wanted to do something new. But the biome changes in .90 basically broke alternis kerbin, which is no longer supported, and I have nether the skills or the tools to fix.\n\nBut then Kopernicus was released. It didn\u0027t take long for me to realize that with this tool, it was possible to remake the KSP solar system without going back to school for computer programming.\n\n**Gallery**\n\n\u003E \n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/VGcvt)\n\n**What does this mod do?**\n\nIt moves Moho and Eve closer the sun.\n\nIt moves lathe to its own orbit, to the inside of the stock kerbin orbit, where it is now circled by Mun and Minmus\n\nIt replaces Lathe with Bop. (This was entirely a quick-fix, and I hope to figure out a better solution later).\n\nJool now orbits on the outside of Kerbin\u0027s stock orbit.\n\nKerbin now orbits Jool in less inclined orbit close to where bop orbits in the stock game.\n\nDuna orbits further away from the sun.\n\n**Download**\n\n[https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/645/Insystem%20Mod%20for%20Kopernicus](https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/645/Insystem%20Mod%20for%20Kopernicus)\n\n**Recommendations.** \n\nThis mod goes really, really well with the Outer planets mod ([http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/104280-0-90-Outer-Planets-Mod-%281-5-5-1%29-TextureReplacer-incompatibility-fixed-1-Mar](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/104280-0-90-Outer-Planets-Mod-%281-5-5-1%29-TextureReplacer-incompatibility-fixed-1-Mar) ) I highly recommend installing it.\n\n**Credits**\n\nSarbian for DDSLoader ([http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/96729-0-90-DDSLoader-1-9-%28Mar-9%29-Loads-DDS-Texture-Boringly-fast-edition](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/96729-0-90-DDSLoader-1-9-%28Mar-9%29-Loads-DDS-Texture-Boringly-fast-edition) ) and ModuleManager updates, too.\n\nBryceSchroeder for making the Kopernicus mod ([http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/88168-Early-development-0-24-Kopernicus-Planetary-System-Modifier](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/88168-Early-development-0-24-Kopernicus-Planetary-System-Modifier) )\n\nStreetwind for a massive amount of help.\n\n**License**\n\nThis mod is released under a creative commons license ([http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/))\n\n**Known problems**\n\nSometimes ships appear in orbit, rather than on the launch pad. Just revert flight and launch again.\n\nSome planets do not have .cfg files, and therefore their science values are unaltered.\n\nIn some installs, the vehicle appears inside the sun and explodes when first launched. Reverting to vehicle assembly and launching again fixes the problem. I\u0027m unsure what causes this, or how to stop it from happening.\n\nI\u0027m sure there are other problems. I just haven\u0027t found them yet.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-24T21:12:31Z\u0022 title=\u002212/24/2015 09:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Dunrana**"},{"CreatedByName":"daniel l.","CreatedById":57763,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-16T04:53:17Z","Content":"Really quite cool!"},{"CreatedByName":"amarius1","CreatedById":111155,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T18:57:23Z","Content":"Hey rhis is realy cool!

I fear that the lackluster response from the community indicates very few of them agree with you. Truthfully, I didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t really expect a big response.
