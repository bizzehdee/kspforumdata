The output log lists several mods multiple times and for multiple versions of the game that will definiteley not be compatible with the version of the game your playing.

I took a look at the logs you posted and your mods were all over the place 1.2.2, 1.3.1, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6 and 1.7. The Unity version the game is built upon changed at 1.4 so you run a high risk of incompatibility running newer mods on your install. It\u0027s obvious in the log that several of your mods fail to load their .dlls because of this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
