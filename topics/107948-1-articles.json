The closest I can get the nodes is about 1.4k so I start burning to slow down and everything is going dandy at first and I\u0027m closing in on the stranded kerbal but then a bit before the pink circle reaches my retrograde marker my the target begins moving away from me despite me moving faster. Then I end up burning to correct it etc etc but it keeps overshooting till I can\u0027t get back. I can\u0027t seem to get the speed down to 0.0 relative to the targets before the target is gone.\n\nThe orbit of the target is a little inclined from the usual however and I only have a little over 1300 delta V left (and I need enough to get back down to Kerbin, which shouldn\u0027t take much).\n\nThis is my first time rendezvousing technically since the in-game tutorial was kinda meh. Your tutorial was helpful malkuth, as well as Das who went over some rendezvousing last night but I kinda gotten myself into a hard spot with mine. If I can complete the contract on this flight it would be great, if not I can always deorbit and launch another craft which will cost some more funds.\n\nEDIT: I finally got it. I instead lined up the orbits, which I should\u0027ve done in the first place and managed to get a very close encounter at 0.1-0.2km and through trial and error on my precise burns I finally manged to get close enough to complete the contract. The hard part was that I did the entire maneuver on the dark side of Kerbin on stock lighting so I could barely see the ships or the kerbal as I EVA\u0027d him over.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-20T02:58:57Z\u0022 title=\u002205/20/2015 02:58  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Anrui**\n  \nGot it!"},{"CreatedByName":"Two","CreatedById":144535,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T13:33:42Z","Content":"Perfect! Just what I was looking for. Thanks! =)\n\nYou do over-explain some of the things a bit, but I finally understood how these target markers are actually working."},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow88","CreatedById":66043,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T13:08:47Z","Content":"Nice video, but there is an error in your explanation of the prograde and target markers at around the 12:15 point. The pink circle is the target, and the yellow prograde marker is your current direction of travel; you actually call it the other way round. With the correct explanation of the markers, it is easier to recognise that, in your example, your current flight direction is taking you to the right of your target, which is why you need to make a correction burn whilst pointing to the left of the target to alter your course for a better intercept."}]}
