I\u0027ve just restarted my career to take advantage of the 1.0 release (now 1.0.2.842), and I\u0027ve run into a problem using one of the early parts.\n\nThis behavior MAY be intentional, but I don\u0027t think so.\n\nFirst, let the record indicate that I am running the Steam version of KSP on a Windows 8.1 64 bit installation. It is not immediately clear in any of the files I was instructed to look at whether the KSP installation is 32 bit or 64 bit, but the version number is clearly 1.0.2.842.\n\nBasically, I\u0027m using the \u0022Thumper\u0022 solid booster as a first stage to get my craft into orbital or suborbital trajectories in the early contracts where science and funding are thin on the ground. It\u0027s not usable as such because the engine is getting entangled in the grating on the Level 2 launchpad. It pulls free after a few moments or can be pried loose if you want to tilt your craft a few dozens of degrees off the vertical on the launchpad, but both come at the expense of a lot of wasted fuel.\n\nI have been able to get early access to the S1 SRB-KD25k \u0022Kickback\u0022 Solid Booster through a testing contract, which does not have the above mentioned problem. An obvious workaround would be utilizing the TT18-A Launch Stability Enhancer to lift the rig off the ground, but I did not prioritize the purchase of \u0022General Construction\u0022 and as noted above, science and funding are at a premium at the game start. If a player does not purchase it before \u0022Advanced Rocketry\u0022, and does not get a testing contract allowing them to use either the \u0022Kickback\u0022 or the TT18-A LSE, they are denied the use of Solid Boosters in the early game, which could be a major balance issue given the expense of Liquid Fuel Stacks.\n\nHere is a screenshot of the Test craft (designed to allow experienced pilot Kerbals to haul rich morons... I mean \u0022Tourists\u0022 into space. (Should probably ditch the Science Jr...))\n\n![1024x768.resizedimage](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/39748012118903076/EDF55E1375F5F7ADD7B5C9335AB795DD3F9C0AA5/1024x768.resizedimage)\n\nHere is a screenshot of the craft trying to lift off, but entangled in the grating.\n\n![F6C53B44F6B1ECD1CD239E29D20C37C973AA109F](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/39748012118908191/F6C53B44F6B1ECD1CD239E29D20C37C973AA109F/)\n\nAnd here the craft finally pries itself loose from the launchpad. Note it has wasted about a third of its 1st stage fuel to go 11.5 meters! This is not a problem with the weight as the craft gains speed quite rapidly once it is disentangled.\n\n![F232C0BE4A1478F041E0E88A40D0E9120875FD3A](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/39748012118912603/F232C0BE4A1478F041E0E88A40D0E9120875FD3A/)\n\nCraft File:https://www.dropbox.com/s/mswf5xx2qe8z5cb/Pseudo-Gemini%20Test.craft?dl=0\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/mswf5xx2qe8z5cb/Pseudo-Gemini%20Test.craft?dl=0\n\nSave File:\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/a8nre4dsop6utmp/persistent.sfs?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/a8nre4dsop6utmp/persistent.sfs?dl=0)\n\nDXDiag File:\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/0x17rdqen4uh9pv/DxDiag.txt?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0x17rdqen4uh9pv/DxDiag.txt?dl=0)\n\nCongrats to Squad, Felipe Falanghe and the KSP team on the official release and for all their great work!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-03T12:05:20Z\u0022 title=\u002205/03/2015 12:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Duke Leto**\n  \nSpelling Errors"},{"CreatedByName":"launchpad_liftoff","CreatedById":114538,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T13:18:28Z","Content":"This bug is in career mode. When the launchpad is level 1 all my small rockets launch fine as expected. After I upgrade the launchpad to level 2, the same rockets that launched fine before, appear to get stuck. After about 10 seconds of the boosters burning they suddenly launch very fast upwards. I have determined this might be because of the creases in the grate of the level 2 launchpad. The bottom edges of the boosters get stuck between the creases and the rocket doesn\u0027t take off until it somehow gets freed. This doesn\u0027t happen if I slightly readjust the position of the boosters."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T13:21:56Z","Content":"Its an old issue, collisions on 3D are never perfect and Squad have addressed this several times now, its one of the reasons we have launch clamps."},{"CreatedByName":"Duke Leto","CreatedById":142852,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T02:06:18Z","Content":"All right then, I\u0027d just repeat my science tree balance suggestion:\n\nMove the TT18-A Launch Stability Enhancer to either \u0022Start\u0022 or \u0022Basic Rocketry\u0022.

I hesitated to suggest this, since although it doesn\u0027t say anywhere that they are required for launchpad level 2, it doesn\u0027t say you need a parachute to land either, so it is the job of the player to consider getting stuck in the launchpad grate. That means that somewhere should be stated that it can happen and then let the player deal with it appropriately however they want, or simply unlock the launch clamps when upgrading the pad to level 2 (instead of having them in the tech tree) so the player can use them to launch rockets from then on if they need to. Also, the launch clamps go directly hand in hand with the launchpad (since you can\u0027t use them as *not* connected to the launchpad anyway) so I think providing them as a launchpad upgrade instead of a technology makes a lot of sense and works nicely.\n\nI haven\u0027t tried modding KSP, but if I had any experience I would make a mod that does what I suggested above if it is possible.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-04T08:30:15Z\u0022 title=\u002205/04/2015 08:30  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by launchpad\\_liftoff**\n  \ncorrection"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T09:37:42Z","Content":"We can fudge our own launch clamps as soon as we get any decouplers, by using stack decouplers as feet or using radial decouplers and modular girder segments, we can keep our troublesome craft off the surface.\n\nThe issue here is known as \u0022sticky launchpad\u0022 and is caused by the Unity engine colliders, coding around it only helped to an extent."},{"CreatedByName":"Grimm Spector","CreatedById":148772,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T19:01:32Z","Content":"Getting this in 1.04 with the starting launch pad and nothing can free the ship no matter what I do!"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T19:03:29Z","Content":"I\u0027ve had some luck with placing my rocket so the engines touch the floor of the VAB, also by moving the rocket to the side so it\u0027s on the concrete edge of the pad, not on the grille, as it is the grille that is \u0022sticky\u0022 (bad collider)."},{"CreatedByName":"OddFunction","CreatedById":143805,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T19:27:05Z","Content":"Have you guys tried any of these suggestions?\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/127580-1-0-X-Cross-Platform-Issues-Thread](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/127580-1-0-X-Cross-Platform-Issues-Thread)\n\nFind: ISSUES / FIXES:\n\nThen Find: [1.0.4] Tier 2 \u0022Sticky\u0022 Launch Pad \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 [PARTIAL FIX / PARTIAL ADD-ON FIX]\n\nWhich reads:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E This bug only strikes the Tier 2 launch pad with certain (mostly 30 ton\u002B) rockets where the engine nozzles rest directly on the launch pad.\n\u003E I have created a small, stand-alone add-on that fixes this bug.
