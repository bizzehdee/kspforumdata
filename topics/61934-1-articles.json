The ship would drift constantly while I was making the burn, and I had to keep it on course manually. I had enough torque/gimbaling to hold direction, but SAS just didn\u0027t want to do it. To make things worse, physical time acceleration didn\u0027t work either - it just made it impossible to keep it on course. I had to nurse the burns all the way, for 3hrs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout halfway through the first burn I was thinking to myself, Mechjeb would be so useful right about now. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdmittedly, the ship was wobbly (it was made from about 12 launches), but it was symmetrical, so it should have been balanced, but my point is if I can control it manually, SAS should be able to do the same.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn atmosphere, the new ASAS is good, and not having to press F all the time when turning is good. But out of atmosphere, you generally want to burn in one direction. Something to manage long burns in space (ie transfer burns) in stock would be good, or at least a way to get the old SAS behavior back for those long burns.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"leax256","CreatedById":57364,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-02T14:41:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Merinsan\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Merinsan\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell, I kind of do.

Since SAS doesn\u0027t know how much control authority it has to work with, it either under-controls on sluggish vehicles or over-controls on twitchy ones and a huge amount of vehicle design has to go into getting just enough control authority so that SAS is useful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like to see some type of interface that PartModules could inherit from that would allow those PartModules to report the amount of control they can apply. Ideally, that could be reported in the form a vector specifying the force for a full roll, yaw or pitch deflection; the moments can be calculated based on where the parts are located relative to the CoM, and by using vectors you can account for yaw-roll-pitch coupling as well. By telling SAS what it has to work with initially the control system will be able to converge a lot faster than it currently can and certainly without the risk of oscillations on very, very high-maneuverability vehicles.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
