To me, career mode is the \u0022challenge mode\u0022 you play once you\u0027ve cut your teeth in the sandbox. Unfortunately it does not, in any way, perform that role. There is no real challenge in career mode beyond massive mountains of grind (which isn\u0027t really a challenge). Time considerations, such as budgets, upkeep, and life support, would go a long way to providing actual challenge.\u003Cp\u003ELetting the player in on information is a great thing in a game about spaceflight.
