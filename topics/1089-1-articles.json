I see Orbiters, Spaceplanes, etc, but when I try to mount a liquid fueld rocket to one of the giant fuel tanks it doesnt work. I have to mount the command capsule on the 3m tank. I was wondering if a couple existed that allowed me to make a 1m liquid fueld rocket draw fuel from the giant tank, and then be able to ditch it like the shuttle does.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-26T21:14:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThey are working on getting fuel to flow across couplers sideways.
