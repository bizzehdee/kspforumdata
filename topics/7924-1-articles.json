Also thanks for letting me know not understanding the IDE is not all in my head. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know what an IDE is (integrated development environment) It takes XML or what have you and helps you script for a specific thing (like KSP environment) script might look completely different if it were for a bot, even if it\\\u0027s in the same language. I find that managing files, programs is a serious pain with these. I like to know where all my stuff is and it wants to lump it all together and whatnot. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA compiler takes what you wrote and turns it into a functional file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA program is a framework where you can script in if you make it that way.
