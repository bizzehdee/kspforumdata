This occurs on both Windows x32 and Linux x64\n\nIf I have two ships docked together, then un-dock them they will separate. If I dock them, switch to another vessel then back, they will not be able to separate after un-docking. They are considered separate vessels but they are stuck together.\n\nThe workaround I use now, is to un-dock, switch to another vessel and timewarp 5 to 10 minutes into the future. When I switch back they are separated and I can fly them normally. Time warping while one of the two vessels are active will show them drifting apart but once I leave timewarp they warp back together and collide/intersect and explode."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T17:51:41Z","Content":"If you are using KJR, then check the thread, and use a link (a few pages from the end of the thread) about finding the current dev version, which instantly solves the problem."},{"CreatedByName":"Rokmonkey","CreatedById":9319,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T17:57:23Z","Content":"Oh, it\u0027s a KJR problem?
