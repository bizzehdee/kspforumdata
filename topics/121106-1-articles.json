First time I came in for reentry was just mindblowing. And naturally because I\u0027m playing KSP again, I really want to start up my ETS playthrough again. However, because of just how incredibly awesome IVA is for me now, I really want to do it on video this time.

WMM isn\u0027t fancy, and if you get into making LP\u0027s or anything it\u0027s not going to be an acceptable long term option, but it\u0027s certainly capable enough of getting the job done quickly and effectively long enough for you to decide if this is something you want to keep doing, and if so, then look at a better editor, probably a paid program for windows, or a free option like AV Linux. The recorders listed can be a jumping stone too for people who decide this is something they want to do enough of, but OBS is certainly capable enough that many relatively high profile content creators are able to use it as their primary program (and it does make your life much simpler if you both record and stream). I can\u0027t say I know of anyone who has done the same with shadowplay, mostly because there are a lot more games it doesn\u0027t get along with than for OBS (there is an equivalent for AMD as well, whose name escapes me.
