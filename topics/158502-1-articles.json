I have multiple monitors, and would like to have 3 monitors for the 3 basic KSP\u00A0views. One monitor would be the normal external view. The other would be the map view, and the 3rd would be the internal or IVA view.\u00A0Would it be possible to mod KSP in a way that allows me to see all these views in different windows simultaneously?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-01T01:19:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI went ahead and moved this thread to a better home to ask this question\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"genericeventhandler","CreatedById":149557,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-12T12:37:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith kRPC you can have a browser window open with a map displaying. \u00A0And another with graphs and such.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know of anyway to get a different view onto another monitor though.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGEH\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/62902-122-krpc-remote-procedure-call-server-v038-29th-march-2017/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0026amp;comment=954093\u0026amp;embedComment=954093\u0026amp;embedDo=findComment\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-12T16:31:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith the version of Unity KSP currently uses it is hard to do it properly.
