I\u0027m using an older cfg file from Atomic Age, and it\u0027s pretty buggy. You can switch a tank to LF only in the VAB, but upon launch it now has the new value of LF, plus the original amount of oxidizer. If you revert to VAB you can manually remove the oxidizer and relaunch and it\u0027s fine in the numbers, but still shows the empty oxidizer value. So it\u0027s not broke, but something is off somewhere \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bedwyr","CreatedById":104239,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T16:33:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust to be clear by the thread title, firespitter should be considered compatible with 1.0 up to 1.0.2, correct?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StevenJ","CreatedById":114626,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T16:41:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bedwyr\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Bedwyr\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EJust to be clear by the thread title, firespitter should be considered compatible with 1.0 up to 1.0.2, correct?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes that is correct, it has some issues such as wings don\u0027t seem to be generating lift but other than that it works fine.
