You can counter this by either building a very heavy rover, which has some obvious drawbacks, or by mounting downthrusters, which can be low-thrust engines or RCS nozzles pointed UP, to push your rover into the ground and compensate for lack of gravity. This is extra nice when turning or changing gradient since those are the easiest times to flip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso don\u0027t neglect to tweak your wheels! It\u0027s very easy to overlook that you can and should adjust which wheels have steering and motor; a nice setup that feels natural is rear wheel drive/front wheel steering. This also saves on electrical consumption since only wheels with motor on drain batteries.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd for driving, my biggest tip is to watch it going over the tops of hills so you don\u0027t go flying, and not get carried away speeding downhill.

It\u0027s another rationale for providing some kind of down-force producing mechanism. Ions and RCS are the two methods I\u0027ve encountered over the years that folks recommend for that job. Ion thrusters have two advantages: one, an ion-based system can be set to run by opening up the throttle (instead of having to hold down a key to keep the RCS going - I haven\u0027t heard of anybody using an O-10 engine for this same purpose but I imagine it would work) and two: longevity - assuming you\u0027re deploying the rover on a world without an atmosphere, you get that awesome Isp. RCS\u0027s advantages - they come down lower in the tech tree, the parts are less expensive as a rule, and the power requirements are much lower.

I use KP8 for forward, KP4 and KP6 for turning, and KP5 for reverse. This greatly helps rover stability because it takes torque out of the process. If you keep using the WASD keys to drive, you\u0027re also using torque, which will tend to make your rover roll over or somersault. Also, you can now drive your rover with both hands, one for the rover itself (the numpad) and one for torque (WASD). This enables you to use 1 or the other or both simultaneously depending on the situation. Sometimes, especially in rough terrain on low-gravity worlds, the rover steering won\u0027t work because there\u0027s not enough traction, but you can pivot with torque. And even on high-gravity worlds, you can greatly reduce your turn radius using both at once. Finally, when you get airborne, you can use WASD to make sure you hit the ground at the correct orientation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlways have plenty of lights.

Use the rover\u0027s cockpit or inline probe core for driving and flying in space, and the core on the roof for landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep an eye on your ground clearance. Although you want the rover low and squatty, make sure that no structural part will touch the ground due to suspension flexing or tires going flat. Flat tires usually won\u0027t flip you unless they cause some fixed part to hit the ground. And don\u0027t make the rover so low and wide that the belly will drag when you go over the crest of a hill or the lumps on the crawler track at KSC. This is especially something to check if your rover\u0027s weight is going to change a lot during operation (like it\u0027s a fuel truck). Be sure to test ground clearance both full and empty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlways have a battery and something that will charge it slowly no matter what.
