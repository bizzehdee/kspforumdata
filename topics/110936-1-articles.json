AFAIK, there have been reports that a Kerbals Courage can potentially drop during a mission (this may have been a bug that was fixed), but if that\u0027s the case, then changing stats can be supported by the system. From there, I guess you\u0027d just need a new \u0027stat\u0027 called \u0027health\u0027 or something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving a doctor on-board your ship could potentially slow the decay of health, and having a \u0027clinic\u0027 module or something could be used to \u0027cure\u0027 \u0027sick\u0027 Kerbals, using a similar process to the Science Lab research function thing. Higher level Doctors could help keep more Kerbals healthy, or keep the ones that are there even healthier. Maybe a fully-leveled Doc could boost some of the others Kerbal\u0027s stats.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know if I\u0027d want my Kerbals to suddenly \u0027lose control\u0027 or anything like that... maybe a progressive reduction to their skill level or something? A sick level 3 scientist doesn\u0027t give as much of a bonus as a healthy level 3 scientist? Or a sick level 2 pilot might forget how to point prograde/retrograde?
