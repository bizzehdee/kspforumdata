And the prey species would likely evolve their technologies and societies significantly faster than the predator species, again due to numbers, making it more likely that in future the predator species is on the backfoot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-25T05:16:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs the prey species another predator in turn?\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf yes - no problem, humans were cannibals during the primitive times, but don\u0027t eat each other now.... erm... often.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf no - unikely a non-predator could become sapient, as it doesn\u0027t need an active seeking stragegy,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-10-25T05:27:33Z\u0022 title=\u002210/25/2019 05:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 25, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by kerbiloid\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-25T10:17:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI feel like the problem with this kind of co-evolution is that eventually one species will evolve and become much smarter than the other one (most likely the predator) so if the predators become better at hunting, their numbers rise higher and overwhelm the prey forcing the prey extinct.
