Wouldn\u0027t be much need for a custom message for the ESU, unless I have more than one on the craft, in which case knowing exactly which one just collected all applicable science might be useful as the message would differentiate between one and the other.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn conjunction with Kal1000 controllers, maybe a way to display screen messages whenever a certain relative or absolute position is reached on the controller track.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EWhenever I make a propeller-driven craft, I usually have a the torque max out at 25% main throttle, RPM max out on 50%, and anything above that is used to tweak the propeller\u0027s angle of attack to get better thrust at higher speeds. Having the game display a message upon reaching any of those points would be nice.\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nBeing able to confirm \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E status over a whole base without having the right click on processors and drills would be nice too.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe message editor must be available from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E at the very least, and possibly in-flight too.\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou could probably make a part and edit it to have a few (or many) pre-recorded messages which could be activated via action group, so that only one such part would be needed per vessel.
