I few weeks ago I put up a thread about people voting for my 100th post. And a few days after I accedentally posted my 100th post. *sigh* And then 1.0 came out... AND EVERY PLANE I HAD BUILT BROKE. So instead of me rebuilding the same things with some different wing design, I want to go back to my roots. The first few crafts I built were interplanetary probes, and I want to do something different. Something bigger. No longer shall I put off KSP and spend exuberant amounts of money on TF2. No... I shall build. Great spacecrafts. Space stations. AND EVERYTHING... that you guys vote for. This is no longer my 100th post celebration. This is our celebration. I will create the most amazing crafts (besides SSTOs because 1.0 isn\u0027t friendly to me and planes) and the largest, coolest, most semi-average Duna and Eve landers, and maybe even be able to go to Jool and never return because I suck at this game! This is a vote, and for every 3 votes per category, I will build one of that category. I suck at this game, but I will probably (not really) suck a little less and this game! Lets get started!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGo ahead and post below what you want of a specific category, and I will do my best to create and fly them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
