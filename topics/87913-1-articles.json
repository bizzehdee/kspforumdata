In other words. Kerbal Sweat = Rocket Fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConsidering some of the facial expressions that the kerbals have while riding/piloting some of the insane crafts I have built. This made me think they must be sweating themselves silly. Just a simple indicator of sweat produced based on the terror the kerbal goes through. Then methinks there should be a way to turn that sweat to fuel. So, here goes a mod to create a simple and fun fuel mining mechanic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbals will sweat each day just doing nothing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore fun/excitment = More Sweat \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESweat \u002B Material Science Lab \u002B Electric = Fuel \u002B Oxidizer \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would not create lots of fuel but anything is better than nothing. Current mining mods once in place seem kinda boring to watch them extract fuel from the ground. An amusement park with rides to scare the bejebus and sweat out of the kerbals would be an exciting and possibly dangerous way to gather a resource. Rocket sled with high G-force braking is an example.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore ideas to follow once this code skelton is up.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-22T19:10:14Z\u0022 title=\u002210/22/2014 07:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 22, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by MoeslyArmlis\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"worir4","CreatedById":75980,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-19T17:51:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKerbals don\u0027t sweat!
