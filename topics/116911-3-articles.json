Problem is, none of Yogui87s Lionhead mods have been updated since 0.25. I\u0027d be happy to maintain them. They are easy enough to update, seeing as most Lionhead mods are parts packs, which only needs minor re-balancing, node flipping and configuring the different engines.\n\nThat\u0027s be neat! You should message him. I already have an updated Probes pack that MeCripp provided me with, but you\u0027d have to talk to him about that.\n\nNo worries about that though, I think it\u0027s rather see these rockets done!
