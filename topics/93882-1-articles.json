I created an account to make a question on that section, but first I just wanted to say that, as a new player, I have found KSP to be just awesome. I started playing in .24.2 and have not stopped learning since. With .90 I started a new career, and it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s going beta than ever. The first absolutely cool thing I did was rescue Tomzer Kerman from orbit... without target indicators on the navball or closest approach on the map (hadn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t upgraded the building yet)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had rescued previous iterations of Tomzer many times. I was in fact one of the first things I tried when I got the game: you can imagine how that went. First, I tried to do it with and orbit in the opposite direction (east to west!) and was terribly frustrated. Later it became easy, once I learned to do proper rendevouz. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut on .90 I just accepted the contract and launched. Once I was in orbit, I discovered I had no targeting, no closes approach... I almost went back empty-handed, but decided to try it by eyeballing it and not loose the contract. To my own amazement, I managed to get my capsule to 1k of him... I switched to him, wanting to EVA the remaining distance... and then I went into the dark side of Kerbin!!! I couldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t see anything! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut now, Tomzer is my second best pilot, on level 2, and is currently in orbit around Minmus, as part of a crew that is going to build a station and harvest a crap ton of science of the little moon. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of that was so awesome I wanted to share it. This Christmas I am going to gift KSP to my little brother. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd this community is also great. The moders, the youtubers and the forum crowd, you (and now I myself, I guess) are all awesome. And Squad is just great: It will be great to be there for the arrival of KSP 1.0.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xacktar","CreatedById":88876,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-20T19:35:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the game!
