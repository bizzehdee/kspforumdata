So I would like to replace MechJeb with PreciseNode and some combination of info mods like KER and VOID. One of the info I regularly use from MechJeb is the phase angle to target, to launch directly to docking. The question is, does any of the info mods show the phase angle to target, or else is there an easy way to time my launches with the info they show?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think I need it to be really precise, but I\u0027m bad at estimating stuff from map view.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-08T10:36:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Envm\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E/10char\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-08T11:15:56Z\u0022 title=\u002211/08/2013 11:15  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 8, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by KerbMav\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maltesh","CreatedById":17144,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-08T11:00:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/21544-22-Protractor-Rendezvous-Plugin-v-2-4-3\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EProtractor\u003C/a\u003E will give you an angle that decreases to zero when the worlds are near the appropriate configuration for a Hohmann transfer.

I use this for launching stuff directly to my space station. So for each different ascent profile, I would first do a test launch into the target orbit. From the phase angle at launch, and the phase angle at orbit insertion I then calculate the phase angle where I should launch, and then if I launch at that phase angle, I can approach the station immediatly without needing a parking orbit or excessive amounts of delta-v. But since I\u0027m bad at judging that from looking at the map view, I either need the phase angle, or a reasonably easy way to approximate the timing with other information displayed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
