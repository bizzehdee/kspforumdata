In the Sun, pressure is very high so fusing temperatures are reduced (There is also the small matter that the fusing matter in the Sun is kept in place by gravity, which is not a containment option available here). Since we cannot generate such high pressures, much higher temperatures are required (about 100 million K compared to the Sun\u0027s core temperature, which apparently is estimated at only 15 million K)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Galacticruler","CreatedById":58398,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-03T00:31:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh, but wouldn\u0027t forcing them together with magnets work?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eare Deuterium and Tritium even magnetically influenced?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-03T00:37:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThey are when they\u0027re plasma, which they inevitably will be at those kind of temperatures, and that\u0027s how all fusion reactor prototypes work-trying to physically force it together with solid objects (if that makes sense...) would contaminate the plasma and rapidly make fusion impossible.

The gas is heated up using a variety of methods, principally large neutral ion beams that irradiate the gas with many megaWatts of energy. At high temperatures (100 million Kelvin) the atoms in the gas are energetic enough that the electrons are stripped off the nuclei; this is what characterizes a plasma. So there\u0027s a bunch of negatively charged free electrons and positively charged free ions in the vacuum chamber. At that point you create a 3 dimensional time varying magnetic field profile using huge coils that carry megaAmps of current. The magnetic fields cause the electrons and ions to rotate around the Tokamak in opposite directions; they follow helical paths that converge as they flow around the torus to form a solid mass of plasma, with a definite edge where denisty and temperature drop off dramatically. If you can get the ions streaming around the torus fast enough, they\u0027ll start colliding with each other, causing fusion reactions. Each fusion reaction produces a heavier ion that is more energetic than the combined energy of the ions that created it, so makes the plasma hotter, causing more fusions in a chain reaction that will engulf the plasma.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s how it\u0027s supposed to work. Roadblocks are plasma electrodynamics is still being studied; it\u0027s somewhat well understood but there are characteristics of the plasma that are still be probed and researched. For instance, it\u0027s not well understood how to best contain plasma disruptions. In high energy plasmas, simply collapsing them could cause damage to the tokamak surface. There are state transitions in the plasmas being investigated. The formation of instabilities called edge localized modes (ELMs) are still being investigated for their cause, mitigation, and utility. Materials research is ongoing. Current experiments have to be scaled up to produce any usable amount of power, and scaling up produces differences in kind, not just scale. There\u0027s a lot to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are also inertially confined fusion experiments, where high powered lasers are fired into small pellets of material to try to cause fusion reactions.
