Hmm since I don\u0027t eat beef, not a problem. Ok so I do eat buffalo (very little of it in fact, but I only eat small amounts of grass feed animals) but its forbidden here to feed them cultured crops so\u00A0 . . . . .\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.gracelinks.org/1361/the-water-footprint-of-food\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.gracelinks.org/1361/the-water-footprint-of-food\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere is a table: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/jan/10/how-much-water-food-production-waste\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/jan/10/how-much-water-food-production-waste\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1 kilogram of rice needs 2500 liters of water, if we consider the energy by density that is about 10000 liters per gallon of cooking oil, if the oil was made from converted starch with no loss of energy during the transition, that about 0.8kg of fat on the body.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEgg is a pretty good choice, its 196 liters of water. (57-60 grams per egg) = 3333 liters per kg of eggs. Better choice than beef, which is 15000 liters per kg. Better than chicken, pork, lamb\u00A0 at 4333 per kg, 6000, 10000, respectively, liters of water used per kilo.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe worst choice is chocolate, its apparently 17000 liters per pound, its largely fat, so its about twice as water hoggy as rice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBanana and potatoes are a better choice, but their water content is higher than rice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCorn, uses 147 gallons (558.6 liters) per lb of corn, a lb is 0.45 kg so thats 1228.9 liters (compares to 1600 for wheat, barley and rye). Woohoo I score on this one, I eat lots of maize. Dried beans, another native american food crop is 2200 liters per dried kilogram. A quarter cup contains as much protein as an egg, though I think beans and corn both need supplimental sources, so that egg is still in the water budget.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNone the less I still don\u0027t see where the 4185 liters/day is coming from, at least.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo this post is tangentially important here, lets say we cut this down to say 800 liters of water a day, this means for every person living in a mars colony if the food is sustainably grown, they are going to have to have something like 100 day supply of water for the crops they grow even if water is perfectly recycled, this means for every person they are going to need to find 80000 liters of water and a place to store maybe 30 percent (because water use shifts in the life of a crop). Things like having water for bathing is a triviality, The greenhouse where the crops are grown would need to be perfectly sealed, even from the bottom, a loss of 1% of the daily water need per day translates into 8 liters of water a day, if there are a dozen people in the colony you would need 100 liters of water generation per day just to keep up. This means something else, structures capable of retaining water (sill-plastic) will need to be brought from earth even if the materials to construct the rest of the greenhouse can be made on mars (aluminum, glass).In addition, prolly gonna needs some chickens, though the budge may not be as bad, since some of the crop waste can be used to feed chickens (ive even heard they eat waste from other animals, humans?). And pretty much if you raise chickens you cant tell the sex till there a certain age so at least some of the males and older females will be on the menu. That entails bringing chickens from earth to mars, you can incubate eggs part of the way, but at some point you are going to have little chicks floating around in space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-17T23:37:11Z\u0022 title=\u002212/17/2015 11:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by PB666\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"YNM","CreatedById":98447,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-18T00:40:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe figure is correct.

Much of that water is returned locally in the form of precipitation. Overuse for agriculture reduces and changes the pattern of soil hydration, droughts caused by climate change also alter this. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLakes Mead and Chad are examples of drought caused lowering, the aral sea is an example of overuse. In the case of greenland warming results in freshwater basins in the summer time.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn a greenhouse\u00A0i assume that the LED lighting system would be tuned to the exact frequency plants need and pulsed as to prevent photosynthetic saturation, thus minimizing the amount of transpiration. However plants grow bigger faster, low protein crops lose their\u00A0advantage for things like C4 (corn), so then the specialization would be into things like legumes. Quinoa is somewhat advantageous because its high altitude growth means the greenhouse pressure can be lowered, other high altitude crops may be selected.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222327122\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022128076\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221450399340\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022136352\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022micr0wave\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n9 hours ago, micr0wave said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1 liter of table water needs 1.5 liters water\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDont drink water at the table, lol.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AngelLestat","CreatedById":58968,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-18T12:52:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can not guide based on those numbers.

The same can be said of the Rio Grande river, if the US chooses to ration its use, Mexico will take what the US does not. The same can be said about the Western US\u0027s Colorado river.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI dont understand your main point with all this?
