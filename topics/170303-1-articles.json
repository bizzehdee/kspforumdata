I use\u00A0the mod \u0022[x] Science! \u0022 to keep track of everything I did.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I have to always collect two samples, one for the lab, and one for recovering, to keep track of everything I already collected. At first It appeared easy, but now it\u0027s turning into a nightmare to keep track of everything, and always take two samples. Sometimes I end with more samples for the lab or recovering, and have to see what is missing. This is preventing me to enjoy the game, or to use science auto-collect mods (because they only take 1 sample)\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:/\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/ZNGIcon1.png\u0022 title=\u0022:/\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nMy question is, is possible to edit the game\u0027s files to make the labs not destroy experiments when they are being turned into data, so I can recovery them later and keep track of everything I did?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso, would be nice if there\u0027s a way to prevent the same experiment being turned into data in two distinct labs, but this one I think is much harder to do with a simple .cfg edit.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI think this has something to do with the \u0022ModuleScienceConverter\u0022, but in the Labs .cfg there isn\u0027t nothing that seems related.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf someone could help me with this, I\u0027ll be immensely grateful!\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Blaarkies","CreatedById":153700,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-31T08:03:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe science lab is way overpowered for collecting science points.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWithout any science lab:\u003Cbr\u003E\n-If you collect everything, you will max out the tech tree before leaving Kerbin\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u003Cbr\u003E\n-If you play on hard, you will do that by catching a few extra samples around Eve/Duna.\u003Cbr\u003E\n-If you play it on super-duper-hard, you will max out the tree without needing Eeloo/Moho\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nMy point is there is a ridiculously large amount of science in Kerbin\u0027s universe.
