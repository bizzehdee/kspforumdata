Bright Saturn-style rings are made of ice and would be boiled away. You can actually calculate the Roche limit if you want to be realistic, but the math is probably a little much for this post.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond, Hot Jupiters likely have few, if any, moons, for the reasons stated above. \u00A0Stable moon orbits exist within a maximum of 30-50% of the radius of the hill sphere, depending on a number of factors. \u00A0This close to Kerbol, it\u0027s probably on the smaller size. They would be Gilly-like captured asteroids, anything bigger would have been destabilized by tidal interactions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThose same tidal interactions would keep a Hot Jupiter in an orbit with a near-zero inclination and eccentricity. It would also be tidally locked, so you could make one side hot and the dark side cooler. The dark side would still be toasty because the atmosphere would be pretty effective at moving heat there. \u00A0If you can figure out how to make a planet glow in the game, give the dark side a red glow. \u00A0If you know the temperature you can even calculate the exact shade based on blackbody radiation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s about it, though the migration of a Hot Jupiter from where it formed would be very disruptive to the inner planetary system. \u00A0If you want to accurize the rest of the Kerbol System, at a minimum I\u0027d delete Moho and turn Eve into an ocean planet, because the migration would drag a tremendous amount of volatiles with it. Any terrestrial planet that survived would be covered by oceans hundreds of kilometers deep.
