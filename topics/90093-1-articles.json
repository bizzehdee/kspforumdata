Please don\u0027t turn it into one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am however, looking for your personal opinions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI started playing KSP stock. I played it for quite a while, and even made it to Duna (albeit horribly so) stock. Then I learned about mechjeb and played with it for awhile. It has taught me a lot. I\u0027ve also installed Kerbal engineer redux. I really like the information it gives.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m starting to think that, for me at my current play level, mechjeb is just too much. However, I\u0027m still unsure about KER. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not really sure exactly what to ask. I\u0027m just trying to figure out whether KER is right for my current play style or if I want to try to go vanilla again. I haven\u0027t visited any other planets other than Mun, Minmus, and Duna. Do you feel like using KER to visit the rest of the planets would take away any long term sense of satisfaction? Or does everyone use it for long voyages?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, just kinda looking for your thoughts on KER or vanilla for my first \u0022play through\u0022 now that I have more of an idea of what I\u0027m doing. I suppose if I don\u0027t use KER I\u0027d just have to use a ton of charts for launch windows and stuff? Or would it be better to just play and try to figure it out?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frederf","CreatedById":3844,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-12T09:27:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt depends on what you mean by \u0022use.\u0022 The MJ \u0022take me there\u0022 button spoils the fun of course but any of the transfer window planners (KSP_TOT is amazing) simply allow you to tailor your rocket to be efficient which can add tons of challenge and reward. KER I admit I only use for pre-launch dV/TWR calcs. With moderate pre-planning the stock (or with preciseNode) nodes are more than enough. If you\u0027re at the level I think you are the tools replace paper and pencil calcs saving you time so use them. Pretend it\u0027s your own division of engineers. I wouldn\u0027t play as if I knew less than I did. Primitive\u0027s cuteness wears off sooner or later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven with a KSP_TOT snapshot solution you\u0027ll never hit it spot on anyway.

For finding windows you need another tool, I like Transfer Window Planner. You can also use a web tool like alexmoon.github.io/ksp/ to calculate them. Calculating transfers manually is a bit beyond my modest math skills, so I use tools without shame and don\u0027t feel any lessened satisfaction from interplanetary missions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-12T12:28:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf it somehow became impossible to get an in-game tool that told me the dV of every stage and the rocket in the VAB, I\u0027d quit playing because the game would no longer be fun for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suggest this: If you\u0027re getting frustrated with the lack of information in stock, give KER a try. If you like playing less with KER installed, uninstall it and go back to stock information displays. Neither is wrong, or even inferior.

Those readouts are sorely needed in stock. They don\u0027t take away anything for me. They add the satisfaction of being able to respond to real data (which I suspect real astronauts have) in real time. It makes precise piloting a lot more fun. I don\u0027t use MechJeb, but I do write kOS scripts. That\u0027s also a lot of fun, for similar reasons.
