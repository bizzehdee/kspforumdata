As long as you are fine with using NERVAs (don\u0027t know why but some people seem to hate them) there is one thing I could think of. Try sticking two R.A.P.I.E.R. engines on your craft, with a single LV-N in the centre. Then put the R.A.P.I.E.R. engines in an action group so you can toggle them on and off as needed. Usual ascent profile, except that you might want to stay in the lower part of the upper atmosphere a little longer than usual to gain some more speed low down, then use the atmosphere to kick you AP as high as possible, switch to the LV-N and point a little above your prograde vector. Then toggle your R.A.P.I.E.R. engines on and off if needed to keep your AP far enough ahead. Alternatively you might try using large solar cells and multiple PB-ION electric thrusters as these have insane ISP. However I don\u0027t think they will be enough to circularize, maybe if you combine multiple PB-IONs with a single LV-N you could use the LV-N when you need a little more uumph and the PB-IONs to get the additional orbital dV. Beware the long burn times with the PB-ION though. For the Xenon Tanks it might be best to hide them in a cargo bay so as to have them shielded from reentry and drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Also, welcome to the forums, hope you enjoy it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are looking for some inspiration you might want to check out [thread=90747]Wanderfound\u0027s Kerbodyne SSTO Division[/thread], he is like a dark magician for stock SSTO\u0027s or just head over to the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forums/20-The-Spacecraft-Exchange\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESpacecraft Exchange\u003C/a\u003E.

It took me a fair while before I was able to actually get them to work, and mainly that was through disassembling other craft and reading all the tutorials on the subject. If your 25T limit is exact, you can get away with either a combo Turbo-Rapier (attach a Rapier, then attach the Turbojet to the Rapier and use the offset tool to clip it in a bit). Or for an easier ascent, throw on two turbojets, and attach a couple of the little Rockomax 48-7S.

The three things you specify - a Mk2 Cockpit, a Mk2 Crew Cabin and an Inline Docking Port, come out to 4.66 tonnes by themselves. Now, since you\u0027re in stock, you can pull stock shenanigans; those three things can compose your fuselage in and of themselves (if you were going with, say...FAR, you\u0027d have to worry about making that aerodynamic - which actually isn\u0027t that difficult all told but still a bite in the backside).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo basic design process: your paywad is 4.66 tonnes. Assume 25% paywad fraction, therefore your final plane will weigh in the neighborhood of 18.64 tonnes - it\u0027s doable. Each RAPIER engine can lift 13 tonnes in stock, so you need 2 RAPIERs to do the job. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGiven that you\u0027ve got two RAPIERs, design your plane assuming they\u0027ll be lifting their maximum - so plan for 26 tonnes. 40 Units of LF times 26 tonnes - you need 1040 units of Liquid Fuel. 25 units of Oxidizer times 26 tonnes - you need 650 units of Oxidizer. There are several different single tanks that have that kind of capacity, but use whatever combination you want; any of the Mk3 fuselages or adapters would work, as would a X200-32, while none of the Mk2 fuselages would give you what you need with just a single part but you could do it with two or three. 26 Tonnes of plane, so 26 total lift coefficient; you\u0027ll need 13 pairs of Delta Wings/Wing Connector A/Wing Connector B. And you\u0027ll want six RAM Intakes, plus do all the normal crap required to build a spaceplane that won\u0027t want to fly backwards. That\u0027d get you to orbit, give you some room to fool around a bit, then land. And that\u0027s pretty much it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suppose you could go with Turbojet/24-77 combos. You\u0027d still need two Turbojets with 3-4 24-77s a pop; but then you could plan for thirty tonnes (Turbojets being able to lift about 15 tonnes in stock). You\u0027d probably wind up just as light, but with more power to you (those 24-77s would give you as much thrust as an LV-N, but they\u0027d be almost ten times less massive).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re in NEAR or FAR, I can\u0027t go into details since a lot of that will depend on the final shape of your plane. I\u0027m also still an amateur there. I think you could get it done with under 25 tonnes, but I\u0027m not 100% sure...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, what you might consider doing is adding a pair of FL-T800s/LV-Ns, which, like XRuler suggested, you\u0027d use simply as the interplanetary engines (the RAPIERs would be solely for the takeoff and landing portion of the flight). That would add 13.5 tonnes to your payload - so you adjust the numbers; your 4.66 tonne payload becomes an 18.16 tonne payload requiring a 72.64 tonne plane. I don\u0027t know if your 25 tonnes is a hard limit or not, but I won\u0027t go into details given that design constraint.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways - if 25 tonnes is a hard limit, you\u0027re probably going to have to give up \u003Cem\u003Esomething\u003C/em\u003E. At best with stock aero, your total payload is going to have to be 6.25-6.5 tonnes or thereabouts. With 4.66 in the Mk2 Cockpit, Mk 2 Cabin and Inline Docking Port, you\u0027ve got 1.84 tonnes for a fuel tank and engine. An LV-N by itself comes in at 2.25 tonnes, so those are out. Next best Isp in space is the LV-909, Aerospike or Poodle, and of those the 909 is the lightest, at 0.5 tonnes - leaving 1.34 tonnes for fuel. So maybe an FL-T200 plus part of an FL-T100. I don\u0027t \u003Cem\u003Ethink\u003C/em\u003E that\u0027s going to get you 1000 m/s of delta-V, but you might give it a shot to see anyways.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-23T13:41:40Z\u0022 title=\u002204/23/2015 01:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by capi3101\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheXRuler","CreatedById":125517,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T13:42:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust wanted to comment on capi\u0027s post, if you only add one LV-N you only add 2.25t, so you\u0027d add 8 tons in total, if I got capi\u0027s calctlations right. it would however give you a massive increase in dV, since it is more than twice as efficient in vacuum. I don\u0027t have much experience with stock planes (I have always used FAR), but I would think that turning off the RAPIERs as soon as you reach ~50km will give you a lot more dV for the same amount of fuel, thereby reducing total weight. Also, if you are using stock, replace the RAPIERs with two turbojet engines, as these have more thrust, and about 10 times the efficiency. Then stick on a bunch of intakes and reach ~2000m/s on jets alone, circularize with the LV-N and you should have a lot of dV left for orbital shenanigans. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAhhh stock aero-model you so silly ^^ Don\u0027t rely on that though as turbojet behaviour will probably change drastically with the 1.0 update.
