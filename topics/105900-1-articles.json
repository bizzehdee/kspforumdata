In the assembly building, a part is usually being highlighted with the cursor when the freeze suddenly occurs.\n\nCan someone please explain to me what might be causing this?"},{"CreatedByName":"Pipcard","CreatedById":2541,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T15:33:55Z","Content":"It still freezes randomly, even without Kerbal Engineer.\n\nFor example, I was trying to use the new resource mining system, and when I tried to click to change the time warp, it froze."}]}
