Reentry from high orbit (Mun return, for example) using aerobraking happens exactly as I would expect it to. Lowering the Pe to 25-30 km ensures safe and realistic deceleration (around 6 g), parachutes are not indestructible and provide much nicer, lower g, making them a bit more dangerous, which is awesome. There is still plenty of ablator on the smallest shield (when only pod and parachute are returning) which gives me confidence that it will be a viable procedure for return even from higher orbits.\n\nI haven\u0027t had the chance to test nukes yet, but I hear they\u0027re fixed as well.\n\nGood work SQUAD!\n\nThere are still a few crucial things that are missing from stock, mainly the stuff you get with KER.

I remember being a little put off by the first plane I ever designed, which was pre .90.\n\nIt was a small one engine thing it flew very well and I wanted to see how high and fast it could fly, I nosed up to a 45 degree angle then nosed up even further. When the engine finally died I went to map view to see how high I would coast. The Ap was in space forget the hieght but I remember making it to space at under 80k closer to 70K I think. \n\nI also find the update to make designing planes and SSTO\u0027s a little more intitutive. Jets lose thrust at higher altitudes, high aspect wing ratios cause more drag than lower aspect ratios at high speeds, build something that looks like it can fly it probally can reasonably well, you may need SAS to help out if you did not pay attention to COG, COL, and COT. I am actually finding it easier to design because it is now related closer to reallife. Sure there are still some things you can do to take advantage of how things are calculated and can get some crazy things to fly, which I think is a good thing. It is fun to build some crazy stuff that I like how it looks and \u0022cheating\u0022 to get it to work.\n\nOverall I am happy with this update, I am not sure about reentry heat. I set the difficulty to maxium and after 1.0.2 it seems you have to work at a craft failing during reentry. I can get parts to explode easily enough but I have tried some very agressive reentry angles with no ill effect. The only time I worried was when returning from the Mun and only had enough delta-v to get my PE to around 40k for return. Several orbits around kerbin and I started worrying my ablative was going to be gone during my final descent. It seems spending more time in spent in the atmosphere above a certain speed effects ablative wear. Which kind of makes sense to me it is the friction wearing it down pulling it and the heat it is holding away from the craft. Not sure if that is close to realistic but that is how I see it from my limited understanding of how this stuff works."},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T01:12:23Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E 1.0.1 and 1.0.2 are spot on!\n\nI\u0027m afraid they just aren\u0027t for me. 1.0 has sucked the life out of KSP for me. \n\nI guess it depends how you like to play the game.
