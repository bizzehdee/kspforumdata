Its predictions range from the existence of black holes, gravitational radiation to the cosmological models, predicting a primordial beginning, namely the big-bang. All these solutions have been obtained by first considering a plausible distribution of matter, and through the Einstein field equation, the spacetime metric of the geometry is determined. However, one may solve the Einstein field equation in the reverse direction, namely, one first considers an interesting and exotic spacetime metric, then finds the matter source responsible for the respective geometry. In this manner, it was found that some of these solutions possess a peculiar property, namely \u0027exotic matter,\u0027 involving a stress-energy tensor that violates the null energy condition. \u003Cstrong\u003EThese geometries also allow closed timelike curves, with the respective causality violations.\u003C/strong\u003E These solutions are primarily useful as \u0027gedanken-experiments\u0027 and as a theoretician\u0027s probe of the foundations of general relativity, and include traversable wormholes and superluminal \u0027warp drive\u0027 spacetimes. Thus, one may be tempted to denote these geometries as \u0027exotic\u0027 solutions of the Einstein field equation, as they violate the energy conditions and generate closed timelike curves. In this article, in addition to extensively exploring interesting features, in particular, the physical properties and characteristics of these \u0027exotic spacetimes,\u0027 we also analyze other non-trivial general relativistic geometries which generate closed timelike curves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EF.
