A normal-ish setup would have main engines firing at the same time as the boosters, although possibly at reduced throttle to limit speed to terminal velocity (if you have a fairly high overall TWR). Firing the main engines right from the start has the advantage of their gimballing being available to help keep you on course. That\u0027s assuming, of course, that the boosters are attached parallel to the main engine, not stacked below it. If you\u0027ve gone for stacked boosters, you\u0027ll need tail fins and possibly winglets as well, to provide the directional stability.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlexisBV","CreatedById":81911,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-10T17:37:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Murph\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Murph\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m also a little confused by you saying that engines are in stage 0.
