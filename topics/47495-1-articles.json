I mean, Kerbals don\u0027t have noses so I think it safe to say they don\u0027t breathe and only wear spacesuits for the pressure. They have no genders and when they die, they release a cloud of what appear to be spores. So I feel quite content in assuming they\u0027re some type of fungus that can go dormant for decades without any life support at all. They get in their seats, they go into suspended animation, and they wake up at the destination. Thus, I have no problem putting a Kerbal in a 1-man can and sending him off indefinitely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s also the fact that from the standpoint of rocket engineering, Kerbals are parts like any other, to be included in the design at the cost of their associated mass only if the mission requires their function. And Kerbals can\u0027t do very much. In vanilla, they can fix flats, repack chutes, and plant flags, in order of usefulness. And until the recent release of the new version of KAS, they couldn\u0027t do much more with mods, either. None of these tasks (even what the new KAS can do) requires more than average intelligence and a few minutes of training. So in my universe, Kerbalnauts aren\u0027t the elite, they\u0027re pressganged bums who get their training in LKO from short videos while waiting on their launch windows. The elites design the rockets, the rockets are flown by probe cores, and the Kerbals are just there for any menial labor the mission can\u0027t do without. My Kerbalnauts are thought of as galley slaves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, if I didn\u0027t need the Kerbals to do something at the destination, they wouldn\u0027t be aboard, so I try hard not to get them killed. But I do this by having my highly trained engineers design safe, reliable rockets that usually work the 1st time and program them to operate autonomously so Kerbals can\u0027t screw them up. And nearly all Kerbals are on 1-way trips to be the tire repairman on some distant world for the rest of their lives so there\u0027s usually no provision to bring them home, let alone save them with an escape tower. After all, the rocket will probably work and if it doesn\u0027t, the ever-expanding Kerb City has an ever-expanding population of bums under ever new bridge that gets built \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Panichio","CreatedById":2858,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-06T03:43:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI feel so horrible now, and probably with good reason, too.
