Just off the top of my head - performing an polar orbital scan allows you to access a 3D terrain model back at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E and pick a landing spot in your desired biome / elevation / slope, a bit like KerbNet. Perhaps you need to actually be on the surface and take samples to enable materials analysis and thus identify ore locations. Perhaps identifying exoplanets requires solar-orbit telescopes. Perhaps dropping a probe through the atmosphere allows you to measure the atmosphere density and gravity, giving you the right number of parachutes for a given lander and allowing you to model the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E requirements to get back to orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically, I find trial-and-error with real bodies quite tedious.

Real space exploration is done in baby steps with lots of research, modelling, etc but the first thing I did when I got KSP2 was strap together an Apollo-style Mun mission, blast off and aim to get Kerbals to the Mun. A half-dozen failures (and a dozen bugs) later, I had it - but I don\u0027t think that\u0027s the way it should go when you have a career mode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow71","CreatedById":210112,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-06-30T13:07:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt this point, if I\u0027m being honest...I don\u0027t expect much.\u00A0 It is the first feature on the roadmap, and they aren\u0027t telling us anything about it other than some hints in the AMA and a couple of new animations.\u00A0 Zero actual, tangible information about the direction they are taking this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn addition to that, Nate recently stated it was \u0022months away,\u0022 which puts this coming out no sooner than Q4...and quite possibly not until after the 1st of the year.\u00A0 My prediction is near the anniversary of EA release, and quite possibly not until after it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-06-30T14:03:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224295422\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022217025\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221687409631\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002273725\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Superfluous J\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 6/22/2023 at 12:53 AM, Superfluous J said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EThe below is not what I \u003Cstrong\u003Eexpect\u003C/strong\u003E from the science update.
