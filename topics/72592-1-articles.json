I have an avid interest for everything connected to space and exploration of it, the spark was struck in my elementary school days, so the demo immediately played the right notes for me when I picked it up about a week ago. I have to admit that I\u0027ve known of KSP\u0027s existence since 2012 (via Steam), but never got around to check it out. Am I glad I finally decided to do so!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the demo I went through all available tutorials and I experimented a lot with different rocket builds in Sandbox mode. Now that I\u0027ve got the full version, I\u0027m playing Career mode. Currently I\u0027m just about to launch my 1st mission towards Mun (orbiting only) to collect further science points. Looking forward to this next milestone!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will not post any questions or ask for tips in this first post, since a lot of them have already been answered, I\u0027m happy with browsing the threads in here and other parts of the forum. Anyways, enough for now, I have to get back to VAB and check if my engineers connected the strut connectors to the SRBs properly, so I don\u0027t see the \u0027jelly-effect\u0027 again, like it happened yesterday. (that was a lol/panic moment).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far, while in career mode, I have managed to keep the \u0027original-three\u0027 from harm. Jebediah, Bill and Bob are alive and well. But I have also recruited 3 other astronauts, who do the majority of the test launches. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-17T14:29:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the Forums, and I wish you the best of luck in your endeavors.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
