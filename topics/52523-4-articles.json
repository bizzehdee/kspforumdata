(as can be seen in the last two images of the album)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, that caused me to notice two things:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(1) The airframe flew nearly perfectly as a glider with just the RAPIER engine attached. This confirmed my strong suspicions that the problem was that she was a tail-dragger due to the combination of asymmetric drag (remember, in stock KSP, drag is proportional to mass- so your engines generate a TON of drag... pun intended...) and a Center of Lift that was too far forward to compensate due to the bugginess of Procedural Dynamics not adjusting the Center of Lift *AT ALL* for swept (like in my design) vs. straight wings... (I initially thought it was inverting the Center of Lift- but it turns out it just doesn\u0027t move it back if the wings are swept back...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(2) The damaged Raven showed it could still maintain a fine climb rate (and likely a high altitude ceiling) with just the 50kN of thrust from a single throttled-back RAPIER engine. Additionally, before the thing went nose-up, it had become obvious the limiting factor on the altitude ceiling was going to be the intake area, rather than the lift-mass/drag ratios of the craft (which were quite impressive- Procedural Dynamics seems to model aerodynamic forces increasing as the square of continuous wing area, like in real-life, by altering the lift coefficient depending on wing size... GREATLY rewarding the Raven\u0027s huge wings...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way, here\u0027s one more shot of the Raven at 18,000 meters with a still VERY nice rate of climb (I expect to make at least 27,000 meters at full throttle), and throttled to less thrust than the twin thermal turbojets (T3J\u0027s anyone? I think I\u0027m going to have to make that term a \u0022thing\u0022...) could provide at a lower altitude... (their thrust would have been even higher at this altitude) What all this says to me is that I need to make some design refinements...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/pa8Vw4n.png\u0022 alt=\u0022pa8Vw4n.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are my ideas:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(1) Consider moving the thermal turbojets to an over-wing position (an under-wing design will only make the tail-dragging worse, and have issues with colliding into bumpy terrain on rough landings) or one on the top of the fuselage further forward, since Procedural Dynamics has insisted on placing the Center of Lift much further forward than it should be...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(2) Consider whether I really need 2 thermal turbojets, or if just one would be superior. Two TTJ\u0027s may provide better thrust at lower altitude, perhaps even in the ranges relevant to low-altitude flying on Duna- but they will also just add extra weight if the plane can reach the altitude ranges where the same thrust could be achieved by routing all the intake air to just one thermal turbojet (for this reason, as well as avoiding asymmetric flame-outs, most of my high-altitude plane designs featured just one engine. I had no need for this design strategy with the OP\u0027d KSP-I atmospheric intakes with 4x the area of a Ram intake and no drag- but now that they are gone, I may be wise to go back to this weight and lag-saving design principle.) The extra weight will also make landing more dangerous and difficult by increasing the wingload...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll soon be turning out a Raven Mk2 after I decide whether I\u0027m better off with two top-mounted TTJ\u0027s (and perhaps a couple more intakes- I\u0027m currently at 1 inline and 3 radials for two engines- so maybe a 3:1 ratio with 2 more inline intakes...) or one tail-mounted TTJ.
