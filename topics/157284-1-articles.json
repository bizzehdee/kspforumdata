I will put every mission log into this! This will be most likely not that detailed and boring\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMission 1: Simple Rocket\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI created the save game, and because I can\u0027t do names, its called career(*sarcastically* yay, so exciting, best name ever, woo!) I went straight to Mission Control and accepted the Launch first vessel and scientific report from Kerbin stuff(watched videos to know to do that.) After, I went to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, I made the flea rocket, the only thing you can make at first. Launch! It went like anyone would expect(I did check staging), went up, down, landed. Science! Recovered the vessel and got 25 science, plus he funds from the missions and world firsts! I got the first 2 upgrades in the R\u0026amp;D and the survivability upgrade!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMission 2: Messier 1\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMessier\u00A01\u00A0is a rocket with reusable stages. Messier 1 is going to complete the testing of the \u0022Swivel\u0022 Engine and Mk16 parachutes. So, it is impossible to test both in the same flight, so I will have to do two tests. It also has a thermometer, goo, and barometer. \u0022Swivel\u0022 is the first contract. I now realize it is possible to do both, I get up to 30km and start falling to complete the mk16 contract. To complete it in time, I had to activate one parachute, then the other when I was slow enough. I decoupled the stage with the parachutes now deployed and activated the capsule parachutes. I did science about 400 meters above the ground and now wait at 4x speed to fall. Landed safely and now checking the engine stage, 62 meters above ground. Landed 1.5km away from Jeb. I gained 36.4 science from the recovery and 11 of it was from records, and contracts. Messier 1 is a success. With the science, I get the \u0022General Rocketry\u0022 upgrade, and have 16.4 science points left, that I can\u0027t send.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMission 3: Messier 2\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMessier 2 is a rocket that does not have reusable stages, it has two radially attached science units that decouple and fall separately from the capsule. It is planed to get to past 70km and use the radial decoupler to complete two contracts. The rocket got to 120km, even with it flipping quite easily, and not wanting to be normal. It will fall and when I get to 75km, I will decouple the Science units, and hope that they don\u0027t burn. Time warped to far, then it turns out the science units where connected to the vessel, not decouplers. I switched the first stage engine for a \u0022Swivel Engine\u0022 and reconnected the science units to the decouplers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMessier 2.5 is the same rocket with some different things (see line above). It already has performance better than the Messier 2, with no flips at over 400m. 4km and still good. I am not doing a gravity turn as I won\u0027t have the fuel to get out of the atmosphere. Staged. 232km is the Apoapsis. I forgot to do High Atmosphere science, so I will launch science units separately. One at 75km and one at 60km-65km. Everything has survived reentry, but I missed the 70km mark and didn\u0027t complete a mission, will do it next time. Everything has survived landing, except any and all heatsheilds. I have gained\u00A070.9\u00A0science! I get \u0022Basic Science\u0022 and one other upgrade.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMission 4: Messier 3\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMessier 3 is the same rocket, with added science modules. 2 meters up I use the new Science Module thing and already will gain 17 science from it. 22 Science from upper atmosphere! 25 Science from Low Space. 6 science from Contract of radial decoupler.

I upgraded the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, and Launchpad to make it possible to make the rocket have science and able to deorbit. Launch is ready. I realize there is no \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E modules so I go to add some, the only \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E modules I have are the Mk 1 Command Capsule. Rocket Fails to launch, forgot to do some things, Added more fuel and some SRBs. First 30 second good, then I flip. Restart. The next launch goes 200% better. I get to an orbit, but not one I was expecting, I had so much \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E, that I got into an elliptical orbit! I decouple the Probe and let it do its orbit, and I go back to sub-orbital and decouple my science. Now here is where it went bad, due to poor planning, I forgot a heatsheild one the command capsule, so It is stuck in orbit, with no more fuel(used to get capsule back to a more circular orbit.) I will have to pick up Jeb on another mission. My science drowned too...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRobin 1 is an aircraft with some 0.625m parts that are tweakscaled bigger.

I added Science Modules after the first launch... It does not take off without smooth ground, and I forgot I can\u0027t do airplanes, so I blew up and only gained 16 science.
