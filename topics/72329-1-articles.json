For me it would have to be when I discovered how to make wing airfoils for stubborn airplanes that don\u0027t want to lift off, I would post screenshots but my screenshots folder is all messed up, and I\u0027ve also implemented the use for modular girders too, I love to use them for mounting engines and raising my tail a few degrees so it looks nice, on the engine subject, I had also replicated a few V12 piston plane engines, it has no use at all really, but it looks really cool. But back to girders, I use them for an array of things, I like to use them also for water float mounts too, I know that sounds silly, everything that touches water just vanishes right? Wrong! If you\u0027re slow enough to land on the 1x1 metal plates you\u0027ll be fine, but suspend them far enough under the girders so you don\u0027t break them or anything, but anyways, have you discovered anything interesting that you would like to share with the community? I\u0027m always looking for more things to use on my airplanes. Go ahead and post your discoveries below, I\u0027d love to hear what you have. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-14T05:02:31Z\u0022 title=\u002205/14/2014 05:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 14, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by LtHeckard\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
