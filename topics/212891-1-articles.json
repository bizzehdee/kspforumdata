I jettison them Normal to the plane of the orbit, then modify the orbit of my deployment vessel for a 2:3 resonance orbit. When I warp back to apo it\u0027s like the main vessel passing by the deployed vessel has some bizarre gravitational effect that drags the deployed sat into a weird highly elliptical orbit. The little deployed sat had been in a nearly perfectly circular orbit ever so slightly inclined from the parent craft due to the deployment force, has no motors other than \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E, and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E was turned off for it - so it shouldn\u0027t be under much force ata ll. In this most recent case I was in a high orbit above Minmus (around 1K km), so it\u0027s not like Minmus would have much effect. I saw the same thing while deploying sats around the Mun. Sometimes all goes well, sometimes I slingshot the poor little com sat right out of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
