No stealth in space, and any competent space warship commander will have dozens of backup sensor systems and will deploy a fleet of drone spacecraft, far from the battle, that all also have sensors. They will, at a minimum, scan 100% of the sky in infrared at least once a minute so you cannot be surprised by anything under thrust. The drone spacecraft sensor net will all relay their data to the mothership, and will also give you views from other angles, so even if someone manages to mask their emissions in a narrow cone, they will be seen still. \u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s just not gonna happen.

I\u0027m saying it\u0027s going to be literally the very last system to fail. Especially since radios are also light and cheap, and a space warship would be receiving a constant telemetry feed from as many as dozens of other small spacecraft, all updating the sensor picture as seen by the space warship\u0027s control systems.\u003Cp\u003EAnd that\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Etoday\u0027s\u003C/em\u003E technology.

Specifically, both high velocity kinetic guns and lasers need enormous electricity supplies or they don\u0027t work. And the only energy source that makes any sense in an environment where every gram costs you propellant and money is nuclear. You punch a hole in one of the gigantic magnets that are part of a fusion reactor, or put a few holes in the primary loop for a fission reactor.

But let\u0027s analyse this thing a bit more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, light lag. Barring radical stuff (i.e: old Einstein still rules), that means anything more than a light-minute out is completely out of the picture: the data they send you is at least two minutes old, and who knows where has he moved since then. So, only stuff light-seconds away can offer you clear picture of the battle in real time. Remote satellites can warn someone is coming, and when he\u0027ll be there, but they can\u0027t help you take him down unless they also join the fight, in other words.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, \u0022cheap sensors\u0022. First, I\u0027m not even going to touch active radar, because that not only can be defeated both actively and passively, it\u0027s like painting a really big target on your sensor system. So I will only analyse passive optical systems. Cheap or not, those things need mirrors to concentrate the radiation, in whatever form it takes, down to where they can resolve fine detail thousands of kms away. That imposes hard physical limits on their size, first of all (interferometry is a thing, yeah, but in the end you still need the same area). And there the issue that something that can burn at thousands of kms a very tiny spot, is a huge flashlight a hundred meters across at a \u003Cem\u003Ehundred\u003C/em\u003E thousand kms. You don\u0027t need to get a consistent lock, you don\u0027t need a humongous mirror to focus the beam: just shine your laser flashlight at more or less their direction, and eventually every passive uncovered sensor gets blinded when the laser shines over it. Those beam spot can cover the whole surface of your ship, at what may seem a low power for a weapon against a hull, but more than enough to fry any sensor embedded there. Without uncovered, functional, \u003Cem\u003Every cold\u003C/em\u003E sensors, you can\u0027t do the enemy the same favour...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut of course, your main point, distributed sensor networks. That\u0027s a good one, really, but just the same, it\u0027s just something the enemy can \u003Cem\u003Ealso\u003C/em\u003E do: distribute low to high power lasers in the same sphere of engagement (again, a few light-seconds) around the high-value targets, and have the drones fight for sensor dominance until one of the sides is completely blinded. \u003Cem\u003EThen\u003C/em\u003E the big guns move close to finish the job. I know I often talk about \u0022dashing captains\u0022 and \u0022ships\u0022, but as I said in the other thread, the fragile humans should be relegated to C4IR positions far form the real action: this thing will be slugged out by \u0022short\u0022 range drone weapon platforms, forming a constellation of distributed offensive/sensor capabilities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune.

I know, from my personal knowledge of physics and engineering, and the arguments given here, that \u003Cem\u003Eultimately\u003C/em\u003E laser weapons are the only way to go, because there is no way to stop the beams and if at least 2 beam frequencies are in use, no way to reflect them. However, I also know that the enormous pieces of equipment, weighing thousands of tons, needed to generate and focus even soft x-ray beams may mean there is a brief period of time before anyone invests that much money where simpler kinetic weapons may rule the day. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. I know, again from both personal knowledge and the arguments give, that there is not any stealth in space except around the handful of places in space that give you cover, such as large planets. The rest of the time, it\u0027s a wide open battlefield, and range is king. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The more efficient the rocket engine you devise, the \u003Cem\u003Ebigger\u003C/em\u003E the flare of infrared light you must emit in order to use it. This is because kinetic energy of your rocket exhaust stream scales with the square of the exhaust stream velocity. Ergo, if you double ISP, you must quadruple the required energy, and a rocket exhaust stream has low entropy compared to the power source driving it. This means you \u003Cem\u003Emust\u003C/em\u003E have gigantic heat radiators in order to use any kind of high performance rocket. This is why even the mediocre performance space shuttle RCS plumes can be seen from the asteroid belt, and a nuclear thermal rocket would be visible from anywhere in the solar system. And don\u0027t even think of cloaking a fusion or antimatter drive, either of which will glow like a star.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can\u0027t get into weapons range of someone if you don\u0027t maneuver, and the moment you maneuver, \u0022bloop. contact detected, no IFF, mass estimate is warship class. Shall I arm weapons, commander?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo from my perspective, the arguments are resolved. I have not seen any arguments from a poster that are supported by actual facts and knowledge to dispute #1 and #2.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-29T21:41:44Z\u0022 title=\u002209/29/2015 09:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SomeGuy12\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GeneralVeers","CreatedById":148918,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-29T22:56:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SomeGuy12\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SomeGuy12\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWedge, the fact is, some of the posters on this forum know what they are talking about\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYup.

Yet I still figured out that the Number One rule we humans (should have) learned from world history is that what is true in theory frequently doesn\u0027t work in practice. Human beings have tried out all kinds of fancy weapons that sounded great in theory and on the blueprint, which when tested in the field turned out to be abject failures. On the flip side, there are weapons that look incredibly stupid and foolish--but work! Bottom line (and if you actually do have a college education, you should know this already) you cannot prove something as fact unless you \u003Cstrong\u003Etest\u003C/strong\u003E it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaser weapons in space?

Your example (RCS thrusters from Mars) uses a civilian object that\u0027s not trying to hide itself. Modern stealth aircraft (and also the A-10 Thunderbolt, which is obviously not a stealth-class plane!) already use various methods to vastly reduce the infrared signature from the engines. Two of the simplest methods of reducing infrared signature? Fly at lower velocity and bury the engines inside the fuselage so the engine flare can\u0027t be seen from any direction except straight to the rear. The A-10 Thunderbolt has its rear control surfaces right around the engine exhausts, blocking your view of the exhaust flares from below and to the sides, making it extremely difficult for a defender on the ground to get a missile lock. Humans already know the basics of stealth in space. We won\u0027t know until we test said basics, but enough has already been done with real planes that we can apply the label \u0022reasonable doubt\u0022 to your claims. Civilian ships are so easy to spot because nobody cares; military engineers will make a specific effort to prove folks like you wrong, and we have no idea how successful they will be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStrategy and tactics is something that\u0027s already been tested on real-world battlefields.

No amount of technical trickery can obscure this, you might as well say \u0022and then we invent anti gravity\u0022 as an explanation for why you think there will be stealth in space. You merely need several observer stations with IR detectors and the ability to sweep the entire sky. The reason you need several is that yes, someone could perform maneuvers if they knew where the observer was and were precisely in line with the sun. Similarly, it\u0027s vaguely possible to hide with a cooled front plate, if you aim it right at the target you are trying to sneak up on, so you need observers located at other angles to spot this trick.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour post indicates that you don\u0027t in fact have any such education, or you forgot what you allegedly know.
