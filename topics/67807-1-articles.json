It\u0027s pretty easy for beginners though - here\u0027s what you do:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Once you\u0027re in orbit, go to the map screen and tilt the camera so that you\u0027re looking at Kerbin\u0027s North Pole. Target Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Turn the camera until Minmus is in at the three o\u0027clock position.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Set a maneuver node at the six o\u0027clock position and pull prograde until the orbit indicated touches the orbit of Minmus from that perspective. If you\u0027re lucky enough to get an encounter by pulling prograde, great; just do that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Assuming you didn\u0027t get an encounter, place another node at either the ascending node or descending node, whichever one you come to first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4A) If the node is past about a third of the way to Minmus, stop, delete your node, wait one orbit and try again. Do this as often as necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Here you want to to pull normal or anti-normal; you want the value of the node to go down to zero, or at least to 0.1 or 0.2. Once it\u0027s there, you should see the close approach chevrons. Pull the prograde/retrograde markers until you get an encounter. If you still don\u0027t get one, pull on the radial in/out markers, or fiddle with the positioning of your nodes until you get an encounter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) With your two nodes set up, burn as indicated. Be willing to re-do the second node after the first burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027ll get you there in the early going. Later as you gain experience, you can start attempting to combine the inclination and transfer burns into one. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat just occurred to me is this -\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Get in orbit, go to the map screen, target Minmus as above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Set up a maneuver node any old place along your orbit. Pull prograde until 930 m/s is indicated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Move the node around until a Minmus encounter is indicated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) If have sufficient time, burn as indicated. If not, try again in another orbit/half-orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s going off the latest delta-V map that says you need 930 from a 70k orbit to a Minmus transfer, and unless I\u0027m mistaken moving the node around will ensure that you find one of those spots where the burn occurs at the node.
