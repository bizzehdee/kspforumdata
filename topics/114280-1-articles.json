I don\u0027t know the technical term. :|) car was overheating. I\u0027ve got two different repair manuals for two cars that are not the model of the car I\u0027m attempting to \u0022fix\u0022...\n\nHere\u0027s what I\u0027ve figured out and done so far before it started thunder-storming:\n\n- The coolant level was in the right spot\n- The top of the coolant tank where the hose comes out of was corroded\n- The inside of the cap on the other side of the hose (where it enters the grill area, I believe) and the place where the cap screws in are corroded\n- The coolant/water inside the tank was rusty\n\nI flushed out the tank with a garden hose to get rid of the rusty water and cleaned as much of the corrosion away as I could. Still need to run the car for a while to see what happens.\n\nDo any of you guys have some pointers?"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T19:59:33Z","Content":"The waterpump might be stuck preventing the water to be circulated.\n\nThe radiator fan might be broken, not cooling the water enough.\n\nThe radiator fan switch could be broken not switching the fan on.\n\nThe radiator thermostat could be malfunctioning not sending the water through the radiator to be cooled.\n\nThere are many reasons it runs hot.

You will need to get a radiator cleaning compound from a car accessory shop. follow the instructions and after you drain the water, which should be very rusty, repeat the process with more compound.

Make sure the replacement part is of the proper temperature for the engine (check specs).\n\nThe water pump; If you can turn it by hand (might need to loosen the belt(s) first), then that\u0027s not the problem. If you can\u0027t turn it, a jammed or frozen impeller is likely ... I find them an easy swap, like the thermostat, you\u0027ll need a replacement gasket and go visit an auto junk yard for a replacement pump (used are usually just fine, cheap too).\n\nRadiator fan is an easy check; If the car\u0027s hot, it should be running. If not, check the fuse panel first. Another related problem would be the temperature sending unit/switch; That\u0027s another easy fix (usually), if you can get to it. If all else fails - the fan could be shot.\n\nChecking the radiator core is a bit more difficult. That\u0027s really something you should let a shop do. If it\u0027s clogged, they might be able to clean it out - and then pressure test it, especially if it\u0027s badly rusted. I think more-so than the fan, the radiator core will likely be the most expensive repair issue.\n\nBeen there, done that, many times ... skinned knuckles to prove it lol.\n\nGood luck. ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T21:07:33Z","Content":"I once replaced a radiator fan that went out....the new one still didn\u0027t work.

One in the radiator fan, and one near the engine block.\n\nAs others have said, check the thermostat - take it out (cold) and drop it in a pot of water at or just above the marked temperature. If it doesn\u0027t move, bin it.\n\nLeaks are a problem, leaks around the hub of the (presumably belt driven) fan may well be from the water pump seals / bearings as it\u0027s often driven on the same shaft. - Hint: most water pumps have a \u0022telltale\u0022 hole in the bottom of the housing where the shaft exits, if it\u0027s leaking water here the seals are shot.\n\nIf it\u0027s not the water pump, it\u0027s probably from the bottom hose (easy) or radiator core itself behind the fan somewhere... Which does not bode well for the condition of the radiator as a whole.\n\nAlso check the heater connections/hoses, as they are a *very* common source of leaks.\n\nUse a radiator flush compound, then try \u0022back flushing\u0022 (reverse direction to normal coolant flow) until no more rubbish comes out. Getting rid of the rust may of course exacerbate leaks.\n\nThere are products that claim to \u0022plug leaks\u0022 in a radiator from the inside, but they\u0027re a stopgap measure and may cause more problems than they solve - by \u0022plugging up\u0022 things that shouldn\u0027t... \n\nIf it\u0027s leaking from the radiator where you can get at it, you may be able to solder it up the old-school way - but YMMV with a modern vehicle.\n\nAny DIY radiator repairs are, of course, just until one can find a replacement at a reasonable price ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nMinor leaks shouldn\u0027t cause the engine to overheat alone (provided you keep the coolant topped up), but they may be indicative of a more systemic problem - heavily corroded cooling galleries and/or radiator passages.\n\nHas it had a proper glycol (antifreeze) mix in it? Modern cars with alloy heads pretty much require it for it\u0027s corrosion inhibiting properties, and it\u0027s a good idea even in an old cast iron beast.\n\nOne other thing that may cause overheating is a blown / leaking head gasket. Top it up, make sure all the belts are in place and run the engine with the radiator cap off. Check for bubbles or oil in the water, and water in the oil. Either of these probably means replacing the head gasket and checking the block / head for cracks. \n\nA compression test or a \u0022leakdown test\u0022 should be done if you suspect this is the problem.\n\nJust to muddy the waters further, a flogged out water pump seal can also draw air into the system with similar results - make sure this is ok before getting more serious.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-27T11:07:34Z\u0022 title=\u002206/27/2015 11:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by steve\\_v**\n  \nThermostat first, most common."},{"CreatedByName":"Dispatcher","CreatedById":78707,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T03:41:39Z","Content":"All the above is good advice.
