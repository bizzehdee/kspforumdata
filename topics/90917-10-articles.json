The target object was considered \u0022class C\u0022 with mass of 132 tons, so the crew was quite confident of success. The launch was pretty boring, with Jeb actually snoring through the whole thing. The orbital adjustments required for successful rendezvous took quite a few days to line up, but the crew managed to acquire their target and set up an intercept after eight days MET. Another two days of further adjustments brought the crew into visual range of their target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe crew quickly realized this ship wasn\u0027t well designed for capturing an asteroid, as it lacked fine maneuvering jets that would have made the grabber maneuver a bit less of a bone jarring jolt. Also probably would have been more successful on the first attempt rather than requiring several attempts. But eventually they did attach to the asteroid using the grabber unit and began the slow process of bringing the asteroid into an elliptical orbit around Kerbin. The original plan was to put the asteroid in a circular orbit in LKO to facilitate easier access for the scientists to further investigate. Unfortunately the ship lacked the necessary delta-v to accomplish a circular orbit, so an elliptical orbit was considered good enough, with the periapsis of 100km. Again the poor design of this ship made the orbital adjustments much more tedious due to the lack of stability between the mass of the asteroid vs. the mass of the ship itself. The slow burn to correct the orbit required nearly two additional days, but eventually they were successful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith these lessons learned the next time the KSC controllers plan an asteroid capture mission the crew will be better prepared.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/BtbEQ\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

After detaching the transfer stage the crew performed a full check out of the lander. After a little more than 1 year after leaving Kerbin the crew was prepared for the final stage. Bob brought the lander into position for final descent to the surface, fired the engines to decelerate enough to dip into the thin atmosphere, and began preparations for landing. The jolt from the opening parachutes reminded Bob that he was only minutes from touching down on the surface.

Launch was smooth and the two space craft lined up for a successful docking. After additional science activities in orbit the crew prepared for return to Kerbin. Step one involved ditching the lander in orbit, then a maneuver engine burn to leave Duna SOI for eventual maneuvers for returning to Kerbin. Several maneuvers along the journey brought the crew safely back to Kerbin SOI and after 2 years 254 days it was time for additional maneuvers to bring the space craft into orbit around Kerbin. Final preparations for landing went quickly and before much time had passed it was time to return to the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/ixj5r\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
