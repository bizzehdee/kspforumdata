It has a lander with Lf\u002BOx tanks, but my main ship is nuclear powered and has liquid only tanks, so being able to direct the ISRU output to only the lander tanks or only the liquid tanks for the nuclear engine would save a lot of time manually transferring fuel (also trying to manually balance Lf and Ox is kind of a nightmare).\n\nI would prefer a way to do this on stock but would be interested in any mods that can do this (TAC fuel balancer maybe?)\n\nThanks!"},{"CreatedByName":"Jarin","CreatedById":71395,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T04:42:54Z","Content":"Try disabling the tanks you don\u0027t want it to fill. Right-click the tank, so it shows the fill bar, then click the little green arrow on the right, turning it to a red blocked symbol."},{"CreatedByName":"katateochi","CreatedById":35181,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T06:25:32Z","Content":"yeah Jarin\u0027s suggestion is right. Lock the oxidizer on the tanks for the nuclear engine from the tanks\u0027 context menus. You can do that once in flight, and you can also set that up in the VAB so if you\u0027re launching it again you won\u0027t have to set it each time you launch.\n\nAlso, run liquid and oxidizer conversion separately (don\u0027t use the Lf\u002BOx option on the converter, use the two separate ones instead). That way if one fuel type fills up first, it won\u0027t stop producing the other."}]}
