I had done the Go for Orbit Mission successfully using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E and then went back to try it again with manual control, which was just after 1.12 had been downloaded. Was going OK, but when I dropped the lower stage the capsule went violently out of control. I concluded this was my reactions not being quick enough, so I tried again using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E, and got the same result when I separated from the lower stage. I\u0027ve tried it a couple of times now and every time after staging the mission terminated with a message that I was far off course. Once there was a very strange occurrence where the lower stage didn\u0027t separate cleanly, it separated a little bit and then hung there for a while before dropping off entirely. In all cases \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E was engaged, in target mode and seemed to follow the target OK.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m also having a problem with To the Mun Part 2 mission, but since I\u0027ve never done this successfully before 1.12, that may just be a problem with what I\u0027m doing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m concluding that this is a regression in 1.12 - can someone else try the mission and confirm my results ?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"James Kerman","CreatedById":160462,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-06-26T12:13:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forum \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/212386-fritz-meissner/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022212386\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/212386-fritz-meissner/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Fritz Meissner\u003C/a\u003E, your post has been moved from KSP 2 discussion to here, a great place to ask questions about gameplay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rhomphaia","CreatedById":2440,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-06-26T12:54:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223995529\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022203339\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221624709613\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022160462\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022James Kerman\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n28 minutes ago, James Kerman said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forum \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/212386-fritz-meissner/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022212386\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/212386-fritz-meissner/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Fritz Meissner\u003C/a\u003E, your post has been moved from KSP 2 discussion to here, a great place to ask questions about gameplay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot really a gameplay issue as such, just had a look and it seems the rocket used in this tutorial is bugged.\u00A0 noticed some z-fighting around the decoupler in question.\u00A0 it has been moved up so it is at the top of the terrier, clipping through the shroud, when staged it collides so cant separate. either knocking the craft violently or getting stuck.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is also some z-fighting noticeable around the join between the 400 and 100 tanks\u00A0this doesn\u0027t cause any issues though, but something has gotten out of place\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"James Kerman","CreatedById":160462,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-06-26T13:03:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/2440-rhomphaia/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u00222440\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/2440-rhomphaia/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Rhomphaia\u003C/a\u003E, this issue has been moved to tech support.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fritz Meissner","CreatedById":212386,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-06-26T14:51:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223995538\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022203339\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221624712083\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u00222440\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Rhomphaia\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Rhomphaia said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot really a gameplay issue as such, just had a look and it seems the rocket used in this tutorial is bugged.\u00A0 noticed some z-fighting around the decoupler in question.\u00A0 it has been moved up so it is at the top of the terrier, clipping through the shroud, when staged it collides so cant separate. either knocking the craft violently or getting stuck.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is also some z-fighting noticeable around the join between the 400 and 100 tanks\u00A0this doesn\u0027t cause any issues though, but something has gotten out of place\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for looking.
