Having more makes sense if you do simulations, serious video-editing, run VM\u0027s or do other advanced stuff. On the other hand, having more RAM is unlikely to hurt anything, so why not? If the builder website is accurate regarding the motherboard, it supports up to 64 GB. No way you are going to fill that up \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EEdit:\u003Cp\u003EOk so an unexpected problem has arisen. As I said my current set p consists of a laptop which connects to the internet via WIFI. To a modem in a completely different part of the house to my office. Running an Ethernet cable across the house and my office doesn\u0027t have a phone line connected to it. This basically leaves me with the only option being wireless. Does anybody have any advice on how to set this up with my new computer? \u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want a stable, reliable and fast connection, getting a cable is by far the best option. Sending your stuff through air is convenient, but a compromise in a lot of ways. Cables win out almost every time, unless you use a shoddy quality cable over a long distance. Get a good, properly made cable and your experience will be superior to anything else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDepending on your technological inclination, you might consider \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.pccasegear.com/index.php?main_page=index\u0026amp;cPath=200_1348\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eethernet over power\u003C/a\u003E. It is not very complicated, but has some ifs and buts that need to be taken into account. With ethernet over power you make use of your existing power infrastructure via your power outlets, removing the need to pull cables. Not as good as a dedicated cable, but better than wireless communications. If running cables is really not an option, I would recommend looking seriously into this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen that absolutely, positively is not an option, you need to go wireless. There are different approaches, but some are obviously better than others. The best option is to get a card that you put in the computer yourself (or have it put in, if that has your fancy). This is where the compact size of the motherboard starts hurting a bit, because you obscure part of the air intake of your video card. I would probably opt for a as compact as possible PCI-E 1x card with a modern wireless standard (\u003Cem\u003Eac\u003C/em\u003E or at least \u003Cem\u003En\u003C/em\u003E). That can be a relatively small card with high performance. Do not buy a cheap toy, just something reasonable without going overboard. Depending on the placement of your PC, you could consider a card \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.pccasegear.com/index.php?main_page=product_info\u0026amp;cPath=200_328\u0026amp;products_id=33234\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ewith a wired antenna\u003C/a\u003E. That way you can optimize reception a little bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother option is to buy a PCI card.The downside is that this is older technology and would likely be a larger card. The plus side is that the slot is furthest away from your GPU.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA final option is getting a USB-wireless stick or dongle. This is the most convenient option, but more of a temporary solution than a permanent one.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-21T18:22:43Z\u0022 title=\u002209/21/2015 06:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Camacha\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dodgey","CreatedById":89577,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-22T05:19:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlright sweet, thanks for the help!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-26T03:38:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHas anyone here toyed with virtual machines? I always felt they were a bit boring and dry, but now that I have seen how they are deployed in real life situations, I am coming around. The ability of running a full network of devices on one machine is pretty cool, though whether it actually is an improvement very much depends on the circumstances and goals. To toy around with things and get a feeling for their inner working it is pretty amazing though.
