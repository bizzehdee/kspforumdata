I had some ideas how this could be used as a collectors mission. The idea is as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Each moon/planet has a number of different rock samples. Moons between 2-3 and planets between 4 and 8. The number of different rock samples which can be found should be listed somewhere so you can see how many you are still missing \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- A kerbal or rover can collect rock samples. Only when collecting, the game shows which rock sample you collected. \u0022You found a ... rock\u0022 (\u0022You found a moon rock... on the moon.. who would have thought\u0022)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- You should not be able to see which rock sample is where by flying over an area; you should be able to guess where different rock samples are.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPossible locations for different rock samples could be: inside craters, on the poles, on high mountains, near liquids, where the ground has a different color (differently colored patches), etc\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Off course you must return the rock sample to Kerbin to mark a sample as \u0027collected\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully the devs had similar ideas with the rock samples.
