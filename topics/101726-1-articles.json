For Kerbals, absolutely. Just send up a better ship with an extra seat ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) . Or if your stranded ship has a docking port you can launch a refueling mission. \n\nIt\u0027s possible to recover orbiting debris as well (for example by grabbing with a docking claw or trapping in a cargo bay) but even if your ship is 100% resusable you may spend so much on the fuel to reach the parts that it\u0027s just not worth it.\n\n2. Hard to tell what you\u0027re trying to do from the description, but what you may be running into is the fact that all parts have to \u0022branch\u0022 from a root, typically in only one direction. \n\nWhat ever you\u0027re trying to do, \u0027moar struts\u0027 will cover up a wide range of problems. For example, if you can get the parts arranged kind of the way you want them but can\u0027t connect them together using the nodes, you can always stitch the parts together using some combination of EAS-4 Struts and Cubic Octagonal struts.\n\nGood luck, and welcome to the forums!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-11T14:38:29Z\u0022 title=\u002203/11/2015 02:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mister Dilsby**"},{"CreatedByName":"Cucumbor","CreatedById":139316,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-11T16:24:11Z","Content":"Thanks for reply.

If the ship in orbit is really expensive and has a peraspsis of 70km for instance... and it already has parachutes and everything else it needs to land, then it would be pretty cheap to send up a jet powered SSTO and nudge the other ships perapsis down into the atmosphere, where the expensive ship can then aerobrake, deorbit, and land for recovery.\n\nRecovering ships that can\u0027t land on their own is more tricky, but it can be done profitably for now, due to the extreme efficiency and effectiveness of turbojets\n\n2) No, its a game engine limitation... I wish I could do what you want as well\n\n2. Is it possible to attach 2 decoupler or girder seqment to both details (connect them)?

It can branch but it cannot loop. You are trying to go from Mk1 cockpit--\u003ELFB#1--\u003Egirder#1--\u003ELFB#2--\u003Egirder#2--\u003ELFB#1 and that\u0027s not allowed. What you CAN do, though, is use EAS-4 struts to close the loop between girder#2 and LFB#1.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-11T16:59:21Z\u0022 title=\u002203/11/2015 04:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mister Dilsby**"},{"CreatedByName":"Cucumbor","CreatedById":139316,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-11T19:39:25Z","Content":"Such a big dissapointment ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif) but thanks anyway."},{"CreatedByName":"LordFerret","CreatedById":111598,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-11T21:29:03Z","Content":"You can attach a second girder, but it doesn\u0027t actually attach... it just sits there.

Of course, you could also try something more bold and go EVA and fly your Kerbal to where you want him.

If you have PreciseNode installed you can crank it up in there, but if not you can edit the config file for KSP and change it there. Find, in your KSP directory, the file named **settings.cfg** and copy it (just in case), then edit it and find where it says:\n\nCONIC\\_PATCH\\_LIMIT = 3\n\nAll that does is gives you more lines when it\u0027s drawing your predicted orbit through different planets\u0027 SOIs.\n\nOr, if you\u0027re playing career, you need to upgrade both your Mission Control and Tracking Station 1 each to get patched conics and maneuver nodes."},{"CreatedByName":"Cucumbor","CreatedById":139316,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-13T12:34:29Z","Content":"thanks you so much!"}]}
