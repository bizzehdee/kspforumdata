If the ship in orbit is really expensive and has a peraspsis of 70km for instance... and it already has parachutes and everything else it needs to land, then it would be pretty cheap to send up a jet powered SSTO and nudge the other ships perapsis down into the atmosphere, where the expensive ship can then aerobrake, deorbit, and land for recovery.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERecovering ships that can\u0027t land on their own is more tricky, but it can be done profitably for now, due to the extreme efficiency and effectiveness of turbojets\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) No, its a game engine limitation...
