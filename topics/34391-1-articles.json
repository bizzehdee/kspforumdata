FAR if you add that nosecone it reduces drag by a ton. I\u0027m not sure if rockets w/o nosecones are worse in FAR than they are in vanilla. There are some other things that make it harder, if you stray too far from your prograde marker when launching a rocket you will flip out so no straight up to 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 gravity turns.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UmbralRaptor","CreatedById":2767,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-23T07:31:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022WhiteWeasel\u0022 data-cite=\u0022WhiteWeasel\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI though FAR made drag more realistic and harder?
