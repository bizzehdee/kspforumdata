Exploration Flight Test 1 (EFT-1) will launch in December 4 later this year, 2014, aboard a Delta IV Heavy, with the Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage/Delta Cryogenic Second Stage. It\u0027s carrying the Orion MPCV spacecraft, which is really exciting since it\u0027s what will be powering NASA\u0027s future in deep space. I really hope I can find the time to visit the Cape to watch this launch, as it will be my first launch gone to in real life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI mean, think about it. We\u0027re getting a \u0022sneak peak\u0022 at our future in space, it\u0027s the spacecraft (albeit an unfinished version, no solar panels and other differences) that could be taking us to asteroids and Mars... Pretty cool, huh? It\u0027s also going to test a high energy re-entry from a high orbit! NASA also posted a picture recently of the Delta IV Heavy boosters being delivered!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think this would be the perfect time to see a real life rocket launch, anyone else planning on seeing it? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/Rendering_of_Orion_Exploration_Flight_Test_1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Rendering_of_Orion_Exploration_Flight_Test_1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a5/EFT-1_mission_diagram.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022EFT-1_mission_diagram.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Destroyer","CreatedById":36109,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-30T21:30:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would, if I wasn\u0027t like... 2000 miles away.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-30T21:54:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFloridas a 2 hour plane ride for me so yea I\u0027m going.
