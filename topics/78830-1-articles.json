Your body wants to send a big ol\u0027 pain signal to your brain, letting you know what just happened. Lidocain blocks that signal. But it also blocks signals going from the brain to your jaw and parts of face (depending on where you\u0027ve been anesthetized) so your brain can\u0027t tell the muscles in your face to stay taught and keep your lip up and stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ralathon","CreatedById":71537,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-21T16:50:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor this you first need to understand how nerves work.

When a signal transfers along a nerve signal it does so by disrupting this balance after which the cell needs to recover back to the status quo. A local anastheasia like lidocaine works by temporarily blocking the pumps that the cell uses to recover. So no further signals can travel along the nerve for a couple of hours. The nerves that carry pain are luckily also the least protected of all nerves, so you don\u0027t need much to block them. This is also why you can\u0027t feel pain, but you\u0027ll still feel pressures and can still move.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pawelk198604","CreatedById":35539,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-21T18:10:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI remember this young dentist could see that fresh out of college, was surprised to have to give me two lidocaine: D\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe gave the first dose nothing had happened, he was a little surprised, he gave me a second dose of something started something work, but clearly I could see that I\u0027m still not anesthetized, he begins to worry I told him: \u0022Maybe the doctor will give the third dose, I wanted to finally pulled the tooth. \u0022He answered me\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You do not understand fully Lidocaine is a very strong agent that you do not want something to happen?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe said that he would have would be to consult with his colleague, mentor probably had about forty, the second dentist.
