I may have misread your post topic, sorry!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYep, it can be done!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure if I\u0027ve prepared enough documentation notes with my personal experiences in this, but while designing my stock shuttle, I performed numerous tests on the hull before working on the engine design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, it sounds like you have a Center of Mass and Center of Lift issue. ( Referred to as CoM and CoL here on the forums and abroad ). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETypically, I\u0027ve tried to align the two to be as close together as possible. This can be tricky and is purely based on individual design of each craft you make, so take that under consideration. Don\u0027t even think about thrust until you make your plane a glider. I had to do this with my shuttle because when I come in for re-entry, I\u0027m unpowered and have a 17 ton glider. It just has to work in order for me to continue on with my goals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor CoL, Look very closely at your wings and design them with symmetry snap turned off to fine tune your wing surfaces. I have found this to be helpful for me, so your milage may vary. I\u0027d say give it a try. Also, use the intended parts around their intended design, or at least try as much as you can with the limited parts available in stock.Less pretty designs, but for practicality, it just works. The same principle can be applied to mod parts as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse the CoL tool to make sure the lift is generated at the wings and not the tail or nose. What\u0027s worked for me so far, is lift generated at or near center of my current wing design or at the very least, as near as possible to the greatest surface area that lift is applied. You just have to visualise it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor CoM, it\u0027s again, craft design dependant.Certain parts will change certain attributes, so you may or may not need to adjust your part location a bit to get the desired CoM your looking for. Too much to the rear, and no matter how perfect your CoL is, the mass at the rear will cause you pitch up, putting you into a backflip on the slightest maneuver. Too far to the front of your plane, and your fighting the controls to keep the nose up, despite your thrust vector and lift profile.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suggest experimentation with with your engines attached, but powered off for full testing purposes. Send your plane up with a standard rocket launcher, get a good altitude, pitch your rocket with plane attached to a heading of of 90\u003Csup\u003E0\u003C/sup\u003E, get to vertical flight and decouple the rocket in such a way that it doesn\u0027t interfere with your plane what-so-ever. Coast, as far you can while keeping the plane level. Conduct simple pitch, yaw and roll maneuvers to examine it\u0027s flight characteristics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you land your glider properly in controlled flight, your ready for engine design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe trick with engine design is to make sure your thrust is firing right through your center of mass. Toggle both in the SPH or VAB accordingly. Now you need to decide how many engines. !, 2, 3, 4? Every engine you add will change the way your plane handles in flight. Start with one in the middle, fly it for a while, then try 2 and so on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not an expert in Spaceplanes, but I\u0027ve learned this information through trial and error with my stock shuttle design in various configurations with jets on or off, counter weights simulating engines for glide tests and with a full on external tank, decoupling and landing the shuttle on the runway. Orbit is a ways off yet for me. (65km altitude so far though).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure the more experienced players here will have far more valuable feedback than I could ever possibly dream of but I hope my small contribution puts you on the right path to success.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood Luck!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Edit: I forgot mention that if you\u0027d like to see me conduct some tests on my redesigned shuttle, send me a PM so we can arrange a good time for broadcast on Twitch.

The pics are from way back a few versions ago, but the principles still work and is more effective with the increase in radial engines and control toggles. They are fun to fly and fun to land.

Here are main concepts to remember.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Balance engines\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBuild main components in SPH. Just adjust your vertical engine positions until it can maintain balance so thrust prevents pitching beyond what command module can handle. With some forward motion, the wings can help with low-speed landing. Much like a harrier or helicopter. They can land perfectly vertical, but do best with some forward motion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Plan for fuel usage\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake sure that your front and rear engine share the same single fuel tank, each have their own tank the same, etc. Make sure that as fuel burns out, it won\u0027t shift weight. Best test is to use a structure pylon to hold it down and test after doing original balance test. Burn down fuel to mostly empty and then release the clamp, see if still balanced.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Make use of the new control hotkeys\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToggle them engines on and off. In the old days, I would have no horizontal engines until I jettisoned the verticals. This way, you can lift off, and use a key to toggle now. In landing, have main flight engines that turn completely off at centre of your vertical lift. This way as fuel drains down, weight doesn\u0027t shift. Have a secondary engine to offer horizontal thrust or use pitch to control. I prefer using pitch, but in atmo, you will want the horizontal thrusting to make it easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, VTOL are really fun and must be built in SPH, but you can transfer them to VAB if you need to launch them for other planets. To do so, open your save file location and copy your ship file from SPH to VAB. Then open the file, change the = SPH to an = VAB\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: With mods, you can have engines with different thrust profiles. That way, you can control balance and pitch with throttle. Have some without ramp up, then a second to counter imbalance.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-11T05:26:36Z\u0022 title=\u002206/11/2013 05:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 11, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Markus Reese\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bsalis","CreatedById":32928,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-11T08:19:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kidneythump\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kidneythump\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI had an idea of making a spaceplane that takes of and lands like a regular rocket but with the added capability of regular flight, does anyone got any experience with this?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYep - plenty.
