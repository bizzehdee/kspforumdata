A world with life, just like Kerbin. Except it wasn\u0027t Kerbin. It wasn\u0027t Earth either. In fact, this was long before those worlds even existed. On an unidentified planet long, long ago, a sprawling civilization spread out from their home planet and into the galaxy where they populated. It was a time when the universe was very young and our galaxy was just a couple of billion years old. They found life among other worlds but other intelligent life had not appeared yet. Seeing the scarcity of life in the galaxy, the first civilization realized that they must protect life wherever it was and see they intelligent species like them evolved. Their technology advanced as they seeded planets with new life where they previously had no chance of acquiring. One of those planets was the Earth. For a billion years, they protected, seeded and nurtured many planets throughout the galaxy, until they had become so powerful, they had no need of a body and became incorporeal beings (almost god-like). Seeing their work completed, they traveled to the very center of the galaxy, went into a deep sleep and waited for intelligent beings to discover them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Meanwhile, on the seeded planets, many intelligent beings evolved and became spacefaring, but with only greed and menace they destroyed themselves before they could discover interstellar travel. A few species began to colonize nearby stars, but their \u0027stellar empires\u0027 were often unstable and riots and rebellion were a constant threat to them. When faced against another species\u0027 \u0027stellar empire\u0027, it would be enough for their different political groups to form a weak, shady alliance, but once the war was over, they would continue to squabble amongst themselves and order would inevitably dissolve. For billions of years, the cycles continued, over and over again, growth and destruction. Until now. On planet Earth, bipedal apes called humans began to expand into the cosmos once their corrupt national governments were ousted and replaced by \u0027space corporations\u0027 which competed constantly for the best mining grounds in the solar system. It was not long before the humans began to follow the same path as the stellar empires did. Independent groups separated from the main empire and became space pirates raiding each other and the empire. But this time, once the human empire discovered warp drive, they abused it to travel to other star systems and deprive their planets of their resources; even if it meant destroying a developing civilization. The humans built massive ark-ships designed to \u0027hop\u0027 from one star to the next, using its resources to build yet more ark-ships and crushing all opposition. For thousands of years man built, pillaged, destroyed, consumed. Flourishing planets were left cold, dark and devoid of life. It was this way in which humans \u0027conquered\u0027 the galaxy; the complete opposite of the first civilization. The first civilization spread throughout the galaxy trying to spread life, humans did it by destroying it. Everything was good for the humans, no other species in the galaxy was even close to matching the power of man. Except for one. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The humans assembled their best crew in a ship which used General Products Hull (indestructible hull) to travel to the Sagittarius A region of the galaxy, in other words, the supermassive black hole to test out extreme time dilation effects on spaceships and the human body as well as send a large probe into Sagittarius A itself. Once they arrived, the probe was sent into the black hole. Until this time, no artificial object had ever been sent into Sagittarius A itself other than the first civilization. This disturbance caused a single being of the first civilization to awaken. He was at first struck with awe that an intelligent civilization would go this far to discover them. But as he gazed upon the worlds he had once brought life to, all he found was death. Now, only a precious few worlds with life remained, but the humans only spared them to use them as \u0027tourist hubs\u0027 and luxury homes for the extremely wealthy. He saw giant space stations the size of planets and dead stars drained of energy. This view brought great sadness to him but it only lasted for a brief moment as his sadness turned to extreme anger and instantly destroyed the human ship. He awoken the rest of his kind with a roar so loud that it caused half of the stars within the central region of the galaxy to instantly go supernova. He then assembled his kind and began to destroy the mighty human empire at speeds which could only be outmatched by light itself. With no other civilizations to match its power and strength, man had grown lazy and his weapons were incredibly weak. But even with their full force, they were no match for the civilization that had lasted for billions of years. It was not until only a tiny remnant of the human race living at the edge of galaxy was left when man realized his mistake. He had given up humbleness for greed and power. But still, the humans demanded retribution for their loss. Using the last of their technological strength, they created pitch black, perfectly rectangular and incredibly powerful supercomputers called \u0027monoliths\u0027 to wander the galaxy, searching for planets with life with the hope of transmitting their knowledge no matter how small a fragment to \u0027enhance\u0027 any creature that touches it. As they were being sent out, Earth, the last beacon of human civilization was pillaged. The beings then thrust a sword the size of the moon into Earth as a warning to aggressive future civilizations. Some of the beings transformed themselves into enormous squid-like creatures (the origin of the term-\u0027deep space kraken\u0027) to patrol the almost dead galaxy for intelligent life, but this time, where they found it, they would destroy it. After wiping a final tear off his incorporeal face, the head being sunk back into Sagittarius A to continue his slumber. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*warning: spoilers incoming\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 7 million years later, 11 monoliths traveling side by side finally came up across a peculiar star system. It was the Kerbal system, where Kerbin was the only recognizable planet with life. 5 of them descended onto Kerbin, 3 crashed into the Mun, another into low Minar orbit, one crashed into Duna(source of SSTV signal) and the final one into low Ike orbit(magic boulder). They strategically positioned themselves in order to provide any intelligent life forms from Kerbin \u0027stepping\u0027 stones to interstellar travel. Their original purpose was not to make Kerbals spread life throughout the galaxy, but simply continue the conflict with the first civilization now dubbed \u0027the deep space krakens\u0027. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E In an unknown region of Kerbin near the equator, a kerbal tribe was sleeping peacefully among the rocks. One of the young kerbals awoke to find a big black object just sitting there just 10 meters away. He went up to it, looked around it curiously, and touched it. It was very smooth\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The next day, the same kerbal tribe was searching for fruit among the trees. The young kerbal woke up and finally brought the tribe to the place where he saw the monolith. It was gone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELater that day, the young kerbal ventured out onto the prairie to look for roots and tubers. But his mind was captured by the skeleton of a large animal just lying there. He curiously picked up one of the bones and started digging for tubers. He was able to very quickly dig up as much roots as his tummy could allow him. Looking to his side, he saw a small animal grazing nearby. The kerbals could eat meat, but they could only scavenge as their stubby legs could not run fast enough to keep up with the swift prey of that time and his species\u0027 arms were one of the weakest on Kerbin. Raising his arm and grasping his bone, the young kerbal knew what he would do\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESooo, there you have it!
