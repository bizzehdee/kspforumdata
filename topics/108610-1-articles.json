Now that they\u0027re not, my craft is unable to power the probe core. Would it be relatively trivial to change the 2x3 panels into Gigantors? Sending something to augment the craft is impractical because it will have missed the SOI change by that time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-10T20:25:08Z\u0022 title=\u002205/10/2015 08:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by THX1138\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Clockwork13","CreatedById":100102,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T18:12:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m 90% sure that you can\u0027t immediately turn the 2x3 solar panels into gigantors.

Their names are pretty easy to figure out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, open the .cfg file (its name will be the same as the directory name) in Notepad, and scroll down to the section in brackets. Then, all you have to do change the chargeRate to whatever you\u0027d like. KSP models the solar panel power as n/r^2, where r is your distance from the sun, and n is the charge rate you see there. Increasing it by a factor of ten will increase the power you got previously at Jool by a factor of ten as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGigantors have a chargeRate of 24.4, so simply change it to that value to have the small solar panel output what a Gigantor would. Then, restart your game, and all the 2x3 solar panels in the game will have greatly increased power outputs!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
