The setup is very simple, a MK16 chute on top of a MK I command pod with a heatshield on the bottom. I did a mission to the moon and back this morning and everything was fine, the same pod survived (without any problems). I just tried returning from the moon with the exact same setup and the chute was destroyed, even though the pod was oriented the right way, all the way. This happened to two different craft (good bye Jeb and Valentina...) A third craft had the radial chutes next to MK16, and they didn\u0027t burn up. I never used deadly re-entry, as the first time I used it it was extremely bugged, and I never looked at it again. I hoped now that Squad made it stock it would be without these strange bugs... apparently not... Worst thing.. there is a craft heading for Duna with the MK16 chutes... It was designed to use them, so those Kerbals are also heading for a certain doom (first time going past minmus since 0.19), Ah well, hopefully there is another small fix before the next 20 ingame days pass \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheCanadianVendingMachine","CreatedById":59684,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T23:01:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAre you deploying them while re-entering?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"archnem","CreatedById":135259,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T23:02:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYah in 1.0.2 re-entry is for serious now.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"chunes","CreatedById":142605,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T23:03:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECanadianVendingMachine, I believe Kaiz0r is saying the parachute is burning up before even deploying it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-01T23:42:50Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2015 11:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by chunes\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kaiz0r","CreatedById":68389,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T23:19:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYup, just tried again, with the shallowest of re-entry\u0027s I ever did.
