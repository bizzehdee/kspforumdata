Completed all the tutorials, but i can\u0027t seem to do anything in career mode as any rocket i create using normal engines (those that need fuel tanks, not solid fuel ones) act crazy as hell. As soon as i enable them rocket starts going around like crazy, no way to keep it in one direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny idea what i\u0027m doing wrong? Don\u0027t have any fins unlocked, don\u0027t have SAS unlocked (although i don\u0027t think SAS would help here that much)...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI lost like three times all the money i had.

Well, many tutorials you can find around were for previous versions (up to KSP 0.90); with KSP 1.0 the differences in aerodynamics are so marked to be totally different for what those tutorials may tell.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn KSP 1.0 aerodynamic forces on vessels can spin them. Stability of vessels is now absolutely needed to be able to maintain course or steer them where needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile in the lower atmosphere and at high speed, the effect of lifting and control surfaces is highest. Center of Pressure of the aerodynamics forces should always be aft than the Center of Mass, to have a stable vessel. That means, use fins at the tail. While you have no fins (not yet researched the stability node), you have better maintain a rocket aligned with the prograde marker (only very minimal eroors can be corrected by the reaction wheel with a Mk1 pod, or by gimbaling engines when you have them). You have to get high, above the lower atmosphere (no less than 20 Km altitude) before the aerodynamic forces diminish enough to let control from the RW in the pod (or gimbaling engines) be enough to steer the craft where you like.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: please note, KSP does not show where the Center of Pressure is. In the editor you can display the Center of Lift (though it only works when at least one lifting/control surface is attached to the craft). Use the Center of Lift to have an approximate idea of where the Center of Pressure may be, so always build your crafts to have a Center of Lift aft of the Center of Mass.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-02T10:52:28Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2015 10:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by diomedea\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shaunri","CreatedById":142681,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T10:51:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the kind answer sir \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003Eyou have better maintain a rocket aligned with the prograde marker\u0022\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EThat was like the most important thing i had to learn.
