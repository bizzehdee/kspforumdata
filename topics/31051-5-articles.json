As stack replacements, I have my doubts about the hexagonal formfactor but certainly you would not have the bumper caps and it wouldn\u0027t be particularly important to have the label plates the way they are. Key in my mind is that the hexcan sizes are not directly compatible with the stock size standards; as radial tanks this is insignificant, the stock radial bits also have no relation to the stack sizes. Hexcans currently have a bumper-measure of 0.4m flatflat and 0.46m pointpoint, meaning if they\u0027re scaled up in the standard doubling progression it would be as follow\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESize 0 0.2f-f 0.23p-p\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESize 1 0.4f-f 0.46p-p\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESize 2 0.8f-f 0.92p-p\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESize 3 1.6f-f 1.84p-p\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESize 4 3.2f-f 3.68p-p\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECompared to the stock\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESize 0 0.625\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESize 1 1.250\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESize 2 2.500\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESize 3 5.000*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESize 4 10.00*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(* Sizes 3 and 4 don\u0027t actually exist and have not been widely accepted by parts makers)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn order to make stack-intended hextanks I\u0027d need to significantly deviate from the norm of the set.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"techno65535","CreatedById":160947,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-05T05:45:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESomething I\u0027ve kinda wanted to see is an in-line hexcan carrier/adaptor.
