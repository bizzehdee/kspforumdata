What do you guys think?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, my biggest problem is ascent (getting enough weight to orbit) and I can barely get a small Minmus transfer craft up there. My space program is mostly rocket-oriented, which is why I haven\u0027t researched Airplanes yet \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been considering Advanced Exploration for the lab, which seems like a good \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003ESCIENCE \u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003Einvestment, as well as Command Modules for the 3-Kerbal pod. I\u0027m also thinking about throwing in Landing if I have 90 science to spare... I\u0027ll need those big landing legs! Other than that, I could go for Larger Rocketry to get the Mainsail, Aerodynamics for the 2.5m fairing, or maybe even Construction for the tri-coupler.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I don\u0027t want to make a hasty decision. This career game was not going well (probably blew about 100k funds on two missions trying to get Jeb off that deathtrap of a Mun. Did not work.)

It\u0027s a huge investment if so because it can be used in both low and high orbit for *each biome*.

Don\u0027t worry if you miss one or two instruments - that\u0027s not going to hurt too much, but make sure you get a Kerbal (to take surface sample) and a Science Jr.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T02:12:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d try to go for Field Science, but that\u0027s just me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T02:42:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI vote for Propulsion Systems. The \u0022Spark\u0022 is a great little engine for small cheap satellites (e.g. for contracts), particularly when coupled with the Oscar-B (which is much buffed up in 1.0.2, holds 0.2 tons fuel!).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMiniaturization goes well with Propulsion Systems (for the size-0 adapters), and also gives you a docking port, which opens up lots of contracts.

Definitely support the idea of landing on minmus next, so get whatever parts you need for that. If you can\u0027t take a pilot and a scientist, then consider a decent probe core with SAS for landing, and take just a scientist to reset the experiments, letting you collect more science\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
