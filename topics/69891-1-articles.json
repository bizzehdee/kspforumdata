Don\u0027t get me wrong, it\u0027s exciting, but there doesn\u0027t seem to be much purpose to them except getting science.

I made a lander called Zhan II (I have different vessel names for the three big countries: America, China, and Russia. They each have different satellite names, rover names, lander names etc.) and sent it out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt went well, I kinda love how it looks when connected to the asteroid.
