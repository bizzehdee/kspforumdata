No input is working except the pause menu and the timewarp. \n\nAlso, my framerate dropped from 60 to 10 when this happened.\n\nI also have the skybox-screen in the KSC view. No kerbin, no buildings.\n\nAny ideas for a fix ? It is very irritating\n\nI\u0027m gonna try restarting the game now but i don\u0027t think that my progress will be saved...\n\nEDIT : restarting the game has made the KSC, the solar system and my probe re-appear, however i am still getting the part where i cannot timewarp \u0022because of acceleration\u0022. I don\u0027t see how my ship could be under acceleration since the engine is shut down, the reaction wheels and SAS are turned off, and there are no RCS.\n\nThe game isn\u0027t even letting me save and quit without losing my progression...\n\ntalk about a finished game...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-27T19:09:42Z\u0022 title=\u002206/27/2015 07:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Hcube**"}]}
