After a significant amount of saving up, I was finally ready to make my rather elaborate M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn vessel complete with a tiny lander and fueling station. To make a short story short, I try to launch it and it blows up on the pad and destroys my launch pad. Now I\u0027m rather certain, from my fairly significant amount of experience in KSP, that there is nothing intrinsically wrong with my rocket design. It was, in fact, one of my less risky creations at least in its size class:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ugBCs2g.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ugBCs2g.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I had set the game up with no quickloading. Normally I like to live with the consequences of my actions, but this time not only am I quite certain it\u0027s not my fault, I am also apparently unable to continue playing as I do not have the funds to repair the pad, any assets to sell, or any method that I can see of completing any contracts...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...well I could try using the runway to launch rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENevermind, I think I have my answer.

As far as I can tell, the launch pad decides to explode based on certain rockets being on it, regardless of the stability of the rocket. The weight is possibly connected but is not the only factor as my under 250 ton rocket (above) will break the pad while a 750 rocket that was much simpler did not break it. My current suspicions are that it has something to do with either the number of engines touching the launch pad, or something about the part count of the base stage of the ship. I cannot find any hypothesis to stand up to testing, however, and the only pattern I can ever find between ships that repeatedly blow up the launch pad is that if I edit the ship and leave the base stage the same, it still blows up the pad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApparently attaching launch clamps to the ship does keep it from blowing up the pad, but I don\u0027t understand why, as the ship is perfectly stable and has a wide base. It should stand up on its own just fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I hadn\u0027t yet unlocked launch clamps.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-17T03:14:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m going to lock this one out, since your more recent thread seems to have the answer you seek.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/103433-What-causes-the-launch-pad-to-blow-up\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/103433-What-causes-the-launch-pad-to-blow-up\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~Claw\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
