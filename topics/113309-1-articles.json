There are companies that do this at reasonable cost and I was really just thinking about having simple icons on the keys that denote what the command does, with an appropriate key cap colour. \n\nTypical costs and options:\n\n [http://www.wasdkeyboards.com/index.php/products/printed-keycap-singles/custom-art-cherry-mx-keycaps.html](http://www.wasdkeyboards.com/index.php/products/printed-keycap-singles/custom-art-cherry-mx-keycaps.html)\n\n [http://www.wasdkeyboards.com/index.php/products/keycap-set/88-key-iso-cherry-mx-keycap-set.html](http://www.wasdkeyboards.com/index.php/products/keycap-set/88-key-iso-cherry-mx-keycap-set.html)\n\nHas anybody on this forum created a custom layout before that they\u0027d be willing to share as an SVG (or compatible format that they accept).\n\nBest regards,\n\nSam"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T09:54:35Z","Content":"Kerbals just need a space key version of [this](http://event-kikaku.com/enter-key/).

The UV cured coating they use on the caps is very durable and all, but it gets yellow over time. Given that you don\u0027t need that amount of durability for a KSP keyboard, I\u0027d look around for another company.\n\nI also have an older WASD with laser printed keys instead, it\u0027s used everyday at the office to program on it, so hard use for 3 years now. It\u0027s in perfect condition.\n\nSo, while it\u0027s cool and all. I would look around for some other company with some other method of printing, like laser, I believe it should be cheaper too (the printing, not what they charge, mind you ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) ).\n\nOn the other hand, WASD quality is second to none and has DA BEST costumer service you\u0027ll find in your life. So there\u0027s that, you know you\u0027ll get what you ordered."}]}
