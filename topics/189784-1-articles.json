Laythe has lower gravity than Kerbin so if it can lift off Kerbin\u0027s ocean it should be able to do so from Laythe. Laythe atmosphere is also thinner and space starts at 50km instead of 70km, so it will be easier to reach orbit on Laythe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo you use any mods?

You can use parachutes on Laythe to conserve fuel during landing. The tricky part with using a rocket for rescue is getting it to land reasonably close to where Jeb is stuck. Quicksave and reload until you get the landing close enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain, HyperEdit can be your friend here: teleport your rocket into the ocean to make sure it floats vertically rather than tipping over.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote that if you rescue Jeb but your rescue craft runs out of fuel while circularizing orbit, the EVA jetpack carries around 600 m/s of deltaV in his jetpack.
