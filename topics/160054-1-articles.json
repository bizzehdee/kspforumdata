I just had not wanted to merge this back story with a more official first post to prevent any confusion that could happen.

This means I\u0027ll have to go back and re-edit all of the .cfg files... again. This is a process that took maybe three months last time (albeit I was working much more casually). I\u0027m hoping I will have it all figured out within a week or two. I\u0027ve sadly also been unable to transfer any vehicles over from the previous save (which really, really, really angers me because I had some craft in there\u00A0that I very much so liked.)

I will have a more official first post that will introduce a few characters along with spaceflight. This post was just meant to give a very basic back story. The main story will focus on spaceflight, space combat, exploration, along with various parts being on planets/moons. I\u0027ll have plenty of screenshots for your viewing pleasure. As I posted earlier I\u0027ve suffered a major kraken attack so I\u0027m currently going and re-editing all of the .cfg files and downloading everything from scratch. Take a look at this earlier post that I used to show off some of my creations (sadly you\u0027re not going to see any of these exact spacecraft due to that annoying kraken, but it\u0027ll at least give you an idea of what to expect). Glad to see you\u0027re interested in this!
