I threw together a quick rocket to retrieve my stranded, upside-down crew out of their rover on the Mun. The first attempt I landed at the wrong location, accidentally choosing the wreckage site of the previous rover that did not survive landing on the moon. I decided to leave escape ship there, no reason to waste a free escape from the moon. My second attempt was going very well, however I burned more fuel then I realized attempting to land within close proximity to the live crew, and when they boarded the escape shuttle and fired the engines, there was only enough fuel to launch them straight up into the sky to a height of 100k meters. The good news is I have one less ship on the Mun to worry about and two less Kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dharak1","CreatedById":61137,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-21T22:02:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI always leave them behind.
