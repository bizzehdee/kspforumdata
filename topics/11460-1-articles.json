Some have seemed reasonably and level headed, others have been the worst of any stereotype.\n\nDoesn\\\u0027t matter where your from, there are people that are good examples of your culture and country, and there are people that are bad examples of your culture and country. Generally the bad examples do much much more to get remembered, such as make everyone nearby hate that they are allowed to even breathe......But thats pretty much a possible situation from every group, from KKK to christian choirboys to well, name it.\n\nYour both right, it just depends. Generally speaking, the global opinion of an American isn\\\u0027t flattering as far as im aware, and its mostly the fault of a minority of loud self entitled retards that if not for an overprotective society would have either perished of their own doing, or been beaten to death by someone they wronged.\n\nAnd I say this as a citizen of America\\\u0027s hat...........how common that view is....ah well"},{"CreatedByName":"sss","CreatedById":24050,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-27T04:57:44Z","Content":"greetings from Canada! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Luigibro606","CreatedById":8700,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-27T05:04:35Z","Content":"OIL\n\nI WANT OIL\n\n(Now *dat*, is human.)"},{"CreatedByName":"RC1062","CreatedById":10709,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-27T06:16:28Z","Content":"Umm..."},{"CreatedByName":"Nooblet68","CreatedById":11784,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-27T12:07:32Z","Content":"Cake, RC?"},{"CreatedByName":"RC1062","CreatedById":10709,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-27T12:33:00Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Cake, RC?\n\n\\*Takes cake\\*\n\nThanks, good sir."},{"CreatedByName":"Nooblet68","CreatedById":11784,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-27T12:38:43Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \\*Takes cake\\*\n\u003E \n\u003E Thanks, good sir.\n\nOi!
