If so, you may want to try verifying your files. I know it sounds odd, but I have seen something like what you are describing\u00A0being caused by a few corrupted files.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdditionally, (if you are on Windows) there is a file called \u0022output_log.txt\u0022 that grows every time you start the game.

However players shouldn\u0027t normally be concerned with deleting it: KSP recreates that file from scratch each time it is launched (so, you\u0027ll have a lean log file just afterwards, then it will keep increasing size until KSP is closed), you may actually see this if you keep the subfolder with that file in view during launch or use any program to show the log concurrently with the KSP process. Just because of KSP recreating the file each time, one may need to rename or otherwise save that file somewhere if it holds useful info (like when hunting bugs); and then the need to delete those saved files after bug is catched.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
