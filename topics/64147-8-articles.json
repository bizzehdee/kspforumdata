Because burns consume fuel, the bigger the burns you make, the fewer burns you can do, which limits your ability to make further maneuvers. Therefore, we always place our nodes to minimize the size of the burn vector needed to go from Orbit A to Orbit B. To do this, we look for where the burn vector has the most \u0022leverage\u0022 to \u0022pry\u0022 our current orbital path from where it is now into alignment with the desired orbital path.
