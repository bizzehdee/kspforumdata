Which, after my most recent attempt went into an uncontrollable and nearly-unrecoverable spin, seems obvious--at high speeds, slight turns or wobbles will present the entire face of the craft to the oncoming air, inducing enormous drag. Maybe fish don\u0027t have to deal with this because water is incompressible, unlike air. Regardless, this poses a whole new set of challenges to spaceplane design that will be very interesting to tackle!"},{"CreatedByName":"SuicidalInsanity","CreatedById":143878,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T20:21:30Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I have no idea what exactly you\u0027ve done to the ESTOC engine but I do **not** like it.\n\u003E I took some time to compare the ESTOC part.cfg\u0027s from v1.0 and v1.02. Now I understand why the ESTOC performs so poorly. From v1.0 to v1.02 it has lost roughly 30% of it\u0027s power.\n\nThe ESTOC recieved a 25% thrust nerf following V1.0. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E And compare it to the stock RAPIER it weighs three times as much but delivers only 150% of it\u0027s power. The stock RAPIER wins on all fronts. WITH EASE!\n\nWhere are you getting that? ESTOC weights 3 tons, RAPIER weights 2 tons. ESTOC, at present, is 150% more powerful than the RAPIER at 150% the mass cost. Before the nerf, ESTOC was 200% thrust for 150% mass.\n\nEdit: Tex\\_NL, I just tested a replica of the plane you posted, using ver1.1.2, and I\u0027m not seeing any of the behaviors you are describing - replica plane hit orbit 150x150km, ~900 dV left, mach 1 soon after launch. So a few questions: Mod version# you are using? Stock or nuFAR atmo model? Any mods that might affect engines?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-21T21:25:42Z\u0022 title=\u002205/21/2015 09:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SuicidalInsanity**\n  \nFlight testing"},{"CreatedByName":"temporalExile","CreatedById":127675,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T03:26:24Z","Content":"Great mod, but I have noticed some things that really bug me.\n\n1. The VTOL engine hits its max thrust at 8 km, which makes absolutely no sense for an engine designed specifically to take off. I would probably make it stronger as well, because of how hard it is to set up a craft with more than one of those things. I think that the thrust curve used for the J-33 would work fairly well here\n\n2. The Vectoring turbojet\u0027s performance just barely surpasses that of the J-33. I understand that the vectoring-ness of the engine is a reason to weaken it, but that level of maneuverability is easily obtained through other means at speeds that low. I would reccomend a slightly nerfed version of the J-X4\u0027s thrust curve for this one\n\n3. The aerospace intake could stand to be a bit pointier. Or not. I don\u0027t care too strongly about this.\n\n4. The Ramjet is actually a turbo ramjet, or else it wouldn\u0027t produce any thrust while standing still. Once again, I don\u0027t care too strongly about this\n\n5. The Engines in general seem a bit wimpy. IMO, they should have around they perform around 210% of the engines Mk I counterpart, and should have 205% of the mass.\n\nEDIT\u003E6. In the new update, the ramjet flat out under-performs compared to the J-X4. It only manages half of the max thrust, compared to the already weak ~120% max thrust that it used to have.\n\nComplaining about awesome content offered to me completely free of charge aside, this really is a great mod, and I hope you keep up the good work.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-22T14:19:05Z\u0022 title=\u002205/22/2015 02:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by temporalExile**"}]}
