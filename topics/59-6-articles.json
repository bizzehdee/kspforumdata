His task was further complicated by the need to keep slapping the other two kerbonauts\\\u0027 hands away from the ABORT handle. Once Jeb finally had the craft under control, he proceeded to put it into the best orbit yet, with an apokee just a hair under 50 km and a perikee of 48.5 km... and kept it there for the next eighteen hours* and thirty-odd orbits, shattering all previous records. After splashdown and recovery, all three kerbonauts had to be taken out of the capsule on stretchers; Bob and Bill were babbling, while Jeb promptly went to sleep, saying that he hadn\\\u0027t been

Observations and photographs were made of the munar surface to help determine landing sites for future missions. After three orbits, Munatic 1 fired its upper stage engine again and headed for home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDisaster struck at the very end of the mission, when a misheard instruction caused the premature jettisoning of the service module, stranding the crew in orbit. Fortunately, Jeb Kerman was on hand at KSC and led a round-the-clock rescue effort. A partially-assembled Orbiter 2 stack was completed with any parts they could find, hastily fueled, and moved to the pad for an accelerated launch. Jeb was alone in the capsule for this mission; the plan was to match orbits and transfer the Munatic 1 crew over in suits, followed by a cramped but survivable re-entry. Once he was actually in orbit, however, Jeb decided to hold this option in reserve as a \u0027Plan B.\u0027 His first, and ultimately successful, solution was to make hard contact with the other capsule (with a brief EVA to secure them with a tether) and use his retros to gently deorbit both spacecraft. The two pods splashed down within kilometers of each other, and both crews received a hero\\\u0027s welcome at KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[The stranding-in-space thing actually happened - my goof, and par for the course in KSP, but I figured Jeb wouldn\\\u0027t just let them sit up there until their air ran out. And this is just the sort of Crazy Awesome thing he\\\u0027d try, if the game engine let him.]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second Munatic mission was ambitious, to say the least. With the lander design \u003Cem\u003Estill\u003C/em\u003E stuck in development hell, the \u0027bigger is better\u0027 faction in the program had come up with a design that could send any conceivable payload to the Mun with fuel to spare. This was accomplished by adding a second mid-stage to the stack, which now exceeded the height of the gantry. The first and only flight of Munatic 2 called to mind the many failed attempts to come up with a viable Orbiter 2: the overloaded rocket lurched off the pad, struggled to gain speed and altitude, and finally broke apart at its weakest point, the coupling between the first and second mid-stages. The crew was able to eject and parachute to safety, while a train of rocket stages (still carrying most of their fuel) plunged into the ocean behind them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b348/cmdrzoom/KSP/munatic2-01.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022munatic2-01.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMunatic 2 on the pad\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother round of yelling and finger-pointing, again calling to mind the Orbiter 2 trials, followed. It didn\\\u0027t help that this embarrassment came on the heels of the \u0027successful failure\u0027 of Munatic 1. It was eventually decided to go back to that earlier design, at least for now. Even Jeb acknowledged, \u0027There\\\u0027s nothin\\\u0027 wrong with that rocket. It got those boys to the Mun and back just fine. That\\\u0027s what we need, not ways to kill a lotta fish.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a result, Munatic 3 was almost identical to Munatic 1. The only modifications were to the upper stage: some of the engineers, tired of waiting for the committee, took the \u0027back to basics\u0027 order of the day to heart and went down to their local hardware store. There they bought a ladder and the parts to make four sturdy legs, which they proceeded to weld to the side and base. The rest of the weekend was spent swapping out the LV-T30 for a hand-built engine which was smaller and less powerful, but much lighter and more efficient. (One of the engineers had been working on it as a hobby, there being little demand or interest in the KSP for such things.) On Munday they presented the ad-hoc lander to their superiors, who mostly stared and mumbled to each other... until Jeb stepped forward, praised them for their initiative, and gave them all a raise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFive days later, Munatic 3 thundered off the pad into a clear blue sky... and history.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b348/cmdrzoom/KSP/munatic3-03.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022munatic3-03.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b348/cmdrzoom/KSP/munatic3-04.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022munatic3-04.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven though this was his first time flying an actual Munatic, not a simulator, Jeb handled the launch and orbital insertion like the pro he was. His TMI was so smooth that he was able to retain the mid-stage all the way to the Mun and use its remaining fuel to enter a stable munar orbit, where it was left as a comm relay. (Engineers had imagined this possibility only a few days before the mission, just enough time to weld on another couple of antennas and some tin foil.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe landing sites were all in mares, wide areas of darker and (it was hoped) flatter ground. One of these was close to the Mun\\\u0027s equator, in easy reach of Munatic 3\\\u0027s current orbit, but also close to the day/night line. As commander, Jeb chose instead to land at the alternate site to the north, in full sunlight. Time and fuel was spent to tilt the craft\\\u0027s orbit accordingly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b348/cmdrzoom/KSP/munatic3-16.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022munatic3-16.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b348/cmdrzoom/KSP/munatic3-19.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022munatic3-19.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESoon it was time to begin the descent. The thrust of the new engine was weak, but so was the Mun\\\u0027s gravity; it also sipped fuel rather than gulping it, giving the pilot plenty of hover time over the target. Bursts from the RCS thrusters were used to further slow the craft. Bill counted down the distance, Bob held his breath until he passed out (missing the rest of the landing) and Jeb tried to concentrate on the ball, the speed indicator, and the view out the window all at once. There was a gentle thump; Jeb cut the throttle, checked everything one more time, and gave Kouston the good news:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Munatic Base here, we made it.

There was plenty of cheering in Kouston too, before everyone got back to business. The crew was given permission to depressurize the capsule and make their way down the ladder. Jeb was the first one down, of course; he actually leapt from the bottom and landed with a mighty whoop. \u0027Hoooo! That was fun!\u0027 were thus the first words spoken on the munar surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe three kerbonauts spent almost an hour on the surface: planting the flag, taking photographs and measurements, bouncing around the lander in the low gravity, and leaving lots of corrugated footprints in the grey soil.

First he put Munatic 3 in an unusual retrograde orbit, then made several aborted attempts to extend it in the proper direction and inclination. When the craft finally left the Mun\\\u0027s gravity well, new calculations required further course corrections. All of these long burns ate into the reserve left over from the landing. Munatic 3 eventually settled into a high orbit, and Jeb was still trying to tighten it up and reduce the inclination when the main tank finally ran dry. Bill and Bob stared at the gauge for a moment, then began screaming in unison. Jeb hushed them: \u0027Knock it off! We still got another tank, hardly been touched. It may not be pretty, but I promise, I \u003Cem\u003Ewill\u003C/em\u003E get us down.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb was, of course, referring to the RCS fuel. It was just enough to bring the perikee down into the upper atmosphere, where aerobraking would take care of the rest. There was no hope of hitting the recovery area; in fact, there was at least a 50/50 chance of coming down on land rather than water. There had been many (\u003Cem\u003Emany\u003C/em\u003E) crash-tests of the capsule with dummies inside, which suggested good odds of survival for both... but like landing on the Mun, it had never actually been done before. Still, it was their only shot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter running the RCS quads dry as well, Jeb jettisoned and christened the empty landing stage in the same breath: \u0027Farewell, Oddity, and we thank you.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b348/cmdrzoom/KSP/munatic3-32.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022munatic3-32.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b348/cmdrzoom/KSP/munatic3-35.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022munatic3-35.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe long, shallow re-entry of Munatic 3 was easier on the kerbonauts, but meant more anxious waiting for them and for ground control in Kouston, cut off by radio blackout.
