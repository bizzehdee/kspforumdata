Did the forum suffer a wipe or something?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, I\u0027m guessing there were changes to the account info meta because I could not save any changes before I changed my birth date to a more modern date (it was set on December 25th 0001 (because I\u0027m a rebel)). Anything else pertaining to accounts that was changed that I might be made aware of and that would be useful to know?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThird, I\u0027m sorta interested in learning the lost history of the forums and KSP in general that I missed.
