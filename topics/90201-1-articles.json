For those mods I can check if certain modules are present in the craft.

It does seem that it incorrectly learnt that those landing gears belong to BahaSP, but that\u0027s a weak association in the knowledge base, if you upload your part-map it should correct it. The knowledge base adapts by using weighted associations, each part-map that is uploaded will rank up or down the associations between parts and mods, so if like this, it has learnt something wrong from one user, hopefully the majority of users will out weight that and set it right.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rdwulfe","CreatedById":107690,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-14T04:14:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAhh.
