So placed MK1 pod on three tanks and two busters and just let it go up and up vertically got rid of busters and tanks when they were done. Came down vertically the pod survived without shield but it was a close call the G was wel in the red. Then I tried the same but this time while i was falling down i left the tanks...the pod couldn\u0027t hold this. Next test was again tank plus pod plus shield. No problem....however the pod was going so fast that one poor chute didn\u0027t have a chance. So it seems unless you are heavy and go to extreme like me the pods will just do fine without the shield...at least did the Mk1\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Monger","CreatedById":4143,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T14:15:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPods can take quite a punch. For early non-orbital and low orbit missions you don\u0027t need it. Ironically, you don\u0027t need it either if you take a quite steep reentry, because more dangerous than the friction is the long exposure to it, i.e. the pod is unable to cool down efficiently. However, you will get other problems with a a fast descent (i.e. being unable to break fast enough)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
