I have made the fairings as accurate as possible. This craft is 100% scale to real life (about). It has better detail than my first Delta II\u0027s (GPS carrying 6925, and 6925-8 comsat carrier) and it is an 7920H-10 (GEM boosters, 9 of them, with a 2nd stage, and no 3 third stage, Heavy Version Booster, 10 foot fairings diameter.) The Delta II Heavy no longer flies today, but has advanced planetary science and astrophysics (Such as MER Opportunity, MESSENGER, Dawn, Spitzer, GLAST, GRAIL, etc.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have included a Cryogenic vent port for fashion, (The real rocket contains such) and Is activated with 1. I have been able to make a better interstage, and I have thrust taper on my GEM-46 rendition. With the Grail Probes, I have no hinges for the spacecraft, but you can likely build them with infernal Robotics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/NpFCw\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
