Is there any way to do that using the save files? any help would be appreciated, if you need craft files I can post them later.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthanks in advance\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-26T02:54:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, it should be fairly simple.\u00A0 If the offending fuel tank is not the root part, just detach everything aft of it and set it aside.\u00A0 Then junk the fuel tank, attach the desired cargo bay,and reattach the previously removed parts from there aft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the offending fuel tank is the root part, just re-root the ship to some part in front of the fuel tank then follow the above procedure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf\u00A0 you have wing and such attached radially to the offending fuel tank but not to anything else, then you\u0027ll have to rebuild that part of the ship to attach them to the sides of the cargo bay.\u00A0 But such is life.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-26T14:31:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s pretty delicate to operate on sfs for this matter, but not that hard.
