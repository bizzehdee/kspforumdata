I\u2019m going to apologize in advance if I\u2019m not posting this on the correct platform, \u00A0(I\u2019m new) but I have an issue with building my rover. Whenever I try and switch from Mirror to radial symmetry, it automatically switches back to mirror when I go to place down my wheels. The reason I need radial symmetry is because Mirror makes the wheels inverted and unable to drive. How do I fix this? *NOTE: I am on a console, not PC\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-04-17T22:40:40Z\u0022 title=\u002204/17/2018 10:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EApril 17, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Haydn Dailey\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Goody1981","CreatedById":153740,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-17T23:37:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi there, a pic would help but usually that happens when you\u2019re trying to attach the wheels\u00A0to something else that\u2019s already been radially\u00A0attached. You can\u2019t have mirror symmetry on a part you\u2019re attaching to a part that\u2019s been attached in radial symmetry (confusing sentence - hope that makes sense).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo fix, you can remove the part you\u2019re attaching the wheels to, and put it back on in mirror symmetry, then the wheels will attach in mirror symmetry.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr, you can place the wheels one at a time, and use the move/rotate widgets with angle snap, in absolute\u00A0mode, to get the wheels properly aligned.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-04-17T23:39:28Z\u0022 title=\u002204/17/2018 11:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EApril 17, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Goody1981\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
