And that\u0027s basically means a photon drive or equivalent. So while Q-thruster can and should work, its efficiency cannot exceed 300MW/N. There are experiments suggesting higher efficiency, but I find them very doubtful. We\u0027ll see, I guess, but I wouldn\u0027t expect anything out of it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mazon Del","CreatedById":32991,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-12T16:23:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAw, sad. I thought this was some new information on the subject. That said, on Friday I managed to find a video from November (late Nov? I forget) that was a very nicely detailed video from Harold White himself on the NASA test results and current setup as well with some great info. Turns out one reason why NASA\u0027s gear was operating at low power compared with the Chinese experiments was their system was being designed to have as few physical connections as possible. The power and signal moves through liquid wires (basically a tray of some conductive liquid and the test article itself had prongs going into it). Systems like this were described as only being particularly compact with low power, an increased size would mean a larger vacuum chamber would be required. They give some pretty good images to show how cramped that test chamber was. In other news, as of November, they DID receive their vacuum rated RF source.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cirocco","CreatedById":100285,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-12T16:29:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eif I recall correctly NASA did conclude that it might be possible, but more investigation is required.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eif this does prove to be possible, then it could be pretty huge for deep-space probes.
