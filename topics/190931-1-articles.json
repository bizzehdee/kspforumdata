The octo-girder, that the 4 arms attach to, was set as root in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E. As I said though, each of the individual arms launch as a separate craft, with it\u0027s own root. As mentioned, lots of empty docking ports (more and more as each arm is attached!). These are Konstruction weldable ports but I don\u0027t think it matters according to 5thHoreseman\u0027s statement (I did start this search for answers at the \u0022Konstruction!\u0022 mod forum, but the more replies I got, the more it seems to be more than just a single cause). Each arm\u0027s \u0022inner\u0022 octo-girder section (the one with the port on it) is set to auto-strut to root part, the other parts, including the other (outer) octo-girder, are all set to grandparent as is everything else on the central stack other than the previously mentioned \u0022root\u0022 part. You\u0027ll also notice a smaller amount of lights on the previous version...the increased lighting on the new version is, I\u0027m guessing another additive to the slow down? You\u0027ll notice how many tanks I had managed to attach on the previous version, possibly covering up \u0022empty\u0022 ports and reducing the slowdown with each additional tank. I started over as the portable strutting on the old version was getting out of control and trying to attach a portable strut during EVA also resulted in parts coming off, at time, but not always.

I\u0027ve been using struts, of one type or the other to 1. keep these parts together during launch, which is a primary concern. Without struts, the various parts wobble like an earthworm during launch and orbit insertion...and sometimes with spectacularly disastrous result...very \u0022kerbal like\u0022. 2. To try and fend off the Kraken once the station is built and very large ships dock for refueling. I\u0027m open to trying anything, at this point.

This begs a question, is there a way to turn certain banks of lights on and off while not affecting others? The other 2 arms will still be attached but will not have docking ports...I can use them as a place for portable struts if the tanks start to get \u0022wobblies\u0022.

I\u0027ve reduced the amount of \u0022open\u0022 docking ports by only putting them on 2 of the 4 arms. In hindsight my original design was overly complicated and the new design results in the same amount of fuel/LOx available. The other 2 arms are now used to store fuel (in the octo-girders they are made from) and as an attachment points for portable struts from the tanks mounted on the other 2 arms. The struts may not be necessary...but most times I\u0027ve said that in the past, a Kraken visits...sooooo. I\u0027ve also reduced the amount of \u0022open\u0022 docking ports by only attaching one arm with them and then covering 4 of the ports with tanks, and welding them. In the screenshot below I\u0027ve got 2 tank sets attached and will bring up 2 more before launching the other arm that has ports. The reduction of \u0022open\u0022 docking ports seems to have been the single biggest help with the previous issues with the induced physics warp in previous station building attempts.
