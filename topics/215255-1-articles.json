When a rocket is loaded onto any launch pad, the camera acts weird. Instead of panning around the rocket when you move the mouse side to side, the camera instead tilts left to right depending on the mouse movement. This issue only occurs when loading from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E.
