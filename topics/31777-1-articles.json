I recently decided start working on my first releasable plugin, and the following question came to mind:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow many people (if any) actually like Unity\u0027s (and by extension KSP\u0027s) message system and how many would prefer it stuck to Events and Delegates like a normal C# program? Personally, the message system drives me up a wall. Would people want the devs to expose Events for key occurrences such as OnFlightStart and OnPartDestroyed? Are some people unfamiliar with Events and more comfortable with messages?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
