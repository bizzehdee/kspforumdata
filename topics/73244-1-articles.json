Jeb has just returned from a testing mission, examining the capabilities of the FourJade ion lander planned to land on Pol and Bop, as well as those of the landerprobes. Soon, the launches shall begin, and the FourJade ship will be assembled in Kerbin orbit. I shall begin this report with an explanation of the FourJade mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOur examination of the data from a probe previously sent to Laythe and the Jool system has revealed the startling strength of gravity of Tylo - and more importantly, its lack of atmosphere. Our engineers do not feel sufficiently prepared to construct a safe Tylo lander at this time, and while an indepth, multiprobe examination mission could be sent out, Commander Jebadiah Kerman is of the opinion that it would be a wasted opportunity not to send a mission to land on the other four moons of Jool. As such, we prepare. A transfer ship and lifter have been constructed, prepared to carry three veteran kerbonauts to Jool along with the landers. A Mun lander has been given additional thrust and fuel, rendering it more than capable of hovering on Kerbin: this will land on Vall. So, Laythe, Pol and Bop remained.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPrevious testing and improvement connected with the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/76915-Redundancy-is-King-A-Duna-landing-%28Pic-Heavy%29?p=1114553\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1114553\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ERedKing\u003C/a\u003E mission has created a lander that can descend from Kerbin orbit, land on parachutes alone, then ascend back to Kerbin orbit, and from there, even transfer to the Mun. This lander has been slightly tweaked, and is now the FourJade Laythe lander. Its capsule also serves as an ion lander - and this is what Jebadiah has been testing over the last few weeks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first liftoff showed a small problem: probe cores had been left off the two lander probes that were also to be tested.

As such, coordinating the transfers from Kerbin orbit to Mun and Minmus was difficult and tedious: the cause of sleepless nights for several in mission control. Several times, burns were within minutes of each other, and windows were missed due to an overestimation of how long the probes could fire their engines at full thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/96Jhs1.png\u0022 alt=\u002296Jhs1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/ZGfZ7O.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ZGfZ7O.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Mun probe in particular had to make some drastic adjustments to its orbit in the hopes of getting into the Mun\u0027s sphere of influence.

As it is said, if the component would not come to the ship, the ship would have to go to the component. And so, using the remaining fuel in the final lifter stage, it did so. Once orbits were matched and the distance was less than a kilometre, it was time to remove the final lifter stage, as it would be in the way of the docking port. So it deorbited itself, and docking continued.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/isNV4F.png\u0022 alt=\u0022isNV4F.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is a matter of days before the Jool window.

First, an escape burn was planned that just barely escaped Laythe\u0027s SOI. If the escape was directly prograde, the resulting Jool orbit would take Bill out past Tylo without a hope of a Vall encounter, so its position had to be somewhat fiddled with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/FtnprF.png\u0022 alt=\u0022FtnprF.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/IZ0pUu.png\u0022 alt=\u0022IZ0pUu.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, the monopropellant in the small tanks that were blocking the ion engines had to be used up, so they could be staged away. Then, it was time for a series of burns on the trio of ion engines. Low power generation (a total of 11 RTGs and 3 OX-STAT panels) meant that they couldn\u0027t thrust at full power for very long, though they could keep up one-third throttle indefinitely. As such, it took three burns to escape.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/3ZNhgY.png\u0022 alt=\u00223ZNhgY.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/SmLxg4.png\u0022 alt=\u0022SmLxg4.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe trajectory at Vall was coming in retrograde, so Bill set up a maneuver in Jool orbit to move it through the moon to the other side.

It was decided that the best way to get the ship close to Jool would be to perform a gravity assist downwards at Tylo, and then later perform one upwards to get out of such a close, atmosphere-scraping orbit. These would give Bob the opportunity to visit Tylo and take reports there - something unique that Bill and Jeb hadn\u0027t done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/aCrcEW.png\u0022 alt=\u0022aCrcEW.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHis Laythe escape burn was not all that long after Bill\u0027s on his journey to Vall: it had been noted that Bill could have had a Tylo encounter if he stopped his burn to Vall partway.

This site was chosen for a number of reasons: it was there, there would be sunlight for the solar panels, and a lack of landing lights made the ability to see the lander\u0027s shadow an extremely valuable tool. Additionally, Mission Control wanted a picture of him standing with the landing probe on an alien surface. This probably didn\u0027t factor into his decision in the slightest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/qEnXri.png\u0022 alt=\u0022qEnXri.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/1wb1yy.png\u0022 alt=\u00221wb1yy.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/OViBt9.png\u0022 alt=\u0022OViBt9.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe landing ended up being straight down, and was extremely smooth and gentle.
