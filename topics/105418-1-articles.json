The programs I was using to try and it send it to the system tray were run with lesser rights. \n\n1.0 works great. Uses 1.2Gb RAM at startup, great FPS and so on. No problems to report ingame. \n\nHowever, I have a problem when trying to minimize the game to the system tray.\n\nYou see the date and time on the bottom right of your screen? There are a few icons next to it. Most people have the battery/power on their laptop, wifi bars, a spinning Avast icon... this is the System Tray.\n\nI use Iconize 2.0.0.4 to add running programs to the toolbar. Most extensively, I use it for Google Chrome. Right click on Iconize, select Google Chrome and it minimizes to a tiny Chrome logo you can double click to restore. \n\nKSP 0.90 allowed me to do the same. Switch to the Desktop or a non-fullscreen application, right click on Iconize and select KSP to store it away as a tiny icon on the bottom right toolbar. Other applications, such as Alien: Isolation, World of Tanks, Mechwarrior:Online all can be minimized this way.\n\nHowever, a few applications don\u0027t. They briefly appear as icons in the System Tray, then reappear in their regular minimized forms (large Icon \u002B title in Taskbar at the bottom of the screen).\n\nKSP 1.0 is one of them now. It doesn\u0027t stay in the system tray anymore. It \u0027iconizes\u0027 for a brief second before restoring itself to the taskbar.\n\nIs there any solution to this?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-01T13:29:05Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2015 01:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TruthQuark**"},{"CreatedByName":"Harry Rhodan","CreatedById":119953,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T23:19:18Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Is there any solution to this?\n\nHave you tried starting it with the option -popupwindow?"},{"CreatedByName":"MatterBeam","CreatedById":133334,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T00:29:54Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Have you tried starting it with the option -popupwindow?\n\nNo that didn\u0027t work ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\nMinimizing from fullscreen had no effect.
