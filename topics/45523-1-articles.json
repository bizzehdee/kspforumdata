And since the Avionics Package doesn\u0027t even provide extra torque (which you also would\u0027t need for such a small probe) you can remove it completely and still have the same functions for your probe, saving weight and therefore having more delta-v for your probe. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"that1guy","CreatedById":14276,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-10T17:53:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn response to your SAS informataion, all I have to say is \u0022oops\u0022 \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E I guess I should pay more attention to updates\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Eskarina","CreatedById":79945,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-25T04:30:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice video and nice explanations.
