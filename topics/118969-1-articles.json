This scramjet will mostly work like a real life one in that it doesn\u0027t produce thrust at zero, or even at low speeds. You will need to accelerate to at least mach 1 before it starts to work, and higher if you want it to produce any significant amount of thrust. Once at around mach 5 however, it will give enough acceleration to shoot a plane into space at near orbital velocity at apoapsis. Real life scramjets will not work until around mach 5, however I decided to lower the threshold for a few reasons. The first one is that the speeds needed in KSP are much lower than in real life. Low Kerbin Orbital speed is a little more than 2km/s, while LEO speed is about 8km/s. There aren\u0027t many air breathing engines that will get you to mach 5 in KSP so that\u0027s another reason to lower the threshold. Last, but not least. It\u0027s possible that some scramjets could work like ramjets below mach 5, still no thrust at low speeds, but no need to actually go hypersonic before it works so it\u0027s assumed this is one of those. See video below for a quick guide.

I hadn\u0027t noticed I missed changing the X axis when doing the graph, fixed it now! Well and about the altitude thing yeah, and actually the atmCurve (which I didn\u0027t post here) and the intake speed value are made so it can perform for a while in the upper reaches of the atmosphere. Up there you can easily go at mach 7 without exploding. I the video there was some minor explosion, I\u0027m actually not sure exactly what exploded because the ship still looks fine, but yeah, should\u0027ve probably pitched up to the upper atomosphere faster to avoid overheating\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mariohm1311","CreatedById":114131,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-21T19:55:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs if we didn\u0027t have enough OP engines, now there is a \u0022scramjet\u0022...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nestor_d","CreatedById":138673,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-21T20:42:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022mariohm1311\u0022 data-cite=\u0022mariohm1311\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAs if we didn\u0027t have enough OP engines, now there is a \u0022scramjet\u0022...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell yeah, but scramjets are actually a thing in real life. But to try to counter the possible OP-ness of such an engine I gave it a rather low specific impulse as far as air-breathing which is in line with the performance of real scramjets. It\u0027s also rather expensive heavy-ish and not very versatile in terms of how it can be used since it\u0027s radial attachment, rather large and it can\u0027t be used as the only means of propulsion.

If you put two of this on a heavy Mk3 plane you will not get much more than a TWR of 4, which seems reasonable. Also, I technically did lower the max speed, which is projected to be up to mach 25, but in any case, given the drop in thrust after mach 8.8 and with altitude, i seriously doubt it\u0027s even possible to go past mach 12. And as I said on the original post, it\u0027s not that I lowered the threshold speed just because, a proposed feature of scramjet engines is that they will have variable geometry so they can work as ramjets at low supersonic speed and then transition to scramjet at higher speed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mariohm1311","CreatedById":114131,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-25T18:07:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022nestor_d\u0022 data-cite=\u0022nestor_d\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell yes, it has a TWR of 2 when it\u0027s mounted on a launch vehicle, so it\u0027s not the scramjet itself that is so heavy.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, you\u0027re wrong.
