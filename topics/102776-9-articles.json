You will see that now the body is in a fixed spot over the surface. Now apply a particle effect from the parent planet to the Phantom body and make sure the jetstream is very tiny and the particles are tiny as well. Next, trough some texture trickery, find in the textures, the spot your Phantom body and thus the volcano is and modify it to get a real volcano terrain. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf this doesn\u0027t work try this: move the Phantom body under the surface and create a second one high up over the planet than apply a particle effect between the two. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far I got this working on Kerbol Plus, but I still don\u0027t know what parameter to modify in order to make the Phantom bodies synchronise rotation with parent body.
