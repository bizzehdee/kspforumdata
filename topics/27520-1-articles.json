The boosters have parachutes so that they\u0027ll come down relatively soft somewhere on Kerbin and the transfer stage probe body has parachutes and a heat shield for re-entry and landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow on this particular design the only reason the transfer stage has a probe body is because I don\u0027t want to leave the debris sitting in orbit, so the probe uses the little bit of fuel left to return to Kerbin. Then the probe will decouple from the actual transfer stage, using the heat shield and parachute to return safely to the surface. (Note once the probe decouples from the transfer stage, the transfer stage becomes debris and is no longer considered a \u0022component\u0022.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only reason I like to return the boosters is because the only difference it makes is swapping out nose cones for parachutes, which isn\u0027t really a problem. (And it of course means that we can theoretically go collect the boosters and re-purpose them, however I don\u0027t actually recover the boosters because the game removes them before they can actually land. The only thing I do actually recover is Kerbals, so far I rarely do manned missions and when I do I make sure they land within about 10 - 15km of KSC for easier recovery.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/74725194/re-useable%2002.png\u0022 alt=\u0022re-useable%2002.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/74725194/re-useable%2001.png\u0022 alt=\u0022re-useable%2001.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-19T13:40:22Z\u0022 title=\u002205/19/2013 01:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 19, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by CoriW\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Panichio","CreatedById":2858,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-19T13:45:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022CoriW\u0022 data-cite=\u0022CoriW\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESometimes people like to set rules for themselves in order to increase the challenge of KSP.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m pretty sure he was joking. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CoriW","CreatedById":57866,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-19T13:51:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Panichio\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Panichio\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m pretty sure he was joking. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah I caught on right after I replied to it. xD\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn another note I\u0027ve tweaked my \u0022Rules and Regulations\u0022 a little bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChanged (3) from this...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E3) Reusable.
