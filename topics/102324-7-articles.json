At least after such an incident, the hydrogen will disperse extremely rapidly, rather than pool and build up like gas, or burst into flames like pierced batteries are often warrant to do. The hydrogen may ignite also, but at no greater risk than other fuels - petrol in particular can be a rather nasty, sticking flame, while hydrogen will burn quite intensely, but very rapidly and dispersed, generally completely consuming itself without causing major damage.

I\u0027ll point out the Fukushima incident, during which a reactor building got blown apart - by hydrogen buildup. In a building that did not have a PEM operating to generate hydrogen, this hydrogen was simply split from water by the heat of an idle reactor, and was sufficient to pretty well destroy the building. Nuclear reactors don\u0027t like changing load, so if you simply modify all reactors we have to generate hydrogen in down cycles, rather than just a few for which it\u0027s most profitable, we have lots of hydrogen, created at high pressure, at fairly negligible cost. Perhaps this won\u0027t be enough to power a full switchover to hydrogen vehicles, but it can power many of them, enough to make them viable on the roads, which will then encourage a clean hydrogen industry to be developed by the fact there\u0027s demand for it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn terms of the performance offered to a road vehicle for a rechargable energy storage that can be supplied by whatever large scale power plant is suitable, hydrogen is unmatched - massively lighter, considerably smaller, and allows a long range in a package that will fit inside a normal-looking car.

We don\u0027t have issues with this, so it\u0027s perfectly acceptable to assume that hydrogen will have similar requirements, and that bar awful maintenance or tampering, 0% will enter the cabin.

(0.8 kg/L) Assuming a low fuel cell efficiency of 60%, and hydrogen will happily match that energetic content with only 24 kg of fuel. This also discounts that a fuel cell vehicle would have a small battery and regenerative braking, so to match range with that 60 gallon tank would use even less fuel. By your numbers, you only need to be sure at least 9/10ths of the hydrogen will go elsewhere in case of a leak to have no problems whatsoever.

You also won\u0027t get 2 kW with roof panels, unless you\u0027re going to say your car is 10 m^2 and on the equator for its entire life, and the hydrogen car can do this just as easily, so is no advantage specifically for electric cars.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit as I just recalled asking about why hydrogen is not used for aircraft: no infrastructure. There\u0027s a plenty large hydrocarbon infrastructure that can provide enough fuel for planes, so that\u0027s what\u0027s used as it\u0027s easiest. Hydrogen will be more efficient after a switchover, but airlines are cost-driven and with the tiny infrastructure and few places that actually have large hydrogen quantities, a hydrogen plane would have no place to fuel up and cost far more, so there\u0027s no interest as is. Interest will be generated after a hydrogen industry drives cost down and depleting fossil fuels drives hydrocarbon fuel cost up. Electric will have no interest from airliner manufacturers as it cannot even slightly provide the energy and mass requirements, while hydrogen can, so hydrogen will be the fuel of choice after fossil fuel depletion becomes more severe. At least, assuming we don\u0027t have miniature fusion devices by that point, but it seems unlikely - the European fusion committee isn\u0027t looking at even large tokamaks being commercial until the early 2040\u0027s at best.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-13T12:05:34Z\u0022 title=\u002204/13/2015 12:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Iskierka\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AngelLestat","CreatedById":58968,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T15:09:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kohai_Khaos\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kohai_Khaos\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA tank of any size exploding is going to be catastrophic.

Diesel has an ever so slightly lower specific energy than gasoline, but diesel engines can hit efficiencies of 50%, which would mean you\u0027d need about double that amount of hydrogen to match a high-efficiency diesel engine with a 60 gallon tank (plus some more, because diesel\u0027s higher density means it holds about 11% more energy per gallon over gasoline).

I guess it\u0027s lucky we\u0027re talking about 60 gallon tanks, which you should only really find on \u0022small\u0022 big trucks, and bigger models already pack things like 200 and 500 gallon tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen again, Lestat does keep saying that bigger vehicles are what\u0027s going to be ideal for hydrogen.

For equal capacity and range, the hydrogen car will weigh much less, and thus require less energy to begin with - it\u0027s far more likely that they\u0027ll have rather comparable efficiency in terms of transport capability per energy at well, or possibly even favour hydrogen, at least at longer ranges that many people will desire.
