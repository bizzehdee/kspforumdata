This is a tutorial so I would assume that it would dictate fuel consumption. I do the initial burn toward the moon and it cits the engines when the timer ends. I delete my precious manuver so I can warp to the blue marker which then starts the enter moon orbit portion. I can move the throttle up and down no problem, the engines simply won\u0027t come on. I can easily turn the ship after I pick a manuver that makes sense to me. I know something isn\u0027t right because the \u0022next\u0022 won\u0027t light up, but for the life of me, the instructions are so poor, I have no idea what is needed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe bar on the right is bright green so I assume I have fuel and there was no instruction to drop a stage.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have reloaded the simulation probably 10 times.
