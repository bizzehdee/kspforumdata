The drop in apoapsis is to be expected immediately after SRB separation as it was the case with the real shuttle, whose TWR was less than 1 after SRB sep, but rose back to 1 soon. Another thing you could try would be to activate the RCS after SRB separation, if you aren\u0027t doing that already. Beyond that, all I can say for now is to keep experimenting.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd what about the amount of fuel in the tank?

What I did was build the orbiter out of stock parts to get a mass for the orbiter. I then took the gross mass of the full STS stack, and the mass of the real orbiter, determined what percentage of the total STS gross mass was the orbiter. Knowing that percentage I could calculate the remaining scaled down mass of the STS in KSP. I then used the gross mass of the real External Tank and SRBs to determine their percentage shares of the remaining mass. I then used the real gross mass-to-empty mass ratios for the ET and SRBs to determine the empty mass and propellant masses for the KSP parts. I then determined how much thrust the vehicle would have to have to possess the same TWR at liftoff, and then determined through percentages the thrust of the SRBs and SSMEs. If your method works, that\u0027s awesome.

It is something that I had constant trouble with, especially if there is no payload. The easiest time I have had getting it to orbit is with a payload in the bay, and only using the pitch controls, and barely using the SAS after SRB separation. If you attempt to yaw, or roll the shuttle after SRB sep, it usually goes into a tumble that is unrecoverable, even using RCS and SAS. MechJeb isn\u0027t particularly helpful as it will attempt to correct any yaw and roll and will cause the vehicle to tumble. I tried multiple things to try and fix the tumble that all proved unsuccessful. I disabled roll and yaw control in the ailerons, and pitch and roll control in the rudder during ascent, as I believed the rudder was trying to participate in the SAS\u0027s pitching causing the initial yaw and thus the tumble. This did not help. I tried disabling the control surfaces altogether during ascent, which didn\u0027t help. I even tried using the control surfaces module on the engines to try and select only pitch control for the SSMEs. I was able to get the engines to use ModuleControlSurface in place of ModuleGimbal, and get them only to work for pitching the vehicle. None of these efforts was successful. Only when I placed a decent payload in the bay did it get to be any kind of controllable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe TWR after SRB separation is quite terrible, but it can reach orbit. I don\u0027t believe that KSP models pressure thrust, which might make things a little better. Feel free to play with the numbers and if you find good values for propellant load, thrust, Isp let me know. I welcome any and all balancing tips. I have the station modules modeled and textured and with very basic IVAs, and I\u0027m still working on the PMA and CBMs. Work is slow as the school year has started.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sgt.Shutesie","CreatedById":141397,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-07T02:42:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo today I returned to attempting a shuttle that looked nice and performed, but this time left all the stats on the tank and SRBs the same.
