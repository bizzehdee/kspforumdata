It will be a token burn, something like 10m/s or less, but burning retrograde at a low periapsis of Mun saves a lot of delta-V versus trying to get an orbit from a distant flyby. Don\u0027t make the corrective burn to match the appointed delta-V, just aim at the node target, open the throttle minimally (don\u0027t worry about the time, during the transfer fifteen minutes this or that way is insignificant) and (still with Mun in focus) observe how your actual orbit changes.

Sharpy\u0027s advice covers this this pretty well. Fine-tuning your orbit for low munar periapsis doesn\u0027t require much dV from your rocket if you do it early when you\u0027re still a long distance from the Mun. (Reason for wanting the low periapsis: to save fuel, it\u0027s an efficient use of dV for the next step.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 2: Orbit Mun. As you approach, set a maneuver node right at periapsis that burns retrograde until you are in a very low circular orbit. Do this burn when you get to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E(I\u0027m assuming here that your kerbonaut is pretty much on the equator, and you\u0027re approaching in the equatorial plane, so that you don\u0027t have to do any inclination adjustments on approach-- if that\u0027s not the case, you\u0027ll have some additional work to do before descending.)\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 3: F5. This next step is tricky and you may need a few tries. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 4: Begin descent. This will be trickier for the rescue than it was for your first mission, since you care about where you land (don\u0027t want your poor kerbonaut to have to walk dozens of kilometers or more...) Set your stranded kerbonaut\u0027s vessel as your target. Wait until you\u0027re maybe 30 longitude degrees west of target, then place a maneuver node around 10 degrees west or so from the target\u0027s location. This will be a retrograde burn that puts you on a descending trajectory to impact the Mun near the target. Make it so that the projected impact point is a smidgeon east of your target (i.e. so that you\u0027re projected to overshoot slightly, like a km or two).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 5: Pre-landing. This is the most critical and tricky part, since it eats up the most dV, and if it\u0027s not done \u0022just so\u0022, has the most potential for Bad Things (waste lots of fuel, land too far from target, crash). The ideal way to land is called a \u0022suicide burn\u0022, and involves waiting until the last possible moment and then starting a hard burn that brings you to a stop right at the surface. That\u0027s a hard thing to judge, since if you start your burn too early you waste fuel, and if you wait too long you go splat. Here\u0027s a handy way to set it up: Place a maneuver node right precisely at the surface of the Mun, at your projected impact point. Drag the retrograde handle and just hold it there until the projected orbit shrinks to nothing and the prograde/retrograde markers on the node start flipping back and forth. Look at the \u0022estimated burn time\u0022 indicator on your nav ball. You\u0027ll start your burn when it\u0027s a bit less than that time remaining until the node-- for example, if the indicator says that the estimated burn is 20 seconds, you\u0027d wait until you\u0027re, say, 16 seconds or so before the manuever to start the burn. When you\u0027re burning, keep your craft pointed \u003Cstrong\u003Esurface\u003C/strong\u003E retrograde, and burn until your surface velocity has reduced to something manageable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 6: Landing. At this point, if the tricky and finicky previous step was done just right, you\u0027ll be moving pretty slowly and mostly vertically, not very far above the surface. Now just land as you would normally do. Hopefully you\u0027ve got plenty of fuel left for the return trip. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy landings!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wemb","CreatedById":121979,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T08:36:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother tip, if you\u0027re not flying with some aids, it can be hard to judge how far the ground is - keep an eyeout for your shadow as you get close to landing.

I\u0027d aim for at least a thrust/weight ratio (TWR) of at least 1.2, but as long as you don\u0027t add a significant amount of mass by switching to bigger engines, a higher TWR never hurts (or in other words: the higher the TWR, the more fuel efficient your burns against gravity become).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile I\u0027m a huge fan of doing the math manually, I can also recommend the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/54533-0-23-VOID-Vessel-Orbital-Informational-Display\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EVOID\u003C/a\u003E mod.

Below 1 km I tend to decelerate even further - around 10 m/s. Of course I always try to keep the retrograde marker pointing directly upwards.
