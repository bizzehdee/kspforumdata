Then you have stuff like this in Unity\n\nParent\n\n-Object1\n\n--mesh\n\n--mesh\n\n--mesh\n\n--mesh\n\n-Object2\n\n--mesh\n\n--mesh\n\nSomething like that. And each object has an animation but they are each different like it would originally be like this if you had all animations on one object.\n\n-Default Take (depends on how you export it)\n\n-Shroud\n\n-LandingGear\n\nBut with 2 objects you would have:\n\nObject 1\n\n-Default Take\n\n-Shroud\n\nObject 2\n\n-Default Take\n\n-LandingGear\n\nI hope this wasn\u0027t too confusing because I didn\u0027t know that much on how to explain it."},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-02T21:16:24Z","Content":"TBH I don\u0027t even understand what the problem was in the first place."}]}
