(even with radically improved materials, something like this couldn\u0027t be expected to fly more than a few thousand meters above the lowest-altitude parts of Mars with surface elevations below the nominal \u0022sea level\u0022 of Mars...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr would it be worthwhile to go with something like a biplane or even triplane design to obtain lower wing-loading and better aspect-ratio? (the Helios H-1 wings were 11.5 inches from front to back. \u00A0With a biplane design, a better aspect-ratio could be achieved by making the wings thinner, to obtain similar wing-area while extending just as far from the Center of Mass...) \u00A0This was actually a design-strategy in some early aircraft that allowed higher altitude-ceiling, climb-rate,\u00A0and better maneuverability on some early fighter designs at the expense of top speed- and on Mars, where attitude-ceiling would be the driving design-constraint, this would probably be a worthwhile tradeoff as well...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlternatively, if provided with electric supersonic\u00A0jet engines (similar to what Elon Musk likes to fancifully talk about today) or even nuclear-thermal supersonic turbojets, a better strategy might be to opt for speed instead of low wing-loading to keep winged aircraft airborne. \u00A0This would require slightly futuristic propulsion methods, but there is nothing about the laws of physics that forbids obtaining your propulsion energy from batteries, solar panels, fuel-cells, and/or a tiny\u00A0nuclear reactor instead of combustion. ..\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSupersonic design concepts might also be aided by breakthroughs in airframe design, if the Japan/MIT concept of a supersonic biplane ever comes to fruition- in which two wings are placed such that the shockwaves from each destructively interfere with each other, producing less than half the wave drag of a comparable wing-area monoplane and reduced sonic-boom. \u00A0However these designs have significant\u00A0difficulty with low-speed flight, and while they might be able to fly perfectly well at low altitudes on Mars, would probably have extremely high takeoff and landing speeds that would require impractically long and smooth runways for even the lightest of craft...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese ideas might all seem fanciful or even impossible, but they are not so pie-in-the sky as one might think, and I would appreciate if all individuals responding to this post keep the discussion optimistic and non-critical.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet me repeat myself-\u00A0these concepts are on the very edge of what is possible, and many of you may feel they are *impossible*. \u00A0I do not mean this as a form of backseat or pre-emptive moderation, but I would appreciate if those of you who are critics and cynics\u00A0respect those of us who would like to have a positive\u00A0discussion of this concept,\u00A0by refraining from quickly jumping to make such statements-\u00A0as they will drown out all other discussion if you do not control yourselves from making highly-critical statements to this effect. \u00A0Out of respect for myself and other forum users, please avoid\u00A0statements here\u00A0to the effect that flight on Mars is impossible- the\u00A0assumption that most people probably hold, and this discussion is meant to reconsider.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegards,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNorthstar\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-01-05T23:08:58Z\u0022 title=\u002201/05/2017 11:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 5, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cubinator","CreatedById":150330,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-05T23:12:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think with Mars\u0027\u00A0(is it Mars\u0027 or Mars\u0027s?
