For Jool or Kerbin-Mun-Minmus, the primary (Jool or Kerbin) is large enough that even if you implemented my system it would look very much like the current system, except there would be VoI boundaries between the \u0022inner\u0022 region and the \u0022outer\u0022 region for each pair of bodies that essentially did nothing. That\u0027s why I think we should leave any planetary system with mass ratios above Duna/Ike levels alone and use the current system, since implementing my system there would only add extra VoI transitions which didn\u0027t act very differently at all from the current system. It would just be confusing for no reason.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf (for an example of how this would work, I\u0027m not suggesting this)you made the Mun much more massive, you could implement my system for the Kerbin-Mun pair, since Minmus would be in the outer region and would just orbit the barycenter with no difficulties. You could also (although this is probably unrealistic from a stability perspective) have smaller moons orbiting either the beefier Mun or Kerbin such that they stayed within the VoI of one or the other. Think of Minmus in low Kerbin orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother hypothetical: What if we gave one of the forthcoming new gas giants a binary moon system? It could have two moons of equal mass orbiting one another very closely as their barycenter orbited the gas giant. As you approached this binary mun from orbit around the gas giant, you would first transition to the binary mun\u0027s barycenter\u0027s SoI, which would be determined exactly like the current system using the mass and semi-major axis of the binary pair\u0027s orbit about the gas giant to determine it\u0027s size. Then as you got closer, you would transition to the \u0022inner\u0022 region of the binary and my system would be used to determine which VoI you were in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYet another, even more wacky proposal would be to have one large body and two smaller ones - say Duna and two Ikes. If you put both Ikes in orbit around Duna separately, you could use the current system and it would be ok. But imagine placing the Ikes in a binary! Their combined mass would make the mass-ratio about 8:1 (Duna to Ike\u002BIke), which would be perfect for using my system. So on an incoming trajectory from interplanetary space you would enter the Duna/Ikes barycenter VoI first, then (assuming you\u0027re going to aerobrake at Duna) you enter the inner region of the Duna/Ikes system on the Duna side and you are only affected by Duna\u0027s gravity. You aerobrake to be captured but your leave your apoapsis high enough that you enter the Ikes side of the Duna/Ikes inner region and enter the VoI of the Ike/Ike barycenter object. Then, as you approach one of the Ikes, you enter its inner region and solo VoI. That would certainly be confusing, and the conic patch draw limit had better be set pretty high or it will be hard to see what\u0027s going to happen next, but it would work perfectly well in my system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo basically, you can do whatever you want with my system so long as you have at most two mutually-orbiting objects (barycenters included) in any given system which share a given order of magnitude of mass.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"chaos_forge","CreatedById":64960,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-18T20:15:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHorn Brain is exactly right with, the small exception that it *would* be possible to have 3 objects of equal mass, if they follow an orbit like this: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/orbit3.gif\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/orbit3.gif\u003C/a\u003E (essentially two stars orbit each other, and the third orbits the close pair from a significantly larger distance).
