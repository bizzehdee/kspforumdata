As part of a school project we will be using our telescope to try to discover new extragalactic supernovas. Does anyone have any suggestions as to where to look? I think it might be a good idea to look somewhere close to Polaris as it will be visibile all year long, and at the same time somewhere far away from (possibly perpendicular to) the galactic plane, so that it should be easier to see galaxies (I think). However I have never done anything of this kind so I\u0027m really not sure.
