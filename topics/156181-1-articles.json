When I try to do a rendezvous I get an encounter, usually \u0026lt;1 km, but when I go out of map mode and look around for it I can\u0027t see it, it usually tells me the distance between our ships, but it didn\u0027t,\u00A0I used the navball to point at it, and lined my camera up with it I couldn\u0027t see it, I tried getting closer the retrograde vector to slow down then burning towards it, so I got my encounter down to .1 km, but when I finally was able to see it it still wouldn\u0027t show me the distance. I only have MechJeb installed, so I tried uninstalling it but it still wouldn\u0027t work. It worked up until I installed MechJeb. I\u0027m worried that it overwrote some file that gives me the distance, but I don\u0027t want to reinstall it and lose all my saves, although I could just copy the save file, but that might be the corrupted part. I haven\u0027t been able to do any rendezvous and dock. Please Help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Harry Rhodan","CreatedById":119953,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-09T11:30:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nF4 enables/disables ship labels.
