You can then throttle down on the engines to make the most use of the chutes and the airbrakes so they get maximized until it is safe to use the regular chutes but saving that extra fuel will be more risky and everything goes pretty quick. The added benefit is that if you land at 5-7k elevation it saves you a few thousand meters of flight on your ascent off Serran!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAirbrakes by 61K, engine assist down to below 500m/s to deploy drogues, combination drogue\u002Bengine down below 200m/s for the blue chutes. In the VAB I changed the deployment settings for all my parachutes to be half the time of the defaults. Depending on when you start burning in the atmosphere to green light the drogues, your distance between greenlighting the first chutes and when you land could be 1500m or less... You will most likely want engines going all the way until you land, regardless of how your chutes get setup. If you use a mod like SafetyChuteIndicator you can more easily see when it is safe to deploy the chutes so you can more accurately judge what you should be throttling your engines to on your descent. With 3 airbrakes, 3 drogues and 9 side mounted blue chutes- I spent 1.4kdV to land the last time I went for the blue side of Serran (which means my lower throttle all the way down cost more fuel because I was scared, could probably have spent half the dV going for a suicide burn around 8-10K elevation).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have done some testing and there is a limit to how many chutes you can use and still gain any speed reduction at all so it will probably always cost a good amount of fuel to land on the blue side.
