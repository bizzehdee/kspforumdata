But then, I\u0027m in this business for the money, and there was a LOT of it behind this mining gig.\n\nPlus I had been wanting to try my hand at a self-refueling interplanetary-capable ship lately. In fact I had all the calculations done already. So the call of money and challenge were stronger...\n\nI toyed with three different approaches, and finally launched the product of my musings: a 250-ton SSTO-though-not-on-Kerbin behemoth rocket ship equipped with 12 drills, a 2700 ore capacity, ISRU, all the science equipment available including a lab, and enough gigantors to power it all up at once in Kerbin space and hopefully in Duna space too.\n\nShe sports a single KR-L2, giving her a TWR between 0.8 and 1.13 depending on how light I try to fly her. Because she is meant to be self-fueling, I did not bother with RCS and straight up lined her with Verniers instead which make her quite nimble, to my surprise. Launch from Kerbin was done with the help of 300 tons of LF-boosters in onion setup, but I fouled up my imgur and deleted those pics ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\nSo with no further ado, here she is, dwarfing my LKO space station:\n\n![H6mejhW.png](http://i.imgur.com/H6mejhW.png)\n\nI had no scientist available right away, though, and I figured that, instead of getting one from the science station with an Ulysse SSTO, and launching her again in the grand tour spaceship, I\u0027d simply stopover on the way and pick her up. For some reason (a small amount of offset-clipping is my best guess) I couldn\u0027t get KSP to accept clicks on the lander can as transfer destination, and had to EVA\u0027d her across:\n\n![8bVhtlL.png](http://i.imgur.com/8bVhtlL.png)\n\nOnce done, the massive thing headed for its first stop: Minmus. The idea is, she\u0027ll refuel there, and be halfway to everywhere else in the Kerbol system. Minmus is a bit higher in deltaV and cheaper to leave, making it a more efficient stop for fuel than the Mun. I like my missions cheap and efficient like that.\n\n![XYh6ruS.png](http://i.imgur.com/XYh6ruS.png)\n\n![CD03xcm.png](http://i.imgur.com/CD03xcm.png)\n\n![OpYxiyD.png](http://i.imgur.com/OpYxiyD.png)\n\nStill being efficiency-minded I landed her in the Highlands, on top of the tallest peak of Minmus, as that was one of the few biomes unexplored so far:\n\n![Mj9j0ts.png](http://i.imgur.com/Mj9j0ts.png)\n\nMight as well make good use of those science instruments.\n\nFast approach and suicide-burn are most efficient, and thusly:\n\n![ewvK7Hy.png](http://i.imgur.com/ewvK7Hy.png)\n\n![hqRca75.png](http://i.imgur.com/hqRca75.png)\n\n![etunedE.png](http://i.imgur.com/etunedE.png)\n\nEverything up and running for the last Kerbin-bound refill:\n\n![K9BRkt7.png](http://i.imgur.com/K9BRkt7.png)\n\nThe ore concentration turned out a little over 2% only at this altitude, but I was patient enough to not bother relaunching and landing into one of the Flats. Though, not patient enoug hto wait for full ore tanks.\n\n![okWZIrh.png](http://i.imgur.com/okWZIrh.png)\n\n![ONYs3fX.png](http://i.imgur.com/ONYs3fX.png)\n\n![KboVsjJ.png](http://i.imgur.com/KboVsjJ.png)\n\nFrom there on, the crew argued between themselves about their next destination. Liniella, being the only scientist aboard and outnumbered by the two engineers, lost the contest. She wanted to head inwards to Kerbol, but the engineers insisted on paying a visit to their Duna-colonist friends. Also, the intercept was good for Duna, and only tentative for either Eve or Moho.\n\nAlthough I did not initially launch with ore in the tanks (it\u0027s expensive), filling the 2700 tank extends the range of the ship from 4875 to 5200\u002B m/s:\n\n![YdHMgMs.png](http://i.imgur.com/YdHMgMs.png)\n\nHere I\u0027m taking advantage of the wait to Duna injection to convert the half-load of ore leftover from the refueling, to make the launch from Minmus \u0022free as in beer\u0022. Ore has a density of 10, LFO a density of 5, and the conversion ratio is 1:2 so it\u0027s all the same in the end, having ore in store is pretty much equivalent to having an extra tank - as long as you can convert it to fluel in time.\n\n![DymRMyw.png](http://i.imgur.com/DymRMyw.png)\n\nI christened her the Grand Tour Star, for obvious reasons of unimaginativeness.\n\n...and off into the blackness between...\n\n![Cldclx1.png](http://i.imgur.com/Cldclx1.png)\n\nNext stop: Ike ! I got a Periapsis of 450 km and a 312 days transit. Good thing she packs \\*tons\\* of snacks. Also, the science lab has been filled and running since before the Minmus stopover, for extra science points.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-16T15:24:47Z\u0022 title=\u002206/16/2015 03:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jesrad**"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-15T12:55:05Z","Content":"Looks pretty awesome!

Meanwhile, Arena and Jenming scienced away quietly in the back seats of the Lab, and when they finally were in range of Duna, this happened:\n\n![wuQysdu.png](http://i.imgur.com/wuQysdu.png)\n\nWoops, better empty that bucket.\n\nYou know all those mission drills the astronauts do over and over and over ad nauseam, until they can do the planned tasks in their sleep ? That\u0027s what Linielle had spent her last month doing. When the Star breached the 140km altitude limit, she hurried out the airlock and went through every instrument at an insane pace:\n\n![vlKzjZ2.png](http://i.imgur.com/vlKzjZ2.png)\n\nShe completed all of her assignments in record time, getting back in the hab before the ship reached the upper limit of the atmosphere.\n\nIn unrelated news, the coffee storage alarms report a breach.\n\nThe ship, still massing 117 tons, dipped at hypersonic speed into the tenuous and dusty layer of gases, and then something unexpected happened:\n\n![bGm13Nm.png](http://i.imgur.com/bGm13Nm.png)\n\n![OVECAGS.png](http://i.imgur.com/OVECAGS.png)\n\n![J4kyk1Y.png](http://i.imgur.com/J4kyk1Y.png)\n\n![PVxprKO.png](http://i.imgur.com/PVxprKO.png)\n\n![uhsK8w1.png](http://i.imgur.com/uhsK8w1.png)\n\n![X75gDp0.png](http://i.imgur.com/X75gDp0.png)\n\nOscillations quickly receded and she stabilized in this 30-degree-down stance...
