I had an idea. The idea is simple but can grow very complex. The idea is to take ideas from replies to this thread for a story-based space program that is run and flown by me. Watching and loving EnterElysium\u0027s World War K, Viking Space Program, and other story-based series\u0027. Having lost a lot of interest in KSP recently has made me upset.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI want to return to the roots of KSP, and I want to bring you all with me. So give ideas for what the Space Program should do first, the enemy of the program if there is one, and where to go. I have HyperEdit, to I can put any planet close to eachother.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease. Put ideas for the first action of this program. This isn\u0027t my program, nor yours. It\u0027s the forums, and everyone who has an idea or even a challenge to put on me personally. I am fine with any idea. I will try to post as often as possible. Most of the time it will be 1 post a day on the weekdays unless I am busy, and 2-3 a day on weekends.
