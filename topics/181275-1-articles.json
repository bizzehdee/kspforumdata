This threw me off a bit when I couldn\u0027t get the mass of a vessel to align with what I calculated because the mass fraction for a radial booster assembly was being rounded up so when I multiplied that single mass value by 4 I ended up 3kg heavier than what the engineer report and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E were saying for the complete rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny mods that I happen to not know of that will get me a mass readout with some decimal places?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: to be clear I know the reason there is no mass precision is because all the parts have whole number masses - the real culprit here is tweakscale \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-01-10T04:21:26Z\u0022 title=\u002201/10/2019 04:21  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 10, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Drew Kerman\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
