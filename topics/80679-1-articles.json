I still need the solar panels so it doesn\u0027t run out of electricity, but besides that this thing is pretty neat for it\u0027s size. 49 parts, 4 stages. First stage to go is 4 RT-10 boosters, then four sets of LV-909\u0027s hooked up with fuel lines to a middle 48-7S (Only just discovered how awesome this engine is). With a bit of modding and a bit of tweaking, I could probably get it up to 14,000m/s of DV. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/D0D8R0x.png\u0022 alt=\u0022D0D8R0x.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/i3SULEW.png\u0022 alt=\u0022i3SULEW.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rzEUgKu.png\u0022 alt=\u0022rzEUgKu.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-04T11:32:01Z\u0022 title=\u002208/04/2014 11:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 4, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by CitizenAerospace\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdded pictures.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rune","CreatedById":52690,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-04T13:07:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd when you consider those batteries are massless (physics relevance set to zero in the part file by default), you can kind of guess why. But that thing would be perfect to take a sample container (AKA: kerbal) back to orbit at Eve with some tiny changes, if you put it on top of another rocket to get it there. You can clip a seat inside that probe ina way that the kerbal sits right inside, as if it was a really really tiny capsule. Good job!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune.
