I can\u0027t build a ship since it won\u0027t allow me to select the Mk1 command pod. But then when I go to the R\u0026amp;D and unlock it nothing actually happens, instead when I return to the VAB it\u0027s still locked and returning to the R\u0026amp;D shows it as unlocked along with a duplicate that isn\u0027t unlocked. Repeating the process just causes more of them to stack up in R\u0026amp;D without ever unlocking any in the VAB. So any ideas what\u0027s going on here?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"gecko1501","CreatedById":88393,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-17T05:37:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDo you have any mods installed?
