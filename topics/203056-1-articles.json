Thus switching from a vessel below that altitude would simply be deleting the craft. However, when the vessel is above that altitude and heading up on a suborbital\u00A0trajectory, there are situations where one may want to switch immediately, but must wait until it clears the atmosphere. I find this to be an annoying limitation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
