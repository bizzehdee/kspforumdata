For those who don\u0027t know, world building is exactly what the name implies, its building a fictional world from scratch,similar to what is done for shows or movies like LOTR. I recently realized i could use KSP to build models of my vehicles, not only for visual purposes but also to check if their actually somewhat realistically usable (i have a tendency to design bricks that can magically fly with unicorn dust when i use just paper). However, i was wondering if there were any rules,legal or otherwise, that prevent me from creating\u00A0screenshots of my creations and attaching them to the article i write about my world. My world is on a different website, so it doesn\u0027t violate the forum\u0027s RP rules. I tried reading the TOS for KSP but got overwhelmed by it, so if there is information there i probably missed it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank
