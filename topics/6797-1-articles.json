If you run through the stages while still in the atmosphere it releases just fine but with full throttle I can make it up 30k\u002B meters before I want to release the stage but when I do I think it collides with the part opposite it. If anybody could give me an idea how to make it less unstable that\\\u0027d be great!

Oh, well, a mod can move it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou were right, the second stage drop tanks are colliding with each other. I separated them out into 2 staging events.

I\\\u0027m not the only one then. When it decouples, does it just spontaneously explode, or does something that decouples bounce around and blow stuff up? If the former, I have the same exact problem. I really have no idea what causes it, but it doesn\\\u0027t seem to want to go away no matter what I do.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Goosey145","CreatedById":7969,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-02-19T20:11:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks Umbral, I\\\u0027ll try that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@Rascal Yeah, when you decouple the stage it goes into a slideshow of the entire rocket exploding.
