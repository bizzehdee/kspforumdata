I can even do shrouded fans. That stuff seems to be okay for me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen I get some crazy ideas. An asteroid mining base with no \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E. Other ships will bring them in... (and slow them down). If this instantly was flagged as a bad idea by your brain you\u00A0are right, BTW. So once the asteroid is moving by slowly underneath this station I can\u0027t maneuver,\u00A0I\u0027m going to\u00A0 snag it with 35\u002B meter arm with 4 servo/hinge articulations. On the end are drills ready to harvest that sweet ore along with the necessary AGU.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo... I forgot to change the rate to like 2 degrees a second for the first move. And the flailing NEVER stopped after. Radiators breaking everywhere.... luckily I had no solar panels.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI assume there is too much weight on the joints? I\u0027m unfamiliar with dampening ... would changing that help any?\u00A0 Would using TweakScale to increase the size to better match the truss segments help?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe trusses I\u0027m using are from ...

The usability is not there... currently anyway.
