Yeah, the boom was clearly chosen for looks over function. In operation it tends to twist as well as pitch/yaw. I disabled all the gyros on the lander to avoid excessive bounce when maneuvering, and as noted in the images ended up firing two lander aerospikes along with the Wasabi\u0027s two outriggers to prevent a \u0022pogo-ing\u0022 oscillation mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReally, I SHOULD have known better on those LV-Ns. I\u0027ve towed class-E asteroids, and on those ships I make the boom twice as long for just this reason. Somehow, I thought the exhaust would pass between the parts of the lander...oh well, lesson learned, and it\u0027s always a good feeling to pull off a workaround.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother error I made is overlap of action groups. The Wasabi Maru\u0027s solar panels are \u00278\u0027, the cargo bay door/interior light combo is \u00279\u0027, and the science package is \u00270\u0027. If I pressed those keys in sequence right now it would also trigger the XL parachutes on the lander, followed by the radial clusters, and finally fire the separatrons and blow the descent fuel tanks/parachute stacks into space.
