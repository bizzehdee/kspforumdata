The other orange suits and all the \\*\\*\\* pilots are still waiting for a window to come back from Duna. So it\u0027s up to Kerbfleet\u0027s bench to pull this one off.\n\nThe ships:\n\nEVORAMA 180t lander/ascent vehicle: \n\n ~10500 surface dV\n\n crew of one \n\n Kerbin SSTO capable\n\n parachute landing, Eve ascent on 6xaerospikes and one KS-25x4\n\nKSS WASABI MARU: \n\n 150t interplanetary cruiser\n\n 4x LV-N main engines with 2x aerospike auxiliary\n\n towing boom, cargo bay, sweet running lights\n\nThe plan is to launch both ships, dock in orbit, refuel, and catch the next window to Eve. Then Wasabi Maru will drop a rover to the surface to scout a good landing site. Evorama will follow, then hopefully return one Kerbonaut to the Wasabi for the trip back home.\n\nAt this writing the mission is still in progress and I do not know if it will succeed. Here\u0027s an album featuring the two main ships. Enjoy!\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

I know, rather than going to auxiliary engines I could also have separated the ships and at least gotten the cruiser to Eve on LV-Ns. I just didn\u0027t want to bother with multiple aerocaptures, docking etc. \n\nNext phase is landing, and recovery from the surface! Was very hard to go to bed last night and work this morning knowing I am this close.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-10T19:50:18Z\u0022 title=\u002204/10/2015 07:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mister Dilsby**"},{"CreatedByName":"Rolanvorxariat","CreatedById":117146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-10T15:11:02Z","Content":"That is the first aesthetically pleasing eve lander I have seen.\n\nkuzzter \u002Brep"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Dilsby","CreatedById":232743,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-10T15:18:19Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E That is the first aesthetically pleasing eve lander I have seen.\n\nThank you!

And I\u0027m with Chiken1880 on how nice your lander looks. I dunno if I\u0027d have dared use such a narrow connection as your towing boom, though.\n\nSympathies on the LV-N placement; that\u0027s why I stick mine on outriggers these days. At least you were able to salvage the mission."},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Dilsby","CreatedById":232743,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-10T19:26:24Z","Content":"Thanks Commander! Yeah, the boom was clearly chosen for looks over function. In operation it tends to twist as well as pitch/yaw. I disabled all the gyros on the lander to avoid excessive bounce when maneuvering, and as noted in the images ended up firing two lander aerospikes along with the Wasabi\u0027s two outriggers to prevent a \u0022pogo-ing\u0022 oscillation mode.\n\nReally, I SHOULD have known better on those LV-Ns. I\u0027ve towed class-E asteroids, and on those ships I make the boom twice as long for just this reason. Somehow, I thought the exhaust would pass between the parts of the lander...oh well, lesson learned, and it\u0027s always a good feeling to pull off a workaround.\n\nAnother error I made is overlap of action groups. The Wasabi Maru\u0027s solar panels are \u00278\u0027, the cargo bay door/interior light combo is \u00279\u0027, and the science package is \u00270\u0027. If I pressed those keys in sequence right now it would also trigger the XL parachutes on the lander, followed by the radial clusters, and finally fire the separatrons and blow the descent fuel tanks/parachute stacks into space. So I\u0027m doing everything with right-click as long as the ships are docked.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-10T19:32:03Z\u0022 title=\u002204/10/2015 07:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mister Dilsby**"},{"CreatedByName":"Commander Zoom","CreatedById":8333,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-10T21:41:58Z","Content":"Something I do that may help (you and others) is maintain a consistent set of keys for my action groups, on all craft.\n\n1 - Solar Panels\n\n2 - Ladders\n\n5 - Camera/Telescope (VDM Hullcam mod)\n\n9 - Science\n\n0 - Antennae\n\n(and then anything else I need is done on a craft by craft basis, or just right-clicked as necessary)"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Dilsby","CreatedById":232743,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-10T23:43:48Z","Content":"That\u0027s a very good practice.
