I have not tried out the Kethane mod, though I am seriously considering it at some point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn terms of future functionality added to the game itself, what would you like to see either as optional or not?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst off, in the same vein as docking support added, I\u0027d like to see a way to put together modules once they are landed. Something like a rover with a crane that can lift individual sections (so you can land one piece at a time or something) and then \u0022put them together\u0022 either stacking or connecting to their sides to make colonies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can think of a couple of things from mods that would be interesting to add. For example zoxygen and power plus lights. Each kerbal inhabitting the colony modules would use a certain amount of zoxygen, power would be used to create zoxygen and power would also be used to power any external lights once the planet/moon was in darkness (maybe with light sensor lights that automatically turned themselves on when it was local night time). Battery modules that would store power during darkness and solar cells to provide power during the day. Maybe even a nuclear reactor (found by the side of the road?) to give constant power if you wanted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it would also be interesting to have a fuel production module that produced fuel at a certain (very slow) rate using some power, and ONLY as part of a dirt side colony (not for use as a space station). You could refuel from the fuel production module, maybe either getting your rocket close enough to it or using something like a fuel truck/rover that could shuttle fuel back and forth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe each module or number of modules requires a certain number of kerbals to operate. Like 1 kerbal per 5 colony modules or something like that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose are the things I can think of that could make for some interesting colony building times (and incentives to build one, both from a \u0022cool look at this\u0022, but also from an ability to refuel away from Kerbal or having to launch tons of rockets each carrying a little fuel out to your main one).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA last thought, it might be interesting to allow you to either have a vehicle assembly building module, or the ability to combine a number of \u0022VAB sub modules\u0022 together to make a big VAB module on other planets/moons. Maybe as an optional thing or something. That way you can build rockets from the get go away from Kerbin, once you have an established colony there, build the VAB and now you can launch rockets from your colony. Maybe the VAB\u0027s ability to build rockets is limited in part counts based on the number of modules you have assembled to build the VAB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike say, a 10 module VAB on Duna is limited to only building rockets with 10 parts (but gets full fuel upon building, not using the fuel in your fuel generation modules in the colony). You also cannot add colony modules to rockets made in VABs that aren\u0027t located on Kerbin (so you can\u0027t build a VAB and then spam colony modules at that location). You could also easily put together rovers with it (since they don\u0027t take many parts), or small rockets. The big suckers would be limited...think of how many trips from Kerbin to Duna it would take to build a VAB large enough to make a 100 part rocket. YOUCH!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust some fun thoughts for the day.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, some kind of colony building functionality (other than landing rockets and rovers like you can now) would be cool some time down the road.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vespasianus","CreatedById":26881,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-01T18:27:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EShouldn\u0027t this be in the Suggestions forum? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, I think this is something that might be implemented in the future, but for now, the main thing is to complete the game\u0027s core features.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust my 2 cents to the conversation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jay_Em","CreatedById":47145,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-01T18:33:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI love the idea of being able to launch different modules to other planets, which can then be assembled to make moonbases and so on.

In terms of VABs on other planets, I\u0027m not sure about going that far, but potentially being able to reattach parts to rockets once they are landed on a special landing pad or something would be great, so you can launch a rocket from Kerbin to the Duna base, then launch a service rocket from Kerbin to the Duna base with the parts you want to add to the first rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, KSP is still only very early in development so I\u0027m not suggesting this be added in .18 or .19 or anything, I\u0027m just saying I\u0027d like to see KSP go in this direction after all the core elements are finished.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-01T18:52:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmmm, asking what people think about colonies, rather than just suggesting them, nah I think we\u0027ll keep this one here \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInteresting thoughts there azazel1024, hopefully this will stimulate an in-depth discussion on the topic.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tauge","CreatedById":39280,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-01T19:02:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d love to be able to build colonies.

My first laythe landing site as it turns out would be perfect for a colony complete with a runway for spaceplanes! I think mining might be a cool feature too based of of the kethane mod. Maybe you could mine materials, then make parts using 3D printers (which are totally a thing, google them). I think an ET VAB is the best option for colony building, but you ought to be able to manually dock and connect modules too if you so choose. Had a huge debate about this in a different thread, I think to satisfy everyone we need both. An ET VAB/ SPH shouldn\u0027t be hard to do in the near future imo. I\u0027m thinking some kind of large inflatable structure that is then reinforced with a light truss system. That way it can be decompressed to roll the craft out. Fuel obviously could be mined with the existing version of the kethane mod, but vanilla-ized. Inflatables also bring about the possibility of floating airship colonies. Maybe placed in the upper atmosphere of Eve, kerbin, Jool or Laythe.

This is largely because of how I play the game currently. I spent about 3 weeks getting my piloting down, and really doing the same maneuvers over and over. I eventually found myself doing the same things over and over and wanted a little variety. To this end I tried two mods. Orbital Construction and ISA Mapsat. Whats interesting about these? Well..they give a functional purpose to all my launches, and lets me build some long term goals. For instance I made 10 flights to my lunar orbital construction ship to deliver fuel and parts so I could build a ship without having to build a heavy lift stage to get it into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimilarly I enjoy getting to the new planets, but once I used ISA Mapsat my flights had a kind of purpose to them. I could run a mission to map each moon and planet. It gave me a target to hit that gave me a product I could reuse.....maps. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m about to try out the Tosh cart mod. which I hope will give me some fun stuff to do on planet, because running a kerbanaut around is a little slow. Hoping to use them to discover the mapped anomolies. I\u0027m also eyeing the kethane mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelieve it or not all of this has a point related to colonies. I think colonies could be really interesting if we can get a working instance of docking. With docking people could have multiple flights to establish their colony and link it all together. If a certain set of prefabbed small structures are delivered and connected together you would get a certain capability such as refueling or construction or even science research (to unlock new parts, an item on the projected feature list) . Delivering crew could enabling the location of minerals (maybe with the aid of a satellite) and using a \u0022computer aided foundry\u0022 to fabricate parts. Maybe the connecting of parts could be done through a rover with a mechanical arm as suggested by Jay_em.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternatively, the parts could also be constructed in orbit to form a space station. Built part by part like our real space station. This could also be used for refueling or construction or science research.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy personal dream is that colonies, mining, orbital and colony based refueling and construction, and different kinds of satellites all make it into the core game maybe with an unlockable science tree so you have a natural progression. The number of truly awesome mods that are coming out are great as independent pieces, but I think they also could be brought into the game proper to give the \u0022campaign\u0022 mode a logical sense of purpose.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-10-02T00:13:54Z\u0022 title=\u002210/02/2012 12:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 2, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by air805ronin\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"9911MU51C","CreatedById":49907,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-02T00:58:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI want this in the game badly. they should have a campaign mode where you build and you can have separate colonies on planets and run their populations and resources etc\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stargazer1235","CreatedById":52505,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-02T01:06:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESpace colonies would be very fun.
