I hope you like it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been using Kethane for ages now. But recently it\u0027s come to my attention that Squad is at long last going to be putting a resource engine into the stock game, and apparently it\u0027s going to be very much like Karbonite instead of Kethane. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBetween that info and the fact that Kethane STILL hasn\u0027t been updated for .90, I decided to do something about creating an equivalent set of parts for the LLL Mod. I figured I\u0027d be needing to get used to Karbonite, but the existing Karbonite parts are not the right size for my needs. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn particular I can\u0027t make EAGLE pods with them very easily. It\u0027s possible - but the end result looks clumsy next to the old sleek LLL Kethane pods I was able to put together. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo - I took a careful look at how the LLL Kethane Parts worked in terms of the models and the .CFG file structure. Then I did some mixing and matching with the modules of the USI Karbonite parts, replacing the Kethane modules in the LLL CFGs with their Karbonite counterparts and doing palette color swaps on the LLL models. Then testing, re-testing, and making sure everything worked right. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd now I have a set of LLL Karbonite fuel tanks and a 2x1 Karbonite converter that produces every type of fuel output that the LLL 2x1 Kethane Converter did. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only remaining problem is cosmetic only. As I said above, I did a palette swap on the fuel tanks to make the stripes on them a reddish-rust color instead of green to differentiate them from the Kethane tanks. And that worked out just fine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut on the Karbonite and Kethane converters, it seems to have removed ALL color from both parts and I don\u0027t know why. It doesn\u0027t affect the functionality of them. But I\u0027m not sure what is conflicting - the old Kethane model still looks green when I pull up the model out of game, and the Karbonite model looks properly rust colored, but in-game, they both lack any color stripes. Weird. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn any case - all the parts in these files have been renamed and DO NOT CONFLICT in functionality with the existing Kethane parts! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can run both in the same game save with no problem. The LLL Karbonite parts show up right next to their LLL Kethane counterparts in the parts listing in the VAB/SPH. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOne caveat - these work perfectly with KSP .25, but I have NOT tested these in KSP .90.\u003C/strong\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut considering that most of the tweaks are in the .cfg files and simply create new parts similar to the existing LLL Kethane parts, I\u0027m fairly sure they\u0027ll work just fine. In any case, as a proof of concept, they should be useful in finalizing LLL Parts that are compatible with Karbonite (or the future resource system in the stock game).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIncluded in the link below is also a re-scaled USI radial mount drill that more closely matches the size of the Kethane side-mounted small drill. It\u0027s not part of what I\u0027m offering as the LLL Karbonite parts. So don\u0027t add it as part of any future LLL mod. But any player who wants to mess with it is free to do so. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor any player who wants to test these, just do the usual installation method of merging the GameData folder to your KSP game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download/61ajsseqg3xu50s/LLL-Karbonite.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003ELogan\u0027s LLL Karbonite Parts mod add-on\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/Tuegl#0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
