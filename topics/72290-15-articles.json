None of it has led anywhere because it\u0027s simply is not efficient. Every mission launches into a different plane. So if two different missions going two different places want to use a single fuel station, one of them needs to make a massive plane-change after fuelling. That is unless they are both going to the same place relatively close in time to each other (ie Mun trips a couple months apart at most). Refuel also means docking, requiring all the associated navigation, thruster and antenna parts = increased weight.\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat what I actually found myself in KSP. Even without plane changes, refuelling was simply added waste of time (and bit of delta-V cost) of all these dockings, and need to put extra hardware on that ships, reducing max delta-V. And all this fuel had to be hauled up somehow - so \u003Cstrong\u003Etotal cost\u003C/strong\u003E remains the same (or worse). Better just to attach useful payload to that stack and launch it in one go, straight to destination.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWithout actually somehow producing fuel in space, \u0022supply depots\u0022 don\u0027t make much sense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess upcoming budget/cost system could change this somewhat, but we will see. Because, as I mentioned before, you will still have to launch fuel, and I wonder if this will be good enough to offset small cost saving on not hauling interplanetary bits (which are not quite high weight/cost fraction compared to whole groundside launcher).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-30T16:47:53Z\u0022 title=\u002206/30/2014 04:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 30, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by RidingTheFlow\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sky_walker","CreatedById":113214,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-30T17:50:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAdvantage is obvious: in multiple trips you can get more fuel to the space craft as rockets in real life, unlike Kerbal, got very limited cargo capacity. In real life the \u0022more boosters\u0022 rule doesn\u0027t work. So if you want large, high DeltaV space ship you want to launch it in multiple stages.
