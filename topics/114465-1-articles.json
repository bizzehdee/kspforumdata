For example if it was originally a high value experiment it will be lower, if you revert enough it will be zero. I thought it might work itself out when you completed the mission, but it does not.\n\nThere is an old thread about this same issue here:\n\n[http://steamcommunity.com/app/220200/discussions/0/648814842000453371/](http://steamcommunity.com/app/220200/discussions/0/648814842000453371/)\n\nThe link at the end no longer works.\n\nThis doesn\u0027t seem right since revert reverts everything else...\n\nThanks\n\nKerbal Space Program - 1.0.4.861 (WindowsPlayer) Steam\n\nOS: Windows 7 Service Pack 1 (6.1.7601) 64bit\n\nCPU: AMD Phenom II X6 1090T Processor (6)\n\nRAM: 8189\n\nGPU: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 560 Ti (977MB)\n\nSM: 30 (Direct3D 9.0c [nvd3dum.dll 9.18.13.4411])\n\nRT Formats: ARGB32, Depth, ARGBHalf, RGB565, Default, DefaultHDR, ARGBFloat, RGFloat, RGHalf, RFloat, RHalf, R8\n\nStock install, no mods."}]}
