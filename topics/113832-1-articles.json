Ever since 1.0 came out, I\u0027ve been in the habit of setting my chutes to always deploy at 0.5 atmospheres, and that was pretty much perfectly safe-- never had to worry about a chute problem. However, now I find that I can rip the chutes off, even at that setting. Not sure if it\u0027s something that was done to the chutes, or if it\u0027s just that aero has changed in a way that craft are still going too fast when they reach that altitude.\n\nIn any case, the addition of the safe/unsafe indicator is pretty nice-- can use that for deciding when to deploy.\n\nRequest for Squad: Please make one additional change to the safe/unsafe UI: have the little parachute icon in the staging display change color, or something. i.e. when it\u0027s unsafe to deploy chutes, put a red warning border around the staging icon. That way, I don\u0027t have to mess around with right-clicking on parts to look at the safe/unsafe display in the context menu; all I\u0027d have to do is watch the chute\u0027s icon in my staging UI, and hit the space bar when the red warning goes away."},{"CreatedByName":"Dh397","CreatedById":146566,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T22:08:39Z","Content":"thanks for all the reply\u0027s. i think i see my problem is my reentry angle and speed. i am burning them up coming in to the atmosphere. going to keep trying"},{"CreatedByName":"Lelitu","CreatedById":146287,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T22:39:59Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E thanks for all the reply\u0027s. i think i see my problem is my reentry angle and speed. i am burning them up coming in to the atmosphere. going to keep trying\n\nThat is not the issue. You have a broken staging setup, Parachutes should never be staged until \\*after\\* re-entry and almost all deceleration.\n\nPut the \\*only\\* the parachutes in stage 0, last stage to be triggered. Nothing else should occur in stage 0.\n\nDo not trigger this stage until below 250m/s\n\nParachutes will not need to be tweaked if this is done, and will never rip off.\n\nIf you\u0027re too low when dropping under 250m/s, then you have a re-entry angle problem"},{"CreatedByName":"Dh397","CreatedById":146566,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T00:04:30Z","Content":"thank you all. i think i found my problem. have not had time to play much. will report back when I succeed.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nmy staging is correct. i was opening them way too soon. noob mistake. lol"}]}
