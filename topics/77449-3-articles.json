The granularity of the failures and the ability to repair in-flight or in-situ sets this apart from other failure mods. This belongs in the pantheon of mods like DRE, RemoteTech, FAR, TACLS, etc. It forces the player to plan for contingencies and be creative.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis makes early Career mode much more difficult, because players have less capacity to deal with failures and have to scrap missions and lose money/rep. This is, imo, a better way of making the early game challenging than Squad\u0027s way of just cranking up numbers. It may seem harsh though, so maybe ease up on early-flight failures (say during launch, when players can\u0027t address failures) and allow more failures in mid-flight, when EVA is much more feasible. Decouplers failing during launch pretty much scrap a whole mission, regardless of how expensive it is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do have a noob question to ask, though. How do I get Rocket Parts? I\u0027m using KAS as well and I can\u0027t find them on my kerbals, or in my command pods, or in my KAS containers. I checked the OP and your Github site, but I haven\u0027t found any hints. Thanks in advance!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd finally a suggestion, because who doesn\u0027t have one? People seem to want a way to increase part reliability with use and experience. How about a simple \u0022prototype\u0022 flag? Prototype parts have higher failure rates, of course. When the player recovers a prototype part that hasn\u0027t failed (and hasn\u0027t been repaired), it removes the flag. If not, future instances of the part still retain the flag and lowered reliability. This would encourage test missions to work out the bugs of new parts, and maybe wouldn\u0027t be as complicated as adding more metrics or analyzing tech trees.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for your hard work, IRnifty!
