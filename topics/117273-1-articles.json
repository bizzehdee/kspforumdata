I do not know the complexities involved in modding and mod compatibility. What I do know is that modders are a passionate people. I have played with many KSP mods, and each adds a uniqueness to the game, but with each new mod comes the potential to bring compatibility issues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is my suggestion. How about having a modders meeting virtually! Modders can come together and discuss common resources, problems (eg: aerodynamics), and find solutions to things. There can be a Short Summary of the meeting topics afterwards or something.\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what does the KSP Community think?

It helps if you can ask your question and then hang around, even if I am in the channel, quite often I am AFK and will not see your question for quite a bit of time. If you join, ask your question, and then leave 5 minutes later because no one has answered, it almost certain that no one saw your question in that time because they did not have their IRC window open at that exact moment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ED.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
