you\u0027ve surmised:\u00A0 in real life, there are \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eoodles\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E of difficult engineering considerations when building rockets.\u00A0 It\u0027s not like KSP, where there aren\u0027t any actual micro-level engineering problems at all, just macro-level problems like overall ship mass, rigidity, etc.\u00A0 In KSP you can just slap pieces together like Lego and they work every time with 100% reliability.\u00A0 Real-world rockets have to deal with \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Elots\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E more complications.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example:\u00A0 Real-world rocket fuel is typically cryogenic, i.e. liquid H\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E and O\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E that are chilled hundreds of degrees below room temperature.\u00A0 Keeping them cold is a huge problem, because typically the way one keeps things super-cold is to slather lots of insulation on, and that\u0027s something that\u0027s hard to do on a rocket where space and mass are at a premium.\u00A0 That\u0027s why rockets typically stand empty on the launchpad for days until liftoff is near, and they refuel them at the last minute-- because every second the fuel is actually on the rocket, it\u0027s boiling away and you\u0027re losing fuel even if you\u0027re not running the engine.\u00A0 And the worst possible geometry, if you\u0027re trying to limit heat flow, is a long skinny fuel line.\u00A0 You want big spherical tanks (or, at least, as close to a sphere as you can have, given the constraints of the rocket\u0027s shape).\u00A0 You want to keep the length of fuel lines to an absolute minimum, meaning keep the tanks close to the engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Yes, there are cases of non-cryogenic rocket fuels, such as the Saturn V\u0027s first stage, which IIRC used kerosene.\u00A0 But even there, you need an oxidizer.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen there\u0027s the question of running fuel lines through a decoupler.\u00A0 In KSP, decouplers are magic, you just hit space bar and they fire perfectly every time, and never misfire, or get stuck, or blow up any other nearby pieces, or anything.\u00A0 In real life, they\u0027re \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ehard\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 It\u0027s easy for things to go wrong.\u00A0 Yes, it\u0027s a conceptually simple piece of equipment, but there are so many ways for them to go wrong, either due to human error during assembly or just engineering-tolerance problems.\u00A0 Many spacecraft have been lost or severely damaged because something went wrong with a decoupler.\u00A0 You want to keep the physical arrangement around the decoupler as simple as humanly possible, to minimize the number of moving parts in case something goes wrong.\u00A0 Which means that you really, really don\u0027t want to be running fuel lines or anything else through them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...And so on, and so forth.\u00A0 The fact remains, KSP is a \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Egame\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, it\u0027s why you can play it without needing a PhD in aeronautical engineering, it\u0027s why NASA doesn\u0027t let 12-year-olds design their rockets.\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022;)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022

\u0022put tourists on a reentry vehicle\u0022 is to just build a lawn dart with a Mk1 command pod on the front, as many Mk1 crew cabins strung behind it as necessary, and some AV-R8 winglets on the back for steering.\u00A0 Bring it in prograde, up-angled like a spaceplane.\u00A0 Gets tons of body lift, comes in gentle as a feather by the time it gets within a few kilometers of the ground.\u00A0 If I have to come in much faster than LKO speeds (e.g. from Minmus or somewhere), stick a jettisonable heat shield on top with a nosecone, for getting through the hot part of reentry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime
