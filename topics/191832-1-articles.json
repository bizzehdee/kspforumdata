I don\u0027t really see the value in something like that, as there are enough stack adapters already in the game that make steps from one size to another. If you\u0027re wanting a procedural adapter, take a look at the Procedural Parts mod which is entirely configurable to whatever sizes you want, although the build process is considerably different to stock KSP so may take some getting used to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you don\u0027t want a procedural part, try Missing History for some useful additions to Making History (and it turns the FL-A10 into a fuel tank which is useful for smaller rockets); Near Future Launch Vehicles for some oversized rocket parts in 5m and 7.5m sizes, which also contain engine adapters that also double as stack adapters; and ReStock\u002B adds some extra adapters in the 1.25m-1.875m-2.5m brackets too (and also makes most of Missing History redundant as of ReStock\u002B v1.0).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there something in particular that you don\u0027t like about the stock stack adapters?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbal4","CreatedById":201852,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-02-23T08:41:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nimaging a MK1 parachute with a adapter to 5m below it.\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E. yeah, this is a good idea, with curved adapters. i support, but the one. i\u00A0mentioned earlier would be a little useless(but funny).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-02-23T09:12:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOkay but it can\u0027t be done with only five adapters. We have short adapters, long adapters, adapters with fuel, without fuel... So let\u0027s sum it up, one per upper node size (0.625, 1.25, 2.5, 3.75, 5m) times two because fuel, times three because length.
