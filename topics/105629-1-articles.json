Now I can use this base again from the tracking station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever the other one is still not accesable. A workaround might be to fly something close and do the same trick. (Not tryed yet)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think this is related to antoher issue ... In the Austronaut Complex I am missing almost all my Kerbals flying on any vessel. Only one of about 10 shows up in the assigned tab. Also, even if fully upgraded I have a max of 12 now, but the description from the outside (right click on the bulding) did read \u0022fully upgraded\u0022, \u0022unlimtted number of Kerbals\u0022 earlier, after the upgrade. Suddenly I can\u0027t see this either when right clicking the building.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs with the post before I was using a save from the (steam) version before 1.0.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"strobelix","CreatedById":142046,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T18:06:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUpdate I could fix it!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually it was related to the the indexes in the presistence.sfs file of 2 Kerbals ...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe log file lead me to the solution (unfortunately it\u0027s overwrtten now and I can\u0027t post the exact entries) ... there were some NullPointer and index out of bound exceptions and the it stated something about the base, actually the name, and that the crew is not the same person as it is in the roster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter carefully examine the module having the lines (names are just of the top of my head)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecrew = Kerwise Kerbal\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecrew = Robert Kerbal\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd in the roster entries I had \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eidx = -1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efor both, comparing it with another module where for 2 crews idx=0 and idx=1 I thought this might be the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I went back to the roster entries for this 2 specific Kerbals and put idx=0 for the first in the module (Kerwise Kerbal) and idx=1 for the 2nd (Robert Kerbal).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd voila after saving the file and starting the app. They show up again in the Astronaut Comlex as assigned and all others show up again too. Also I can read the info on right click again and the restriction to 12 Kerbals disappeared. Also I can fly the base again from the tracking tracking station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope this helps.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Yllier","CreatedById":107767,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T20:11:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you for your replies.\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E I launched another ship and did as you did: switched to the ship in map mode.
