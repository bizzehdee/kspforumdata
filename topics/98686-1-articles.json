I want to be able to accelerate or decelerate other spacecraft, using only electricity!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe utility of such a thing would be endless and it would give the ability to go around the solar system using no fuel at all!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is an example: imagine that you had one big coilgun attached to a space station orbiting kerbin and one orbiting mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom kerbin, you can propel a light spacecraft and put it into a transfer trajectory to the moon. The coilgun will slow down of course, but since it\u0027s much more massive than the spacecraft being propelled, it\u0027s speed will not change much, meaning it will remain in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow the spacecraft meets with the coilgun that is orbiting the moon and the coilgun decelerates it, taking all of it\u0027s energy. The spacecraft will now fall vertically towards the moon and will only need fuel for the landing. The coilgun will of course gain speed, but since it\u0027s massive, it will remain in orbit around the moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow when the spacecraft wants to return to kerbin, it needs only enough fuel to reach the periapsis of the coilgun, after which the coilgun gives back the original kinetic energy and the spacecraft is now on an escape trajectory. The coilgun returns to it\u0027s original orbit due to the transfer of energy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe spacecraft meets with the coilgun orbiting kerbin and then after a violent exchange of energy, their speeds will be the same and back to the starting orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf one puts such a coilgun on another planet, it will be possible to go between that planet and kerbin, for free!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI imagine the coilgun to be a very long tube with electromagnets attached radially all over it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course the only problem will be very precise maneuvering, penalty the complete destruction of both the coilgun and the spacecraft \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBtw let\u0027s not forget that it\u0027s possible to steal energy from the moon by doing slingshots around it and then store the energy into a space station \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E (until the moon starts to enter kerbin\u0027s atmosphere...)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-03T20:21:08Z\u0022 title=\u002202/03/2015 08:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Cinon\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thomas988","CreatedById":92699,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-03T20:18:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmmmm...interesting idea.
