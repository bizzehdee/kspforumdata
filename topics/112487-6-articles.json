I\u0027d hate to have to deal with 18 3/4 Edisons to the Franklin every day. I will point out that I had less issues converting everything to metric than most of my classmates in US engineering school, thanks to a high school chemistry teacher who mainly concentrated on the factor label method (google hits it right away). Considering that other 10th grade chemistry topics were (I assume still are) the octect rule and the ideal gas equation (both nearly worthless* in real life), this seems like a great idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* worthless in \u0022will not give sufficiently accurate results\u0022 (although I think NASA can use the ideal gas equation to model ISS drag.
