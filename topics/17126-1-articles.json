It does require Mechjeb for assistance as it is far to unstable to fly manual even with SAS as it flips out on the gravity turn, but should be fairly stable in orbit even though it would require alot of time to maneuver. I will upload a version that does not require Mechjeb for you pilots who like a challenge. This ship should be able to get to Minmus and back (I have not tried it myself). And, if your careful, can get from the Mun to Minmus and back. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you guys have any ideas on how to make this more stable (It is in early testing) please let me know, I would love for this rocket to be usable by beginners as their first deep-space rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Catfish9200","CreatedById":8657,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-17T10:04:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m going to try this one out, I\u0027ve never tried piloting anything this big.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aaron1818","CreatedById":40688,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-17T10:08:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow do i get mech jeb?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
