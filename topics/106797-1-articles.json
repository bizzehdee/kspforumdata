What is the difference in 1.0 that is making all my rockets tip over?\n\nIt\u0027s the new aerodynamics making things make sense. The way to get around this is to either keep a tiny TINY angle of attack during ascent (nearly impossible in KSP), concentrate your mass at the top of the rocket (pretty hard to do), or to add control fins at the bottom (easiest). I guess it\u0027s realistic, since look what happens when you\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/N1XE_awXEA4?start=112\u0026feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n and there\u0027s nothing keeping the rocket from getting just *slightly* out of line and then being flipped over by aerodynamic forces.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-02T05:31:41Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2015 05:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by mythbusters844**\n  \nfound video"},{"CreatedByName":"EtherDragon","CreatedById":82405,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T05:30:28Z","Content":"Actually the problem you are having is quite the opposite of \u0022top heavy.\u0022\n\nTake a look in your VAB at the Center of Mass. You\u0027ll see that it\u0027s nearer the bottom of your rocket than the top. Also, as you empty the fuel the CoM shifts lower. By definition, your rocket is bottom heavy.\n\nThis becomes an issue because what that really means is your rocket is top-draggy. If you parked your rocket on a see-saw, and balanced it on the CoM it would have a lot more length at the nose than on the tail. \n\nWhat this means is that any torque on the nose will have more leverage than the same torque on the tail. If your nose tips over just a little bit (more than about 5-degrees) the difference in drag induced torque between the nose and tail is enough to overwhelm your controls and flip the rocket over.\n\nSo, what\u0027s the answer? Tail-fins. \n\nIt turns out, the very thing that wants to flip your nose over (drag from the air) is useful for keeping it pointing strait up, if you have tail-fins. Here is [an Illustrated Guide](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117876-Why-Does-My-FLIPing-Rocket-Always-Flip-Over%21-%28Easy-Picture-Explanation%29) in the Tutorial section of these forums that explain what I\u0027m talking about.\n\nKeep flying, and stay shiny!\n\nP.S.

At higher speeds, your likeliness to stall increases to the point that if you deviate one bit, you will create turbulence that will destroy any control you have. This is even true for the best-built jetplanes. Once the SR-71 is up to top speed, it is committed to that direction until it slows back down again.\n\nThe trick (if it even still applies with the changes made in 1.0.1 and .2) is to know the speeds in atmo that it is safest for your craft to turn. This would actually encourage you to not just go full throttle right from the launch pad. Before, this was true because it was a fuel-saving measure. Now it is also true in order to allow gravity turns while in lower atmo.\n\nAs all things with KSP, this does require practice and the willingness to watch things go wrong a number of times. Get a feel for the tolerances of your craft at different speeds. There will be chances for some forgiveness where you can bring it back out of control or just prevent it from doing so, but it will be different depending on how your craft is built.\n\nI haven\u0027t tried the patched versions of 1.0 yet, but I do hope they still leave this in."},{"CreatedByName":"Oddible","CreatedById":74605,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T16:19:10Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Losing control at high speeds is due to more accurate aerodynamics.\n\nOnce again, this is at VERY VERY SLOW SPEEDS 50-150, right off the launch pad with very low TWR (1.25-1.5).\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Taking the fins off your lateral boosters might help.

When I found out the second decoupler wasn\u0027t really attached to anything, I switched to a single decoupler.
