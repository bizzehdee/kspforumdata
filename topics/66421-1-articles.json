For someone who does not speak english or whatever the initial language used in that software is it is a godsend. But on the other side, it\u0027s extremely tricky to do it right and recently I am getting more and more sick by localized programs which are localized poorly and insist that since I am in my country, I am supposed to withstand the program\u0027s poor translation. Some even don\u0027t allow to change language selection.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing is the translation itself. Messages are often put out of context and while translating, people do not often realize what context applies to them which leads to mistranslation. One hilarious example is from MS windows installation which used to have \u0022Installing volume manager\u0022 translated to my language as \u0022Installing loudness manager\u0022 for many years and many windows versions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELetting the translator to see the context of the message is extremely tricky and it is a lot of work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other thing is that different languages have different ordering of elements. Units may need to be put before or after the value, or even elements of the message need to be reordered based on the language. Message such as \u0022You will hit [body] in [time] seconds\u0022 may need the [body] and [time] values swapped. Again, it is often implemented as \u0022translateable\u0022 message \u0022You will hit %s in %s seconds\u0022 which leads to either unnatural or completely wrong translation if there is no way to put these elements in the right order. That is exactly the case with e.g. Reddit translation to my language, which throws messages like \u0022seen 5 minutes ago\u0022 translated to my language in a way which does not make sense because in my language there is no way to put that \u0022ago\u0022 at the end of sentence. But it is there, translated literally and making sentence which is simply wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yet another thing are counters. You sure understand that message \u0022you will die in [number] hours\u0022 does not really work if that [number] is 1 and you need to alternate between \u0022hour\u0022 and \u0022hours\u0022 based on what the value is. Many programs allow one word for value \u00221\u0022 and another word for any other value, but while that might be enough for english, it still does not suffice for other language. My language has three such steps, for instance. One word is for 1, another word for 2-4, and yet another word for 5-20. At 21 we\u0027re back to word for 1, 22-24 is the same as 2-4 and so on. So far I have met only one program which supported this level of localization.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo... yeah, I think localization is a good idea.
