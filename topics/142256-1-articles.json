Do you know that awesome thing you did, where a timer to the next maneuver node flashes on the tracking station, switching from MET to MNV? Could the same be made for encounters? If a probe has both an encounter and a maneuver in its path, only the nearest one is shown, so every probe shows as either \u0022MET\u0022, \u0022MET/MNV\u0022 or \u0022MET/ENC\u0022, rather than cycling through all of them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
