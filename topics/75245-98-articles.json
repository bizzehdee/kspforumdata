Interface is now all there, but there seems to be an issue with transmitting data. Tried to transmit a crew report from a manned craft in orbit. Even with the antenna pointed at mission control and the connection clearly visible in the map view I always get the \u0022no comms device\u0022 message.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy goal was just to get the mod loading in KSP until somebody with some knowledge of the code got around to patching it and now the professionals are on the case, so my work is done \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlaying KSP without RemoteTech is cheating BTW...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"morgenshtern","CreatedById":122405,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T12:54:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022critic\u0022 data-cite=\u0022critic\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EPlaying KSP without RemoteTech is cheating BTW...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReally =) \u0022Musthave\u0022 hardcore mod.

We felt that enabling something that clearly violates the laws of physics would not fit with the theme of the mod.\u003Cp\u003EWe need to have a better safety net for when you go out of range and there are a lot of ideas on how to do this. Adding a hack that lets you contact probes with no connection is, in my opinion, just a lazy hack. Which is why i denied the pull request. All of the other options are harder to implement than a simple hand wave of the rules.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, if a probe has no connection and the vehicle is in focus, why not simulate it checking all the other options in the target list until it finds one with a connection? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a simulation of backup code on the probe rather than a \u0027lazy hack\u0027, doesn\u0027t violate physics and you would only get control if a signal got through which maintains realism.
