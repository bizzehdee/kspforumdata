I know the lack of notice for the forum migration is due to a simple lack of foresight, and maybe a touch of incompetence on the part of planning, and is not at all meant to be\u00A0malicious in any way, but it still ticks me off royally! The extreme fallout (data loss)\u00A0resulting from\u00A0the lack of notice has brought back old memories of another unrelated incident which used a short notice update to (maliciously) destroy data and remove functionality.\u00A0I still remember when Sony killed Linux on PS3s on April 1, 2010. The Firmware update gave NO WARNING AT ALL during the installation procedure that Other OS features were about to be removed, or that a backup should be made prior to the update. You simply LOST access to the partition from your hard drive... didn\u0027t even get the space back! Sony didn\u0027t offer any recourse for backup once the firmware was installed. The earliest indications they would do this were a blog post on March 29, a mere 3 days before the April Fools firmware release. You would need to have actually been paying attention to a Sony blog to see the news. It trickled out slowly, and was counter to a statement just a month or two earlier that reassured customers that Other OS on older \u0022Phat\u0022 PS3s was not being touched, and that only the new Slim PS3s would not have it, and simply because it was not shipping as a feature of the new units. On April 1st... April Fools day,\u00A0even when people started shouting \u0022OH MY GOD! Sony is killing OtherOS with this firmware update!\u0022... A lot of people actually thought it was a prank and updated anyway... I mean, the update said NOTHING about Other OS removal, and that would be silly!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank God that you guys aren\u0027t like that... But the short notice of data purging STILL had the same effect. We lost data, and had no time to ever see a warning, or to take action to save it, and that just plain sucks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
