First is the max number of crew spaces, but it is then reduced by 1/4.  It can be pretty easy to use simple parts to create a lot of seats (like, 22), but that reduction means it has the least impact. Next is the Extra Time.  That is not reduced by anything and added directly to the (maxcrew\\*.25) result.  They are usually the Hab inflatables, from the small Rangers to the large Ring, and the Kerbitats.  They are configured with names like \u0022Hab Quarters\u0022, or \u0022Habitat\u0022.  When you add them to your vessel in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and set their mode, open the LS window and scroll to the bottom.  You will see the total extra time in the formula, and the individual components that supply that number.  Lastly, you see the Multiplier. That gives the opportunity for a large result, because it is a multiplier.  The biggest ones go to just over 5x and are inflatables and Kerbitats that are configured as \u0022Hab Common\u0022.  By adding combinations of crew capacity, extra time, and multipliers, you can reach your goal.\n\nAlso note the denominator at the end. it increases with every kerbal you actually have resident, which means it lowers the entire numerator.  The fastest way to reduce hab/home duration is to fill up you vessel with Kerbals.  You will need to start thinking that you need to build a vessel that has capacity of 10 kerbals and filling it with 3 Kerbals (for example) if you need longer durations.\n\nHope that helps."},{"CreatedByName":"Tyko","CreatedById":164179,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-24T18:55:29Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 37 minutes ago, bounty123 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Pilots are immune to hab effects since a recent update.\n\u003E \n\nGood point...just because they are immune to hab effects, does the mean the timer doesn\u0027t work?
