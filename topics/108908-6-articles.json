We didn\u0027t have any encounter warning system so when you burned you burned till you made it to almost above the mun\u0027s orbit. When I encountered I was always over eager with my landings, and since most of my Pe\u0027s where on the night side of the mun, I always came down at night. When I was coming down, it was impossible to tell how far you where from the surface, so I would often pancake jeb bob and bill into the surface thinking that I had made it more than a kilometer or much more up. It wasn\u0027t until I would look at my navball and see me gaining speed would not be able to slow it down in time. Soon I figured out how to enter orbit, and pick my landing sites. But it wasn\u0027t until I downloaded some of my first mods, those that gave me landing legs, was I able to land, and until .14 that I was able to build one that would return.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nansuchao","CreatedById":135151,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T00:07:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy first Mun landing in 0.12, was terrible.

First try. I thank my Orbiter experience (I have used Orbiter since 2001) for achieving this on the very first attempt. I was also part of an Orbiter addon team that developed addons and enhancements for NASSP (which eventually became Project Apollo).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
