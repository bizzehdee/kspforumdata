The resource system was shelved for a very good reason: it was eating up a huge amount of (ahem) resources and was clearly going to take a lot longer than anticipated. It was originally going to be the showcase feature of 0.19, but at some point someone on staff presumably noticed that the last minor version came out almost 3 months ago (the longest any release prior to that had taken was about 41 days, and that was the gap between 0.13.2 and 0.14, arguably the most significant update the game received up to that point). Resources were clearly going to take far too long to finish up, and the long-timers were getting antsy. So resources got shelved, and 0.19 featured less content than was anticipated. Priorities naturally shifted after that, to getting the main Sandbox mode stable and getting the groundwork for Career mode in place.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
