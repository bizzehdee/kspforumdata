Balancing is completely unnecessary even in competitive multiplayer games, because the players can always choose to follow self-imposed restrictions. Many people still want the game to be balanced, because the forced restrictions make the game more fun, even if the same gameplay would be possible without them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor another comparison, go to The Spacecraft Exchange. How many ships can you find there that look good, assuming that they were created by a competent 3D modeller with the proper tools and enough time? My guess: 0.
