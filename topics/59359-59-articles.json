Unless someone can clearly identify this as being an issue I am able to fix, I\u0027d kindly ask that from now on it be raised with the ATM team to resolve. Yes, I am aware that changing the textures to dds will overcome the issue, but that just manually does what ATM should be able to do automatically. Also, I do not have time at the moment to explore the process of changing texture formats so they will be remaining as tga for a while longer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a DDS texture converter that you can use: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/98672-WIN-KSP-to-DDS-texture-converter\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/98672-WIN-KSP-to-DDS-texture-converter\u003C/a\u003E I just used it a couple of minutes ago to convert the rework parts (I removed the legacy models) into DDS, takes all of 30 seconds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, any progress on the activestruts thing?
