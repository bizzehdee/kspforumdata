Unfortunately it caused all kinds of chaos on the server and caused massive corruption. \n\nBasically, squad\u0027s server wasn\u0027t designed to take the load that cloudfire unleashed upon it and it suffered multiple forms of buffer overloads which pushed tainted code into the stack and hence destruction."},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T22:30:29Z","Content":"Moved to Kerbal Network."},{"CreatedByName":"Rath","CreatedById":138223,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T22:55:13Z","Content":"eep!
