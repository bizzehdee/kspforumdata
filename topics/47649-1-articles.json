Minmus seems to be the biggest culprit, I had a small rover there that I landed and it flipped end over end for, literally, 40 minutes. I went out to dinner and came back to it still flipping. I eventually had to redesign it to spread out its mass a bit more so it wouldn\u0027t flip as easily. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also lost a Kerbal on EVA due to the way it came down on an unassisted jump. The Kerbal bounced, then bounced over a ridge which gave it far too much air time so it landed face first at about 20 m/s. Crunch went the Kerbal. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, I hate Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
