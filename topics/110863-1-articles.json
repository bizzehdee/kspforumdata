Slugs, pounds-mass, kips (?), tons, and ounces? To go directly between these, I\u0027d need to memorize 15 separate conversions, many of which need a lot of digits for accuracy (3 or more). The option is to put everything into one unit, which is extremely inconvenient when nothing is given to you in that unit to start with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConversions in SI mean moving a decimal point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s it.

There simply \u003Cem\u003Ei\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cem\u003Es no round off error\u003C/em\u003E. The Imperial system almost never uses conversions that are multiples of 10, which can cause some serious issues with precision when you\u0027re applying multiple conversions in series. Avoidable(ish) with computers, but for mental math and estimation, its a needless source of error. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is really a subpoint of 3 and you mentioned it in the post, but it bears repeating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003E4) Hybrid Units\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m out of clever titles. In the Imperial system, it\u0027s common to report quantities in two additive values, e.g. 5 lbs 6 oz. Yes, I know how to deal with it, but the point is \u003Cem\u003EI have to deal with it\u003C/em\u003E. This is never convention in SI/metric. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that\u0027s it. You can chalk all this up to \u0022poor training and habits\u0022, but those are very large and very real issues in the real world. The SI is simple and straight-forward because it was designed to be simple and straight forward, and is one of the few examples where a rational and intentional design produced such a system. I think it\u0027s a shame to not use it in place of the Imperial \u0022system\u0022, which has, been cobbled together from a multitude of sources and disciplines, many of which are now obsolete.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, just my opinion with supporting points for why I think it\u0027s quantitatively inaccurate to say Imperial is \u0022just different names for the same things.\u0022 The way in which I thought your response post supported my point was that you had to bring \u0022oh, if you\u0027re doing it right\u0022 and \u0022people need to be taught appropriately,\u0022 and you did because the Imperial system is not as easy to use as the SI system. It takes more experience and training to use than the SI system, and offers no benefits to the SI system. IMO, it\u0027s hard to use the SI system \u003Cem\u003Ewrong \u003C/em\u003Eand I can\u0027t imagine having to write a post that starts with \u0022if you\u0027re using the SI system correctly\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-04T22:23:31Z\u0022 title=\u002206/04/2015 10:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Orbital Vagabond\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SanderB","CreatedById":83050,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T22:10:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EConverting between units is like riding a bike or a language, if you learn it young it\u0027s easy otherwise it\u0027s something that will - for most - always require effort and feel cumbersome.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OhioBob","CreatedById":128005,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T07:16:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOrbital Vagabond,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll grant you that the units in the SI system are more intuitive and easier to learn, but that\u0027s not what I was talking about. The point I was making was about problem solving. I\u0027m assuming that a person is already familiar with the particular units that are customary in his/her particular field or industry. In that case it is no more difficult to solve a problem in imperial units than it is in SI units.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach system has base units, which are typically what you use in problem solving. In SI the base units are meter (length), kilogram (mass), and second (time). Force is a derived unit, the Newton. In the imperial system the base units are foot (length), pound (force), and second (time). Mass is a derived unit, the slug. That is really all you need to know. If you are given a quantity in other units, you just have to convert it to the base units. Although there are many different units in the imperial system, the number that a person has to become familiar with in normal practice with is rather few. And if imperial units are what you work with every day, the units become second nature.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
