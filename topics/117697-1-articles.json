I suggest doing some uncrewed test missions beforehand to figure out exactly how much delta-v the lift-off vehicle will need to make orbit, determine how high the balloon takes a craft in Eve\u0027s atmosphere, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xtoro","CreatedById":79015,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T15:50:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETried it before, didn\u0027t work well, but that was back in 0.23-ish times. The problem is that you don\u0027t have enough velocity at high altitude, and turning on rockets before you reach max balloon altitude and while it\u0027s still inflated causes too much drag. But, starting at zero velocity when you deflate is kind of like being on a really tall mountain, however you still need a good sized rocket which means you need the larger heavier balloon =even larger rocket. But, the largest balloons also don\u0027t deflate so that\u0027s a problem too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T17:38:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESounds like a very ambitious flight profile.

Eve is a little more massive than Kerbin, so you\u0027ll probably need a pretty potent \u0022kick\u0022 to get up to orbital velocity, even from higher in the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
