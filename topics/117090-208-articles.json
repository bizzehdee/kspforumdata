I was using stock only rockets, as well as stock plus SSTU for testing (though mostly SSTU). I tend to ignore the stock parts in real play, aside from the mk1 pod which as the stock pods go is OK, it\u0027s decently Mercury-like.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRemember that tier 4 is only 45 science, however, which is trivial.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat about the SSTU probe core happening very early but only 0.625 diameter\u00A0and then ALSO the 0.625m tank. Min tank with nosecone\u002Bprobe core\u002Btank... all we need is a tiny engine, and the first craft is an SSTU sounding rocket!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-08T16:40:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222843465\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022117090\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221478622463\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022105588\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022CobaltWolf\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 minutes ago, CobaltWolf said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/138730-shadowmage/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022138730\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/138730-shadowmage/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Shadowmage\u003C/a\u003E my LEM is on a 1K atlas and is already a mere 4 parts.
