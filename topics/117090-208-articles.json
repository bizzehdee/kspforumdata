It really is a tricky issue for stock play.\n\u003E \n\nIndeed the tech-node and cost balancing is an ongoing process.\n\nCosts currently are all over the place with little/no attempt at balance for most parts.  Tech nodes are a little better handled, but there are still many parts using whatever guess I first came up with for where to put them.\n\nI\u0027ll take a look at the fairings and decouplers tech placement.  They were a bit odd with where I had them positioned (should be \u003C= 1.875m when first unlocked, with the first \u0027upgrade\u0027 taking them to 2.5m; could have messed something up there, not the easiest stuff to test for as it requires constantly creating new career games at various states in the tech tree).\n\nIn general I am very disappointed with the stock tech tree.  It has so many holes and inconsistencies in it with the stock parts, makes it very hard to figure out where the SSTU parts should be placed.  I\u0027m not opposed to CTT integration, though I haven\u0027t gotten much of a chance to look over it in a long time.  Would still need to come up with some sort of placement for the stock tree though for those who don\u0027t use CTT (or use some other tech-tree).  Yes, SSTU can add custom nodes (and already does), but it makes it a bit less compatible with other tech-tree mods, and I don\u0027t want to turn SSTU into a custom-tech-tree mod as well.\n\nOn the subject of early career balance -- yeah, I need to figure something a bit different out there.  SSTU parts make it very easy to get into orbit or get to the Mun with minimal part-counts, mostly bypassing the first \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E upgrade.  Though I don\u0027t think that part count should be an in-game limitation of any sort, it is something I might need to pay attention to as stock has decided that it does matter.  I would be fine with the first tier or two of parts having a bit of a premium in their \u0027cost\u0027 to compensate for their increased utility compared to stock parts (later parts would use a more normal cost balancing as part-count is not such a huge deal after the initial tier or two of tech tree is unlocked)."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-07T21:14:13Z","Content":"I think the play through required for a career balance pass will be as follows.

Would like to keep things somewhat consistent between parts for easier re-use of textures, but may well end up with a couple different types of support structures even for just the torus parts (will certainly be at least a crew tube\u002Btruss, plain truss, telescoping crew tube, and possibly a telescoping alternate to the truss as well; haven\u0027t even thought about support rigging/tension braces yet)."},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-07T22:37:09Z","Content":"Bit of work figuring out some of the inflatable torus deployment animations.  Going to be a bit of hand-waving going on with these parts -- the deployment animation being used wouldn\u0027t be mechanically possible exactly as shown, but is about the best approximation that I\u0027ll be able to create without delving into some very complex mesh  and animation setups.  As long as it looks good while deployed, decent while stowed, and doesn\u0027t make you go \u0027ugghh..\u0027 while the animation is playing, I\u0027m going to call it \u0027good enough\u0027.  Should probably be more thought of an animated construction step rather than a simple inflation procedure.\n\nSo.. updated render of the smallest centrifuge part (1.25m core, 10m x 2.5m torus, 2.5m outer diameter when stowed).  Using the HAB textures to see how bad the distortion will be for various animation states; they will be getting their own textures.   The module shown would be roughly equivalent to the \u0027Nautilus\u0027 demonstrator module concepts.  The 1.25m core should line up well for use with the existing station modules.\n\n![G5IH2po.gif](http://i.imgur.com/G5IH2po.gif)\n\nHonestly I think the existing torus/centrifuge geometry is pretty close to what they\u0027ll end up being.

The larger torus parts will have multiple support arms / crew tubes and possibly some form of external bracing if I can pull off the animation for it.  The general external geometry will be fairly plain though, a simple torus; as with the HAB parts much of the detail will be part of the texture.\n\nAnyhow, my goal for the next week (or three...) will be to get the geometry and textures for the inflatable torus centrifuges finished and the initial balance setup for those parts.  Next up will be finishing up the SC-D parts (for the TKS/VA craft).  From there I\u0027ll be moving into an extended balance, cleanup, and bug-fixing stage, as well as taking a few weeks out in order to work on finishing up the wheels and re-introducing the SC-E parts."},{"CreatedByName":"RedParadize","CreatedById":129285,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-07T22:46:02Z","Content":"[@Shadowmage](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/138730-shadowmage/) Great, there is some mesh I would like to have for reference.

That makes a huge difference as it increases the mass, and in SSTU you don\u0027t need part count. Currently, the tanks in SSTU allow for full length selection from first unlocking them, which is 9\\*FL-T200. The trick is that I don\u0027t like limiting the SSTU lengths, as that defeats the purpose, IMHO. Can the dry mass be too high, then use the \u0022upgrade\u0022 functionality to make them sensible?\n\nI think to start, I\u0027d (sadly) move all the SSTU stuff up to at least the 45 level (tier 4) to start. Perhaps the small diameter tank (.625) lower at tier 3, instead of having that diameter be a decrease node bump higher up... The trick is that we need a *payload* for it. I\u0027d love to see a small probe core---like a nosecone shape---in the 0.625 size, then throw those in early.\n\nSoyuz was really contemporary to Apollo, but unless SSTU adds in a Gemini analog, that will leave a huge gap. I think for *gameplay*, I\u0027d put the Soyuz spacecraft stuff at the 90 science level. The MFT-D perhaps can stay where it is, as well as the 1.875 diameter change, and I guess the Russian engines as well.\n\nThe Soviet station stuff should all be in the 160 tier, I guess.

I suppose the 2 \u0022A\u0022 inflatables could appear with Shuttle in the 300s.\n\nThe radial materials science bay should likely move to 90 as it\u0027s a miniaturized version of the stock one that appears at 45 science points.

Though for this case it should be the \u0027master\u0027 branch, which it should have defaulted to.\n\nIf you had already forked it at some time in the past it probably just brought you to that old version;  you will need to either update that fork (difficult through website), or delete that fork and re-fork it.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, tater said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E In case anyone can mess with this: [https://github.com/nasa/NASA-3D-Resources/tree/master/3D Models](https://github.com/nasa/NASA-3D-Resources/tree/master/3D%20Models)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E NASA 3d models.

That makes a huge difference as it increases the mass, and in SSTU you don\u0027t need part count. Currently, the tanks in SSTU allow for full length selection from first unlocking them, which is 9\\*FL-T200. The trick is that I don\u0027t like limiting the SSTU lengths, as that defeats the purpose, IMHO. Can the dry mass be too high, then use the \u0022upgrade\u0022 functionality to make them sensible?\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I think to start, I\u0027d (sadly) move all the SSTU stuff up to at least the 45 level (tier 4) to start. Perhaps the small diameter tank (.625) lower at tier 3, instead of having that diameter be a decrease node bump higher up... The trick is that we need a *payload* for it. I\u0027d love to see a small probe core---like a nosecone shape---in the 0.625 size, then throw those in early.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [snip]\n\u003E \n\nI like most of those suggestions, except the \u0027tanks start at tier 4\u0027 (and other bits not starting until tier 4).\n\nIf tanks aren\u0027t unlocked until tier 4 what am I supposed to use on my early rockets?  (Keep in mind I remove nearly all stock parts from my games; notably the 1.25m tanks and engines, 2.5m tanks and engines, and all but the \u0027flea\u0027 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E are gone).\n\nWould much rather that the tanks use a worse mass-ratio initially and \u0027upgraded\u0027 to the current mass ratio at tier 4.  -Should- be doable with the part upgrade system.  This would be separate from, and multiplicative with, the \u0027tank modifier type\u0027 (which also needs to be tech-limited at some point...)."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-08T16:37:50Z","Content":"Yeah, I know. I was using stock only rockets, as well as stock plus SSTU for testing (though mostly SSTU).
