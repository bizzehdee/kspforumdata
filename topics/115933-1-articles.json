This is the simplest way to block stuff, with easy way to bypass too. To make it harder to bypass, sometime they either block alternate DNS server, like my school, or they redirect alternate DNS server, like my ISP, which in this way can be fixed by using dnscrypt, which encrypts the DNS traffic so no one can mess with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe stronger way filters works is to use deep packet inspection, which as the name suggests, it inspects all packets to see if they contain prohibited information or not. This is more stronger as the only way to circumvent this is to use some sort of proxy like web proxy or VPN, but this is more heavy, so this is used if the people/organization really don\u0027t want that information to be received, like enterprises and China. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECountermeasure to this is to use VPN and proxy, which encrypts the traffic so the DPI filter doesn\u0027t know it contains the banned information, and it goes to a server in a free internet zone where it gets decrypted and go back to its original server. This is called tunneling. HTTPS also works similarly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECounter-countermeasure to this is to block VPN and proxy traffic\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the most powerful way to bypass all of that filters is to use other internet completely, like using 3G/LTE connection or piggybacking free wifi.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECountermeasure to this is to jam other radios, either by spamming trash radio signals or by impersonating other wifi and sending disconnect command to it.
