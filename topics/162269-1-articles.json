At least I think that\u0027s how it worked in earlier versions? But that does not seem to be the case. Once an experiment is processed to get data for research, I can no longer remove it from the Lab module.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there a way to take the experiment for recovery or it it lost forever once processed?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf not, what does this imply game-play-wise - it will take a long time to get the precious science points from the lab for what is apparently a small gain, not worth the hassle?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"overkill13","CreatedById":173506,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-18T18:25:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo each experiment twice. \u00A0Or in the case of partial return experiments (Mystery Goo and Science Jr) do them an extra time for the lab. \u00A0Store extras in pods or passenger modules or bring a science container along for each repeat. \u00A0Scientists are, obviously, helpful for resetting the Goos and Jrs so you don\u0027t have to carry extras science modules.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFeed one completed experiment\u00A0of each into the lab and the rest go to Kerbin or get transmitted as is. \u00A0You can collect the science for the experiments and the data processing from the lab for each experiment in each biome/situation. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jarin","CreatedById":71395,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-18T18:25:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou need to get two copies if you want both a lab entry and return science.
