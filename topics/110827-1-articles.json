And Now Twin-Roller!***\n\n![hUv0uHN.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/hUv0uHN.jpg)\n\n**The Uni-Roller is a 100% stock Jet-Propelled rover inside of a large freely rotating wheel made of high durability parts.**\n\n**The Uni-Roller can obtain speeds up to 40 M/S. Unfortunately the faster it goes the greater the force placed on the wheel. The faster the speed the larger the wheel stretches. The more the wheel stretches the likelier the possibility of a mechanical failure resulting in serious damage.**\n\n**The maximum safe speed on level ground is around 20-30 M/S. It is recommended to make turns under 25 M/S as the small stabilizers on the side cannot keep the craft from flipping on its side at faster speeds.**\n\nDownload and drive it yourself here: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/muxvqi6r9jgaxms/UniRoller.craft?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/muxvqi6r9jgaxms/UniRoller.craft?dl=0)\n\nThe Twin-Roller is a continuation of the Uni-Roller but as it\u0027s name suggests... Has two wheels instead of one. All rules that apply to the Uni-Roller apply to the Twin-Roller.\n\nDownload the Twin-Roller here: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/aydgcht0bljvuoq/Twin-Roller.craft?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/aydgcht0bljvuoq/Twin-Roller.craft?dl=0)\n\n**Known Glitch:** Since the outside part of the wheel is uncontrolled it will likely be deleted as debris after going back to the space center. If you do not wish this to happen attach a small probe core to the inside portion of the outer wheel or wheels.\n\n![zcfr7HP.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/zcfr7HP.jpg)\n\n![cWp6ABp.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/cWp6ABp.jpg)\n\n![U112rUG.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/U112rUG.jpg)\n\n![g8hqF5s.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/g8hqF5s.jpg)\n\n![KnHQBJi.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/KnHQBJi.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-26T03:14:46Z\u0022 title=\u002205/26/2015 03:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jon144**"},{"CreatedByName":"Noname117","CreatedById":53624,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T21:30:12Z","Content":"This is one of the most creative things I have ever seen in KSP"},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T21:51:06Z","Content":"Neat!

The old landing gear.... Squad did something funky with their physics with the update. I don\u0027t know why or what but the wheels on it just clip into anything they touch now. Luckily the new smaller gears have far more rigid hit-boxes and work well as bearings. Their main problem is they are pretty glitch parts in the editor at least. Whenever you use the sideways/horizontal/vertical move tool they have a habit of snapping into very strange places."},{"CreatedByName":"Jeb Cubed","CreatedById":70444,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T16:52:30Z","Content":"Wow, that is awesome.
