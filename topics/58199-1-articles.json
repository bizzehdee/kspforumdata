For surface samples, have an animation of the kerbal putting some dirt in a small bag, or taking a core sample. Maybe even have them do things like deploy small machines (the same way a flag would be planted) for collecting data, like what was done in the Apollo program. There was an animation of a kerbal picking up a rock that was never implemented into the game, I think it would be a great start.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hashbrown66","CreatedById":65106,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-30T04:07:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree, animations for the win! I wonder if Squad is just holding out on adding content until they work through new systems like science and an economy. It seems like there hasn\u0027t been a whole lot of new parts/small bug fixes/fine-tuning in the last couple of updates.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
