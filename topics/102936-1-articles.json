Will you hit the atmosphere low enough to (crash) land or just do aerobraking? If aerobraking, will you be captured into an elliptical orbit or still be on a hyperbolic orbit? How long will you be in the atmosphere for, or (approximately) when will landing occur? This calculator can help.\n\n[http://cfe316.github.io/ksp_atm_entry/](http://cfe316.github.io/ksp_atm_entry/)\n\nThis calculator is primarily meant for use with mods like **RemoteTech** where craft cannot be controlled instantly; rather, burns and actions must be pre-programmed, so timing is important.\n\nGiven an initial altitude, periapsis, and velocity (and body that you\u0027re orbiting), it will compute the outcome.\n\nThis calculator is a descendent of Alterbaron\u0027s Aerobraking Calculator [http://alterbaron.github.io/ksp_aerocalc/](http://alterbaron.github.io/ksp_aerocalc/) and borrows the interface and integrator, but is somewhat different. Alterbaron\u0027s calculator solves for an aerobraking periapsis for a desired apoapsis and tells you how to burn. This calculator only predicts what will happen, and handles landing and escaping rather than only aerobraking.\n\nWhile the **Trajectories** mod displays landing or aerobraking trajectories, I don\u0027t believe it offers this sort of timing information. (I don\u0027t have it installed so please correct me...)\n\n**For Best Results**\n\nDon\u0027t enter the values when you\u0027re right at apoapsis; the maths (and your velocities) have limited precision there. Best wait till a few degrees afterward.\n\nTo use this calculator when your ship is headed up toward apoapsis, add twice your \u0027time to apoapsis\u0027 from the in-game orbit display to the results.\n\n(Edit April 23rd: I\u0027ve fixed the code and prograde vs retrograde orbits now work correctly: previously, they had been switched.)\n\nThe \u0027time to (and altitude at) 250m/s\u0027 are currently using the *orbital* velocity, not the *surface* velocity. Since the planet\u0027s surface is moving in the orbital frame, you should actually be going slower than 250m/s at the stated time. Since Jool\u0027s \u0027surface\u0027 moves faster than that, it gives nonsense answers, but also trying to land on Jool is a bad idea. I\u0027m planning to fix this to track the surface velocity instead (as one would expect).\n\nRemember that terrain height can be non-negligible. The \u0027Time to 0m\u0027 assumes no terrain.\n\nRemember not to extend solar panels until after you\u0027re sure the chutes have deployed fully, else they can break off.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-23T18:15:39Z\u0022 title=\u002204/23/2015 06:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by cfe316**"}]}
