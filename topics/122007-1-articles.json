And my problem is that the contracts to put things in specific orbits... well.. I can\u0027t see the \u0022specific orbit\u0022 guidelines in my map anymore! They used to show up all the time, and now they only show up sometimes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now I have two active \u0022specific orbit\u0022 contracts, one to put something in orbit around Kerbin and another to put something in orbit around the Sun. If I go in my (fully upgraded) tracking center I can usually see the target orbit around Kerbin. I think I saw the solar orbit once. But when I\u0027m on a flight, I can\u0027t see either orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried removing KER but the issue persists. Did I do something to turn these orbit indicators off?
