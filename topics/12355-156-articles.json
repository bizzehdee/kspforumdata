Once in LKO, target the Mun and from the maneuver planner do the Hohmann xfer to target as Gal said. This will actually put you on a collision course. Now you want to (from the maneuver planner again) do \u0027fine tune to target\u0027 with a 100km final Ap. You should now have two nodes. Do \u0027Execute all nodes\u0027 from the maneuver planner and let MJ do it\u0027s thing. The warp helper is good for not over shooting the SOI once MJ is done executing burns. Once in the Mun\u0027s SOI, do circularize at Pe from the planner and execute node and you should be golden.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis works for minmus as well. Correcting for the inclination isn\u0027t absolutely necessary as the that fine tuning node will correct for that with a minimum dV cost. It\u0027s cheaper to correct for inclination en-route than prior to the inital xfer burn. A 6 degree change in LKO runs you about 230dV while the fine tune burn will only cost 10-50dV depending on where minmus is in its orbit. Alternately if you\u0027re using MJ just target minmus prior to launch and \u0027Launch into target plane\u0027 on the ascent AP.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LORDPrometheus","CreatedById":61414,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-19T14:30:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MD5Ray01\u0022 data-cite=\u0022MD5Ray01\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027ve kind of noticed a problem with MechJeb.

It is beyond painfully slow, and even when I\u0027m very close to my target docking port the auto-docking sends me off into space away from my target. I think you\u0027ll have more luck utilizing Smart A.S.S. and switching between ships to dock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProcedure that works for me:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.) Get within a comfortable distance of your target (I do 50m for small craft, and 100m for large craft).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.) I am going to assume you know how to select control from docking ports, and set as target target ports. Switch between crafts using the \u0027[\u0027 \u0027]\u0027 keys to do the same for both craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.) On both craft select the \u0027TGT\u0027 tab in Smart A.S.S., and select the \u0027\u002BTGT\u0027 button. Wait for them to line up with each other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.) Select \u0027Kill Rot\u0027 in Smart A.S.S. on the target craft after they have lined up with each other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5.) Switch to your approaching craft and select \u0027\u002BRELV\u0027, or \u0027-RVEL\u0027 (depending on which will take less time to line up with). I suggest RCS be off at this point if it isn\u0027t. Once the approaching craft is lined up with the prograde reticle or the retrograde reticle click \u0027Kill Rot\u0027 in Smart A.S.S. Turn RCS on and tap the \u0027H\u0027 or \u0027N\u0027 keys until your relative velocity is as close to zero as you can get it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6.) Turn RCS off (I found turning using RCS adds relative velocity to my craft. Probably improper RCS balance on my craft builds. I only worry about RCS balance on the forward and backwards axis (\u0027H\u0027, \u0027N\u0027 buttons). Press \u0027\u002BTGT\u0027 on Smart A.S.S.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7.) When approaching craft is lined up on the target reticle swtich back to target craft and press \u0027\u002BTGT\u0027 on Smart A.S.S.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8.) When both craft are aligned with each other turn RCS back on approaching craft and press \u0027H\u0027 until relative velocity is approximately 0.5m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9.) Now watch your target reticle and your prograde reticle. The prograde reticle should remain mostly inside the target reticle as you approach your target. If it starts to drift from the target reticle return to step 4 and repeat process. Just remember your relative velocity is now 0.5m/s, so you\u0027ll have to kill all of that velocity as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10.) At 5 meters from target I switch to target craft and select \u0027Kill Rot\u0027 in Smart A.S.S. I switch back to approaching craft and watch the magic happen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter much practice the above method works 9 out of 10 times for me. If I bounce off I usually just have to do a retrograde (because I\u0027m now traveling away from target) RCS burn to get back to target. Make sure you switch to target and select \u0027\u002BTGT\u0027 in Smart A.S.S. if this happens, though wait until approaching craft is more than 5m away before doing so. Repeat steps 7 thru 10 until successful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope the above helps. Docking was a huge pain in the arse for me until much practice and experience. I don\u0027t know why the auto-docking module is almost useless for me (probably something I am doing wrong myself), but I can\u0027t use it the way it currently works for me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SergeiKorolev","CreatedById":93743,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-19T22:14:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey I\u0027m kind of new to KSP and I wondering if MechJeb 2.1 can be integrated with the tech tree in KSP .22 and if so, how can I do this?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-19T22:37:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SergeiKorolev\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SergeiKorolev\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHey I\u0027m kind of new to KSP and I wondering if MechJeb 2.1 can be integrated with the tech tree in KSP .22 and if so, how can I do this?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s already integrated.

The manned lander is going to sit on the surface until refueling is done. During ascent, it will dump the three side tanks (when empty) with 909\u0027s and continue up on the single Poodle engine. With build 102 I know it can do that with enough fuel left to rendezvous. With 104?

Uses nearly all the fuel getting up to 45KM then will not completely shut down the engines after the circularization burn. It\u0027s not a problem with the landers turning speed causing nodes to be missed. They\u0027re short and have big reaction wheels so they can spin around fast to aim for the burns.

I agree that in the past the spaceplane autoland feature was worse than useless, I\u0027m convinced it was actively trying to kill my Kerbals. However, more recently - I\u0027m using build #98 - it works like a dream for me. I\u0027ve discovered, however, a few things: First, you don\u0027t want to be just anywhere on Kerbin, at any random heading and altitude, and just engage autoland and expect it to fly you all the way to the runway. No, you need to be somewhere between 100km to 300km out, at about 10,000 to 15,000 meters altitude. Then bring up the spaceplane guidance window, but don\u0027t choose \u0027autoland\u0027 just yet. First order of business is to set the \u0027autoland glide slope\u0027 to AT LEAST 7 degrees. The default of 3 degrees is, frankly, suicidal. It\u0027ll put you in the ocean if you\u0027re coming in east-to-west, and it\u0027ll DEFINITELY fly you into a mountain if you\u0027re coming in west-to-east. In fact, for a landing heading of 90 deg. I recommend a glide slope of more like 10 to 12 degrees. This is for the main KSC runway, btw, but it\u0027s pretty similar for the island airstrip too, just be aware that there\u0027s a ridge directly EAST of the island runway, so again set a slightly steeper glide slope to clear it. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Anyway, now select \u0027show navball autoland guidance\u0027. Use this to get your plane headed in generally the right direction. With me this can sometimes be an ugly affair, but as long as I\u0027m high enough I can usually recover from a spin before any lithobraking occurs. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Or, as I\u0027ve recently learned from another forum user, if you want MJ to fly that\u0027s fine, but don\u0027t use the crappy spaceplane \u0027altitude and heading hold\u0027 things, instead bring up Smart A.S.S., select SURF, and now you can control your pitch, heading and roll with total precision. Just be sure to set your roll to zero most of the time, 15 degrees at most if you\u0027re banking, and your pitch slightly nose-up, you\u0027ll have to experiment with your individual craft to see what generates level flight. Btw, negative roll is left, positive roll is right. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, now, once you have your yellow prograde indicator somewhat close to the purple target circle, and are flying fairly level at a MINIMUM of 10,000 meters, now you can engage autoland. At first the plane will dive a few thousand meters for some reason, but then it\u0027ll come back on track and put the prograde indicator right on the target circle. Now, regarding speed. For time savings I\u0027ll generally keep full throttle, or close to it, until I\u0027m fairly close to the runway, maybe 10 - 15km or so. Then throttle back to just enough to keep headway without stalling, but you want to be sure to do this AT LEAST 10km before the runway, because MJ can be slow to react to your throttle changes (autoland doesn\u0027t control your throttle, btw, you have to do that manually. FYI.), and it can porpoise up and down for a bit before settling back down, so you want to set the throttle at your final landing position fairly early. Erm, this is predicated on a powered landing, obviously, I haven\u0027t tried doing this with a glider like the REAL Space Shuttle yet, lol!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo that\u0027s about it, at this point you should be able to ride the autopilot all the way down until the wheels touch the runway. Finally, you need to do three things in quick succession once you are on the ground. Hit \u0027abort\u0027 on the autopilot so it doesn\u0027t keep trying to \u0027land\u0027 once it\u0027s already landed; cut your throttle; and engage your brakes. Hopefully your spaceplane landing gear is designed \u0026amp; constructed so as to track straight without any input.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBleh, sorry for the wall of text, I\u0027m just trying to help. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the rocket/vertical \u0027land at target\u0027, I\u0027ve been having good success with that as well. Except... Well, there are lots of people on this thread saying that this feature is now TOO accurate, that if they target a ship to land close to on, say, the Mun, that MJ will now literally land them right on top of the target ship. Well, I\u0027ve NEVER had that happen to me! When doing the de-orbit burn, it always stops doing corse correction burns as soon as it breaks 150 meters on the predicted landing site, and only rarely does it ever even land that close, it\u0027s usually more like 300 - 400 meters. Not a huge problem, I just think it\u0027d be nice to be able to get within 50 meters more often than not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlright, \u0027nuff said, more than enough I\u0027m sure, lol.
