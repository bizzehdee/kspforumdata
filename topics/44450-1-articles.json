Minmus looks like a speck. I\u0027ve never seen Jool from Kerbin, yet it should be looking like a slightly green tinted star.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere should be a more realistic approach, not only because of aestetics, but general usefulness, navigation. In real life, when you move way from a bright object, its luminosity drops and so does the angular diameter. Looking from space, cloudless Earth is very blue, but if you go far away from it, the saturation drops, so you get a light blue point in the sky. Every space simulator program I\u0027ve used simulated this effect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt takes a lot of space between an eye and an object to dim it beyond vision. What goes for natural objects, goes for the artificial ones, too. Spent rocket stages are so tiny and so far away they don\u0027t have a discernible angular diameter (like stars don\u0027t, that\u0027s why they twinkle when looked through atmosphere) so they look like asteroids.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news168.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news168.html\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESatellites in our orbit look like points, yet they\u0027re so far and so small you could never ever see them if they weren\u0027t illuminated against a dark sky.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the sky, which is quite dreadful at the moment, gets replaced with a realistic, point-like, randomly made star map, star-like planets, satellites and artificial object would look even better. I\u0027d even remove the galaxy as you just can\u0027t see it unless you\u0027re under a clear, dark sky.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"technicalfool","CreatedById":70430,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-31T06:17:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESeconded. There must be a way to put a satellite on rails for ease of physics, but keep its rendering switched on. Maybe even preserve rotation, so if it was tumbling before, it carries on tumbling, but as a single rigid body. Make it so that satellites and debris beyond a certain distance (or below a certain zoom level) get rendered as a point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it\u0027d be pretty cool, if there are going to be telescopes added for planet-spotting, to be able to also see your own satellites. Add a dithering effect for atmospheric haze. It\u0027s quite possible to see the stripes of Jupiter with a 110mm reflecting telescope, and you can make out the solar panels and main body of the ISS easily. Tracking the 17,000mph orbiting research station with a manual gear on the other hand, now that takes a steady hand!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a bit of a workaround, you can use the Lazor Systems mod to increase the physics distance up to 90-something kilometres. Really not recommended though, unless your satellites are all teeny little things.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
