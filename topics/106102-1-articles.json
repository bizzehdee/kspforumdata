Why this is a problem is that by using F5/F9 I can change the elapsed time and I always get the same result. Each time I get a close intercept regardless of how long it takes it fails.\n\nCould this be that the contract actually has already expired but that isn\u0027t recognised until I get close enough to switch to the target ?\n\nJust FYI, this is the knarliest rescue I\u0027ve yet seen. Target is a capsule not a Kerbal in a suit, and the orbit is at around 10 degrees off equatorial and is out between Mun and Minmus. Took an upgrade to go beyond 30 parts to be able to built a craft with enough fuel to reach.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-30T10:08:02Z\u0022 title=\u002204/30/2015 10:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kersplattle**"},{"CreatedByName":"RexKramer","CreatedById":76862,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T21:19:09Z","Content":"Time remaining on a contract can be viewed by clicking on the contract in the contracts building.

Best explanation I can come up with. This last time I stopped 1.2 km away and jet-packed the stranded verbal (Moena) over. That worked, managed to get her home with about 1 unit of electricity left !"},{"CreatedByName":"Shpaget","CreatedById":45577,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T10:17:53Z","Content":"Well, 0.5 km (500 m), while close enough for rescue, is certainly not dangerously close. It should not cause collisions. What is your relative speed?\n\nI usually go for \u003C0.2 m/s at \u003C50 m. Getting closer is of no particular use. It\u0027s easier to maneuver while EVA than in a ship.\n\nAre you perhaps burning the stuff you want to rescue with engine exhaust? It won\u0027t be happening at 500 m, but if you get too close..."},{"CreatedByName":"Reactordrone","CreatedById":110060,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T14:41:43Z","Content":"There is a heat bug at the moment that can cause ships to explode if you\u0027ve used F9 so it could be that.\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117856-Random-Exploding-Space-Rendezvous](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117856-Random-Exploding-Space-Rendezvous)"}]}
