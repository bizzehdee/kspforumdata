There are a bunch of issues getting things to behave more realistically. One thing lacking is mass. A lot of KSP crafts are built from aircraft parts, which simply don\u0027t have enough mass. If you want something to behave like it\u0027s 40 tons, make it 40 tons. Then tune the wheels/tracks to match.
