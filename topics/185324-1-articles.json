My discoveries:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n1. Hinges are very weak compared to pistons, even when increased beyond all reasonable limits.\u003Cbr\u003E\n2. At 10x the normal force, a piston can lift as much as the part itself can handle. Pistons lifted every load, right up until the ones that could force the piston through the foot and into the ground\u003Cbr\u003E\n3. Geometry is very, very important. While a vertically oriented piston can lift an enormous amount, one at an angle can have a hard time extending at all.\u003Cbr\u003E\n4. If a part clips into a piston, it will very likely stop the piston from working, regardless of the actual force of the piston.\u003Cbr\u003E\n5. Since power draw scales with absolute force, not force percent, it gets very intense. Easily seeing draw in the high hundreds for some of the heavy lift test.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTomorrow, I\u0027m going to test with some even higher levels. There\u0027s a very good chance that all of them will just instantly destroy whatever they\u0027re attached to. I\u0027ll also see if it\u0027s possible to lash a bunch of pistons together with struts to serve as larger ones.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
