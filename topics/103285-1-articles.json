It started to jump and wouldn\u0027t stop \u0027til the heat death of the universe. I had some other stuff in sight and once I switched the vessels with [ and ] I couldn\u0027t switch back to my main vessel although it was 300 meters away. Maybe a right-click switch to would help. Maybe not. But it also would be a nice thing in space. Wouldnt have to jump between everything and choose just the thing we want to control.\n\nHope this post is clear enough to understand. Things I say tend to be really chaotic.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-03T12:16:10Z\u0022 title=\u002204/03/2015 12:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Veeltch**"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T01:32:49Z","Content":"Would be useful."},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T02:03:09Z","Content":"They could also look at fixing buoyancy in KSP."}]}
