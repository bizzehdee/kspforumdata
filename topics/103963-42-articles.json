I had an Idea. Is it possible to have a settings menu for in atmosphere viewing, and a completely separate settings menu for outer atmosphere viewing? Then an automatic transmission between the two during ascent? It\u0027s a simple suggestion that I\u0027m sure has monumental coding mountains to overcome. But the idea would be to tailor what it looks like when you are flying through a planet verses passing over one. I have not been able to find a happy medium between the two. Scatterer makes in atmosphere look breathtaking. But as soon as I enter orbit. It looks like a ball of blue soup. I am sure some of this is my own ignorance in not being able to find a happy medium in the settings menu. I will keep playing with it. And please don\u0027t take anything I just said as negative.

I suggested this as a way of removing the flickering circles from orbit. I\u0027m taking back that suggestion until future updates when EVE-Scatterer integration is at a more solid state. In the current moment of scatterers development I don\u0027t feel that suggesting fixes or even reporting bugs is all that useful. Keep reading before you judge this comment. This time of year is usually tests and finals for colleges/schools as well as other irl business that has been effecting numerous modders on the forums (including myself). Just as a guess, Blackrack might be busy irl, and posting bugs and suggestions is probably not beneficial. Especially as the suggestions and bugs have probably already been posted.

Idk if you have a 4K monitor (I don\u0027t) but regardless it shows some phenomenal footage of the earths atmospheric scattering from orbit as the sun falls. It could be useful!
