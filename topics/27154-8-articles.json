Even scaled to 64% for KSP that\u0027s still 42kN. There are 8 SuperDraco engines on a Dragon Rider. That gives you approx. 340kN of thrust. That\u0027s a LOT for such a small craft, but if you figure it has to slow the capsule down from post re-entry speed (about 800m/s) to practically zero on landing, as well as being able to rapidly accelerate the capsule away from the rocket in the event of abort, then it kinda needs it. The Delta-V issue might just be an over-calculation of the fuel provided. I suspect it needs fine-tuning to provide a little less.

I\u0027m not much for \u0022maths\u0022 in my games but I appreciate that there are people who can (and like to) do so. If I understand the little delta-v map I saw on the wiki, you\u0027d basically want something that gives more than around 2900 m/s (to get from the Dunar surface to Low Kerbin Orbit) but less than around 4500 m/s (because the idea isn\u0027t to have a capsule that can achieve a Kerbin orbit all on its own). Does that sound about right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI look forward to the ongoing success and development of your mod - and in the meantime I\u0027m going to give my Kerbals a tan in that beautiful blue light. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-02T03:18:59Z\u0022 title=\u002208/02/2013 03:18  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 2, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by HeadHunter67\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdded suggested delta-v range.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LazarusLuan","CreatedById":61673,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-02T03:27:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe new landing gear is done and I\u0027ll have an update uploaded shortly - here are some pics:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://electrictomatoes.com/ksp/screenshot45a.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot45a.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://electrictomatoes.com/ksp/screenshot46a.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot46a.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://electrictomatoes.com/ksp/screenshot48a.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot48a.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mekan1k","CreatedById":48750,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-02T03:39:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWow that\u0027s sexy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
