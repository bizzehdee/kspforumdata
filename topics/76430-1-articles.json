About 30 years, and 6 generations of vehicles later, I managed to get Jeb home again. Things I learned:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Getting down to Eve surface w/Deadly Reentry is nearly as difficult as getting back to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Heatshields are your friends - use them liberally, but make sure you can jettison them before re-assent because you can\u0027t afford the mass going back up\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. You need parachutes going down, but not going back up. I used sepratrons to jettison the lander can/parachute module after landing\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Running out of electricity going down is BAD - you loose attitude control, so your heat shields point in the wrong direction. Make sure you have enough batteries.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Include RCS on the lander, because you may need RCS to keep it from falling over immediately after touchdown. Jettison RSC after landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. For ascent, you need ~12000 dV to make it to orbit. To keep drag from slowing you too much, you need the TMR to be \u0026gt;= 1.7 until you get into the upper atmosphere\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Struts are good. Without struts, things fall apart in heavy gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/70414588/Venus7_landed.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Venus7_landed.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/70414588/Venus7_ascending.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Venus7_ascending.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am currently working on a lander in 0.24.2, where I hope to get some mystery goo home.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
