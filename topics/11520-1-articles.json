I imported the .blend file into Unity as per C7\\\u0027s tutorial, and everything worked as it should. Then, upon importation of the complete part into KSP, the collider mesh not only appears in full white regalia, but is also flipped backwards on its axis, leaving it open to be seen. Has anyone encountered this sort of problem, and if so, are there any solutions you know of? If you need any more information, please tell me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AdmiralStewart","CreatedById":20612,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-27T21:46:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh man was I ever frustrated by flipped/rotated colliders.

Expand the heirarchy and find each collider listed, then apply the Physics -\u0026gt; Mesh collider as Admiral suggested.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you do that, you can delete the Mesh Renderer and Filter, leaving on the Mesh Collider attributes on that specific collider object (be sure to check \u0027convex\u0027 too!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf one of those colliders need to provide collision to any animated object, just parent it to that object in the hierarchy. I found that you need to have the collider\\\u0027s pivot/origin within the mesh in order for it to be moved properly during the animation; Otherwise it rotates it around the distant pivot and causes it to move oddly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Radion","CreatedById":3273,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-28T01:20:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks, both of you.
