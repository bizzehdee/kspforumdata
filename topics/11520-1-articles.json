I imported the .blend file into Unity as per C7\\\u0027s tutorial, and everything worked as it should. Then, upon importation of the complete part into KSP, the collider mesh not only appears in full white regalia, but is also flipped backwards on its axis, leaving it open to be seen. Has anyone encountered this sort of problem, and if so, are there any solutions you know of? If you need any more information, please tell me."},{"CreatedByName":"AdmiralStewart","CreatedById":20612,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-27T21:46:08Z","Content":"Oh man was I ever frustrated by flipped/rotated colliders. Here\\\u0027s what I find works every time:\n\nBuild your model, reset all your origins to a common central point.\n\nDrag/drop your .blend file into your Unity project. Drag/drop that underneath your PartObject that you create. There should be two models to expand underneath that.\n\nHere\\\u0027s where I kept getting messed up: don\\\u0027t delete your collider mesh. Simply select it, and in the inspector window, uncheck Renderable, Cast, and Receive Shadows.\n\nSelect the actual model (third level down in the Game Object heirarchy; PartObject--\u003EBlenderImport--\u003ETheActualModel).\n\nThen insert Game Component-\u003EPhysics-\u003E Mesh Collider.\n\nThen drag the wireframe body of the collider (in the project window, below the BlenderImport - the icon with wires, not the blue one) into the mesh line of the Mesh Collider that is applied to your model.\n\nIf needed, I\\\u0027ll post a screenshot when I get back on my Computer."},{"CreatedByName":"Tiberion","CreatedById":8356,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-27T22:18:30Z","Content":"There\\\u0027s another way you can do it, too.\n\nOnce imported properly into Unity, drag the part into the GameObject you created in the heirarchy. Expand the heirarchy and find each collider listed, then apply the Physics -\u003E Mesh collider as Admiral suggested.\n\nOnce you do that, you can delete the Mesh Renderer and Filter, leaving on the Mesh Collider attributes on that specific collider object (be sure to check \u0027convex\u0027 too!)\n\nIf one of those colliders need to provide collision to any animated object, just parent it to that object in the hierarchy. I found that you need to have the collider\\\u0027s pivot/origin within the mesh in order for it to be moved properly during the animation; Otherwise it rotates it around the distant pivot and causes it to move oddly."},{"CreatedByName":"Radion","CreatedById":3273,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-28T01:20:45Z","Content":"Thanks, both of you. The part is working now."}]}
