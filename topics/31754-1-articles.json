On the upside, I\u0027ve already perfected my first SSTO to the point where 40% of fuel is left after reaching low Kerbin orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"S\u1D04\u026A\u0274\u1D1B\u026A\u029F\u029F\u1D00\u1D1B\u1D0F\u0280","CreatedById":69027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-07T00:05:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#006400;\u0022\u003ETut-tut, you should be studying \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#006400;\u0022\u003EWelcome to the forums!\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-07T00:53:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope you\u0027ll keep us posted on how that space program goes; it sounds like quite an interesting idea.

I\u0027m going to assume that your background means you\u0027re thoroughly familiar with most of the basic concepts, but many of the player aids there are oriented towards helping players apply many of the more complex operations and calculations specifically to the game environment, as well as providing key maps for the different controls (as the game itself is rather slim on the documentation).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy landings!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S.:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i685.photobucket.com/albums/vv213/Specialist290/4274282_460s_zps7a2de5e6.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00224274282_460s_zps7a2de5e6.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jod","CreatedById":68384,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-07T06:04:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks, I\u0027ve already glanced through the Drawing Board.
