It\u0027s very easy to do, as all Blender distributions have an addon called Network Render. All we need, though, is a master for clients to connect to and at least 3 slaves. (The slave computers don\u0027t have to be dedicated to Blender; they can run Blender in the background or something.)\n\nEDIT: Actually, netrender doesn\u0027t seem to split frames into smaller chunks.
