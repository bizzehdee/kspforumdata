All good, I may have to wait a full orbit to get to a point where I can plot an intercept, but Kerbals would rather wait in space for that kind of thing than on the ground. But while I\u0027m waiting, why not fulfill that contract to collect science around Kerbol. So, I open container that holds the little sciency bits on the hopper, and notice that it clips through the tanks I added last minute. It shakes and shudders, but holds together. Darn it, I hate that. That\u0027s what you get for last minute additions; that is management doing something without consulting the engineering section, bypassing quality control.

It\u0027ll be able to rendezvous with Duna but I have no idea if it has the delta-V to slow down into orbit. Probably, but I\u0027m too lazy to break out the calculator right now.

Couldn\u0027t do it, impossible. Like, needle on another planet\u0027s haystack sort of impossible. But I found a willing rookie one-star pilot willing to sacrifice her life. Or at least her free time. So, with the remaining science I had saved up (I don\u0027t always spend it in one place) I researched the Claw. Built a simple ship: lots of gas, and a section that will detach with a new lander can and sciency bits. Launch. Get to orbit, plan trajectory and full-throttle. Upon leaving Kerbin\u0027s SOI, I plan and execute a trajectory that gets me to within 12,000 km but at about a 30* angle of the Ike mission ship. But we\u0027re learning stuff here, lets try it. About halfway through the plotted course I make some little adjustments along the 6 axises. Intercept is now ~9,000 km away. And so on and so forth. I would stop time-warping every time I reached halfway through the remaining course, stop the time-warp, and rotate to prograde and see if going forward or backward would get the intercept any closer, and do the same with normal-antinormal and the other axis (the light blue one) as well. And wouldn\u0027t you know it, by the time the intercept was a few days away, I got it to within 5 kilometres! The relative velocity was still rather extreme, like 2,200 m/s, but I had just enough delta-V to pull that off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://jscript.ca/ksp-images/v1-0/career/Ike%20Mission/Screen-Shot-2015-05-23-at-8.07.50-PM.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Screen-Shot-2015-05-23-at-8.07.50-PM.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t felt this proud of a KSP accomplishment since the very early days, perhaps my first Mun landing.

The mission is now two ships: the fixed-up original and the spontaneously separated probe. But all is not well, at least from the gameplay perspective. The story part is fine, things are progressing nicely. I have managed to get both the ship and the probe almost into stable Duna orbits. Doing this, however, has been very frustrating as switching from the one vessel to the other is causing my game to glitch. If I adjust the course of one vessel and time-warp, this vessel stays stationary in the map while the other proceeds normally. I have to quit the game and reload, then it works for a bit, then starts to glitch again. It\u0027s very strange and makes me want to give up. I won\u0027t, but I\u0027ll probably wait a few days to simmer down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have to get the probe into the correct orbit in respect to the contract\u0027s specifications, then I have to land the Ike mission on the ground.

One fix was tilting the boosters that, as you will see, are tilted. The second was a bit of vertical strutting to reduce bending. Then it took me a few launches to get the now functional design to space. It would have been simple, however a couple of minor staging specifics had to be sorted out. Mostly it\u0027s that when I decoupled the radial boosters, I had to stop all engines and also, to make things go faster, I spun up the vehicle. That last bit wasn\u0027t entirely necessary, but it reduced some waiting time. Normally it would have taken a while for the boosters to get far enough from the rocket. However after that it was all easy. I reached orbit, did the typical M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn transfer, circularized, de-orbited, and, surprisingly, made a perfect landing - a nice touch-down at 1m/s. Then I started emptying the lander, one by one. I managed to get no more than 25 kerbals out (probably less) and then the game crashed. I never quicksaved (I almost never use that feature) and the save file seems to be broken. The space center and Kerbin under it won\u0027t appear when I load the save, anyways.

Alt-speed-dist records, suborbital flight, orbit, launchpad, astronaut complex, mission control and VAB upgrades, I\u0027m sure we all know the drill by now. I\u0027ve been trying to cram space tourism contracts in with my other missions, too. I developed a simple two-man drop-pod that gets down from orbit safely with no power whatsoever, if released on a decaying trajectory. I had a set of test contracts, and combined them with a pair of space-tourism ones as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETest the TR-2V suborbitally at 80-94km, the TR-2C orbitally at the same, and the Rockomax decoupler on an escape trajectory. When combined with my drop-pod, a pair of suborbital tourists, and a probe core for control, I could detach the tourists when I tested the TR-2V before circularising, then run the other tests and burn the escape before the tourists re-entered the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/N4PXUb.png\u0022 alt=\u0022N4PXUb.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/eux4rT.png\u0022 alt=\u0022eux4rT.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe drop-pod also came in handy when combining tourist and rescue missions - or just performing two rescue missions at once. In the above case, I hadn\u0027t fit any solar panels to the ship, so I had to carefully turn things off and on again, and there still wasn\u0027t quite enough fuel to deorbit... but Lagerselle could use what was left in her pack to put the periapse below 60km, and then get back in before detaching from the probe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/OSu4a0.png\u0022 alt=\u0022OSu4a0.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/lcbsMX.png\u0022 alt=\u0022lcbsMX.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also built a rather silly looking 139t (14t of that payload) rocket to get this little number up to space. I\u0027d gathered enough space-tourist contracts that I had four that all wanted Mun-Minmus flybys, so after a quick empty parachute test, Jeb took them off to see the sights. The plan is to use the Mun to reduce the speed with which they\u0027ll enter the atmosphere, reducing the risks of reentry. I don\u0027t have a picture of the rocket in full, but I lack the 2.5m tanks at this time. There was a cluster of four Swivels with a couple of FL-T400s each, above a six T400 stack with a Swivel, and attached with radial decouplers, six stacks of four T400s with Swivels themselves. This didn\u0027t get enough thrust, and was close to the borderline - three Thumper boosters would be too much. So I strapped two to the sides of the payload with more radial decouplers, and they got enough speed on launch that when they ran out, the Swivels could take over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/Wegup3.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Wegup3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/O6lUx8.png\u0022 alt=\u0022O6lUx8.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/kZjH8M.png\u0022 alt=\u0022kZjH8M.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, I did a little messing around and learned something about the damage caused by the RT-5 Flea. Unlike the RT-10 Hammer, if you put a Flea either side of an Okto, attached with their engines pointing in, the Okto will not be directly harmed. In fact, one of the Fleas (which, mind, have higher temperature tolerance than an Okto) will explode, and the other will shoot off, carrying the Okto with it. A little after the fuel runs out, heat conducted away from the Flea will finally do the Okto in, leaving a cooling, uncontrolled, empty Flea on a ballistic trajectory. If you try this with Hammers, the Okto will explode almost instantly, and both Hammers will fly away (or thrust into the ground aimlessly).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spartwo","CreatedById":58131,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T23:51:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMore drop pods\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg

I make a landing in the lowlands, then I hop over to the midlands and tag two different biomes. Then I go back to orbit, but realize I forgot to grab any science from the midlands. Well, OK, I\u0027m not above using F9. Which I did.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter grabbing the science, I orbit again. Then I dock with the mother ship Apollo style (nose to nose). My lander runs out of monoprop so I have to switch horses in midstream and finish the docking from the mother ship. But I do, so I\u0027m feeling pretty satisfied. Then I boost out of Ike orbit and drop down to Duna orbit. I have some contracts for gravity scans at high latitude, so I adjust my orbit to 70 degrees inclination while I\u0027m still highly eliptical. THEN I realize I never turned off the lander engine, so this whole time since I docked I\u0027ve been burning fuel from both ends of the rocket, just pushing against myself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoh!

Turned out, in spite of making a mostly MechJeb-free flight (including a rare manual descent and landing), the Kerbal X in 1.0 makes it to the Mun and back with about 100 m/s of delta-v to spare, presumably thanks to the new aero causing it to waste less fuel during ascent.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
