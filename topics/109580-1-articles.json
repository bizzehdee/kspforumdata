That\u0027s why we developed the F-104 Starfighter, to completely outclass the top of the line fighters of our opponents and halt the tide of Kemunism worldwide. \n\n*Inspired by the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter*\n\n**SPECIFICATIONS**\n\nParts: 84\n\nMass: 14.1t\n\nCrew: 1\n\nHeight: 3.7m\n\nWingsp\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A4n: 7.4m (external fuel tanks included); \n\nLength: 13.0m\n\nPowerplant(s): 1x Double J-X4 Whiplash Turbo Ramjet Engine\n\nMaximum SL Speed: Mach 1\n\nMaximum Speed: Mach 3\u002B @17.5 km altitude\n\nTurn radius: \u0022Banking with intent to turn\u0022\n\n**OPERATIONAL GUIDE**\n\n**Commands**\n\n1 - Start Engine(s)\n\n2 - Open drogue chute\n\n3 - Cut drogue chute\n\n**Takeoff**\n\nThe F-104 is stable on takeoff and will not divert either left or right, but the pilot must accelerate to at least 100 m/s before commencing rotation or the engine at the rear may impact the runway.\n\n**Landing**\n\nApproach the runway at 150 m/s. For the final approach, slow down to 90-100 m/s and land with a minimal application of pitch. Use airbrakes and the drogue chute to minimize the length of runway necessary.\n\n**Flight**\n\nThe F-104 is very stable at high speeds - and rolls well - but it is not very maneuverable. If in air-to-air combat, attempt to perform hit-and-run attacks instead of relying on turns to gain your advantage over the enemy.\n\n**LINK**\n\n[http://kerbal.curseforge.com/shareables/230584-kerheed-f-104-starfighter-stock-replica](http://kerbal.curseforge.com/shareables/230584-kerheed-f-104-starfighter-stock-replica)\n\n**ALBUM**\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
