If I\u0027m logged in to SpacePort, my addon downloads number is 11345. However, if I\u0027m not logged on the number is reduced to 8469. That\u0027s a difference of about 3,000 downloads. Anyone have a clue what is happening? Also if I\u0027m logged in the average rating is 161 ratings at 5 stars. If I\u0027m not logged in the average rating is 159 at 5 stars.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW I also saw that my comments count while I\u0027m not logged on is 25, while when I am logged on it is 33.
