The mission is expected to take approximately 20 years. Why are we going back? Well, here\u0027s a short history lesson:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Times New Roman\u0027;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003EHundreds of years have passed since the Kerbal race has left their old home of Kerbin for the better worlds of Duna and Laythe. The massive colonial effort that took place so long ago was lead by The Great Trio, Jebediah, Bill, and Bob. The reason for the evacuation of Kerbin has since been lost to history, but most speculate a Class F asteroid. The Great Trio have long since passed, but are heralded as heroes in colonies around Duna and Laythe. But now we are having trouble at our now current homes. Laythe is expected to fall into Jool within the next 50 years. The terraforming of Duna so long ago has lead to complications nowadays. We need to go home. For the good of Kerbalkind.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Times New Roman\u0027;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003EThe motto of the mission: Ex nova saecula redimus ad vetera.

Because of the limited resources on Duna, we had to be very conservative of our ores and fuel during its production. All work effort went into the craft, which was assembled in orbit. A module would be built, then sent up to rendezvous to the Remebrant to be attached.

The mid flight course correction is set to happen in five days. The whole crew has been getting restless, since we haven\u0027t fired the engines in about 230 days and Gerry, our engineer, is a little worried. We\u0027ve had a few alarms early in the flight about radiation leak from engine #3. So far, there has been no evidence of such a leak. Gerry has told me that I shouldn\u0027t throttle the engines to 100% during the burn in case the alarms are true. Anyways, that\u0027s my update for today. Commander Archibald out.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Times New Roman\u0027;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003EData Entry #239\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Times New Roman\u0027;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003EWell, the burn didn\u0027t go exactly to plan. The leak did turn out to be true. After burning for 30 seconds at 85% thrust, Gerry came on the intercom and told me to throttle back immediately, as engine #3 was about to overheat. I throttled down to 65%, but the heat didn\u0027t subdue. We had a good two minutes of panic until the heating went down at 33.5% thrust. The burn took three times longer than scheduled. Gerry is going to go on a risky observation EVA to look at engine #3 tomorrow. If we need to, we can shut it down indefinitely, but we would have to shut down engine #1 as well. That means we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll only have one half of the thrust we should have for this mission. I really hope this problem can be fixed.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Times New Roman\u0027;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003EData Entry #241\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Times New Roman\u0027;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003EWe could be in some deep crap right now. Engine #3 is pretty much broken, except we can fix it, temporarily. This fix requires parts from one of the radiators along the main hull of the Remebrant. The construction of this vessel only put on enough radiators as it would need. Getting rid of one might cause us to overheat even faster, but at the cost of being more efficient with our thrust. Max, our mission specialist, says we should use the radiator and risk overheating, while Gerry said the repair might not even work, so we should just settle for less thrust. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m supposed to make an official decision by day 245. This is going to be hard.
