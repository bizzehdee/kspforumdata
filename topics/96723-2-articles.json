I had tried, and tried, and tried...and no matter what I did, I just couldn\u0027t get enough speed through the atmosphere to break into orbit, or if I did I was out of gas shortly after, unable to circularize. So, what was my problem? I was trying, like a fool, to fly a rocket like, well, a rocket. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I jumped into the forums. I found out about this thing called a \u0027gravity turn\u0027 that you did at 10km straight up, pitch over to 45 degrees and you\u0027ll get to orbit (huh? won\u0027t that just flip the rocket around? I thought). I found out that nosecones were adding drag. I found that flat, bulky rockets flew better than my long sleek ones. I was flabbergasted, as here this whole time I was thinking this game was supposed to be \u0027realistic\u0027 and yet, almost everything I knew about rockets before KSP had to be thrown out the window. Shortly after I started I found FAR, and I\u0027ve never looked back...KSP is now the realistic-ish space simulator-ish game I\u0027ve always wanted. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess maybe I\u0027m not the typical case study, as I came from playing Orbiter. I would actually keep Orbiter running for a week at a time to simulate a real-time mission to the moon, so I felt very out of place with the physics of KSP (at least in atmosphere; in space it is still pretty darn good, and actually helped me learn quite a bit about Orbiter as well.)

The only thing I had to modify were my ascent profiles since my rockets all look like, well, rockets rather than a berserk ferris wheel on an acid trip. But rather than get too far down the road with FAR or NEAR, I stayed hopeful Squad would finally give us a workable aerodynamics model and opted for Stock Drag Fix seeing as I don\u0027t bother with planes much. I can build planes just fine, I\u0027m just a rubbish pilot.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-15T15:47:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022smjjames\u0022 data-cite=\u0022smjjames\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EGiven how much more effective asparagus staging seems to be, I wonder why it isn\u0027t done more in RL?\u003Cp\u003EObviously part of the answer is money, but still.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EBecause it\u0027s very difficult mechanically and very dangerous to do when there is an actual risk of failure (you are adding more failure paths).

Your engines will burn the tank that is gravity feeding them much faster than the fuel pumps can refill them. Essentially Asparagus is a \u0022near future\u0022 tech that KSP allows, not that much different from SSTOs which don\u0027t exist in r/l either.
