You could, however, start from a higher orbit, and if that doesn\u0027t work then you can just start the burn earlier and then correct the escape trajectory to your liking.

The upper stage of your launcher should be sufficient. You\u0027ll get a much quicker, more precise burn. It doesn\u0027t have to be enough to escape kerbin, just enough to kick the Ap out past the Mun or farther, getting you out of Kerbin\u0027s shadow to where the ion can take over. As a bonus the trajectory will be straighter at that point, meaning less inaccuracies during the long ion burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeading to the outer planets the burn will alway be across the dark side, and the opposite heading towards the inner system\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-15T16:44:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you have enough batteries and charge, you might be able to burn yourself off the darkside of kerbin before it is out of power. Also, it might be possible to do slight course correction as soon as you catch sunlight again.
