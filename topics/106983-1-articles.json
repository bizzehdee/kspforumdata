Featuring both High and Low attitude flights, along with an EXTREME MANEUVERABILITY, allows you to control this Interceptor (that comes with 2 missiles that fire straight) to the fully potential. These light missiles (named\n\n**HX MISSILE**\n\n, or HX Non-Seeking Missiles) allow you to destroy the enemy planes with ease.\n\nhttp://www./download/wckha4gl72xn11c/Vilniux_Interceptor.craft\n\nDownload link\n\nMade by [SKYTRAVEL](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/116768-STOCK-Skytravel-HIRING-1-0)\n\nFeel free to leave comments here and in the skytravel thread!"},{"CreatedByName":"zekes","CreatedById":23840,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T22:48:16Z","Content":"Nice plane!
