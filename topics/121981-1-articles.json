I wanted it ever since we got the tutorials, and I kinda hoped we would have something like this in stock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo how it would work:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- You build a ship/station/satelite in the editor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Instead of spawning it on the KSC pad/runway you choose an orbit for it (Universe Sandbox style) or put on a planet/moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Once it\u0027s in circular orbit you can edit all the numbers like retrograde, prograde, eccentricity, Ap, Pe, speed, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- When your first object is in space you can spawn another one near it. You choose how far it should spawn from your first object and relative velocity, or create a completely new one in a completely different orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Add windows informing about what is happening/what should be done next/hints.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s pretty much it. In my opinion community-driven scenarios would help teaching the newbies how to react in specific situations, or simply setting up space battles for fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Adding a \u0022Pause time\u0022 button to this might also be a good idea.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-29T19:55:08Z\u0022 title=\u002209/29/2015 07:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Veeltch\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nothingSpecial","CreatedById":118683,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-29T19:31:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like this idea.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
