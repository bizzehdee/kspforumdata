I have a whole spreadsheet dedicated to taking molar mass chemical rxns and resource densities and outputting the corresponding masses and liter input/outputs...and then doing a sanity check to see whether the masses balance.

It basically just took A LOT of electricity and light and assumed the Kerbals were creating waste, which the plants would then consume to produce the biomass resource, which in turn went into making fuel. A lot of players really liked it. I got a lot of good feed back and requests to incorporate more resources so it work with some of the life support mods. I also caught a small amount of .... for it because it was breaking the laws of physics. So fast forward a little, I get a message from seanth about collaborating on the mod, and he had bunch of really cool ideas, knew the science behind all the processes and offered to help develop the new versions with me. Now, we both for whatever reason ended up working extremely well together and our ideas seem to always line up really well...\u0022great minds\u0022 and all that.

On the other hand, I\u0027ll ignore things like that until I\u0027m griped at about it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way I see it, we are making a mod that adds eye candy and fun to the experience of play KSP ...\u0022TO HELL WITH REALISTIC RESULTS, IT\u0027S TOO SLOW!!\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way Sean sees it we should be, at the very least, some where in the same solar system as The Ball Park...\u0022PLEASE!!!!!!!
