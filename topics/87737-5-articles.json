I don\u0027t do anything to the code that produces IntakeAir, and I don\u0027t do anything to the code that consumes IntakeAir.

If there\u0027s enough air for everyone, then an engine gets what it asks for. If there isn\u0027t enough air available for everyone, then the engine only gets a percentage of it\u0027s request.
