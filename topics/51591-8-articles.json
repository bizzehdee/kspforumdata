Sometimes pagination is hard. :/\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe line of sight module requires either direct line of sight to any point on Kerbin, or connection through a chain of relays, each with direct line of sight to the next, and the last with direct line of sight to Kerbin, in order to transmit science via an antenna. Optionally, another setting lets the line of sight mechanic restrict control of probes when no connection to Kerbin is available, but \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/56440-0-24-AntennaRange-1-4-1-Enforce-and-Encourage-Antenna-Diversity?p=1151641\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1151641\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EI don\u0027t actually think this is a good mechanic\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only objects that block line of sight are the on-rails planetary bodies and their natural satellites. Asteroids and other vessels do not block line of sight. By default, there\u0027s a 5% \u0022fudge factor\u0022 done on the line of sight calcs, to make the creation of relay constellations a bit more forgiving -- essentially, AR pretends that a given body\u0027s radius is 5% smaller than it really is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAntennas are completely directionless, and will dynamically calculate their targets, choosing the closest target. So, if you are on the surface of Mun with an antenna that could reach Kerbin, but have a satellite in Munar orbit that can also reach Kerbin, and that satellite is not blocked by the Mun, you will transmit via that satellite instead of directly to Kerbin, reducing the energy cost of your transmission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope that answered your questions; feel free to ask with more specificity if I\u0027ve missed anything.
