If that\u0027s not a consideration with FAR, I can certainly start using fixed tails with elevator surfaces; the tail I have at the moment is all-moving. Am definitely reconsidering re-shaping the wing. Let me run my thinking by y\u0027all real quick:\n\nTarget wing loading is 0.3; I have 38 tonnes of plane, so I want 38 / 0.3 = 126.67 square meters of wing area. That\u0027s 126.67/2 = 63.33 square meters per wing. The fuselage length is 24 meters, so I want my root chord at 24/2 = 12 meters. If I say the tip chord is 12/10 = 1.2 meters, the wingspan I want should be = 63.33 / (0.5 \\* [12\u002B1.2]) = 9.59 meters...\n\nI think I see where I screwed up the math on my initial design - I didn\u0027t divide by 0.5, **I divided by 2**. 63.33/(2 \\* [12\u002B1.2]) = 2.399 meters. So that would explain that. That\u0027s also been a recurring error...\n\nThat is how a trapezoidal wing area is calculated, right? One-half times (the sum of the root chord and the tip chord) times the semi-span? And then triangular wings are just 1/2 times the span times the root chord, right? So if I went pure delta (no tip chord), I\u0027d want 63.33/(0.5\\*12) = 10.555 meters.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Another thought; if the rockets are heavier than the jets, swap them to the foremost position. I prefer jets nearer the centre-line anyway, since if you do get an asymmetrical flameout it\u0027ll be less dangerous than if they\u0027re out at the wingtips ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nNaw - I\u0027ve got three tonnes of rockets and 4.8 tonnes of jets.

Since I\u0027ve established this fine rainy morning that I\u0027ve been screwing that up for weeks and making the wingspan too small, I\u0027m definitely of the opinion that the tailplane is too small...\n\nDefinitely some things to fix.

This isnt helping your take off speeds at all.\n\nAs for your CoM and CoL, I think they are to far apart, right now your CoL indicator is set roughly at the center of your wings which is correct for subsonic flight but as soon as you start going super sonic it will move back towards the rear of your wings, further away from your CoM. This will make the nose VERY heavy at supersonic speeds and it will only get worse at higher mach speeds. \n\nI suggest moving your CoL closer to your CoM. Ideally you want it just behind the CoM.\n\nAbout like this craft, granted this craft it was a bit to close but its CoM shifted forwards as fuel drained.\n\n![pJlxqFM.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/pJlxqFM.jpg)\n\nTo fix your problem I would do two things. Add a Leading Edge Extensions (LEX) to the front of the delta wing... like the F-18 Hornet. I have done it on several craft that had issues with the CoL being to far back and canards weren\u0027t an viable option.\n\nLike this craft, and this craft also utilizes leading edge slats and flaps for take off.\n\n![OlMW4Qx.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/OlMW4Qx.jpg)\n\n![RzxWr7Z.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/RzxWr7Z.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-22T18:33:14Z","Content":"The best way to deal with mach tuck is just to emulate Concorde \u0026 shift some fuel - if you start cranking up pitch control angle to counter it you\u0027re causing excess drag and you\u0027ve reduced your overall control authority.

I decided to ditch the inline rocket fuel tanks and put them out into a fuel fuselage, getting one set of Turbojets off of hardpoints and onto the fuel fuselage. I kept the other pair of jets out on hardpoints. I took out the two Mk2 Rocket Fuel Fuselages from the base fuselage, which shortened the plane lengthwise; I then recalculated the necessary size of the wing. Sticking it on the plane, it looked short, so I added a cruciform all-moving tailplane, and changed the functions of the wing control surfaces to aileron - spoileron - flap/spoiler - flap. I adjusted the wing position to cancel the engine torque. FAR gave me green lights except for L\u003Csub\u003E\u00C3\u0192\u00C5\u00B8\u003C/sub\u003E below Mach 1, and that was a stable oscillation, so off I went.\n\nLast night was actually a night of a bunch of little screw-ups. The first flight failed because I hit D instead of S and sent the plane careening to its death. I hadn\u0027t add sufficient strutting to the frame anyway, so that gave me a chance to fix that problem. Second flight I reverted because the starboard inboard engine flamed out at 24k - I had forgotten to push the magic \u0022fix everything\u0022 Intake Build Aid button before I took off. Third flight......\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E ![bYtCPLu.png](http://i.imgur.com/bYtCPLu.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![n4Rb20d.png](http://i.imgur.com/n4Rb20d.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![oSeAazm.png](http://i.imgur.com/oSeAazm.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nOf all the damn things to fail the mission entirely - the probe\u0027s RCS tanks were clipped into the fuselage. That\u0027s what I get for not redesigning the probe - I\u0027ve launched dozens of these things in stock and the carrier plane was designed as an open frame *around* the side tanks...\n\nActually I had one more screw-up before the night was over; getting back to the SPH to take screenies of the plane, I realized that the engine torque had been balanced *for the inboard jets, not the rockets*. I\u0027d picked the wrong damn pair of engines to analyze...\n\nSo yeah, I\u0027ll be revisiting the design again; if nothing else I need to add some RCS ports so I can start using that forward docking port for something other than decoration.

Well, considering last night\u0027s pattern, I\u0027m at least being consistent.\n\nI think part of my problems at this point is the cruciform tail - I try to build the tailplane so it has x amount of total area (40% of the main wing), but I\u0027m limited on the length of the tail\u0027s root chord by the width of the fin at the point where I mount it, and to compensate I\u0027ve been increasing the span. I might have better luck if I\u0027d just mount the damn things to the fuselage and leave the fin be. That has gotten me into trouble with engines in the past, though.\n\nI did take a look at my drag-generating parts last night; I was amazed how much drag I was getting on those Mk1 tanks...that just doesn\u0027t seem.......fair. Hopefully that\u0027s something that\u0027ll be fixed come Monday.\n\nI do have an issue with CoM/CoL, admittedly; the plane lacks counterweight up by the nose, so there\u0027s a big CoM shift aft once it goes into rocket mode. I have the CoL set as far back as I do so that the plane stay stable as the fuel drains. It probably wouldn\u0027t be as pronounced of an issue if I had more up front."},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T18:23:29Z","Content":"If you trust yourself not to press spacebar, you could mount the engines on decouplers to prevent direct fuel flow, then run a pipe from the engine to the front tank. That should make the fuel drain from back to front ^^"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T18:33:15Z","Content":"Ok I am looking at your SSTO in the last pics... I see several minor issues that will cause bigger issues.\n\nFirst, the CoM and CoT are not lined up, they are slightly off due to the engines, intakes and liquid fuel tanks being below the wings and bringing the CoM down below the CoT. This with the mass of the wings being below the center line of the craft this would further this shift in mass.\n\nThe fix for this is simple. You can shift your turbojets up into the wing by using the movement tool in the SPH. With this you can even remove the pylons they are on which will help with some of the additional mass. Downside to this is your landing gear are going to have be moved. \n\nSecond, your wings are attached to the 1.25m tanks which are then attached to the hull of the craft, which means you have a pretty weak flex point that is between your wings and the actual body of the craft. I prefer to attach my wings to the craft then rotate the fuel tanks through them so they clip through the wings. This will keep some things attached at their strongest points. I would also reduce the thickness of the wings to the minimum to place struts from the wings to other parts of the body to increase strength. Then once the struts are placed I would return the wings to the thickness you want, this will hide them inside the wings. \n\nLast but not least the I would remove that MASSIVE horizontal section of the tail. You should not need anything like that if you shift your mass forward just a bit or your CoL back."},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T20:49:43Z","Content":"I\u0027m not sure why you\u0027re insistent on the tail being 40% of the wing, especially for a delta which doesn\u0027t have a tail to provide any lift.

After taking the time to re-design and re-balance the probe in the VAB, adjust the wing position so that the LV-T45s wouldn\u0027t generate torque relative to the DCoM, add RCS ports, push the magic button and re-set up all the action groups, I took the Phoenix 7b to orbit and delivered its payload.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E ![vEFdg0U.png](http://i.imgur.com/vEFdg0U.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![1O9bV30.png](http://i.imgur.com/1O9bV30.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![k1LWc6z.png](http://i.imgur.com/k1LWc6z.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![EPR81vg.png](http://i.imgur.com/EPR81vg.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![VaEJ7ft.png](http://i.imgur.com/VaEJ7ft.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nFlight was reasonably smooth - plane did pitch down when I switched to the rockets but after a bit it smoothed out. Still had about a 30% rocket fuel reserve when it made orbit - so the design oughta be able to handle heavier payloads than the 6.1 tonne probe I launched this evening.\n\nAdmittedly, landing took a few attempts, the big thing being that I needed to be way gentler on the controls coming in from orbit. After I figured that out, the jets had more than enough juice to fly the craft the rest of the way to KSC. Keeping my airspeed up while on final was a challenge - and once again I could\u0027ve stood to be more gentle on the controls as well (had one attempt where I pulled up too hard trying to line up on the runway and jerked myself right into a stall because I lost too much airspeed, and couldn\u0027t recover afterwards)."},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T03:52:09Z","Content":"Yup; low, slow and smooth is the key to landing. Until you get the hang of it, you\u0027re usually better off powering up and going around again rather than trying any last-second hard manoeuvres.\n\nKeeping the jets on at minimal throttle is useful for reducing spool-up time when you need some power; try to get down to landing speed before you reach the runway, then apply a touch of thrust to hold that speed constant.\n\nFor reentry, I usually just keep the nose 5-10\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 above prograde until I\u0027m back to level flight at 20,000m or so.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-24T03:55:34Z\u0022 title=\u002204/24/2015 03:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Wanderfound**"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T13:42:28Z","Content":"Went back through my notes today - I don\u0027t know where that 40% tail-plane figure came from...hell, even the damn glider figures said 25%. There\u0027s a few more things I\u0027d like to do with the Phoenix (like maybe give it the ability to turn on RCS thrust - right now all it can do is translate because I used the little single squirt ports instead of blocks, and its inherent turning capacity is crappy because at the heart of the thing is an OKTO2), so I\u0027ll shorten the span of the tail plane like y\u0027all have been telling me to do and see what that does. I\u0027ll try the 25% figure first, see what FAR has to say about it and let y\u0027all look at it. Probably still going to be an all-moving tail (for now anyways).\n\nI\u0027m also thinking about moving those Mk1 Fuel Tanks from the front of the fuel fuselage to the back (i.e. just ahead of the engine, changing it from Intake - Mk1 - T400 - T400 - Engine to Intake - T400 - T 400 - Mk1 - Engine); this one\u0027s from the other day.

What you need is enough control moment, and FAR will tell you if it\u0027s not enough - but you have to test it at a bunch of speeds \u0026 altitudes because you can fall out of the envelope for a bit; the one that people usually stumble over is going supersonic \u0026 suddenly losing the ability to hold the nose up, because CoL movement away from CoM has increased the inherent pitch down moment beyond the tail\u0027s pitch up moment at that particular dynamic pressure. Simple answer to that, go supersonic at higher Q. Better answer is to redesign the craft a bit, of course, but at some point you realise that it\u0027d be better just to fly a little differently.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-24T13:55:19Z\u0022 title=\u002204/24/2015 01:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Van Disaster**"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T17:21:58Z","Content":"Capi, \n\nI just want to say congrats, but now comes the fun part, advancing the design.\n\nMay I suggest building a multipart wing so you can kill that long thin tail, unless that is the look you are going for.\n\nYou can end up with a wing that looks more like this, and you will still have great pitch authority, supersonic flight control and pretty decent low speed landing characteristics. \n\n![4bfoATz.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/4bfoATz.jpg)\n\nThat craft can haul 70tons into orbit with ease and it is only 127 parts. \n\nOr a wing like this for a true tailess delta design without canards.\n\n![948FLnw.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/948FLnw.jpg)\n\nAgain that is a SSTO and more than capable of reaching 100km orbit. \n\nIf you look at most modern supersonic aircraft, I suggest researching Russian Fighters or US Fighters of the 4th generation, this is closer to the technology you are dealing with in KSP.
