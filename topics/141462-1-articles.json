I\u0027ve escaped Kerbins SOI and am Orbiting the Sun. According to delta-v charts, I should only need about 90 m/s to get from the edge of Kerbins SOI all the way to Eve. I seem to be needing around 700 m/s to reach it, which I dont\u0027t have. I really don\u0027t get how I should be able to reach it with such little delta-v.

I\u0027m probably not the right person to make suggestions since i always did my transfers with the stock tools, but i\u0027m sure others can give you some good suggestions how to make it a bit less frustrating\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nif all of that sounds to difficult, an alternative solution is to bring more deltaV than suggested by the maps. those maps assume near perfect efficiency for most maneuvers, so if you want to just get there somehow, it may be a good idea to bring more fuel than the bare minimum. nuclear engines are pretty efficient. it\u0027s not hard to design a nuclear powered probe/ship that has 4-5 km/s deltaV. if you can get that thing to kerbin orbit, you can easily reach eve or duna even with farily inefficient burns.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
