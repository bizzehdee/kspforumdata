While vertical snap is great to have stock (it was one of my most used features from EditorExtensions), It should not be tied to angle snap. There are multitudes of times where I could use angle snap but not vertical and vice versa. So here is my suggestion:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you press the angle snap button (or the X key), it displays the current icon it does now and does just angle snap. Press it again and it adds a horizontal line through it (or some other change to indicate vertical snapping). Now both snaps are active. Pressing it a third time returns the hexagon shape to a circle but the line remains, disabling angle snap but leaving vertical on. The fourth press would return it to no snapping at all. This adds no GUI elements, just some new icons, and makes everyone happy. Only possible objection I can think of is people complaining about pressing it multiple times, which would be pretty petty since you already have to do that for symmetry.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sevant","CreatedById":97597,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-07T16:32:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like this idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps you could clear something up for me, though.

As of .23 you snap to the middle of parts as well as set increments around the side when angle snap is on. This is new to .23 and I have yet to find a way to disable it or toggle it independently (hence suggestion).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
