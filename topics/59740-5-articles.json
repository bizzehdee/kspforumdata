I don\u0027t think dedicated control surfaces should be required for non-ballistic entries. Here\u0027s why: I use my entire wing as a control surface by pitching and tilting the plane using my SAS. My wings actually do help me turn, glide, climb, dive etc. Granted, it\u0027s not a very acrobatic or stable plane, but it\u0027s designed for going Mach 2.7.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, when my wings fell off during the mission shown in my last posted pictures, while the SAS allowed the craft to be flown fairly steadily (after I ejected my engines anyway), I had to fly it like a rocket, not a plane. It did not glide, and I could not turn it with anything other than brute thrust. When my wings stay on, it flies like a plane...just with a relatively high stall speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand, if the OP decides I need a plane with control surfaces as my primary means of stability (simplest way to solve this \u003Cstrong\u003Ewould\u003C/strong\u003E be to simply ban SAS modules on planes except those which come built in to the single allowed \u0022control from here\u0022 module [i.e. cockpit, probe core, or remote guidance unit]), then I accept the challenge...though I\u0027m not going to have any time to work on it until next week sometime.
