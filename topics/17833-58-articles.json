While having each stage delta-v is very useful, I never know when it\u0027s better to raise delta-v by using a bigger stage (tank \u002B engine) or to add another stage. I think the optimal way may be to have the biggest delta-v with the less possible mass because we know that the more mass you have on your upper stages, the bigger the lower stages have to be to lift them off. So I have a suggestion for this mod if it\u0027s possible to implement it : having a \u003Cstrong\u003Edelta-v to mass ratio displayed for each stage\u003C/strong\u003E. The bigger the number, the more efficient the stage is for its weight in its current staging configuration. What do you guys think ? Would it be useful ? Or maybe there is a better way to do this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BudgetHedgehog\uFEFF","CreatedById":104112,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-18T00:07:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022cybutek\u0022 data-cite=\u0022cybutek\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI have basically hacked around a bug in TweakScale. \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInteresting stuff.
