Ships will attempt to disable one another, but not kill, just like the Greek trireme which was so light that even when holed it wouldn\u0027t sink. In ancient times sea battles often involved incapacitating with the ram and killing the crew of the disabled vessel. Then the enemy ship (which is very expensive) would be taken home and refitted and repaired.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is likely the kind of warfare that you\u0027d see in space, at least with human crewed ships. The reason being that intercepting the orbit of another ship isn\u0027t really a successful strategy since it will just move away to another orbit, and probably has more delta V than the missile being fired at it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstead lasers should be used to disable a target, then fighting either to take the enemy ship by storm, or sending in a kill vehicle with an explosive warhead would finish the job.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso at this point drones would be even more effective at zeroing in on point defence systems and life support infrastructure from long range by outflanking and encircling the target thus allowing a boarding party to gain easy access.
