As I demonstrait in \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/75626-The-Space-Arm-Flexible-connection-system-using-the-grabber%21\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis thread\u003C/a\u003E the grabber can be used to creat long chains of pivots that then function as giant space arms (or tinticals). The unfortunate part about this is setting up such an effect is a huge difficulty. You can not place parts on the ends of grabbers like you can docking ports. Thus getting all the pivots in a row is very hard to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am suggesting two new parts: The pivot, and the powered pivot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth parts will have a connection point on both ends and act like the grabber pivot in flight. However they will also get some interesting tweaks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA pivot can bend along two axes, and with tweeks one could choose to free/lock either of them independently to create elbow joint. Furthermore the resistance of the pivot could be adjusted so that they could not swing as fast. Finally a range of motion could be selected, so that they could not swing as far as normal. Another addition would be the ability to free/lock pivots using action groups, which can\u0027t be done with grabbers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe powered pivot would have the extra ability of setting the angle in game - after the angle is set in the context menu electrical power will be expended to move the pivot to the desired angle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would also be nice if they could rotate as well, allowing for things like super-size wheels made of fuel tanks for massive surface transports, or engine angling for VTOLs or to allow hard to turn ships to burn retrograde without spinning around or having two sets of engines. Ideally you could even set angle stops in the tweak menu and assign those to action groups, allowing the transition to be done smoothly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot to mention how useful this would be for space stations, as you could fold them up for lunch instead of sending them up as modules.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-09T05:32:36Z\u0022 title=\u002204/09/2014 05:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 9, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by zeel\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MKI","CreatedById":77241,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-09T08:19:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI feel something as simple as a dedicated pivot point could change how players make ships by a lot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESadly something like this doesn\u0027t have much need to be implemented and is more of a side thing to add with primary changes.
