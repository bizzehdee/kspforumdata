I (like others) would like to see more to science than points. I\u0027m sure Squad has refinements coming through the pipeline - so I\u0027m confident that the final-release version will be great. But, why not post an idea anyway?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a disconnect between gathering generic science points, and unlocking technology on the tree. Why would detecting Negative Gravioli particles on Minimus lead to developing a bigger engine or a larger crew module? How does recovering a Kerbal from Duna lead to designing a better solar panel?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy idea is to split the tech tree into two parts - Science, and Engineering. Each would have their own points system. Science points would come from current science experiments - surface samples, materials studies, goo, etc. These points could be spent on related technologies. I\u0027m not quite sure how to define \u0022related,\u0022 though. Obviously - better science instruments. Maybe more efficient solar panels, or new types of propulsion?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEngineering points would come from successful recovery of craft from various locations (implying that there is innovation with rocket design). Other sources could be milestones in payload size, crew size, efficiency (in parts, fuel usage, etc). Perhaps there could be separate categories for stations, probes, landers, and bases. These points would be used for bigger engines, crew modules, etc. Just bigger, better stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, my main point is that large-scale rocket engineering could become it\u0027s own thing with regards to the tech tree/science points.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scoundrel","CreatedById":15369,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-08T01:26:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat is a very well thought out suggestion.
