I switch to the satellite and all is well, it works perfect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem starts when I quit KSP and reload it and try to switch to the satellite again. Upon switching to the satellite, it shudders, then goes completely crazy flipping around for a moment before finally exploding most every component off of it and out into space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny insight/ideas on what might be causing this would be appreciated.
