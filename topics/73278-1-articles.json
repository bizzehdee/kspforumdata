They\u0027d work differently, with radiation for the most part being a danger that slowly accumulated, but temperature being something that could swing fairly quickly, making it a more immediate hazard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s already a temperature mechanic in the game. This could be extended to give Kerbals a (fairly wide) \u0022comfort zone\u0022 temperature range. Outside this range your crewed parts would need to consume electricity, but temperature could also be controlled to some extent by radiators which didn\u0027t consume electricity, giving you a way to minimize the \u0022cost\u0022 of temperature maintenance using clever construction (radiators radiating into each other wouldn\u0027t work very well, so figuring out the geometry of the radiators would be a new construction challenge, much like the challenge NASA faces in real life of figuring out efficeint geometry for solar panels).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAmbient temperature (which is already in the game but doesn\u0027t have much effect) would obviously come into play: Hot in direct sun if you\u0027re close enough, cold if on the dark side of a body or far enough out. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETemperature could of course vary across different planets and moons, creating a distinguishing factor that would differentiate the requirements for ships, stations and bases depending on where you were going.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe challenge can be kept away from new players by making temperature maintenance cheap, so short term trips of up to a couple of months (such as to the Mun or Minmus) could easily just rely on stored pod power, but longer trips, and trips to more hostile environments, would need to consider solar panels and batteries, and really long trips that go far enough out that solar panels aren\u0027t so useful anymore need to consider even more battery storage, radiators... and RTGs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd so to the second suggestion: Right now the challenge of temperature would be completely negated by just sticking a few RTGs on the ship, so there needs to be some downside to RTGs. Indeed, even now RTG\u0027s make electricity consumption a complete non issue, so they need some balancing force already.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was thinking radiation might be the solution. Have ships subject to radiation when in space and from nuclear engines and RTGs (and, I suppose, some celestial bodies might be given high radiation levels, or perhaps high radiation biomes). The challenge to the player would, again, be largely in terms of construction techniques. Structural panels (or some other new part) could act as radiation sheilds. The heavier pods could have better shielding (creating a balancing force to counteract use of only the lightest pods all the time). Optional water jackets could be provided for things like the hitchhiker module. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would again encourage players to think about their ship geometry. A large ship with a lot of nuclear engines or banks of RTGs would need to be designed with the engines and RTGs far from the crewed sections (which creates the challenge of building a \u0022spread out\u0022 ship, probably requiring orbital docking construction), or with radiation shielding between those components (requiring a heavier ship).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENew players could be spared this challenge by again making radiation accumulate very slowly so it\u0027s not a major issue for short trips of a couple of months, and/or providing a natural radiation shield in near-Kerbin-space, extending to the Mun and perhaps Minmus (explain it by saying Kerbin has a strong magnetic field if you like). New players will also \u0022naturally\u0022 be protected by the tech tree, since they won\u0027t gain access to LVN\u0027s and RTGs for some time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-24T18:34:25Z\u0022 title=\u002205/24/2014 06:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 24, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by allmhuran\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LethalDose","CreatedById":92657,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-24T18:46:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEh. I understand what you\u0027re going for here (I think \u0022Anti-death support\u0022 is a good term for it), but IMO this is beyond what is needed.

A radiation shield and a heat shield are effectively the same thing, in that they absorb a given kind of radiation to prevent delicate parts from being affected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause KSP isn\u0027t designed to run the physics of craft not being flown by the player, or not within the loading distance, all radiation/heat penalties would have to be temporary as opposed to cumulative. If a part shuts down unless cooled to a certain heat level, then temperature would only be relevant while actually flying that craft. There would still be no time limit, sure, but it would cause many craft to disintegrate when one engine shuts down before the other due to unequal heating, resulting in a spiral of death or at least an enormous waste of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly, in on the subject of radiators, consider having non electricity dependent radiators, electricity dependent radiators, and intake air dependent radiators.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
