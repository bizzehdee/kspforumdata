FAR originally cut them to 33% thrust, then beefed them back up to 50% when too many folks complained. Jet engines in stock are extremely overpowered, and the lower drag at altitude in FAR exacerbated the problem. As well as chopping overall power, Ferram redid the speed/thrust curves to make them more realistic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETurbojets shouldn\u0027t be able to beat Mach 6; that\u0027s scramjet country. There are limits to how fast you can run a jet engine before it blows up. And, yes, it\u0027s staying this way; Ferram has strongly stated that he\u0027s not reversing the decision any further.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is still easy to make highly effective spaceplanes in FAR, and it is still possible to get an air-breather over Mach 5. You don\u0027t need hypersonic speeds; Mach 4.5 at 30,000m is enough to reach orbit with less than 60 seconds of rocket power. You just have to give a bit more attention to piloting and streamlining now. Before, you could bully through bad aerodynamic design with pure thrust; that is no longer easy to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want a demo, go play with some of the planes at \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/90747-Kerbodyne-SSTO-Division-Omnibus-Thread?p=1353924\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/90747-Kerbodyne-SSTO-Division-Omnibus-Thread?p=1353924\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Velociraptor in particular is ridiculously quick.
