Once you get there, watch the terrain on the horizon to look for a good landing spot. When you see one, burn like hell retrograde. Yes, it\u0027s somewhat inefficient to kill all your orbital velocity while you are still a km or more above the ground, but picking a high quality landing point is worth more than a bit of fuel.

So get more fuel efficient you need to change your technique to be more like a suicide burn. And, yes, that takes practice. (I think there is also at least one mod, that computes when you need to start a suicide burn (and survive) but I never used those.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn tip is to not stop\u00A0 during the descend, but only burn retrograde (to surface, not orbit!). And only burn enough so that you are sure that you\u0027ll be able to stop before you hit the ground. I.e. start burning at a fairly high (= safe) altitude, and stop burning when you notice that you\u0027ll come to a stop before you reach the surface. Repeat once you have descended enough that you reach the limit what you consider safe. One thing I do is to estimate my \u0022time to impact at my current velocity\u0022 and my \u0022time to kill my current velocity\u0022. If they become equal, then I start burning, which increases my \u0022time to impact\u0022 and reduces my \u0022time to kill my current velocity\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne way to do a suicide burn is indeed with quicksaves (well, one save and many reloads): get into a suborbital trajectory, save, and then start burning retrograde at some altitude. If you crash: try again at a higher altitude. If you come to a stop way above ground, then try again at a lower altitude. Until you are happy with the result.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally: the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E map is the absolute minimum.

that\u0027s the reverse of launching straight up to an\u00A0apoapsis of\u00A010 km, then turning sideways and burning for orbit.\u00A0 If you know what a gravity turn is and how\u00A0it works, then
