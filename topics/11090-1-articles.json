I propose a challenge: get into an orbit that will take your spacecraft \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ethrough\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E the arch. It doesn\\\u0027t necessarily have to be stable, but be moving at orbital velocity when you pass through it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEasy? NO! I have serious doubts that anyone is going to do this, but whoever does deserves a shiny medal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScreenshots are required; preferably multiple of the event.

I tried this, got into an orbit close to the arch, and then gave up and landed.
