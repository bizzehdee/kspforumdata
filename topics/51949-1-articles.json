So much good technology came from the first space race between the US and the USSR, so hopefully a new generation, using the latest technology, could be a really big boon for the planet as a whole.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-05T11:40:00Z\u0022 title=\u002211/05/2013 11:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 5, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by allmappedout\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
