Lately, however, when physics reasserts itself (loading the game / switching to something around or on the base from the tracking station, etc), it explodes a landing strut. Then, over time, more and more explode. Maybe one every few minutes. None of them show any stress in the right-click menu. They simply explode now and then. You can see here where legs are \u0022missing\u0022 from the tube that\u0027s a \u0022T\u0022 just to the front ... all but one has blown off. Similarly, the tube on the far right is now missing its legs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe parts should be fairly well lined up, but even without that, I do notice sometimes the entire station just \u0022slides\u0022 a little bit, which is also odd (I\u0027ve noticed this when trying to dock a vehicle, and the entire base starts moving to the side or away from the vehicle that is stationary).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny idea what\u0027s going on here or how to correct it?

One of the legs blew and the whole station went into oscillations, shredding quite a bit of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s relevant, but just in case it is, I\u0027m running v 1.1.2.1260 from Steam on OSX\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-10T21:36:16Z\u0022 title=\u002206/10/2016 09:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 10, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by AndyMac\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdding version and environment\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-10T22:38:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLanding gear is problematic right now.
