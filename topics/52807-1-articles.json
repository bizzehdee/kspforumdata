I was driven to make the video because my journey to get this base setup on Duna took many hours of design and testing with numerous trips to Duna to try out a new concept. It is a sort of advanced tutorial I guess, hopefully someone else will get some help or inspiration from it. I don\u0027t show how the individual ships are made in VAB. But There are five different ships that have to get into LKO and assembled then sent to Duna. Where it gets broken down and sent to the surface of Duna. The videos are about 15 min each. So there speed was increaded alot in some areas to keep the length down. The complete mission took around 2 hours to complete even with warps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI used the Mech Jeb addon the whole way through. Without it this would have been a really tedious endeavor. But I would suggest to all to learn each of the procedure before depending on Mech Jeb. I myself started the career mode which pretty much forces you to do these procedures manually as mech Jeb is not available until much later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope you enjoy the videos,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Egary\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-12T04:28:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMoved to Mission Reports.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
