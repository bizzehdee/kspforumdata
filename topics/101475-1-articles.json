Also, I recommend you make a copy of the save directory before fiddling with it too much. (KSP will sometimes \u0022help\u0022 you out by deleting corrupt saves.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are serious about keeping your old stuff, then I would recommend starting a second save game in career mode with whatever difficulty settings you want (as Taki mentions). Then open both persistent.sfs files, and look through the first sections (the stuff before the FlightState section where the VESSELs are stored). I would recommend making a third file to merge all this stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll want to keep your current science save as the base, but you need to copy over the contract ScenarioModules from the new career save. This will set you up with the proper contract scenario information and relevant money/multipliers. Make sure you don\u0027t leave any extra blank lines between things, and make sure you get all the opening/closing brackets { }.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, make sure you keep a backup copy of your current save, just in case...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~Claw\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bigyihsuan","CreatedById":29291,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-07T23:14:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sal_vager\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sal_vager\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI don\u0027t know actually, but the persistent.sfs has a line near the top \u0022Mode = SCIENCE\u0022, if you change that to \u0022Mode = CAREER\u0022 it may turn your install inside out, so back up your saves first \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve already tried that, and did so with both the persistence file and the other file in there to a backup.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
