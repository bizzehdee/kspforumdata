I do understand DeltaV, retrograde, apoapsis, prograde, and periapsis, so you don\u0027t need to refrain from using those words, but I basically need someone to quickly explain to me how to get to the Mun and even further with what I have in vanilla KSP. If any of you have YouTube accounts where you do this sort of thing, feel free to link them below and I will check them out!\n\nThanks guys!\n\nDon Griffen\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-29T02:05:18Z\u0022 title=\u002203/29/2015 02:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by dongriffen**"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow88","CreatedById":66043,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-28T09:59:06Z","Content":"You could look up Scott Manley on Youtube He has produced tutorial videos for most aspects of KSP."},{"CreatedByName":"Aphobius","CreatedById":79391,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-28T10:19:45Z","Content":"People still asking for tutorials for a\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/r-aVqXpv6TA?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n ..."},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-28T10:57:19Z","Content":"A two minute task for you Aphobius, a rather skilled and experienced player.
