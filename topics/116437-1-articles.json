I feel like if we go with a 32-team based tournament, the event should be livestreamed. Attempting to livestream the entire event myself would just be an exercise in futility, so I ask if another livestreamer wants to stream half of the event while I stream the other half. Using this method, we could likely get the entire tournament streamed in 4 days (assuming each of us does 4 series a day). In accepting this request I would also suggest that you become one of the entry judges for the challenge.\n\nNo worries! You can still participate in the challenge. Having multiple entry judges just means that someone other than you would have to review your craft.\n\nThe official rules of the challenge will likely be decided within these next couple of days, though a pretty solid framework is already in place. I kind of want to be prepared for when the submissions start pouring in.\n\nThanks for checking this out, and if you want to be the other livestreamer for this just leave a post saying so below!"}]}
