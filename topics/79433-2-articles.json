Dragon has been saying stuff like that to modders on these forums for a long time. He was doing it before I joined these forums and he will be doing it after I am gone. I have told him in the past that he needs to use more tact and diplomacy. The bottom line is he doesn\u0027t have tact or diplomacy. What you perceive as abusive he sees as constructive criticism. Now I personally feel that if you want to take them down because of one person and keep them down because of one person then thats your prerogative. If you expect an apology from him then you are going to be waiting for a long time. By taking your links down all you do is give dragon the power, it might seem like by taking down links and teasing us with what could have been proves something, but all it does is show that someone got to you, nothing more. So if you don\u0027t want to share your work and let us give you our opinions good and bad then keep them down, its a shame but I promise you people will eventually move on. If you released your models just because you wanted people to blow sunshine up your butt then you are definitely in the wrong place.
