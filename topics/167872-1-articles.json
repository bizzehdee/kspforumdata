I built a number of networks in previous versions with relays, however now in 1.3.1 I can\u0027t get it to work. Also, when I enable comm network in settings, it doesn\u0027t actually do anything - I don\u0027t see the signal strength panel in top left corner, and after returning to settings comm network is off again. Is this a KSP bug or somehow my problem?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
