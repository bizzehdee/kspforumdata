If that were to get fixed, I could see consolidating the fairing bases again so that all 4 lengths at each base\u002Bfairing diameter combination would be in just one base, instead of two like we have currently. If I could get things to work that way, I\u0027d love to drop the \u0022Lite\u0022 version of the mod and keep a more lean primary copy of the mod running.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe I\u0027ll do that anyway. With three or more jettison nodes, the fairings still worked, it was just a really stupid exploding/zooming bug in the menu icons.

It would still need to be a sensible place for all panel lengths, so I think I could only get away with moving it forward 3m, to accommodate the shortest fairing length. A radius of 7m versus 10m is a large volume difference, but I\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s worth messing with how the part balances in the rocket.

From the log, it seems that one part of the payload has collided with one fairing piece - even if the fairing base is absurdly large compared to the payload - and then the payload has undergone several structural failures sending parts flying off spinning, as if the collided-with piece were given a really enormous impetus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s hard to say. I saw something similar a few times while reworking the ejection angles a little, but then I started getting clean tests after that. I\u0027m wondering if something has changed with how the \u0022ModuleJettison\u0022 fairing panels work, either in terms of the ejection, or how it creates the colliders for them. I\u0027d love to hear from people as to whether this is widespread, but other than messing with the ejection angles (which KSP seems to apply as an addition to a hard-coded ejection vector), I\u0027m not sure what can be fixed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe downside of this sort of mod, that\u0027s trying to capitalize on a stock capability to use it in an unintended fashion, is that we may run into some issues that might not be fixable, depending on what new KSP bugs may crop up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"includao","CreatedById":145136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T07:00:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eis it problematic to implement these fairings to work with stock aerodynamics?

(specifically not through their explosiveNodeID, though they do check that in the event that vessel modification occurs such as through decoupling or damage). What that means is that it doesn\u0027t matter if anything was connected to top04 or not. It still will try to shield. It probably wouldn\u0027t be a big deal for me to add such a check; I just didn\u0027t think it would be necessary since I didn\u0027t anticipate a particular decoupler module deliberately not having anything attached to it.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EHowever, even if I did that, you need a ModuleCargoBay section for every single ModuleAnimatedDecoupler that exists on the part. Its lookupCenter would be set to its explosiveNodeID\u0027s coordinate Its lookupRadius would be set to half the distance to its explosiveNodeID\u0027s Y axis value. (see example above). DeployModuleIndex has to be set to each particular ModuleAnimatedDecoupler\u0027s ordinal position. For example, the decoupler module with explosiveNodeID top04 is the tenth MODULE on the part so the index is 9. (0 = first)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EI thought there might be a #3 but I can\u0027t recall what it might have been just now...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, assuming I do put the necessary check in, you\u0027d need 4 cargo bay modules on that part and on every other part for as many decouplers as they support. Definitely possible in the manner that I described, but what would be better is a single pair of modules on the fairing base. One ModuleCargoBay and one other module which I\u0027ve been working on for use with KWR and its legacy fairings. I\u0027m still finalizing the exact procedure but your fairing system is similar enough in that it has a top part that has to be attached that would be used to determine the size of the cargo bay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne other thing... the DRE support file that you have no longer functions with the current version of DRE.
