Hopefully Squad gets around to working out the kinks with the 64-bit Windows version (thus bringing it up to par with the 64-bit Linux version, which is rock-solid in my experience), but I probably wouldn\u0027t be all that concerned about memory from things like Toolbar and KJR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, KJR\u0027s pretty safe to go with.
