The planet pack and the rest of the mods are up to you because I am finding myself unable to choose.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBARIS is.....\u00A0 interesting.\u00A0 It will definitely increase the grind, so choose your settings for it carefully.\u00A0 Also perhaps increase your cash and science rewards so you don\u0027t go broke.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, I have now done careers in 3 planet packs:\u00A0 OPM, New Horizons, and Alternis Kerbol.\u00A0 Here are my thoughts on them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nOPM is an extension of the stock system--everything from Jool inwards is the same.\u00A0 The new stuff beyond Jool is awesome but very, very far away, with travel times measured in decades 1-way.\u00A0 Thus, to do anything meaningful out there, you can\u0027t get bogged down with anything more than a few science-grab probes to the inner planets, and it helps to increase science rewards to accelerate your ability to go to the new stuff.\u00A0 if you run life support, you\u0027ll pretty much require a Kerbal-freezer.\u00A0 You\u0027ll also want some high-tech engines, either New Future or some sort of powerful nuke engines.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nNew Horizons has Kerbin as a gas giant moon about as far from the sun as Dres is in stock.\u00A0 However, the sun there is brighter so solar panels still work as at Kerbin in stock.\u00A0 This has system has all or most of the stock planets but they\u0027re all rearranged.\u00A0 It also has many totally new planets and moons, some of which are in unusual orbits.\u00A0 Thus, it\u0027s got LOTS of places to go and things to see, many of which are new.\u00A0 Unfortunately, when I played it, events conspired to keep me pretty much pinned in the gas giant system so I never got to see all the other stuff except in the tracking center.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAlternis Kerbol has the same number of planets as the stock system and they all have the same names.\u00A0 However, they\u0027ve all gotten total makeovers and been rearranged.\u00A0 Also, it appears that the topography of the planets is different in each save, so there\u0027s more replay value.\u00A0\u00A0Kerbin is a moon of Jool, which orbits the sun at the same distance as Kerbin in stock.\u00A0 Ike and Gilly are long-period comets.\u00A0 I have only really gotten good started so can\u0027t speak for what\u0027s outside the Jool system, but it certainly looks interesting in the tracking center.\u00A0 Nothing is particularly far away--the system is about the same size as stock--but there are bigger gaps between the planets due to Kerbin, Duna, and Dres now being moons.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for part mods, other than those dictated by sheer distance, it depends on your taste.\u00A0 I myself have pretty much standardized on the following:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nMOLE and DSEV:\u00A0 I use these mostly because they have built-in fuel-switching and they work with the magic \u0022wireless\u0022 resource transfer system of Wild Blue.\u00A0 That makes building bases SO much easier.\u00A0 Plus, the orbital labs of MOLE are useful early on for a continuous IV-drip of science.\u00A0 But\u00A0I mainly use these instead of the stock 1.25m and 2.5m tanks, and it\u0027s nice to have a 2-seat pod early in the game.\u00A0 Also, the 1.8m and 2.5m multi-engine adapators and probe core/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E units are VERY useful.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSpace-Y (and sometimes Space-Y Extended):\u00A0 If you have BARIS launch failures turned on, you really want to minimize the number of lifter stages.\u00A0 Ideally, it should be just a single \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E stack to orbit.\u00A0 If this isn\u0027t quite enough, slap some SRBs on it for the initial kick, so 2 stages max to orbit.\u00A0 But as payload mass increases over time, you\u0027ll need bigger lifter parts.\u00A0 Eventually, even 3.75m isn\u0027t big enough---you\u0027ll need 5m with 3.75m SRBs.\u00A0 Hence, Space-Y.\u00A0 And if you get even bigger, you\u0027ll need Space-Y Extended.\u00A0 Also has some 1.25m and 2.5m engines that have more thrust but less Isp than stock engines, which are quite useful early in the game, plus lots of engine cluster plates.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nLithobrake.\u00A0 This has a number of VERY useful parts, such as a 3-seat lander can and some really beefy lander legs.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nChop Shop:\u00A0 A very imaginative collection of odd bits and pieces that fill all sorts of niches you didn\u0027t know you had.\u00A0 All sorts of very useful stuff here for all sorts of purposes.\u00A0 Once you try it, you\u0027ll always use it.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPathfinder:\u00A0 Inflatable bases with magic \u0022wireless\u0022 resource transfer, the ideal solution for Kraken-resistant bases.\u00A0 Plus, it comes with the excellent Buffalo rover (which can be a tilt-rotor) and the Jetwing.\u00A0 NOTE:\u00A0 pretty much requires

SSTOs and atmospheric planes.\u00A0 Plus, it uses stock textures so not a huge memory hit.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nKerbal Foundries Continued;\u00A0 Mostly for the airplane wheels with built-in electric motors.\u00A0 Pretty much necessary for off-planet spaceplanes.\u00A0 The wheels and tracks are cool but I don\u0027t use them much.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nTAC Self-Destruct:\u00A0 My all-time favorite mod.\u00A0 Causes stuff to explode gratuitously, no collateral damage.\u00A0 Essential for keeping \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin

Only two of the six have actually reached orbit. Sojourner 2 doesn\u0027t really count, though, because I nixed the lab (to rescue a guy) and Sojourner 5 developed a fuel leak and couldn\u0027t charge its battery. S6 just exploded on ascent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT2: I didn\u0027t intend to write any of this up, but just to give a brief summary of my career so far, Skybounds 1-7-ish were my manned rockets, some of which succeeded in getting to orbit, and later taking two astronauts briefly into Sonnah\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E. Extra\u0027s 1-11 (?) were my unmanned rockets, which managed to orbit. Two of them managed to collide with Sonnah, one of them dipped into its atmosphere and then orbited the Mun. The last one in the series landed on the Mun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Sojourner series (1-7) were designed to fly 2 people into orbit with 1.85m rockets along with a MOLE setup. Unfortunately, that program didn\u0027t work out so well. S1 failed and the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Launch Escape System\u0022\u003ELES\u003C/abbr\u003E worked. S2 got into orbit with 1 person for a rescue contract and succeeded but lacked the lab module (I took it out to save mass). S3 blew up on re-entry due to BARIS. S4 exploded, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Launch Escape System\u0022\u003ELES\u003C/abbr\u003E worked. S5 reached orbit (again, a rescue mission, but with the lab this time) but didn\u0027t have the right power systems to make the lab work (I got, like, 0.05 research time before I had to return to Kerbin). S6 exploded but the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Launch Escape System\u0022\u003ELES\u003C/abbr\u003E worked. S7 finally got into orbit with working solar panels, but the research was slow and I determined that it wasn\u0027t worth staying in orbit for two weeks for 10 science. In the time it took to get 10 science, an experiment and another part (I forget which) failed. So, no, unless I can get one far away I\u0027m not going to go down that path.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Descender series are probes that land on other celestial bodies and have probe cores which use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E.
