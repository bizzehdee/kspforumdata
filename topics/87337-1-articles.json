I\u0027m aware of that, and I always pack some hundreds - even thousands of reserve dV for those missions. But the minmus mission posted above is just an example, and the difference of 80m/s isn\u0027t much. But my concern goes especially for flights like to Eeloo, where, according to those charts, the required dV to acchieve a low orbit is of 2100m/s, and we can\u0027t aerobrake.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn any case, I\u0027m not asking for a solution to go around this issue.
