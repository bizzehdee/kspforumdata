It doesn\u0027t have to be a stealth game, but it\u0027s probably one of the most engaging approaches. This game is also a shining example of how to let a player make meaningful choices, and how to tell a story. The player impact on the game, the story telling, the morality system (sort of), and the gameplay are all brilliant. This is easily one of the best games I have ever played. Rather than a proper morality system with nicely labeled options like Mass Effect, you are presented with approaches you can take, and it\u0027s up to you to decide how people will react, and what reaction you even want. You\u0027ll often need to change things up during an interaction. Also, things like mission order impact the game. For example, you will be buying your weapons on the black market, and if you carry out a mission to take out a major cache of weapons and smugglers in the area, that\u0027s going to impact what is available to you for purchase. Other choices impact how the story develops and so on. This makes gathering and understanding intelligence in the game important if you want to be able to anticipate the consequences of your actions on how the game is going to play out. As stated in game, \u0022there are no good or bad choices, just results\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou might also like \u003Cstrong\u003EDCS World\u003C/strong\u003E. It\u0027s a combat flight simulator, and it is a free game that comes with the Su-25t (and a mustang trainer. Other planes are paid DLC). The planes are detailed to various levels. The Su-25t is on the lighter end. You can start it up with a key keyboard commands, though if you really want to get the most out of it, your probably looking at a few hours on youtube (Robert Sogomonian has a fantastic set of videos for it, which serve as a good look at what you can expect from the game as well). You also have planes like the A-10C which have much more involved computer systems than something like the 25t. The flight as well is fantastic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd one final thought. You might like the Myst games. They\u0027re essentially point and click puzzle games. The first game was recently redone (for the second time) and is truly spectacular. You can also walk around the world, a feature not found in the original games until the fourth one (I think. Might have just been the last game, number five that has that). Riven is also available on steam, though it may not work. At the very least, the map viewer, one of the last puzzles, may not function correctly and require you to look up the answer. The second and third games are the best if you ask me, with Riven (#2) taking the cake and Exile (#3) being the close second. Both games a entirely point and click, with point to point movement. Exile has better graphics, and 360 degree camera movement. Do note that both these games are pre-rendered (they predate personal computers that could have rendered such graphics in real time), so there is nothing you can really do to improve them graphically.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hcube","CreatedById":137241,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T23:00:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022CaptainKorhonen\u0022 data-cite=\u0022CaptainKorhonen\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ECounter-Strike Global Offensive, if you like competitive games and first-person shooters.
