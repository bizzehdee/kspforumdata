I\u0027d be happy to help out with german, as I\u0027ve already translated some games into german.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis would mean that a lot more people could feel the joy of KSP, or if localization was a general thing, everyone could do everything.\u003Cbr\u003E\nImagine a world where we all have a common language. Now clearly that is out of grasp, but at least we can start with that.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThank you for reading,\u003Cbr\u003E\nShikashi signing off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-04T21:38:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is something we want to do, and some areas of the game such as the KSPedia are already designed with replacing text in mind.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-04T21:41:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTranslations are planned for some time in the future.
