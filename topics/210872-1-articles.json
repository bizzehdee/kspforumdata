driving force behind humanity\u0027s initial urge to explore the cosmos was a primitive reaction out of fear and a display of power.\u00A0 It was humanity\u0027s exhibition of deimatic behavior, one nation merely showing off its power to inspire fear in a rival nation.\u00A0 It was not out of a desire to explore the ethereal worlds across the void; it was instead a brutish, arrogant cry of \u0022I am better than you.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 However, Kerbalkind is not a warlike species.\u00A0 This is in a sense both a blessing and a curse.\u00A0 In one sense the drive to explore space would be out of sheer curiosity and wonder at the lights in the sky.\u00A0 However, without the ubiquitous fear of failure and war on the horizon, any program toward cosmic exploration would lack the support and interest of fellow Kerbals.\u00A0 Instead of a reckless race to space, it would be more of a saunter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp

of Raymond Kerman as he gazed into the sky on a warm summer night.\u00A0 Well, nights were always warm and, for that matter, always summer where Raymond was from.\u00A0 He took a slow sip from the glass he was holding and closed his eyes, savoring the serenity.\u00A0 Crack-\u003Cem\u003ETHUD\u003C/em\u003E!\u00A0 A wave of compressed air shot the contents of Raymond\u0027s glass all over his face, accompanied by the diminishing sound of a decelerating supersonic plane.\u00A0 Lawrence was almost twenty minutes early.\u00A0 An invisible black shape descended onto the bare strip of ground on a tiny island in the Effem Sea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u0022Thanks for letting me borrow\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EPetunia\u003C/em\u003E,\u0022 said Lawrence as he dismounted from

the storage bay.\u00A0 \u0022Lawrence, you ever think about what\u0027s up in the sky past all the clouds and birds?\u00A0 You ever wonder what Kerbol is or whether the moon is really made of

bright, sunny morning with high visibility and little chance of rain or winds.\u00A0 In fact, zero chance of rain or winds, the same as every other day.\u00A0 Raymond climbed into the cockpit of the \u003Cem\u003EPetunia\u003C/em\u003E, slowly chewing a breakfast bagel and considering what he was about to do to his old desktop computer, which was currently crammed into the storage compartment.\u00A0 With a couple of modified fireworks strapped to the side of course.\u00A0 As the plane ascended, the light of Kerbol and the orange glare of compressed plasma shone right into Raymond\u0027s never-blinking eyes.\u00A0 He\u0027d gotten used to it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022zGtCQk2.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022150.00\u0022

the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EPetunia\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Ehigh into the sky, sending it much higher than it was intended to fly.\u00A0 He hoped the trip wouldn\u0027t damage the engine or any of the control surfaces.\u00A0 Nah, if it had survived Lawrence\u0027s flying; it\u0027d definitely survive this.\u00A0 The clouds, like little foamy ripples spread all the way to the horizon, and the sea was as peaceful and blue as ever.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002225lqLRA.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022150.00\u0022 height=\u0022750\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022

drunk or had just woken up, two things Raymond\u0027s green brain had never experienced.\u00A0 Once the air got too thin for the engine to breath, Raymond cut the throttle and let the plane coast up to the peak of its flight.\u00A0 At that point, he opened the storage bay and pushed a button, sending his makeshift probe hurtling into the sky.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg

presented itself: Raymond didn\u0027t have another old computer he could launch into space to land somewhere in the Effem Sea.\u00A0 The computer he currently owned was kind of important.\u00A0 As he coasted back to the airfield, an idea struck him.\u00A0\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EHe\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Ecould go to space himself.\u00A0 With the proper equipment of

have his early afternoon snack and relax at the top of his tower, monitoring the occasional plane landing or leaving and watching all the passengers make their flight transfers.\u00A0 Today was different, however.\u00A0 Raymond and Lawrence were in a dark corner in the back of Hangar B, welding and soldering away.\u00A0 The\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EPetunia\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Ewas going to need

parachute in case of emergency.\u00A0 Why were they doing this?\u00A0 What was the point risking a million kerbuck plane to escape the atmosphere, a seemingly meaningless task?\u00A0 Well, of course, because nobody had done it before.\u00A0 This, at its core, was the philosophy that drove kerbalkind.\u00A0 Why did Valentina Kerman try so hard to set the land speed record of over 100 m/s in her rover?\u00A0 Because no one else had done it.\u00A0 Why did Bob Kerman spend so many hours in his lab in order to invent Xenon fuel?\u00A0 Because nobody had invented it yet.\u00A0 Why did Shepsen Kerman do the dishes, a simple, humble chore?\u00A0 Because no one else had done them yet.\u00A0 Why did Raymond Kerman fly his plane to space?\u00A0 To go where no Kerman had gone before.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 Double checking that no flights were inbound for the next couple of hours, Raymond hopped in and taxied the \u003Ci\u003EPetunia\u00A0\u003C/i\u003Eout of the hangar.\u00A0 With the new and improved engine, the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EPetunia\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Ewas ready to take to the skies and beyond.\u00A0 Raymond sat in the cockpit, double checking that the fuel flow and air ducts were all getting along with the new engine.\u00A0 Once everything was working, it was time to take a visit to the great

g\u0027s of acceleration, Raymond sank back into his chair and felt the force pull his cheeks back into a painful, forced smile.\u00A0 Whipping off the edges of the wings, the shock cones shook the craft back and forth, vibrating Raymond\u0027s baseball eyes in their sockets.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 Lawrence watched from the command tower as

so little in the scheme of the infinite, immortal cosmos that it would be more of a passing irrelevancy: a brief, violent struggle where the laws of this unnatural world were perfectly enforced.\u00A0

would grow to learn about space, advertising it as an exciting, adventure-filled escapade full of asteroids and planets and alien life.\u00A0 However, this is simply inaccurate.\u00A0 Instead, space is slow-moving, and it\u0027s cold-hearted, and it\u0027s sterile, and if anything \u0022exciting\u0022 befell a brave explorer, it would be unthinkably swift, irreversibly deadly, and all would be over before the astronaut even knew it.\u00A0 For the lives of kerbals are short and fragile and matter not in the eyes of the cosmos,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 Raymond kept the

bank, and his mind made a\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ephoomp\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Esound effect as it suddenly exploded out of the top, glinting in the brightness of Kerbol and sending wisps of cloud and sonic streamers flying.\u00A0 It slowly sank away into the deep blue before a tiny orange plume blossomed and left brief traces of fire in the air.\u00A0 It was almost as fun watching from the ground as from the cockpit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 Up in the cabin, Mortimer relaxed in his seat and almost enjoyed the ride.\u00A0 His mind had by now learned to filter out the irrelevancies and see only the essential.\u00A0 The world to his perspective had, over the years, faded into a monotony of numbers, dollar signs, and statistics.\u00A0 And yet as the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EDrefinger\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Eprodded its way out of the atmosphere, Mortimer almost saw the world out of new eyes.\u00A0 It took Mortimer a moment to realize what he saw.\u00A0 At rest, his mind naturally ran its fingers over the seat fabric, contemplating price and material.\u00A0 It measured the dimensions of the cabin, ran laps around the stadium shaped viewports, mentally peeled back the rubber lining on the carpet.\u00A0 To Mortimer, the world presented itself in shades of black and white, almost lifeless and devoid of beauty.\u00A0 To Mortimer, function was optimized and streamlined, and form and aesthetic were irrelevant and ignored.\u00A0 But taking a look out the window, seeing the stars and feeling the gravity depart, Mortimer Kerman was struck by something so foreign and so unknown that it almost appeared, how could he describe it?\u00A0\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EBeautiful\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 For a few moments, his mind ceased its whirrings and calculatings, and the unused, forgotten part of his brain that appreciated the majesty of space released new chemicals into his mind.\u00A0 He was, for the first time in a while, stunned.\u00A0 This high, the stars no longer winked.\u00A0 They blazed in minute whiteness from a million places at once.\u00A0 The sliver of the moon appeared so real and present that it, for a moment, seemed less than untouchable.\u00A0 This was a world so unique to Mortimer that his robotic, ingrained mind wasn\u0027t quite sure what to do but wonder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg

mind.\u00A0 The light of stars became another statistic and the vastness of space registered as a number.\u00A0 The flames of reentry were not orange to Mortimer.\u00A0 If he thought about it, of

warehouse manager who\u0027d signed the license and title had had something.\u00A0 But for a kerbal going on fifty-three, he was abnormally spry and healthy and certainly wasn\u0027t sick.\u00A0 The

Side-by-side seating, a roomy cabin, a streamlined hull, flattened and tapering into not one, but two massive engines.\u00A0 The wings swooped back from each side of the plane, as graceful as a

future was bleak.\u00A0 Yes, the novelty of space tours had worn off and people were losing interest.\u00A0 For the last few weeks, there had been empty seats here and there, until the recent price cut to 400 kerbucks brought them back.\u00A0 But nothing like this.\u00A0 Raymond reluctantly logged onto his computer and opened the weeks flight plans.\u00A0 When Raymond refreshed the spreadsheet, it showed that of all twenty flights scheduled for the week, only five seats were taken.\u00A0 Raymond\u0027s jaw went slack and he slumped over his desk in

would push us further into space.\u00A0 So I\u0027ve added some more bigger\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EHitchhiker\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Eboosters to\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EDreffy\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Eto experiment and see if maybe even the plane itself could get to orbit.\u00A0 Our tours could be an hour long whereas Mortimer\u0027s would only last for a couple minutes.\u00A0 We\u0027d have to have higher prices and Mortimer would still be king of suborbital, but it would still give us an edge over Mortimer Aerospace.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 Raymond and Rebecca boarded

again beckoned as the curtain of the atmosphere dropped out of view.\u00A0 The whole way up, Raymond fumed.\u00A0 Mortimer Kerman simply had no right sending his planes up here!\u00A0 To Raymond, space was a secret he shared with his closest friends, and although he made a living from it, space wasn\u0027t just another gem in the business world to be exploited for its wealth.\u00A0 Space was a beautiful golden treasure, something to be admired and studied from a distance, not to dig your dirty hands into.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022lG6awqR.jpg\u0022

But as the angry plasma cleared from the windows, the anger cleared from Raymond\u0027s mind.\u00A0 Mortimer could have sub-orbit.\u00A0 Raymond didn\u0027t mind, after all he didn\u0027t own space and he certainly didn\u0027t own Mortimer\u0027s planes.\u00A0 He watched the slow, reverse starfall brighten on the eastern horizon as the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EDrefinger\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Edrifted over the face of Kerbin.\u00A0 Up here, Mortimer didn\u0027t matter to him.\u00A0 Mortimer Kerman was only an invisible speck of green somewhere in the blue face of Kerbin, an astronomical distance below him and Rebecca.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 As the galaxy slowly raised its arm in the eastern sky, Rebecca pointed at the navigation instruments.\u00A0 \u0022Raymond,

Mortimer steals all of our tourists, even if LNR Aerospace can\u0027t stay up, it doesn\u0027t matter.\u00A0 What matters is that we\u0027re here and the world is beautiful, and you\u0027re beautiful, and right here, right now, the most important thing is to stop and appreciate everything for what it is.\u00A0 It\u0027s so easy to become entangled in money and work that we lose focus on good things right in front of us.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 Raymond pointed down at Kerbin.\u00A0 \u0022Somewhere down there, a band is playing, and people are laughing.\u00A0 Somewhere down there, someone is crying.\u00A0 Somebody\u0027s driving home from work, ready to be with their family again.\u00A0 Every star in the heavens above, every cloud in the sky below is so intricate and beautiful, and in a handful of minutes the clouds will be gone, in a handful of years we\u0027ll be gone, and in a handful of millenia even the stars will be gone.\u00A0 And then nothing will have mattered.\u00A0 So I\u0027m going to appreciate everything for what it\u0027s worth while I still can.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022VBVg0Vl.jpg\u0022
