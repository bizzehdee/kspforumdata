I\u0027ve never used the claw. What I\u0027ve noticed is that it happens after I\u0027ve launched and reached LKO and am time warping to apogee. Vessel length makes no difference. I\u0027ve had it happen with purely stock parts as well as mod parts. Longer length vessels tend to bend before exploding. I have noticed that the Kerbin gravity has some influence on this. If the ship is horizontal to Kerbin, it will bend with the aft end bending directly toward Kerbin while the bow remains horizontal. If you place the vessel vertical facing away from Kerbin, it will stretch it like an accordion but not bend and break. In all cases, the ship becomes useless afterward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt happned again just a few moments ago and this time, the Map showed the vessel accelerating but the vessel view showed it\u0027s speed as unchanging.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe workaround I\u0027ve found for now, quicksave before time warping.
