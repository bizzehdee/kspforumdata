Then I realized that I might have already done this, but I wasn\u0027t sure. It would be nice if there was a place where all of your previously obtained data was logged.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe have another building called the Data Center. When you click on the building you\u0027re presented with a screen. The screen has a tab for each scientific instrument you\u0027ve used, crew reports, samples returned, EVA reports, etc. Clicking on a tab will present you with a list of all measurements taken by that instrument (or crew report or whatever). This way if you want to know if you\u0027ve already obtained samples from Minimus you can click on the Data Center, click on the Sample Returns tab, and look for an entry for Minimus. If it\u0027s there then you know you\u0027ve already done a sample return mission. If not, then you haven\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s pretty easy to implement too. Just send a message to the Data Center saying to add the data each time you successfully transmit data or recover a vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ezfox","CreatedById":85056,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-21T22:13:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u002B1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease add as fast as possible !\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lipatden","CreatedById":79564,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-21T23:08:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mandaari\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Mandaari\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...a manned sample return mission to Minimus.
