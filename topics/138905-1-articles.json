It seems to be the parts count and maybe what my system can handle together or something I\u0027m assuming.(if that is related to the bug you mentioned.) And the explosions happen in the upper main part of the ship both ships share. I even had this problem when the boosted ship was only 3009 parts. I added struts to get it to 3329 and the 3331 parts of these two boosted versions. Unless that extra thrust is causing strain on something there is something else wrong besides normal structural problems. It even crashed my game this time. I\u0027ll have to upload the crash log. *The unboosted ship is only like 2600-2700 parts and does not explode with greater velocity and resistance going up.
