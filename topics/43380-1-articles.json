If you just lose your League of Legends account and start getting spam, of course, that\u0027s not the end of the world. But if you have ever made a transaction on LoL, YOUR FINANCIAL INFORMATION MAY BE AT RISK. I only found out about this because my brother used to play the game, and still technically holds an account on my email address. We were lucky we never made any transactions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thought this was an important notice. Riot Games has sent out notices, but you may not receive them for various reasons. I would suggest changing your email and LoL account passwords, and checking with your local bank.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-21T17:09:46Z\u0022 title=\u002208/21/2013 05:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 21, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by The Jedi Master\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mercy","CreatedById":69034,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-21T17:06:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESee, the REAL problem here is that people actually play League Of Legends.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZedNova","CreatedById":57175,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-21T17:13:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0027s league of legends?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Jedi Master","CreatedById":57348,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-21T17:16:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Airbornem4\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Airbornem4\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhat\u0027s league of legends?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPopular online game.
