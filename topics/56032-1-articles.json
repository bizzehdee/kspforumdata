Once as in the experiment is considered the same wherever you are in low orbit. EVA reports on the other hand are biome specific. Reporting from an EVA over Kerbin\u0027s Grasslands gives a different result from doing it over Kerbin\u0027s Mountains. The latter makes sense. If you observe the desert on EVA, you would tell Ground Control different things then if you were over the ocean. That this is not true for Crew Reports is a bit weird. In your pod you would be able to do the same diverse observations as you would on EVA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternatively, if also adding biome specific Crew Reports would upset the science balance, I\u0027d argue to switch Crew Reports to biome specific and EVA reports to once. The Crew reports would then be about observation of the celestial body, while the EVA report would be more about the experience of EVAing in that particular area of space. EVAs are generally more technical, dealing with stuff like construction or reparing, than scientific.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
