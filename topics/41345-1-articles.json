This mission is like the 2020 rover that will use spare parts from Curiosity to look for evidence of past life and store a sample cache for potential return by a future mission. I even used a sky-crane by including the Kerbal Attachment System mod. I called it Fennec after the desert fox.

It has tons of decouplers and legs and gizmos attached to it because I decided to try and do the mission without using Damned Robotics. The result is that the ascent vehicle has to land vertically to deposit the rover (via sky-crane again!), then tip over on its side so that I can wiggle the nose cone on with a tiny docking port, then prop itself back up so that it can launch again. Phew. This is going to be fun:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far, I\u0027ve landed the vehicles about 22 km from Fennec:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/TDASc\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

The best way to do that is with ion propulsion. The vehicle will be called Space Bud (Orbital Retriever), because it\u0027s playing fetch and I\u0027m tired of coming up with appropriate names. It launches on just one large SRB and one medium 1.25m fuel tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/aL7e7\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

With this version, it jumps to controlling the payload, even though the root part is the sky-crane probe... Oh I just figured it out. When I jettisoned the previous stage (which had a small probe on it to deorbit it) it must have automatically selected one of the other probes to control from, not the sky-crane probe.
