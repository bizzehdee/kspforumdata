If KSP crashes to the Desktop, which seems like constantly, it doesn\u0027t actually close. As you can see from the photo it isn\u0027t running anywhere, yet the process is still going pulling cycles. I am writing this about 15 minutes after the crash and it is still pulling proc time and draining my battery. On two occasions there has been multiple instances of the process going on at the same time, I was bleeding off about 1-2% battery life per minute while this was happening.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is happening with both .90 and .25, both unmodded.

KSP was not running at the time, so when I checked Activity Monitor I had 3 KSP processes running with the exact same CPU time as in the OPs image. Yes I am running several mods, I will test to see if I can replicate this in a modded or in an unmodded install, by force quitting and quitting via the exit menu.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"michaelsteele3","CreatedById":127113,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-06T16:49:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESomething similar happens to me, but not often anymore.
