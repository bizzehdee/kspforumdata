I have a large drill and a large converter, so I can drill everywhere and don\u0027t have to care. The refill time varies between a few days or weeks. The lander slides in verry tight, but I think the main stability is coming from the autostruts. When autostruts came out, it felt like cheating to me. But since everybody uses them, I now think it\u0027s ok, if you use it to create realistic things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-07T17:07:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the time being, sevenperforce has hooked me with his\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/165251-roads-to-duna-no-moar-boosters/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E Duna Mission\u003C/a\u003E.

My desire to do (or at least see) something that does one better has spawned this challenge.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for myself, I like to do tailsitter rockets and arguably the best so far has been a asymmetric no-nukes design, which, sadly, still struggles to make it from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E to Minmus without needing a gravity assist from the Mun. It also lacks the range to make a direct move to Moho, requiring a fuel stop on Gilly -- I\u0027m not so fond of actually flying that I\u0027d have started over, instead I went back into the workshop\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA quick attempt at building a spaceplane around a M3 passenger compartment worked surprisingly well; that vessel can handle most places (\u0027cept Tylo) but lacks \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E; it would still require a mothership. Ultimately it suffers the fate of all my mothership-and-shuttle designs: moving from place to place while only landing the shuttle is the exception, not the rule. If nine times out of ten you need to land the whole shebang for refueling, why bother with a shuttle at all?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, after seeing a plane work I tried to scale it up to include \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E. The result is a 200t frankenplane of a vessel, that can land (and drill) both horizontally and sitting upright. Again, getting to Minmus requires a gravity assist (though maybe I should try offloading more oxidizer rather than packing some ore for refining in orbit) but from then on it has the usual stats: well over 6km/s on nukes alone on 2m/s\u00B2, with enough combined nuke\u002Brocket capacity to make a trip from Vall to Tylo.\u00A0 Boring.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022SSTA.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022768\u0022 src=\u0022http://ksp.schnobs.de/stuff/SSTA.jpg\u0022 width=\u0022817\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRemember, they\u0027re that big because I wanted to include a sizeable crew capacity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf all these, the rocket still the design I like the most.
