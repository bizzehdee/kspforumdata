Which, in my space program, means it\u0027s ready to go on a full mission."},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-29T12:12:30Z","Content":"A question/request for KillAshley:\n\nI\u0027ve noticed that several of the new NH planets/moons seem to have curiously high altitude limits for timewarp. For example, Eli requires being over 30 km to allow any timewarp at all, and 60 km to get to x50.\n\nIs there a particular reason for this? If not, could you lower these altitudes?\n\nMy (admittedly fuzzy) understanding as to why such limits even exist is to guard against either physics glitches (i.e. ensuring that the ticks of the physics clock are sufficiently fine-grained to deal with local conditions) or else perhaps playability (don\u0027t want players to accidentally miss opportunities when orbiting close in).\n\nHaving these really high limits has an impact on playability. For example, my NH game has gotten to where I\u0027m now exploring Eli. I\u0027ve got my orbiting mothership, and my little lander, and I\u0027m doing a lot of \u0022land, gather science, take off, rendezvous, refuel, repeat\u0022. I\u0027m used to the types of altitude limits that the \u0022native\u0022 KSP planets set, which work pretty well in my experience (the only one that ever causes me frustration is Gilly).\n\nBut with those high limits, it\u0027s maddeningly slow. The 30 km limit is *incredibly* tedious-- I like to keep my mothership in a fairly low orbit, and the lander is coming in very shallow to maximize Oberth effect, which means traversing half the circumference of the moon while under 30 km. That means every time I want to land and take off, I either have to sit there staring at the screen for several minutes while the lander creeps around the moon, or else switch back to the tracking station to warp to where I want to be and then switch back again, which breaks the immersion.\n\nI\u0027ve found that a good rule of thumb (at least for my own gameplay), as to what constitutes \u0022enjoyable\u0022 versus \u0022frustrating\u0022, is this:\n\n- The minimum useful timewarp for low orbit around any body is x50. At that speed, it\u0027s reasonably friendly to wait for one orbit (a frequent scenario for doing rendezvous). Anything lower than that just takes forever. So the minimum height for x50 timewarp should be around the minimum \u0022reasonable\u0022 altitude for someone to put an orbiter. On Eli, that\u0027s currently 60 km-- I\u0027d suggest 25 km at most, preferably more like 20 km.\n- Allow x10 warp as low as possible without risking terrain collision. On Eli, I\u0027d suggest, for example, 10 km for x5 and 15 km for x10.\n\nI only raise the topic because it seems like an odd quirk in an otherwise stellar mod. Is there a particular reason for the limits to be set so high?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-29T12:16:15Z\u0022 title=\u002210/29/2015 12:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Snark**"},{"CreatedByName":"Kershu5","CreatedById":143297,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-29T13:22:42Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E all of the stock worlds are the same, apart from their orbits.
