The testing milestone for that has been achieved this summer, as has the milestone for the main injector subscale testing last winter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe oxygen preburner is the part in the full-flow staged combustion cycle that generates the gas that spins the methane turbopump. There\u0027s also a separate methane preburner, which spins the oxygen turbopump. Both preburners perform an incomplete combustion. Each one has just about all the fuel of its type passing through it (hence the \u0022full-flow\u0022), and gets a small amount of the other fuel injected so it can combust a little. Both preburners, after spinning each other\u0027s turbopumps, then feed into the main conbustion chamber. This configuration ensures that all of the fuel - even that small percentage combusted in the preburners - contributes to propelling the rocket, increasing Isp. And the full-flow concept simplifies the engine by requiring less branching feed lines and interseals as well as cooling the turbopumps better than in regular staged combustion setups. Simplicity and lowered stresses help with reliability and reusability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFull-flow staged combustion engines have been experimented with in the past, but none have ever been completed and flown; if Raptor is completed and flies, it will be the first of its kind. Additionally, since it uses methane/LOX, it will have both of its propellants in the gas phase upon injection into the combustion chamber, making it the first gas-gas staged combustion system ever built. This further simplifies modeling and optimizing the combustion process. You can also expect lots and lots of 3D-printing to be involved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is an incredibly ambitious engine, but if they can pull it off, it\u0027ll be one heck of an impressive piece of technology. Just keep in mind that due to this ambition, the R\u0026amp;D effort required is substantial, and SpaceX doesn\u0027t expect to complete any fully flight qualified units before 2020.
