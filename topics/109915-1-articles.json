This is being run by my space agency, the Kerbal Administration for Big Overpowered Orbital Machines (KABOOM).\n\nThis is a general overview and is currently a work in progress. Individual missions will receive their own entries once I wrangle everything into a form I\u0027m happy with.\n\nI\u0027ve set the following goals for myself in completing this challenge.\n\n1. Do something somewhat historical, and stay pretty close to the original design, at least until it\u0027s MLV time.\n\n2. Showcase NecroBones\u0027 suite of mods, which I\u0027m a big fan of. [SpaceY](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100408-1-0-2-SpaceY-Heavy-Lifter-Parts-Pack-v0-14-%282015-05-20%29) has great 5 meter parts, including a monstrous quincux lifter engine. [MRS](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/93067-1-0-2-Modular-Rocket-Systems-v1-6-4-%282015-05-14%29-Stock-alike-Parts-Pack) and [Fuel Tanks Plus](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/108238-1-0-2-WIP-Fuel-Tanks-Plus-0-9-1-%282015-05-19%29) provide additional parts to round out the catalog, including a 3.75m probe core (perfect for a S-IVB computer ring) and a 2.25 ton 2.5m LFO tank (perfect as a LM ascent tank).\n\n3. Do something big and quasi-realistic that I\u0027ve been meaning to do for awhile that was never done in reality. Right now the leading AAP entry is a Munar base assembled in situ using Apollo-ish hardware, although we may go to other planets or do a big wet-workshop space station.\n\n4. No MechJeb, which I normally use a lot. I might break this rule when it comes time to assemble the Munar base and need to put down a whole bunch of modules right next to each other.\n\n5. Only use solar panels on those missions which historically had them. Using fuel cells is a new and different thing for me.\n\n6. No fuel ducts. All designs are serially staged, although I\u0027m working on some MLV designs that include SRBs.\n\nWith that out of the way, here\u0027s the overview WIP album:\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/YJ6Pe)\n\nSome of these designs are not yet finalized, and I\u0027m still not happy with the appearance and performance of some craft. My main Saturn V rocket is a bit too tall and has too much lifting power. My Saturn IB has performance that is bang on, but the design doesn\u0027t look quite right. I may end up calling some of these designs as good enough, or may revise them further. Constructive comments are welcome.\n\nMore to come...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-22T03:54:01Z\u0022 title=\u002205/22/2015 03:54  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Norcalplanner**\n  \nAdded links to NecroBones\u0027 mods"},{"CreatedByName":"Norcalplanner","CreatedById":112223,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T20:32:03Z","Content":"Revised versions of the Saturn V and Saturn IB are largely complete, along with all LES testing.

Everything performed well, especially my favorite part - the center engine cutoffs in the S-IC and S-II, made possible by Necrobones\u0027 great quincux engine parts. The only minor glitch was an omitted decoupler between the LM dummy ballast load and the S-IV, meaning that the CM couldn\u0027t pull the ballast free after docking.

Burning the CSM engines to increase the reentry speed resulted in a minor increase in the stress on the heat shield, but we\u0027re still nowhere near the thermal limits.

Can we go now?\u0022, KABOOM mission control decided to combine the Kapollo 9, 10, and 11 missions into a single trip. The big three were in the capsule, with Jeb at the controls. Launch was uneventful. Minor tweaks were made to the S-IV to make it more useful. Mission control had started to wonder why they were throwing away perfectly good stages that were equipped with a probe core. By adding some fuel cells and some docking ports, and it\u0027s own circularization burn a few minutes behind the CSM, the S-IV has been repurposed into Mun Depot Alpha. Based on the very slow rate of fuel use by the fuel cells and a half-full tank, the depot should be controllable for at least a few months - long enough to get at least the beginning of an orbital Munar station going.\n\nThere was a brief kraken sighting - after switching back to the docked CSM/LM from the depot, parts of the craft starting shaking around. Remembering that baby krakens liked to live in the service bays, Bill quickly opened the service bay doors and the shaking stopped. Thankfully the orbital changes caused by the kraken only raised the apoapsis a bit, but it will cause KABOOM engineers to rethink the inclusion of a service bay in future CSMs.\n\nThe main landing by Jeb and Bob in the LM was simultaneously momentous and uneventful. Lighting was really good for the pictures, however, and Jeb had to climb up on top of the LM and mug a bit for the camera. The ascent still needs a bit of work - on the first attempt to lift off, the whole lander lifted off the surface to a height of 50 m or so. Jeb immediately put the craft back down again, then manually thrust limited the descent engine to zero. With that taken care of, the second attempt proceeded as intended. \n\nAfter rendezvousing with the CSM, the small satellite carried in the service bay was released. Powered only by RCS thrusters, this tiny satellite was raised into a higher orbit to minimize interference with future orbital operations. Having this small unmanned craft attached to the central battery stack in the service bay may have contributed to the kraken sighting.\n\nWith all crew members transferred back to the CSM, and all extra fuel from the LM used to top off the CSM tank, it was time to set the LM on a collision trajectory with the Munar surface. Periapsis was reduced to less than 1 km, and the remote camera feed generated some thrilling footage before the unmanned LM finally crashed into a ridge. With the LM gone, Jeb shoved the throttles forward and burned for home. \n\nAs part of the ongoing stress tests of the heat shield system, the CSM burned most of its fuel to hit the atmosphere at interplanetary return speeds, in this case 3,500 m/s. We\u0027re still not close to using even half of the heatshield, despite repeated efforts. KABOOM engineers may call this last test good enough. With an uneventful reentry and splashdown, this marks the end of Phase I of the Kapollo Program. More details in the photo album - enjoy.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/Tnt6f)\n\nPhase II, using the evolved CSM/LM design with a rover and ALSEP packages on both the Mun and Minmus, is being put on hold temporarily until the kraken issue is resolved. Instead, KABOOM ship architects and engineers are going to move on to Phase III, and start the planning process for orbital stations, surface bases, crew and cargo shuttles, and finally interplanetary craft.\n\nIn order to determine exactly what the program\u0027s options are, it\u0027s now time to explore the outer boundaries of the basic Saturn V platform. KABOOM engineers are designing a series of craft with various payload capacities to LKO. Once the capabilities of the lifters are established, detailed planning for a more permanent presence in space can begin. Photos of the preliminary designs are shown below.

I thought about doing exactly what you described with the ATM, but my fairing was already going to be big because of the booms for the solar panels on the main body of the craft. I believe that the booms for the panels were launched folded flat on the real thing, and then deployed (or were supposed to deploy) once in orbit. However, there\u0027s no folding boom like that in stock, so my only other option was to make the boom a separate part with Jr docking ports and assemble it in orbit. Maybe I should have just created the approximate correct solar panel shape with five 1x6 panels coming out of each side. Hmmm.

Get it into orbit and dock the thing on the side. it will make your craft a lot more stable as well since it\u0027s nicely symmetric during launch.\n\nAlright, I now officially feel foolish. In all of the photos I looked at of Skylab, and all the text I read, I never thought to search out the launch configuration. It launched exactly as you said. With that change and the tweak to the solar panels as I noted above, I think I can wrangle the next station into a sane fairing. Thanks both of you for the help."},{"CreatedByName":"Norcalplanner","CreatedById":112223,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T05:02:29Z","Content":"The first half of the MOLAB mission is complete. The MOLAB and two ore-scanning satellites were sent in the first launch, while the crew and a prototype Munar habitat were sent in the second launch. Lots of ore was discovered in the East Crater, so that\u0027s where our focus will be.\n\nThe MOLAB went down first, and landed without incident via a single-use skycrane. The habitat went next, followed by the LM with Jeb and Herbus. All landed within a few hundred meters of each other, so that bodes well for future surface base construction. After jettisoning the skycrane, Jeb was eager to get his hands on the latest in extreme 12 x 12 off-roaders, er..., that is, he was ready to carefully pilot the mobile science lab exactly where he\u0027s told by KABOOM mission control.\n\nAfter checking out the habitat and making sure that everything was OK, Jeb and Herbus set out on their survey. The two took turns planting flags at landmarks and promising base sites along the way. There are some good spots near the Munar arch at the lip of the East Crater, with a nice view of Kerbin, but the ore isn\u0027t quite as good as it is further away from this interesting feature. We\u0027ll need to decide where to go. Or maybe have one fueling base run by engineers, and a second base for scientists and tourists near the arch. Time will tell. Enjoy the photos.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Even worse, only one of them is well lit - here it is:\n\n![rZvQPU4.png](http://i.imgur.com/rZvQPU4.png)\n\nThis shows Jebediah and Herbus reentering the CSM after boarding the LM and rendezvousing in orbit. Everyone made it back home, and I technically have a base on the Mun with that first habitat module, so I\u0027ll go ahead and claim the points: \n\n\u002B20 for MOLAB\n\n\u002B20 for a Munar Base\n\nNew Total - 157 points \n\nHowever, we\u0027re far from done with Munar activities. I\u0027ve found a good spot that\u0027s flat with around 11% ore only a few degrees south of the equator, so that will be our base location. The plan is to refine the habitat module design, make a few different flavors (e.g., one with a cupola, one with a science lab, etc.) and then ship them up there with a Mun buggy truck that can move them around and dock them together. I\u0027ll have to test everything out on Kerbin first, and will post pictures once I have something that\u0027s worth showing."},{"CreatedByName":"Norcalplanner","CreatedById":112223,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T07:17:17Z","Content":"Here\u0027s a photo album with a little bit of the MOLAB aftermath, along with some of the designs for the larger Munar base that we be assembled on the surface. KABOOM\u0027s engineers are still working on designs for a refinery, a tanker to take fuel to orbit, and on-surface fuel storage. For that last bit, the plan is to use 3.75m tanks in a configuration similar to the habitat modules (so the trucks get repurposed as bowsers after the base is assembled). Future plans may include a dedicated orbital station (Munlab) and a small shuttle to take Kerbals and a little cargo to and from the Mun base. Enjoy.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
