I mean, come on, you use it a lot. It\u0027s what enables you to read this, and to reply to it. It allows you to take your family photos. It\u0027s what allowed the invention of common everyday things, like a lightbulb, a candle, a window, a calculator, your computer, and even your house. It should be fairly straightforward, right? ...right? A bit harder that you thought, eh? I\u0027ll let you think on it...\n\nGot your answer? Now don\u0027t go look it up in a dictionary; I want to hear your definition of Science in your own words. \n\nWhat do you think it is? \n\nWhat will it allow us to do in the future? \n\nAre we using it properly?\n\nWhat is it\u0027s potential?\n\nDoes it even have any limits?\n\nAll of these questions can only be answered by you.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-28T17:05:00Z\u0022 title=\u002203/28/2015 05:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Xannari Ferrows**"},{"CreatedByName":"Brotoro","CreatedById":57674,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-23T18:41:50Z","Content":"Science is the process by which we determine the rules by which the universe operates."},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-23T18:41:52Z","Content":"As an abstract concept or as a method of action? \u0027Bout to sleep so not going to do any write up on both.

It\u0027s hard enough predicting what we will find out in ten years, let alone in the distant future (at least that is what your question sounds like to me). I am convinced of one thing though, if humanity lives long enough it will discover many exciting and strange new things beyond our wildest dreams.

When I type this, for example, I observe this bright thing, writing what I want to write. It could be a man-made thing which helps me to write, it could be a part of my body (as it understands what I want !). It could be any other things, maybe aliens, or it could be a friend. Without doing science (like, knocking the object, puncture it, looking at labels, asking, etc.), you can\u0027t deduce which is actually right - even after doing them, it might still be wrong or imperfect...\n\nPhilosophy is a different thing - IMO it\u0027s more self-centered. You try to create a thing that purely comply with your thoughts. Science, or maybe, nature, don\u0027t at all - you can\u0027t be sure that the Sun is perfectly the same with this object you see at nighttime.
