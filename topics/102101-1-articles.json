I\u0027ve been playing for about a year, and I\u0027ve found myself spending quite a lot of time buildling and testing rovers. Unfortunately, the game seems to have a dearth of rover parts, which is surprising considering the Mk2, SP\u002B and MK3 packs that Porkjet has made for Squad. Anyway, I\u0027ve been feeling kind of inspired, so I\u0027ve started to learn some basic parts modding to hopefully build a kit of parts for stockalike, long-distance ~2m modular rovers.\n\nHere\u0027s the first part I\u0027ve made - a crew cabin. It houses 4 Kerbals, and is based off the PPD-10 Hitchhiker Storage Container.\n\nI followed Otis\u0027 \u0022[A beginner\u0027s guide to part modeling for KSP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71CIu-Pkn3k\u0026list=PLP3dfwKIbVYjRgG4QWt4uoVjuuiUcBAdK\u0026index=1)\u0022 which, although there is some incomplete and incorrect information, worked quite well for my first foray into modeling for KSP.Anyway, the fruits of my labor... I give you the Rover RV-1:\n\n[![pejYic3l.png](http://i.imgur.com/pejYic3l.png)](http://i.imgur.com/pejYic3.png)\n\nNote: its the big grey chamfered box. Also, I have a Lackluster Labs truck cab on the front from waaay back.\n\nI would like to release the part (and have had at least one request on reddit), but I have to fix a few things with the part including:\n\n- fix center of mass\n- rescale part to proper size (currently 80% of the size I want)\n- fix textures - gaps/quality issues\n- recess the door/change texture\n\nAny feedback from the community?

My intent was to create a set of flexible parts that you can attach to anything, but provide some better-looking, stockalike parts that actually look like they might go on a rover, rather than sticking a round hab unit on wheels.\n\nLooks like I\u0027m going to have to download FTT and the Mobile Frame mods and check out their dimensions.\n\nThe size of this cabin will be resized to 2m width x 3m length x 1.5m height, with .1m wide structural envelope. (I\u0027m an architectural designer) I believe I can cram 4 kerbals inside the cabin with bunk beds, a mess, a bathroom\u002Bshower unit.\n\nYou could consider this a *really simple, more generic*, *no-frills* version of alexustas\u0027 Exploration Rover System (ASET): [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/94947-Exploration-Rover-System-by-A-S-E-T-%2810-10-14%29](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/94947-Exploration-Rover-System-by-A-S-E-T-%2810-10-14%29)\n\n...which I hadn\u0027t even heard of until after I posted this thread today. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nIn any case, I want my parts to be more flexible and be able to mix and match with other stock and stock-like parts. For instance, Bobcat\u0027s DEMV was a self-contained rover, but it also kind of took away all the fun out of building your own craft.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E This is very nice! Are you also planning to make an LRV type rover or are you sticking to closed rovers?\n\nAh! Probably going to stick with enclosed rovers - I figured the command chair is sufficient for now, and there are some existing mods like this one that fill the niche: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/86343-New-project-from-ASET](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/86343-New-project-from-ASET) (hard to compete with!).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-16T23:52:10Z\u0022 title=\u002203/16/2015 11:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by zilfondel**"},{"CreatedByName":"Raptor831","CreatedById":68286,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-16T23:57:25Z","Content":"Hey, looks good!

I\u0027m still pretty new to this... what is FSwitch?\n\n**Here is essentially my mission statement:**\n\nI would like to say that I\u0027ve been really inspired by the absolutely beautiful models and textures created by Porkjet - the Mk2, SP\u002B and MK3 models, as well as Bobcat\u0027s DEMV series of rovers from a few years back.

Parts that can work together while also being generic (stockalike) enough to work with stock and other mod parts... and also being rugged enough to withstand crashing. In particular, this means I\u0027m not doing any wheels.\n\nHowever, I\u0027d also going to give a shoutout to the really slick Exploration Rover System by alexustas.

Let\u0027s say (just for the sake of argument) that you made a piece that looks basically identical (same textures, shape, width etc.) to the one you\u0027ve made already, but 1/3 the length (and lacking doors). \n\nUsing FireSpitter\u0027s FSFuelSwitch module (or Modular Fuel Tanks, too), you can swap out the fuel/electric charge/whatever contents of your single part so that you only need to make one model for both the monoprop tank, the multi-flex fuel tank, the life support tank, the battery power unit. I think FSFuelSwitch (or maybe FSTextureSwitch only) also makes it possible for you to change the part\u0027s texture too - so you could build in a square panel somewhere on your model (for example) and use different textures on that panel that correspond to different tank contents. Sorry if you already know about this, I\u0027m just making assumptions based on your question about FS switching.\n\nYou could even use FireSpitter\u0027s mesh switching (see the Mobile Frame System mod) to have one part, like your open frame, that has many different possible configurations. Not necessary, but helps with part clutter.\n\nDepends on what you want to do - but the FS texture switching at least seems not terribly complicated, and fuel switching is done via config only (I think). Mesh switching I have no clue.\n\nJust more random thoughts."},{"CreatedByName":"zilfondel","CreatedById":108254,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T02:45:06Z","Content":"Ok, here are a couple of new sketches for redoing the ends and to act as a guide when retexturing.\n\n[![KtRFUg4l.png](http://i.imgur.com/KtRFUg4l.png)](http://imgur.com/KtRFUg4)\n\nSome structural concepts - triangular beams:\n\n[![ArdjuJal.png](http://i.imgur.com/ArdjuJal.png)](http://imgur.com/ArdjuJa)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-17T02:59:38Z\u0022 title=\u002203/17/2015 02:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by zilfondel**"},{"CreatedByName":"HydraDyne","CreatedById":102076,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T07:05:25Z","Content":"This actually looks pretty dope!
