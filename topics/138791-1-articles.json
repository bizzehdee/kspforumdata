I have come across numerous occasions, where this either helps with controlling a vessel, or even adds some semi-automated \u0022autopilot\u0022 function.

In other words, between your plane\u0027s longitudinal axis and the prograde marker.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn KSP, we always need some angle of attack to create lift. If a plane with \u0022flat\u0022, non-angled wings is oriented exactly horizontally, it will be losing altitude. To stay at a given altitude, we\u0027ll need to point a bit upwards.

My first plane to use the Whiplash, and probably one of the most obvious ways to put a Mk2 craft together for these engines. Once positioned at 20000m and 1200m/s, this thing travels around all of Kerbin with just a little occasional correction for roll. If thrust is reduced by one notch ONLY TWICE during an entire Kerbin circumnavigation, this plane stays between 20000 and 21000 m the entire time with no pitch input whatsoever - thanks to the secret powers of the TiltProbeCore\u2122.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:20px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:georgia, serif;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EUSE CASE 2:\u003C/strong\u003E Flying precise profiles with wobbly rockets\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf your launch stack happens to be of the rather wobbly sort, the old instinct of adding MOAR STRUTS has turned out to add considerable drag. Wobblyness makes it harder to fly a precise ascent profile. Often, it helps to just add a probe core to the stack bottom, so that SAS is not fed the data from the top of the rocket, which may be bending and oscillating all over the place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut sometimes, more precision may be desired.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe stack shown below is extremely wobbly, and even more so after shedding the boosters. Which also leaves it with a very low remaining TWR. (There is a huge amount of fuel stored inside that fairing.) The margin between going up way too steep, and being too shallow to produce an apoapsis of 70 km before going downhill again, was hard to attain with manual control. Also, to prevent SAS from violently overcorrecting, I had to severely restrict gimbal authority on the engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInstead of adding 64 struts, and then 6 moar booster tanks to carry the struts, I added, you know, a TiltProbeCore\u2122. I now launch with the stack controlled from the *regular* probe core, SAS hold activated, straight up 90\u00B0. I change to SAS prograde around 70m/s, and at exactly 100m/s, I switch to the TiltProbeCore\u2122, which produces \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ea smooth and predictable turn to the east.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E At a certain pitch, I change back to SAS hold, switch to the regular core again, and watch as the prograde marker - which was slightly lagging behind during the turn - aligns with the rocket\u0027s center axis again, at which point I go back to prograde for the remainder of the ascent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EExhibit 2:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jA5nKEG.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022jA5nKEG.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:georgia, serif;\u0022\u003EA very wobbly stack.

For example, you may find yourself building your first Shuttle (this recently happened to me), asymmetric stack and all, and you realize that the dudes who came up with that config for real must have been every bit as bonkers as you and me. Thrust line changes at booster sep. Cargo bay also off center. Tank gets lighter during ascent, as they all do, but that asymmetric stack makes that a bit more fun. Further up the trajectory, they did a 180\u00B0 roll with the SSMEs still burning enthusiastically, probably mostly because there was no way to do anything even cooler than that. (I mean... seriously... that\u0027s the only possible maneuver that preserves the thrust vector... but I digress.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThose shuttle engines are angled for a reason: it is very helpful if your thrust vector happens to pass somewhere near your center of mass. Actually, preferably, going right through it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo what do you do, when all has been slapped together, and it is only after having left the launchpad that you realize that the \u0022this is forward\u0022 pointer on the navball, derived from the orientation of the Mk3 cockpit, is further away from your thrust vector than Eeloo is from Jeb\u0027s mom? Well, presumably, you revert, or regret, or find a way to improvise yourself to orbit using SAS hold only, probably requiring a lot of fiddling and adjusting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWouldn\u0027t it be nice to actually just hit prograde, and fly your shuttle like a proper rocket? You bet. Well, obviously, your design needs - you guessed it - a TiltProbeCore\u2122.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nActually, in a special case like this - boosters, cargo bay, OMS engines and all - I\u0027d go even further.
