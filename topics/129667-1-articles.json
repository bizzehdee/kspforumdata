Lets keep all the mars discussion in the correct thread: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/129619-venus-vs-mars-colonization/\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/129619-venus-vs-mars-colonization/\u003C/a\u003E And not littering this one. No discussion of politics or scientific justification for such a base. Just focus on the basic requirements of our hypothetical probe, and how it can be filled.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOur hypothetical probe needs, what? A thermal protection system for the initial entry, a buoyant lift bag capable of supporting the payload, enough gas to inflate said lift bag. Then some kind of chemical labratory, capable of breaking down atmospheric compounds and assembling new compounds to demand. A means of assembling these new material into useful objects like more lift baloons. And a way of maintaining itself over the long term.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d prefer not to see \u0022finished colonies\u0022 that assume human workers for maintanace- can we design an automated venus base that can grow faster than it breaks down?
