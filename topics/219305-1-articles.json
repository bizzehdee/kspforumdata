Having them connected, directly or through other parts, on the same ship causes the camera to pan below the launchpad as soon as the craft has loaded and the game then crashes, with the crash handler GUI coming up, after which the game closes to desktop.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there a way to resolve this issue?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLog file:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/1iub96l1phgkx6303agme/Player.log?rlkey=lkr8uvpuo1wc8ny2vb4n79cdr\u0026amp;dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/1iub96l1phgkx6303agme/Player.log?rlkey=lkr8uvpuo1wc8ny2vb4n79cdr\u0026amp;dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JonnyOThan","CreatedById":40902,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-09-18T14:15:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI suspect this might be caused by RasterPropMonitor, or specifically the fact that DeepFreeze doesn\u0027t specify the RPM module in its parts.\u00A0 There is a compatibility patch here that will be included in the next version of RPM:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/JonnyOThan/RasterPropMonitor/commit/69c77e525892e8756a04a0c89c28dbd6444a3844\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/JonnyOThan/RasterPropMonitor/commit/69c77e525892e8756a04a0c89c28dbd6444a3844\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
