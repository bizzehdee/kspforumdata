So I decided to send him even further, cus y\u0027know, might aswell, but accidentally missed Eve when coming back, and moving at 20000 m/s I also missed Kerbin, heading straight towards the sun. Fast-forwarding the game to the highest level (x1 000 000?) broke the craft into every single part it was made of, and with no way to steer clear of the sun, I sped up until he was moving at 93000 m/s, less than 1M away from the sun. Thats when I forced him to E.V.A. He got one last good look at the sun, before his short life ended.
