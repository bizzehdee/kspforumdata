The difference is that the process will happily keep running at up to 50GB used. At this point my MacOS starts complaining about running of space on the system partition due to the ever-growing swap file. Still, it takes a loooong time to reach that point, so I am happy enough. And there are no obvious swap thrashing performance issues, so the OS seems to do a good job of keeping the actual stuff in memory rather than the leaked \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-18T21:20:30Z\u0022 title=\u002208/18/2015 09:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by bos\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rokanov","CreatedById":149722,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-18T21:56:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETLDR: Set texture quality to 1/4 or 1/8, install texture replacer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve had these issues on OSX and have tried a whole bunch of solutions, with moderate success, so thought I\u0027d share what seems to have helped.

I\u0027ve tried Active Texture Management, but it doesn\u0027t compress DDS textures (which most now are) and I found it difficult to produce results. Texture Replacer has some similar features, mainly unloading textures from ram and compression.
