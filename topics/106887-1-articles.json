Happens every time now. I thought it was because I enabled temperatures to be displayed in the part menus but it still crashed, even when not enabled.\n\nI should note that when the game crashes I get no warnings or messages from Windows. That game just closes.\n\nKSP v1.0.2 (steam)\n\n![EmE3pmb.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/EmE3pmb.jpg)\n\n[Craft File.](http://www./download/ljqmmjo3013uic1/Skylon_IV_c.craft)\n\n[Output_log](http://www./view/5v40oh2vk2aaio1/output_log.txt)\n\n[DxDiag.txt](http://www./view/uuqdkqmotza8oei/DxDiag.txt)\n\nThank you."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T15:34:48Z","Content":"I\u0027m getting \u0022access denied\u0022 on your output\\_log."},{"CreatedByName":"Redshift OTF","CreatedById":78679,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T16:35:10Z","Content":"Hmmm sorry about that.
