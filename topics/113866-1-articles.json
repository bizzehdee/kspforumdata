Indeed everyone began as a noob, but you do have to now why you need FAR, not try it as a first try in an unofficial environment.\n\n2) You have some computer knowledge and will not ask questions such as \u0022what is 7zip? Is it legal?\u0022 or \u0022how do I extact this dll from UnityInstaller4.6.4?\u0022\n\n3) I hope that if you can DIY this way, you are wise enough not to disturb ferram4 with bugs related to the 64bit hack (see disclamer)\n\n**Final thought:**\n\nEven for a long time experienced user and developer like me, since I never developed with Visual Studio nor created any dll file for Windows, it took lot of time to figure out how to do things right.\n\nAlso I didn\u0027t want to install the latest version of VS2013 or 2015 because the installers require 6GB of disk space they will never use. Then I was stuck because my C:\\ had only 3GB left.\n\nFAR sources are made with VS2013 so if you prefer using it, use it. This tutorial is about 2010 which will produce the same results with few extra steps.\n\nI hope this can be of any help and SAVE your time! \n\n**Purpose:**\n\n\u002B This tutorial will guide you step by step to unlock then compile the FAR dll **FerramAerospaceResearch.dll** for your KSPx64.\n\n\u002B It also contains the 4 steps to convert KSP 1.0.x for Windows, to Unity 64bit ([**http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117224-Windows-64-bit-community-workaround**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117224-Windows-64-bit-community-workaround))\n\n**PRE-REQUISITES:**\n\n*system:*\n\n\u002B Windows x64 XP/Vista/SEVEN/8 (**x64**)\n\n\u002B Visual Studio C# 2010/2013/2015 ()\n\n\u002B Unity Editor 4.6.4\n\n\u002B 7zip\n\n*KSP:*\n\n\u002B KSP 1.0.x\n\n\u002B [mod] FAR 0.15.x sources [**https://github.com/ferram4/Ferram-Aerospace-Research**](https://github.com/ferram4/Ferram-Aerospace-Research)\n\n\u002B [mod] ModularFlightIntegrator 1.x [**http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/118088-1-0-ModularFlightIntegrator-1-0-%28Apr-30%29**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/118088-1-0-ModularFlightIntegrator-1-0-%28Apr-30%29)\n\n**Brief description:**\n\n- First steps are a recall on how to transform KSP32 1.0.x into KSP64 with Unity 4.6.4\n\n- Subsequent steps are how to edit some project files from FAR to open them with VS2010 instead of VS2013. It adds some complexity to the process and I like it.\n\n- Then it shows you how to build **ferramGraph.dll** then **FerramAerospaceResearch.dll**. Indeed you can skip the **ferramGraph.dll** and use the official mod as reference.\n\n- Then it shows which line to comment in the source and do the build\n\nA picture to show you it works with minor flaws:\n\n[![Q6Ap85nh.png](http://i.imgur.com/Q6Ap85nh.png)](http://imgur.com/Q6Ap85n)\n\n**Flaws I am aware of:**\n\n- the center of lift bubble doesn\u0027t show the arrow, which could possibly tell that you won\u0027t have no drag/lift but you actually have.\n\n- if I notice another one I will report it in this post.\n\n**TUTORIAL:**\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
