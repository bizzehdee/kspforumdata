I\u0027m not sure how likely or feasible it is, but it would be really nice to see those mods ported over to KSP2. Despite KSP2\u0027s bugs, the game has improved a lot and can be seen as a similar title to KSP1. Honestly the amount of creativity generated over the course of KSP1\u0027s lifespan is staggering, and it shouldn\u0027t just be abandoned. Anyone interested in a OPM/Kerbol Origins/etc. revival? Maybe like a \u0022modloader\u0022 that you install into KSP2 with mods that you can enable and disable? I don\u0027t know KSP2 modding, so maybe i\u0027m not the right person to talk about this, but it still would be cool.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ShadowDev","CreatedById":227178,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-04-14T17:42:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi directly porting and loading ksp1 mods would be basically impossible. ksp1 will always be around and is not going away and no USG is going to be abandoned.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nKSP2 modding currently uses BepInEx and has a few library mods to make the experience easier. KSP2 will have its own modloader at some point as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"reschke","CreatedById":77540,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-05-01T03:04:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell there is K2D2 at the moment but it requires a lot of quick saves and some basic understanding of the physics.
