It may not be that much of a suggestion and probably not many people would find it worthwhile or anything interesting, but you know, what the heck.

It\u0027s just a very bad fit for this game. As long as the costs to unlock are appropriately balanced, that\u0027s sufficient. There isn\u0027t any basis in reality for being locked out of one branch of research by taking another, only the time and resources needed to do both/all. It also would significantly shorten career mode, and leave you in the position where you had a \u0022completed\u0022 game which was significantly inferior to sandbox mode. Personally, that would drive me crazy, and it would take around 1ms for me to decide to just hack the save file to have all unlocked (that\u0027s coming from someone who really doesn\u0027t like to cheat, but will gladly hack when confronted with what feels like a fundamentally broken feature).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nobody","CreatedById":64303,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-13T22:05:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERestricted branches really only work well in multi player games where each person needs to fill a specific roll.
