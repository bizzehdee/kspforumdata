Or if powering just one ion engine it is lighter to use an array (0.24t) and waste half it\u0027s charge potential than to use the needed 6 cells (0.3t).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wouldn\u0027t say that the array is over-powered, it does an adequate job and no more. So, it seems to me, that the fuel cell\u00A0is lacking. Either it is\u00A0overweight or should produce more charge or both.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA simple idea might be to make the fuel cell 1/6th of an array;\u00A0visibly it seems that way already.

In my opinion, they should only be used at minmus for fun (not efficiently), or planets closer to the sun where the solar panels get more efficient.

It seemed\u00A0to be working great, but then, when the oxidizer\u00A0ran out, 2 RTG\u0027s did the job, with the help of time acceleration. That makes fuel cells only usable for ion propulsion.

I feel like this part was made to change that. Probably more patient players have different stories, but I agree: This part might need some tweaking.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would go a bit further and suggest to reduce the electric consumption\u00A0for ion engines. Making ion a bit more playable altogether.
