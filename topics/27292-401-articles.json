Let\u0027s just say that according to the official report there were \u0022complications involving unexpected forces, such as gravity\u0022. After that, I decided to try get some proper Munar research done as I never seem to get enough fuel to get back, or get into orbit for a drone rescue. Luckily, this time I brought a bunch of monopropellant and through the powers of persistence I managed to get into a high Munar orbit. I suspect I ran out of fuel because I started on the opposite side I should\u0027ve and had to form a counter-clockwise orbit path with 4 different steering maneuvers to intersect the Mun.

Found a Class E in Kerbin\u0027s SOI with a 2 million meter periapsis that I\u0027m thinking about taking a swing at; went ahead and unlocked Actuators even though it\u0027s not on my old tech preferences list (obviously). I\u0027ve never done a for-reelz asteroid intercept (I\u0027ve done pretty well in the tutorials, though), so I\u0027m not sure whether or not an E is the best kind of rock to cut my teeth on.

I also hear that Ion Engines are about four times powerful than they used to be and use a hell of a lot less power.

Not because I need it to do missions though, but for building purposes only. I will still fly my crafts without having readouts since I have Kdata for radar alt and sea level alt, although the burn time calculator might be nice to have for when I reboot the game (not sure if I can have it show only one feature while flying or not). Mostly I am doing this as I want to attempt an Eve landing/return and flying every craft to Eve is not going to happen, yeah I could hyper edit them there but that is not for me. Aslo this lander will be a legit thing as it will not have chairs on it and I will do it on my \u0022hardcore\u0022 save, I might see about putting this with my current series as well. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now I only have the upper stage of the lander started to test a ladder idea I had, with success and it is still balance for weight as well.
