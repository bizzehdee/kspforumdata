I know they are asteroids and after watching a couple of YouTubers bring them into orbit I decided I want to try that but I can\u0027t seem to track them. Their orbits will not show up. I saw a similar post that said click the blue track button in the bottom left corner but I have no button like that. How do I get their orbits to appear on the tracking station so I know where to rendezvous with them?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbalChamp2006","CreatedById":190555,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-08T19:52:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nif you\u00A0select the object by clicking it on the map the \u0022track\u0022 button should appear in place of the \u0022recover\u0022 button.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-07-08T20:02:28Z\u0022 title=\u002207/08/2020 08:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 8, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by KerbalChamp2006\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ENew info\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jwags","CreatedById":206088,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-09T03:15:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis worked thank you couldn\u0027t even begin to express the amount of gratitude I have for your advice I\u0027ve been trying to do this for 4 weeks now and have been unsuccessful however due to your advice I successfully was able to track one and bring it to kerbin thank you so much\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
