The Lab has no immediate effect on data kept, but it can store an infinite amounts of scientific results. It is the only part which allows even multiple copies from the same experiment in the same situation and biome. This won\u0027t happen automatically, though: Kerbals have to go on EVA and make the rounds, manually collecting the data from every instrument.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T16:23:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERemember that the goo container and science junior can only be used once each, unless they are \u0027cleaned\u0027 using the MPL.
