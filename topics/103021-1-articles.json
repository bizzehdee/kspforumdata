But can\u0027t the MPL store many data? The pod can\u0027t, I know, but if I collect more data of one biome on several single trips and \u0022dump\u0022 the data into the MPL, is that possible?\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nAh found it!

The Lab has no immediate effect on data kept, but it can store an infinite amounts of scientific results. It is the only part which allows even multiple copies from the same experiment in the same situation and biome. This won\u0027t happen automatically, though: Kerbals have to go on EVA and make the rounds, manually collecting the data from every instrument.\u0022"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T16:23:15Z","Content":"Remember that the goo container and science junior can only be used once each, unless they are \u0027cleaned\u0027 using the MPL. To do that I think you have to dock with it anyway."}]}
