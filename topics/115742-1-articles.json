In reasonable time?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently I have two ideas. First, raise my Sun apoapsis a lot, until my orbital speed there becomes manageable, and then just turn around. The other involves Eve flyby, with Oberth maneuver bringing me into a reasonably low retrograde Sun orbit, Then a burn around the Sun to reach the hulk, connected with plane alignment, and finally a burn at the encounter - or somewhere beyond, a bielliptic transfer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, that\u0027s not all. I still need to turn the hulk around and bring it back to Kerbin. I\u0027m pondering a Jool assist and again a turn around the Sun - even if I bring her into *any* solar prograde orbit, that will be manageable through a second craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny good suggestions?

To get back you might need to send a second rescue mission like you said, however i think it would be easier for you to rendezvous with the first craft if you can first get it in an orbit around any other planet.

Some of the \u0022Rescue from around the Sun\u0022 missions are brutal. As far as options it\u0027s going to depend. Is the 10 km/s of dV you mention at Kerbin surface or in LKO? (if it\u0027s not a LKO number I don\u0027t think even rendezvous will be possible) The biggest problem here by far is getting turned around retrograde, this will be easier at higher altitudes the Eve assist idea probably won\u0027t work, basically gravity assists can\u0027t typically turn you around though they can make the turn less expensive (oberth) but in that case I recommend doing it at Jool due to Jool\u0027s orbit speed around Sun being slower. From there as worir 4 mentions you can probably drop the craft into a Jool capture and make the return to Kerbin much easier. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough as I say this I am remembering that I have not done aerobraking at Jool since re-entry heat was a thing, that could make the whole plan moot. In that case you will almost certainly need more dV. I\u0027m not sure of the orbital speed of the craft you are rendezvousing with but basically if you go up to a very high altitude and then turn around you usually end up spending between 2 and 1 km/s depending on your patience. I would then guess that the rendezvous will cost about 1.6 km/s dV. (based on estimating that craft\u0027s orbital velocity as 3.8 km/s) Going home to kerbin should then be around another 2 km/s though that will bring you in backward and very fast so again reentry could be serious problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose are my thoughts.
