Beyond that, a liquid fuel engine should be among the more expensive parts, certainly, but the most expensive should be the fuel. You would think that a rocket engine is a complicated piece of machinery, but in reality it is actually a fairly simple creation.

I had tried before my previous post, but was unable to find any verifiable data. However after my second search I was able to find some transcripts of Senators $%^@ing about the price for rocket engines that NASA commonly uses for the Delta rockets and the Centaur upper stage. Rocket engines are indeed fabulously expensive. My apologies for the failure on my part. My experience with the matter comes from my local space-science center that managed to procure one of the main engine nozzles from the Space Shuttle program while I was still working there. All of my information is from discussions among the various professors that work there and the director of the center.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt any rate, I still maintain that it is too high. From a game play perspective if the first mission in the stock pack has you reach an altitude of 70km, you really need to have a rocket engine unless you can design a good jet that will peak at 70K.. Not everyone is capable of making a well designed space plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition, I would point out that the 2003 manufacture cost for a brand new military-grade jet engine was $14.3 million according to a report published for the USAF by one of the DoD subsidiaries. Further, according to my research the high cost for rocket engines seems to be due to whether or not they restart. The price per unit for the J-2X (redesign of the J-2) was only 25 million per unit, which at the 2003 price for a jet engine would make it 1.7 times more expensive. In contrast, if the engine is restartable, such as the engines on the space shuttle, the price is more like 50 million a unit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we went with the proper scaling that way, then the 2,500 for the jet engine that we currently have in game would at the most scale to 8700 ish for the most basic rocket engine (calling the LV-T30 the most basic).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-21T07:04:07Z\u0022 title=\u002206/21/2013 07:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 21, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by PringleMan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"theSpeare","CreatedById":62144,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-21T07:03:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust came on to say that the icons are beautiful.

Just stage when needed until you reach your desired apoapsis, pop the fairings after you exit the atmosphere, and finish the burn towards orbit. It even has retro-rockets to clean up after itself (although debris in the atmosphere don\u0027t burn up \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E ) Did I mention how cheap it is? My most expensive satellite was only 4,000 kerbits and I could have easily done every probe mission (except solar escape) using the same rocket over and over, while keeping healthy profit margins. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe payload in the above VAB picture cost 1393, which leaves the actual lifter to 12444 - 1393 = 11,051 including fairings. I was able to use this exact lifter for every mission except the solar escape and manned full-orbital missions, the only difference is an extra medium tank and instead of an LV-909, a Vesta (or LV-45 for a bit of extra oomph). The solar escape ship cost 21557. Below is the orbital manned pod, costing 2732, on top of the rocket which costs 18129-2732 = 15397. While I admit its probably not the cheapest thing, it is relatively easy to fly and a breeze to build (especially with the subassembly mod)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/57q5fyT.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002257q5fyT.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe prices do seem a bit odd in places, but I never found myself wanting for money.

A pancake probe, a toroidal tank, an ant, and a solar panel/RLA RTG can do a bunch of missions easily if you know what you\u0027re doing, or even don\u0027t know what you\u0027re doing but can use maneuver nodes. It would be nice to see missions that required more specific satellites, or even a minimum weight. Although, this could be an issue with the pricing, limiting potential lifter designs to be as frugal as possible which goes against the mantra of MOAR BOOSTERS. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, its late, I\u0027ve spent far too long making this post, I hope it comes out intelligible.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"White Owl","CreatedById":10849,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-21T10:50:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou discovered the same thing I did!
