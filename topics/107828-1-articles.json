Is this \u0022Forcing fullscreen?\u0022 Or are you talking about the really annoying way that Spore (I don\u0027t play that many games, so this is the only reference I can find) just plastered itself all over your desktop, making it impossible to use any other apps? Why would anyone want that?"},{"CreatedByName":"Murph","CreatedById":90837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T18:28:34Z","Content":"One thing I\u0027d would strongly like to avoid is it switching to a mode that blocks cmd\u002Btab, as some full screen apps are prone to doing (quite why the OS even allows that without the user granting permission or enabling it is beyond me). I too am annoyed by the current mode where the menu bar and dock can make an intrusive and unwanted appearance if your mouse strays a pixel or 2 too far. Given the choice, however, of cmd\u002Btab being broken, or having to live with the current behaviour, I\u0027d choose the current behaviour. I.e. correct function of cmd\u002Btab is orders of magnitude more important to me than the irritation here. Ideally, I\u0027d do away with the irritation while keeping cmd\u002Btab functionality."}]}
