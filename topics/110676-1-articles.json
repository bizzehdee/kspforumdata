I had a very stable game going with no crashes until just now when I hit 25 flights. I tried taking down flags and stowing Kerbals aboard their ships, so I have a station in orbit, a lander and rover on the surface of the planets I\u0027ve colonized along with a base of about 90 parts. I\u0027ve tried using KAS to connect the rover to the base to reduce the number of flights, which puts the parts count of rover/base at 140. I could also connect the lander to the base with KAS, it\u0027s just tough to get the lander close enough without wasting fuel. Just wondering...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T19:57:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA few hundred thousands depending on your computer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen outside physics range (22.5 km for atmospheric trajectories, 2 km for physical ship simulation) crafts are just points on a set orbit thanks to patched conics. Every crafts trajectory, when in tracking view for example, is just described by a conic equation and a fixed trajectory (on rails). Therefore they barely require any resources to be simulated and the game can manage a great number of ships easily.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour problem probably doesn\u0027t come from this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Murph","CreatedById":90837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T20:03:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is no exact answer to that question. No two flights will use the same amount of memory, if it\u0027s memory usage that you\u0027re concerned about. Total number of parts out there in the universe is likely to have as much of an impact, if not a greater impact than the number of flights.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have too many mods, it could be as low as 1 complex flight being enough to prevent you doing anything else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe answer also depends on which OS you\u0027re using, Windows reportedly seems to use most (3GB\u002B) of its (less than 4GB) before it gets going. On OS X, a fresh install of KSP uses less than 2GB of the 4GB max. On 64 bit Linux, the max is much higher, more limited by loss of performance if you get close to or exceed your system\u0027s RAM capacity.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Keras","CreatedById":114511,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T20:45:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor this kind of crash the most important factors are the amount of parts added by mods and the textures they bring with them.
