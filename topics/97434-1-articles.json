I have started using mods the past couple of weeks, NEAR \u0026amp; DR to name but a few, it is however making my parachute deployment very late, as I have to wait to hit under around 315 m/s or else they rip off. I get very low to the ground before I deploy them, we\u0027re talking under 5000m here. How do you folks cause more drag to slow down better?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-22T11:33:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EShallower reentry path.
