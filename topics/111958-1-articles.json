Mods shown below.\n\nAnyway i do have a problem with my tourists in the Career mode.\n\n[http://e01i.imgup.net/KSPTourist54a6.jpg](http://e01i.imgup.net/KSPTourist54a6.jpg)\n\nLike the picture above shows, i have two tourists in my Astronaut Complex that i don\u0027t have any Contracts available for. They appeared after i accepted my very first Tourist contract but that contract was for other kerbals than those two. And even if i take the two for a ride (i assume they would like a suborbital/orbital around Kerbin flight) they don\u0027t disappear.\n\nI would like to get rid of them, well without killing them ^^\u0022\n\nPS. Even after deleting all mods they didn\u0027t disappear. And non of these mods should have caused that problem.\n\nAlso tested x86 and x64 versions\n\nMods that i use are all up to date\n\nModuleManager\n\nScienceAlert\n\nStageRecovery\n\nStationScience\n\nKerbalScienceExchange\n\nMechJeb\n\nKerbalEngineer\n\nChatter\n\nKAS and KIS\n\nRemoteTech\n\nScansat\n\nAlarmClock\n\nTransferWindow\n\nAlternateResourcePanel\n\nKSP-AVC"},{"CreatedByName":"diomedea","CreatedById":93700,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T14:37:39Z","Content":"Mind showing what contracts you have active, rather then the ones available? \n\nTourists should be made available to ride a craft with active contracts."},{"CreatedByName":"MinaTakashi","CreatedById":145648,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T15:40:04Z","Content":"Of course, i forgot that \n\n[http://b60i.imgup.net/KSPTourist980a.jpg](http://b60i.imgup.net/KSPTourist980a.jpg)\n\nas you see no other contracts are open and those two still show up"},{"CreatedByName":"diomedea","CreatedById":93700,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T17:10:56Z","Content":"Can\u0027t say what caused those tourists to appear then, but sure they are with your savegame now. While the origin can be considered a bug (and would be useful to track what caused it, but would require some effort to do), the persistence with the savegame is something that could be corrected. I would expect them to show with your savegame, in the ROSTER section (has a number of KERBAL entries with all active Kerbals). \n\nIf they indeed show there, taking them out should be an easy chore. If you wish, upload your savegame (.sfs) so me or others may have a look and probably be able to delete those unwanted tourists."},{"CreatedByName":"MinaTakashi","CreatedById":145648,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T19:54:57Z","Content":"Ok thank you very much. The hint that they are saved in the sfs file helped me, i deleted them out of it and now they are gone. \n\nMade a backup of that savegame\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/pak990jg1rh6sgd/0406%2021-40.sfs?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/pak990jg1rh6sgd/0406%2021-40.sfs?dl=0)\n\nDon\u0027t know if that helps to figure the issue out.\n\nBecause i really dont have a clue why they appeared."},{"CreatedByName":"diomedea","CreatedById":93700,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T21:26:34Z","Content":"Checked that savegame, but couldn\u0027t find any hint about what made those tourists to appear. That is actually better, rather then having still something in the save about them, and could create an issue not finding them any more.\n\nCould be something shows in the log (output\\_log.txt or Player.log), in case the process that created them also logged the event. But not knowing what that process could be, can\u0027t anticipate if that took care to keep events logged. Also, can\u0027t exclude it was actually KSP to generate those tourists, as if it called the process twice for the same contract; but then would be interesting to find out what really happened, it may show a bug escaped.\n\nAnyway, glad you could get rid of that annoyance."},{"CreatedByName":"MinaTakashi","CreatedById":145648,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T07:39:21Z","Content":"hm, i cant find any player.log file in my KSP folder, but i found the output\\_log \n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/sz9o2yora9t3may/output_log.txt?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/sz9o2yora9t3may/output_log.txt?dl=0)\n\nmaybe it helps to find the reason why it happened."}]}
