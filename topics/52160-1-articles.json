The end result is that the gyroscope returns to its original equilibrium, while the spacecraft\u0027s orientation has changed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo experience the effect of precession yourself, take a bicycle wheel and grab it by any handhold you can place along its spinning axis. Hold it so that it is upright - parallel with your body (I suppose perpendicular would work too but parallel\u0027s easier on your body). Get somebody else to get that wheel spinning - get it going as fast as possible. Once the wheel\u0027s spinning, try to turn it; you\u0027ll experience a definite counter-force that will try to turn the wheel back to its original position. You can hold it in the new position, but it takes constant force. That\u0027s precession, it\u0027s how a gyroscope works, and in turn it\u0027s what a Reaction Wheel in KSP is based upon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022celem\u0022 data-cite=\u0022celem\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAsas is preferable in general right now since its the lightest sas-capable torque module in stock. \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou mean the Large ASAS module, right?
