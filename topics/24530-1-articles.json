Personally, I like being able to see my debris so I can get rid of it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for hiding irrelevant trajectories, the computer can\u0027t read your mind, so it doesn\u0027t know what you consider to be irrelevant. I might want to see a trajectory that you don\u0027t, and vice versa. Filtering of types of objects is coming, which may address your issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI fully support better camera control. So many times I\u0027ve been left guessing what my encounter is like because I can\u0027t zoom in on it, and it\u0027s then hard to adjust.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
