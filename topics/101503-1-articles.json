An astronaut left the main vehicle, and had landed on the ground, making sure that the ladders were working right, when an attempt was made to climb back onto the vehicle.\n\nOne instant they were standing at the KSC, a few minutes away from snacks and a bed. Seconds away from more than five other Kerbals. The next second, everything was dark, except the clearly distant Kerbol. It took nineteen days to hit it, and the crewman was going to fast for an intercept to be possible. At the same time, two crew members were killed instantly, and three sitting nearby were launched into Kerbol escape, with the shredded remains of a ship flying after them. It was a sad day at the KSC, and it caused a great bit of inquiry surrounding the use of ladders on spacecraft."},{"CreatedByName":"Sampa","CreatedById":130079,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-08T06:31:02Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Whenever I try to build space warships.
