Historically, for reasons that are still not entirely clear to me, raycasting to detect the fairings frequently meets with failure. Deadly Reentry has this problem a lot. The frontal curved part of the fairing is least likely to be detected by a raycast. Probably an issue with the colliders, which AFAIK are what actually get detected. AFAIK.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERaycasting will also fail if the ray passes between the seam where two fairings meet. That\u0027s pretty much inevitable as the ray has no width.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wonder if layers could be an issue too...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ee-dog, if you see this, what layer are the fairings set to?

Very new with this. Following Ferrams guide to build a basic rocket. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I attach a Staysputnik to a fuel tank, then attach an engine, then fill the fuel tank with appropriate fuel, I will get dV from KER.
