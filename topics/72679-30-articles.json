Right-clicking pulls up the part menu with the start scan and analyze options, but they do not work. Any thoughts?

There have already been many changes to how resources are handled between v8 and v9, so I\u0027m not going to bother making those changes again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat was the problem with v9? The anomalies not showing up for the BTDT? Was this after scanning the area with the multi-spectral scanner? I don\u0027t think they will show up with the BTDT until you do that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Virtualgenius","CreatedById":67644,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-25T21:45:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the reply and I guessed it would be a lot of work, I scanned with a multispectral scanner and they didnt show up, but I have now downloaded the latest dev release 9rc4.1 and placed it into a vanilla install and its working fine either i dint install it properly or i had a conflict, so ignore my last previous comment\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Millennium","CreatedById":129275,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-28T17:19:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey guys, new player here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI installed SCANsat but all I\u0027m getting is a large gray map, is that normal?
