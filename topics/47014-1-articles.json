I said to myself maybe a year down the line when everything becomes routine. Buuut then i discovered kOS. THAT is a true auto pilot mod and I love it. Adds a new layer of craft construction. All done in the VAB? Now you gotta write up an autopilot program to fly it. It\u0027s very hard and Im not very good at it, but I learned how to make launch to orbit scripts and maneuver nodes. It is really great to see it all work in the end. It brings back that feeling of accomplishment that I had when I first started playing KSP. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd to top it all off I use the Lazor camera and romfarer to increase draw distance to 100km. From now on I watch all my rockets launch from the ground like I was standing there. The zoomed camera can watch them all the way to the horizon. Truly a brilliant feeling and it breathes new life into this game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVery highly recommended. Ditch mecjeb!

I love that, no autopilot or anything like that just information that I need to make life easier, both in the construction process and in the flight process. But I don\u0027t hate on people who do use it, I do consider it a bit of a cop out in some aspects but I can understand the use of it for those long ion drive burns on sats and probes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I also strive for realism in most of the games I play, and so I also have mods like FAR and DRE, but don\u0027t have the mods that give you way OP engines, or wheels that can go 200m/s on the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"frizzank","CreatedById":57210,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-30T22:17:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI used mech jeb in the beginning to help with the more difficult stuff, but after a while I wanted the extra challenge of doing things myself.
