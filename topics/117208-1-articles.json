One vessel. One guy controls the pilots, the other engineers/scientist. The pilot flies and can time warp while the other guy welds stuff together/does sience. That way if two people were in the same vessel both wouldn\u0027t want to grief or else they would completely fail the mission.\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s say both of them choose theur roles at the beginning of the mission. The pilot has types of missions for pilots, like \u0022fly there, make a report/land there take a sample\u0022. The scientist has something like \u0022check the sample/take a science report at X spot, etc.\u0022 The engineer would need KIS/KAS abilities: \u0022weld this with that, connect X and Y with fuel pipes, then pump the fuel.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo space race.

In fact, KMP was the mod that turned stock multiplayer from an impossibility into a reachable goal. 0.24 broke ground for multiplayer (under the hood, not gameplay-wise) and there are now several devs working on multiplayer, according to the devnotes. Point is, SQUAD already has a system for timewarp in a multiplayer scenario, and unless someone can come up with one that somehow places no restrictions on player timewarp while somehow allowing them to interact at any time without creating a hopeless bowl of event-bubble spaghetti (This is probably impossible, but hey, that\u0027s what everybody said about space travel), that system is KMP\u0027s system.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-30T02:07:22Z\u0022 title=\u002207/30/2015 02:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Hobbes Novakoff\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"logan2611","CreatedById":148925,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T03:18:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlright, so here is how DMP does timewarp in case anyone wants to know(and I think it is a pretty good idea):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlayer 1 timewarps ahead into the future, he is then selected as the reference frame for the server for time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce Player 1 is done timewarping, players may at will sync with his time, doing this will teleport you to where you would be when you get to the time Player 1 is at.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T08:11:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022logan2611\u0022 data-cite=\u0022logan2611\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAlright, so here is how DMP does timewarp in case anyone wants to know(and I think it is a pretty good idea):\u003Cp\u003EPlayer 1 timewarps ahead into the future, he is then selected as the reference frame for the server for time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce Player 1 is done timewarping, players may at will sync with his time, doing this will teleport you to where you would be when you get to the time Player 1 is at.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich is a pretty bad system in my opinion.
