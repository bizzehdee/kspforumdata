Moho... Small planet. I think to myself, self: Moho is a tiny little rock, lets visit it. How hard could it possibly be to get there? I mean heck, I managed to get a probe into orbit around the sun, which is further into the the solar system, and that was easy enough. Now, most of you who have done the Moho thing just shuddered and called me naive. I agree. I WAS naive at the LEAST. Holy heck this was a hard hard mission!! Took a MONTH in KERBIN ORBIT, then another 48 days in transit AND to LAND. WOWSA!! I will never EVER assume this to be easy again! BUT, oh so rewarding! I have yet to eva Bob or Bill, only Jeb is out side right now on the ground.

But, you seem to be confusing the utility of a few different things: thrust, efficiency (or specific impulse, Isp), and delta-v.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThrust is how hard your engines fire. This is what you gain by adding more (or bigger) engines. Thrust is essentially useless once you get into the vacuum of space. Without friction to fight against, one of those little ant engines could (eventually) get any size payload anywhere. Once you are in orbit, all you really need to consider thrust-wise is how quickly you\u0027ll need to execute burns in order avoid messing up your timing or spoiling your patience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEfficiency (Isp) is going to be far more important once you\u0027re in space, because the more efficient, the more you can do with less fuel. More engines does not improve your Isp, but you will instead have (more or less) an average efficiency of the different engines you are using.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDelta-v is the key concept to consider. It literally means change in velocity. It is a measurement of the actual amount of work you have to do to get some place. Consider that regex said it takes about 6,000 m/s of delta-v to get to Moho. So any craft needs to change its initial velocity by 6,000 m/s. The more mass that craft has, the more work it will take in order to get that change in velocity. So, the best possible design to get to Moho would have the lightest engines possible (to cut mass), the most efficient engines possible (so you need less fuel, which means less mass), and exactly the amount of fuel you need with no extra.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo adding all those nuclear engines may have increased your thrust, but that didn\u0027t help you get to Moho any easier.
