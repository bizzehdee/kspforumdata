KSP 32 bit crashes each time I try to enter the atmosphere. I\u0027m running the game stock (unmodded) v1.0.2. I\u0027ve tried reloading KSP about four different times to reattempt entry at around 25k. Each time I get the KSP has stopped working message from Windows as soon as my ship\u0027s heat shield has stopped ablating and I\u0027ve entered thicker atmosphere. The first couple of times, it crashed when I was deploying chutes. The second couple of times, I didn\u0027t open my chutes and it crashed anyway.\n\nWhere the heck is crash data saved now with 1.0 anyway? I can post to my google drive and share it.\n\nDetails: \n\nKSP Version: KSP Windows 32 bit (steam) v1.0.2, build id = 00842\n\n2015.05.01 at 21:02:12 CEST\n\nBranch: master\n\nScreenshot: (working on it)\n\nCraft file: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9ezkeeOoeF-RjJ0SEp5TWVoMHc/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9ezkeeOoeF-RjJ0SEp5TWVoMHc/view?usp=sharing)\n\nSave file: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9ezkeeOoeF-bktHd0ZpQ2FyaWs/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9ezkeeOoeF-bktHd0ZpQ2FyaWs/view?usp=sharing)\n\nCrash Log file: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9ezkeeOoeF-Vl90bG1RZl9MMnc/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9ezkeeOoeF-Vl90bG1RZl9MMnc/view?usp=sharing)\n\nSystem Specs: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9ezkeeOoeF-R1JtODVWYmRGZ1k/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9ezkeeOoeF-R1JtODVWYmRGZ1k/view?usp=sharing)\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nSteps to replicate:\n\n1) load my save game\n\n2) enter the atmosphere with a PE of 29,789\n\n3) When the ship starts to catch fire, detach propulsion stages (crashes with both staging / right clicking the decouplers)\n\n4) Keep the ship centered with the heat shield pointed directly at direction of travel\n\n5) When the flames begin to subside, the game crashes, doesn\u0027t matter if parachutes are deployed or not\n\nScreenshots are located here: [https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B9ezkeeOoeF-RFk3aVdRSlNQcW8\u0026usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B9ezkeeOoeF-RFk3aVdRSlNQcW8\u0026usp=sharing)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-01T23:46:25Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2015 11:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by digitalsingularity**\n  \nadding details"},{"CreatedByName":"digitalsingularity","CreatedById":79683,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T00:52:42Z","Content":"Ha! I found out how to work around the issue. Here\u0027s what I did:\n\n1) Decouple everything but the capsule lander at the apogee\n\n2) enter the atmosphere\n\nBy the time I got the atmosphere, the decoupled parts of my ship were no longer within range to be left in the rendering engine (beyond 4k... not sure how far things render in 1.x). The game didn\u0027t crash (wahoo, only took about 8 attempts to figure out how to work around this) and my kerbal and ship successfully landed. Now... I still think the bug needs to be fixed, whatever it was."},{"CreatedByName":"INSULINt","CreatedById":104803,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T01:17:46Z","Content":"I removed and replaced the radial chutes on my SSTO that was doing the same thing going out and back into the atmo (when I finally got it to not crash before getting out of the atmo)\n\nI\u0027ve had 2 OOM crashes (from mods, oh well) but I did get the thing there and back fine without lockup (KSP.exe has stopped working) crashes.\n\nThe base of the SSTO was built in 1.0.0, so maybe some chutes from previous versions don\u0027t like the atmo/part changes in 1.0.1\u00262?"}]}
