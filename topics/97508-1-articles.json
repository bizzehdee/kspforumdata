What I probably should mention is that this laptop has a hyperthreaded i7 quad core 3rd gen clocking 2.20GHz and a secondary GPU, NVIDIA GeForce GT550M (so no intel HD graphics here!). It was not built for cooling efficiency. The cooling stand helps a good bit with airflow in general, but doesn\u0027t improve my running temps much.

The small area next to my keyboard (just left of the ~ key) actually gets hot enough that its uncomfortable to touch for more than about 10 seconds when I\u0027m doing a multi-hour op with my planetside outfit or something. Thats the heatsink over there. Its blasting air as fast as it can to rid the heat but the real root of the problem is a dell xps 17 has a TERRIBLE cooling system for dealing with the absurd amounts of heat my hardware generates (again, there\u0027s that performance hardware coming back to bite me).
