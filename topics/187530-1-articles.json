If you\u0027re doing this it\u0027s a good idea to raise your payload up a bit\u00A0so it doesn\u0027t hit the ground before you teleport it. I speak from experience testing space stations like this, and while I don\u0027t know if launch clamps can still cause this effect in newer versions, I do this routine out of an abundance of caution anyway.
