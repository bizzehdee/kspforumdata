For a succesful launch to orbit the plane uses a basic jet engine while in the atmosphere with a climb rate of 10 m/s. At 11000 m I activated the two LV-909 liquid fuel engines and maintained a 45 degree climb until apoapsis is raised to 100000m. This is where I circulized my orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the landing I burned the remaining fuel after reentry at KSC, deactivated all reaction wheels and glided to the runway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only two issues I have with it are the need for the hill at the runway for takeoff and the need to burn the liquid fuel before landing or the plane will be destroyed at touchdown even when going down with less than 5 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-06T16:49:05Z\u0022 title=\u002201/06/2015 04:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Scrat\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Etypo\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scrat","CreatedById":48002,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-07T10:32:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI improved the design further and present the Scratcorp Sirius MK 2:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Costs reduced to 24410 funds\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Able to climb to about 16000 m by basic jet engine only\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Added 2 Goo containers\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Less mass leads to reduced fuel consumption by deleting front liquid fuel tanks and redundant parts (e.g. central intakes.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Added antenna and batteries\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Better flight behavior after takeoff\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Reasonable amount of jet fuel left after reentry\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Better style by raising wing tips and positioning intakes below the wing\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E.craft file: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/dnt105qghq2pm2i/Sirius%20MK%202.craft?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/dnt105qghq2pm2i/Sirius%20MK%202.craft?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/70nwM\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
