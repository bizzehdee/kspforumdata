The Problem is this: The fact that there are so many MODs once they are downloaded the source URL is basically LOST or forgotten; I have so many I cant possibly keep track of them all; this is why ORIGINAL AUTHORS\u0027 names NEED TO BE IN THOSE MODS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf people fix them that is fine, but if the original author of the code is not there, good luck in getting it to work; therefore, I ALWAYS go to the ORIGINAL author\u0027s work and use it as a template so I can understand how it works...go to KSP version v24 and use that as a template as well if you need to; I use v24 to make my v90 Tech Tree ! You can always find an earlier version of the best MODS to try in KSP v24.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you understand the code, then pick and choose; Interstellar is called WarpPlugin in the folder; another slightly confusing issue; if yer folder doesnt say \u0027WarpPlugin\u0027, then it isnt Interstellar; now that may have changed with updates as I have not checked in the last month I been so busy fixing Life Support Resources.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome MODDERS will start out making resources simply - like making rocketparts with ElectricCharge (!)...check those cfg part files; I prefer MODS that use more CFG\u0027s and less DLLs as DLLs are hard-coded and not easily customizable; you can use that as a guide as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps and good luck...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECmdr Zeta\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-05T14:55:47Z\u0022 title=\u002203/05/2015 02:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Cdr_Zeta\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
