This is my attempt at recreating a star fighter from the Manga/Anime \u003Cem\u003EMoonlight Mile\u003C/em\u003E. The design intrigued me the most as it combined a futuristic look with the more conventional style of today\u0027s rockets. As I\u0027m not exactly sure what the star fighter was called I decided to name it the SFS-Raven (Space Fighter System).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fighter has 6x lasers centered beneath the cockpit and 2 4x missile pods on either shoulder. The solar panels and missile pod latches are actuated and can open/close. Thrusters at the front also allow the fighter to slow down or reverse without having to rotated to the periapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/ICGry\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
