Once you get over Mach 2.5 (~850 m/s) the parts will start to overheat. When you use the basic jet engine this is not a problem because the engine doesn\u0027t have enough power to cause trouble. When you use the Turbo ramjet engine, you will start to see problems because the engines grow more powerful at higher speeds. (There are examples of this in real life: when the MiG-25 exceeded about Mach 2.83 it would tend to run away and overheat.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, pay close attention to the maximum temperature of the parts. Some parts, like batteries and photovoltaic panels have a maximum temperature of 1200K. A Mk1 cockpit can stand 2000K, a Mk2 2500K and a Mk3 2700K. Once you get above Mach 3, things will start to explode unless you have been very careful in your aircraft design. You want parts that have a high maximum heat, especially the root part. You also want to be able to get rid of the heat quickly. Parts that are good for that are wings, engines, radiators and the engine precooler. With the right construction you can get up to a sustained speed of Mach 4.5.
