You can listen to the launches from the perspective of Mission Control or the separate audio from the astronaut. It may be a bit difficult to find your way up there and you might have to do some reading of the text documents to nail down exactly what your looking for. Some of the audio has several minutes of dead air so don\u0027t be surprised if you fire up a mp3 and only hear some static for a while.
