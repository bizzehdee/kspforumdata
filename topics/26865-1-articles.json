Granted, landing on both these moons are a learning experience in themselves but if there is one thing you will do as a new Kerbonaut is USE LOADS OF FUEL.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo my advice is to get a rocket with a decent amount of fuel into orbit. Make sure it has a docking collar attached to it (normal or JR size - just take note because your Mun ship will need the same size docking collar... oh and the shielded docking collar is compatible with the normal collar but not the JR one) and then send up your Mun ship up to dock with it to top off the tanks. So many of us (yeah, me included) end up landing on the moon (or crashing lol) and find we don\u0027t have enough fuel to get back to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yes, docking is hard to begin with, but if you have problems just watch some videos (ie of Scott Manley\u0027s pedigree) and read up and finally if you are still having problems JUST ASK. The reason so many people help with this game is because it isn\u0027t easy right off the bat... but it is easy once you get the first few docking under your collar. If you are not a purist and will use mods, get the Romfarer Docking Camera mod.

The most important thing is to read into the manouvers you need to do and how to fly to save DeltaV.
