That \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Launch Escape System\u0022\u003ELES\u003C/abbr\u003E is all fairly squared away now, and in preliminary testing seems to work well with the 1.2 pre-release. If you haven\u0027t seen it, the BDB Apollo mod is one of the finest to come along in a while. Check it out!  I am proud to have been able to make a contribution to that effort.\n\nOne of the things I was able to accomplish in the course of building that \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Launch Escape System\u0022\u003ELES\u003C/abbr\u003E was to merge all the functionality and performance of the PEBKAC Mk1-2 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Launch Escape System\u0022\u003ELES\u003C/abbr\u003E into a single part. The models are simplified and look cleaner and I\u0027ve spent some time optimizing the textures so they aren\u0027t such ridiculous resource hogs. Most importantly, for the user, it makes life easier to drop one part in place, instead of three. With all that in mind I am going to make new versions of the PEBKAC \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Launch Escape System\u0022\u003ELES\u003C/abbr\u003E as single parts for the next release of this mod. The package will still include the original 3-part versions so existing builds should continue to work.\n\nI\u0027ll try to get the next release out as soon as possible after 1.2 is officially released.\n\nCheers!"},{"CreatedByName":"Kurld","CreatedById":79950,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-14T12:33:16Z","Content":"Well, I somehow managed to delete the configs I had created while working on the parts during the 1.2 pre-release.
