However, I have noticed since I started playing on 0.9 that the flight crew video feed (the bottom right windows of their faces) is much, much slower than it used to be. I know the feeds are meant to be mildly choppy, but this essentially a 1 fps slideshow of the Kerbals inside the ship. For comparison, older versions of KSP were much smoother and would have more Kerbals in the ship. The game otherwise runs at a rock solid 60\u002Bfps, and I have in fact had a processor upgrade since I last played.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am running mostly aesthetic mods - a couple replaced universe/planet textures, cities and lights, custom suits, etc., as well as Chatterer and KER. Only one mod that adds items (forget the name, but it adds navlights and beacons like on planes). Hardware is beyond \u0022recommended\u0022 specs. x64 exe. Ran the exact same mods back 0.24 and 0.25 with no problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s honestly a minor thing, but I personally love seeing the Kerbals react to everything that happens mid-flight. With it essentially a slideshow now, it just loses that magic. Has anyone else seen slowdown/choppiness of the flight crew video feed since 0.90 came out, or am I just unlucky?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance for any help.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"biohazard15","CreatedById":91655,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-31T06:55:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, do not use 64-bit version.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, do not use 64-bit version.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThird (just in case you somehow managed to miss the previous two), DO NOT USE 64-bit version.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELast, but not least: sloppy video feed is a stock x64 bug.
