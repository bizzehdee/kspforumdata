Most proposals are small fixes that target one issue at the cost of another. I say: let\u0027s go for a more radical approach. Which means it\u0027ll never make it into the real game, but one can always dream, right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESome observations about the current state of affairs\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EScience and the tech tree were the first \u0022game\u0022 additions to KSP. In the original introduction you unlocked the tree with science; there was nothing else to unlock it with.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EInvariably, unlocking the tech tree is either too easy or requires science spamming. I doubt there is a true balance; it depends a lot on your acquired skill levels at KSP\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EWith the latest versions we have funds, science, reputation... a lot of variables to play with\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EBefore strategies gaining science was too hard and required science grinding. \u003Cem\u003ENow\u003C/em\u003E with strategies it\u0027s too easy!

Want that LV-909? You\u0027ll have to \u003Cem\u003Eearn\u003C/em\u003E it by fullfilling tests on it. On easy level it might be as easy as unlocking an entire group; on hard levels you\u0027ll have to unlock the group first, and \u003Cem\u003Ethen\u003C/em\u003E unlock the parts through contracts.

Those contracts to test the LV-909 will not be available until you have collected 3,000 science points.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EObviously science gained through strategies needs to be toned done but that\u0027s not new\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would remove the common problem of \u0022test a parachute over Kerbin to get access to landing gear.\u0022 Of course it would require tighter contracts for proper testing (not the BS of testing a take-off engine in orbit or those kind of things). It would remove the problem of science being an interchangeable currency to buy \u003Cem\u003Eany\u003C/em\u003E technology, at the same time it would reflect a certain \u0022technology level\u0022 that is required to access \u003Cem\u003Eunlocking\u003C/em\u003E certain technology.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ddenis","CreatedById":89784,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-23T00:31:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t think that the real balance is possible at all.
