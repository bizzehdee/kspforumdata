Seems more ideal to have the facilities on the celestial body and do all the work there without expending more fuel for something that will be converted. Also it is lighter to transfer fuel as opposed to kethane. There is the kethane engine, but if I am correct, it is atmosphere breathing, making it all the more clear that such facilities have greater benefit grounded.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConnecting things on the surface without KAS and Kerbals is a real pain in the posterior. Building an efficient vehicle to act as a reusable orbit/surface/orbit/repeat tanker requires it to be able to land with a large amount of empty tankage AND be able to claw its way back to orbit with all tanks full while being able to lift much more fuel than it uses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor some planets (Eve in particular) that\u0027s pretty much impossible. It can be difficult even with lifting Kethane. A lander I made for Duna managed to net less than half a Rockomax X200-8 on each lift. I\u0027d send it down with that tank empty and coming back up, after circularizing and rendezvous, and having to convert a bit of Kethane to have enough fuel to rendezvous... it just wasn\u0027t efficient enough. Fortunately the design did hold enough fuel to go to Ike and land.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if you have a lander capable of carrying over 50% of its fuel and oxidizer capacity to orbit, and landing with 50% or less of its capacity filled, and can station Kerbals at the fueling base to make KAS connections, then a surface based Kethane conversion operation is feasible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor my upcoming Eve mission (all components individually tested, ship assembly ongoing in Kerbin orbit in a \u0022simulation\u0022) I\u0027ll be dropping a drilling rover, a converting rover and a manned lander which will start with about a 50% or somewhat less fuel and oxidizer load. Most likely only one of the two Kerbals will get to set foot on Eve, to plant a flag and connect and disconnect KAS from \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Tinker_to_Evers_to_Chance\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ETinker to Evers to Chance\u003C/a\u003E (drilling, converting and manned vehicles, respectively) to fuel up the lander for its massive parts shedding ascent back to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA KAS winch will serve for getting down from and back up to the 2-man can due to small diameter tanks and engine under it, thus nowhere to mount ladders.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Raffo","CreatedById":100078,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-05T13:06:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi folks!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea) This mod is awesome! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E I read through this thread, and just for the record, I also miss the control options for the stack winch, as described a few times earlier already (I honestly didn\u0027t know it was a problem, as I only encountered KAS newly in this career game, so I don\u0027t even have other winches yet).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ec) I noticed something, that is less a technical bug, but a problematic gameplay situation: In career mode, as soon as you unlock the storage containers (specifically storage container A of course is the first), you suddenly get access to a lot of things, you might not have unlocked yet. These parts don\u0027t show up in your part list in the construction buildings of course, but you can add everything as usual to the containers, without constraint. So for example I can easily put RTGs and rover wheels in the boxes, and assemble them to my ships (or... rovers ^^) later, even though I technically didn\u0027t even research them. This surely has a very kerbal touch to it (\u0022Hey, what\u0027s that warm thing?\u0022 - \u0022I don\u0027t know, just put it in the box and see what we can do with it in space!\u0022 \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E), but break the career mode a little.
