MY issue I\u0027m running into is how do i put the rover or satellite into the cargo bay. So far the closest I\u0027ve gotten is \u0022attaching\u0022 the item to the cargobay front or rear and build the craft around it. But then i can\u0027t drop the cargo. It\u0027s really frustrating see videos of people doing it but i can\u0027t find ANY tutorials or tips on how to do it. I know its best to build them separately then combine them but how?? Thank you\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-12T18:02:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUse a decoupler or docking port.

Fairly easy mistake, too, I\u0027ve forgotten decouplers on my stages sometimes. Landing is not pretty at that point.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
