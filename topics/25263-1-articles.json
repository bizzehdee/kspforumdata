It appeared to me the most appropriate. Yes, I\u0027m a newbie, and I\u0027m having a lot of fun and frustration with the learning curve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince I am new to the game, I am using MechJeb to get over the learning curve. I am trying to send a probe to the Mun, but I am failing once I get there. The first probe crashed into the planet, and the second ended up in a slingshot to deep space. Part of my problem is fuel supplies, and part of my problem is working the MechJeb interface when I get to the Mun and not knowing how to establish an orbit there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is what I\u0027m doing. Tell me where I\u0027m going wrong, if you can. There is something I am missing, or perhaps I\u0027m over-correcting things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Launch and establish a stable orbit around Kerbin. I aim for 200km, and then I use MechJeb to circularize and bring my eccentricity to essentially zero. I hope to have enough fuel left at this point to make the trip successfully.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) I use the Maneuver Planner to set up a Hohmann transfer to the Mun. This appears to work perfectly, and I\u0027m off in flight. I see the path intersecting with the Mun and a fishhook path establishing the flyby. There is also a little circle that says \u0022Encounter\u0022. I don\u0027t know what that means.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) When I get close to the encounter point, I set the \u0022Fine tune closest approach to target\u0022. However, if I am already in the SoI of the Mun, I cannot select it as a target, and the Maneuver Planner requires it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow comes the problem. I\u0027m within the Mun\u0027s SoI. I\u0027m flying close by, or sometimes not that close. I want to establish an orbit. What do I do? I can\u0027t set MechJeb to circularize because it goes all wacky. It\u0027s like it is trying to orbit Kerbin again. Maybe I\u0027m not close enough. But it\u0027s frustrating the hell out of me when it says \u0022This maneuver requires a target\u0022 and I can\u0027t select the Mun as a target to conduct the maneuver.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHelp!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EndlessWaves","CreatedById":41302,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-03T14:31:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Wijbrandus\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Wijbrandus\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESince I am new to the game, I am using MechJeb to get over the learning curve. \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt may be having the opposite effect. It\u0027s worth experimenting a bit so you get a basic idea of how your path changes in response to burns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat you need to do in this case is quite simple. You\u0027re flying past the mun because you have too much speed, so you need to slow down. How do you slow down? Turn around and burn the opposite way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way I\u0027d do it using mechjeb is to open Smart A.S.S. and hit the retrograde button. Assuming your your thrust is in the same direction as your capsule then that\u0027ll let you burn retrograde and lose speed. The curve of your path will increase and once you\u0027ll lost enough speed you\u0027ll be unable to escape from the mun and will be on a circular orbit. Keep burning and it\u0027ll curve more and you\u0027ll drop out of orbit as your path intersects the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cryocasm","CreatedById":5299,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-03T16:36:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI generally recommend MechJeb as well as ORDA, for newbies and experienced players alike, because they help you understand aspects of the game more passively (seeing what is done rather than figuring how to do it yourself).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGeneral must-knows on KSP Orbital Map:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022... Encounter\u0022 means you are entering (encountering) its Sphere of Influence, basically its gravitational well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022... Escape\u0022 means the point where you leave the body\u0027s SoI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, you stated a fish hook, and that it gives no periapsis, this means that your orbital trajectory (flight path) is such that you are slowed to 0 by the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn, accelerated towards its surface, where your logical flight ends. However the conical mathematics continue on with the calculations, which results in the Kerbin SoI escape trajectory that is physically impossible to achieve, due to the fact that you smash into the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI recommend the following:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGet up into a 200km parking orbit. Now this must be done at a 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 heading (prograde orbit). Now that you have a prograde orbit just like the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn\u0027s, you must wait until a transfer window (usually every 40 minutes) opens for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn would be about 2/9ths behind the intercept your burning for when your planning. This means if your a rocket expert you could just launch on a KSC-to-M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn path, but that has many more variables associated (like the slowness of the ascent). Anyways, because you are going for a mun intercept in a prograde orbit, you can easily insert yourself in either a prograde or retrograde orbit around the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn, there isn\u0027t too much of a difference, it just denotes the direction of the orbit (like going from west to east or east to west).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe best way to do this is to put yourself on a slingshot: make sure that you get the Kerbin Escape circle as well as a M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn Periapsis. You can fine tune your periapsis on your way there, but for now aim for your wanted periapsis allowing 50km error.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe trick to this injection is that with just 1000 m/s dV you can insert yourself into Munar orbit, because the injection burn at Kerbin costs roughly 800 m/s and the braking burn at the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn costs a lot less, usually around 200 m/s. If you wish to have a polar or inclined orbit, perform the same steps, but your parking orbit has to be inclined from the start to be the most fuel efficient, and think ahead: take into account your ground position and the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn\u0027s position, in order to get a transfer window sooner (as your on different orbital planes). Inclination can also be performed in transit from a regular equatorial injection.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wijbrandus","CreatedById":62681,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-03T19:05:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk thanks for the tips.
