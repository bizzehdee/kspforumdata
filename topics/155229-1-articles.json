But then I thought modding could be the answer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 Sadly I don\u0027t know how to code so I can\u0027t make this work, that\u0027s why I\u0027m here requesting this.

These should be able to fly the ship even when communication is not possible and you would be able to control the ship as if there were living astronauts there, of course at the cost of a greater consumption of electric charge to \u0022keep the complex software running\u0022 and the A.I. \u0022concious\u0022. The A.I. would also not be able to EVA, since they are just \u0022software\u0022 inside the probe core. Not sure if crew reports should be allowed.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-left:120px;text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#696969;\u0022\u003Eexample of menu:\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-left:120px;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022rk1EmW2.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022561\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rk1EmW2.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-left:120px;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#696969;\u0022\u003E\u00A0 Building on that idea would be the option to transfer them around the ship, so they can go from one core to the other, giving more freedom when it comes to in which probe core the A.I. is at, as well as the possibility of more than one A.I. pilot in a single core for the larger models.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-left:120px;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#696969;\u0022\u003E\u00A0 And a more advanced idea would be allowing kerbals to transfer them around and carry them in a \u0022inert\u0022 form and store them just like science experiments if needed. \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-left:120px;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-left:120px;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#696969;\u0022\u003E\u00A0 As for tech tree stuff, prices, etc. I usually just play sandbox, so I have no experience with that and how to balance it, but I imagine this should something pretty advanced tech wise and probably very expensive as well, so just not caring about the A.I. and letting them \u0022die\u0022 out there would be a huge waste of money compared to recovering/rescuing them. \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-left:120px;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#696969;\u0022\u003E\u00A0 And for their portrait and reaction to flying the rocket (just like the kerbals react in them), I\u0027m not sure. I\u0027m not experienced with animating in 3D, specially for KSP but I could experiment with it if instructed on what to do. Would be cool to have a neon glowey digital face there to remind us that it\u0027s not just a probe.

On it\u0027s own, this would make so you can use just probe cores for missions out of communication reach. Allowing for the same type of control for less mass and less volume since the probe cores are smaller than the command pods and cockpits.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-left:120px;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#696969;\u0022\u003E\u00A0 Now if used with a life support mod, since the A.I. pilots are not biological they would only need electrical charge to \u0022survive\u0022, while astronauts need water, oxygen, food and produce waste, CO2, etc.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-left:120px;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#696969;\u0022\u003E\u00A0 The balancing of that should come with the extra batteries necessary to keep them \u0022concious\u0022 or active.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 I have no idea of how hard this might be so I would be happy with just being able to put a soul in my unmanned ships, but any addition from there would be even better if possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 Now if a similar thing already exists and works on the current version, I would love to download it, even if it\u0027s not exactly what I described here, as long as the focus is the A.I. pilots being their own entity like the kerbonauts and not just a part that you add to control the ship where there is no communication.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 If anything I\u0027m just happy to share this idea and even if someone takes it, as long as it gets done, I don\u0027t really care about credit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
