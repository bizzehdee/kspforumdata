It\u0027s just that the fuel has to be kept cold in the tank, so it doesn\u0027t evaporate and leak out before the engine gets a chance to burn it.\n\nSeparate tech nodes for cryo *tanks* would make more sense IMO.  But it\u0027d be a little at odds with the current setup where any tank (even stock ones) can be cooled for cryo fuel, and the special tanks in this mod just do it more efficiently.  Maybe there could be a mod which removes the cooling feature from generic tanks, and moves the special cryo tanks into a separate branch of the tech tree.\n\nOn a related note: the latest release of CryoTanks includes a [balance change that I recently submitted](https://github.com/ChrisAdderley/CryoTanks/pull/79).  It used to be that the placement of the special cryo tanks in the tech tree was a little haphazard, with nearly half of them in \u0022nuclear propulsion\u0022 though they\u0027re not nuke-specific, and the others starting at a similarly high tech level and grouped together in just a few nodes.  With the change, each cryo tank is one tech tier above the corresponding generic tank, which makes the small ones available earlier and pushes a few of the big ones up to higher tiers.  So now they have the same size progression as the stock tanks, but shifted upward one tier to represent the engineering challenge of putting cryo insulation on a tank of a given size."},{"CreatedByName":"TBenz","CreatedById":190349,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-03T07:15:54Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 3 hours ago, Wyzard said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Separate tech nodes for cryo *tanks* would make more sense IMO.
