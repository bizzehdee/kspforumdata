I put a launch clamp on the solid booster as well, and used some struts to help support the booster. That worked fine. It was kind of like this (top view)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eo===OOOOO===o\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(it\u0027s actualy built in 8x symetry, one O tank in the middle, 4 around it, then 8 around the outside, in 8 symetry from the center. Sorry I don\u0027t have any pics handy.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problems came when I put a solid booster on either side of that one (shown on the left booster, but I did it to the right one as well):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eo \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eo===OOOOO===o\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eo \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs soon as I got it on the launch pad, some of the new boosters would just fall off as soon as the physics kicked in. I added struts galore, holding the side ones to the middle one, and to the closest fuel tank, and they\u0027d still fall off just as frequently. I even tried separating the 3 solid boosters with the tiny truss pieces (and tons of struts), but they still would just fall off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there something I\u0027m not understanding? Are direct booster-to-booster connections really weak or something? I\u0027ve stuck boosters on the side of big orange tanks before, without having them just fall off, so I don\u0027t understand what\u0027s going on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a rather... large... ship. A bit over 800 parts (I can see the jaws dropping and heads shaking from here), but I was able to run it at around 4 FPS on my new gaming rig, so what the heck. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Moar Boosters","CreatedById":79218,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-13T20:40:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think booster - booster connections are pretty weak. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the problem also comes from having stuff too far away from the main core. When the physics kick in, each joint flexes a little bit. If you have a bunch of pieces like this --------0--------- those movements will amplify as they move away from the central core, so the ones at the end take a really big jolt when the physics kick in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally I wouldn\u0027t bother with solid boosters if you need that many. Instead of using 3 boosters on each section, build your own liquid booster. You can chose the right engine/tank combo which has the right amount of power, it\u0027ll make the structure more stable and it\u0027s only 2 parts instead of the 3 solid boosters, which will obviously help if you\u0027re building massive rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BubbaWilkins","CreatedById":57993,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-13T20:45:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf what your saying is you have a giant pancake of solid boosters on 8x symmetry. Then yes, you appear to be having structural failure. Even if you managed to get it to stay together on the launch pad, I expect that it was pull itself apart the moment you launched it. those side connections are pretty weak and usually you\u0027ll not want to extend out from the core engine/tank more than one ring of boosters.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Diazo","CreatedById":81549,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-13T20:52:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf pieces are falling apart on the pad, you will probably have problems in flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, to at least to the flight part, you can use the launch gantries to minimize how much flex there is when the physics kicks in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ED.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lewisd","CreatedById":66947,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-13T21:39:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Diazo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Diazo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHowever, to at least to the flight part, you can use the launch gantries to minimize how much flex there is when the physics kicks in.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have launch gantries attached to each of the boosters on the trusses, just not to the ones right beside them, and the ones beside them keep falling off.
