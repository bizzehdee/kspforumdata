My only problem is completely killing horizontal velocity. I can get the first part of the descent to have no horizontal velocity, but then I began descending, and I reduce my speed every so often, and the horizontal velocity increases. So my question is, how do I never have horizontal velocity on the way down?

When you are high above surface, relative velocity is small. Lower you get, relative velocity increases. You have to counter it by angling thrust vector to not only lower your ship, but also to stay over one spot on the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rpayne88","CreatedById":58336,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-27T19:31:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIts from the rotation of Minmus. I\u0027m assuming your killing all horizontal velocity in orbit and letting yourself fall to the surface. The easiest way to land is to follow the retrograde vector all the way down. Complete a de-orbit burn. The wider the suborbital arc, the more efficient your landing will be as you will be left with very little vertical velocity to kill. It takes practice to get right, but if you follow the vector, you will land with zero horizontal velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"N_Molson","CreatedById":63688,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-27T19:32:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure I\u0027m completely getting it, but one of the best way to kill horizontal velocity is to keep your ship pointed to the retrograde marker (the circle with a cross on the ADI ball). On Minmus you need to apply a very tiny amount of thrust, else you\u0027ll also kill all your vertical velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EElse just fly the lander like an helicopter.
