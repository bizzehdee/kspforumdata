By measuring atmospheric pressure on Duna you would be able to predict the drag,\u00A0thus the landing site of your spacecraft, or research an electric propeller that could work in Dunian conditions. By measuring the magnetic field of the body you would know if it\u0027s possible to survive on the surface, or not.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut experiments in KSP were never meant to be like that. That\u0027s why the best way to repurpose the experiments would be to simply make them yield\u00A0reputation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet\u0027s take a real life example: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_(rover)\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMER Opportunity\u003C/a\u003E. It\u0027s made of metal parts (made by a Boeing team, I believe)\u00A0and it\u0027s being driven by the rover team. It uncovers the mysteries of martian geology, so there is another team that benefits from it: the geologists. (I\u00A0\u00A0know it\u0027s oversimplified, but so is KSP).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo we have three teams: the rover builders, the rover drivers and the geologists.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, who benefits the most from what Opportunity is doing? That\u0027s right, it\u0027s the geologists. The problem is there is no geologist team in KSP. We only have the builders (R\u0026amp;D and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E) and the drivers (the player in-flight). Because of the lack of \u0022the geologists\u0022 the science system is oversimplified, which causes all sorts of balancing problems (science points used to research more parts in R\u0026amp;D). It\u0027s always either too grindy or too easy to unlock the whole tech tree, or you fly a half-assed spacecraft just to unlock proper building materials (parts).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo to sum up: experiments are really useless in a game about spaceflight where you don\u0027t get to do analysis of the data. The devs introduced science points simply to give purpose to the experiment parts. The truth is you don\u0027t even need them to fly your spacecraft in real life, but you do in KSP (R\u0026amp;D research)\u00A0which breaks the game and makes it really hard to balance. That\u0027s why there were so many science\u00A0tweaks in the past and why the parts are being moved around the tech tree all the time (even in 1.2). If we really want the experiments to stay in the game it would be best to have them repurposed as just another reputation source, because using them to research more parts makes zero sense and is hard to balance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: Another way to achieve this\u00A0would be introducing\u00A0some sort of Science Team Building (I know it sounds kinda ridiculous) which would receive\u00A0the data from science experiments and\u00A0analyze it over time producing a steady output\u00A0of reputation. \u0022What does science have to do with reputation?\u0022, you might ask.\u00A0Don\u0027t these scientific organizations, like NASA, JAXA, ESA or SETI like to brag about what they\u0027ve discovered and what they are working on right now on Facebook, Twitter and other media? They very much do. It\u0027s just how PR works. You need good PR to gain good reputation if you are a national space agency.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut this^^^ would\u00A0be too time-consuming IMO.

I\u0027ve not read the entire thread (just the first and last page) so forgive me if anything I\u0027m about to mention has already been discussed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy thoughts on career mode:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGoing from what was described in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Original Post(er). The first post in a thread, or the person who posted it.\u0022\u003EOP\u003C/abbr\u003E, for additional ways to fund your space program we could retain a form of contracts. Specifically, I was thinking that we could have (optional) launch contracts where you\u0027re given a pre-assembled\u00A0payload that you need to get into a specific (reasonable) orbit (and eventually to other planets), kind of like what commercial companies like SpaceX do. To prevent this from degenerating into the current satellite contracts, the orbits would need to be reasonable and the payloads varied enough that there would be some challenge to completing them, plus enough of a payout to make them worth the time. The payloads could be chosen based on the player\u0027s tech level, starting with small communication satellites up to several hundred ton interplanetary vessels. The rationale behind this is that sometimes I enjoy building lifters just for the fun of it and end up slapping together a dummy payload just to have something (usually ridiculous) for my lifter to put into orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConversely\u00A0to reduce the tedium of launches, maybe there could be a system where you can pay a fee based on the size/weight/desired orbit of one of your craft to have someone else launch it for you. Maybe have a requirement that you must have launched a payload at least as big/heavy to the same orbit at least once before to unlock the ability to pay someone else to do it for you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother career idea I\u0027ve seen floated from time to time is the idea of a rival space agency. That could be an interesting mechanic, especially if you had to compete with them for world-first contracts (random side thought: world-first achievements should give rep, not funds, especially if our funding is rep based). How quickly they achieve things could be part of the difficulty settings, and they could launch their own missions so you would see their craft from time to time. Something like KCT would be essential for balancing this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdditionally, I\u0027ve really enjoyed playing through the anomaly explorer contract pack in the past, and a cleverly set up sequence of increasingly difficult \u0022story\u0022 missions could make career mode much more interesting as well. These could be set up so that the player can choose to ignore them and run their own space program if desired. This is not a new idea (NovaSilisko originally intended the Duna SSTV easter egg to be part of a \u0022story mode\u0022 back when he was still a dev), but I think it would go a long ways to providing an overarching goal for career mode beyond exploring just for the sake of exploring. To improve replayability, the anomaly locations for the story missions could be randomly chosen when a new game is started so you actually have to go hunt for them instead of just getting the coordinates from a guide.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother random thought: instead of removing science points entirely, use them simply as a score counter in addition to the other experiment changes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother thing that isn\u0027t mentioned in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Original Post(er). The first post in a thread, or the person who posted it.\u0022\u003EOP\u003C/abbr\u003E but is still utterly broken in stock is the astronaut training. Training should cost funds and take some time, not magically happen because a Kerbal touched the Mun. Also, when hiring astronauts, they come with different levels of training based in your reputation (high reputation means more skilled astronauts are applying), and skilled astronauts cost more to hire initially. This would need to be balanced against the cost of training a less skilled astronaut. The skills also need to be rethought. For example, all engineers should be able to fix\u00A0things regardless of their level, but an experienced engineer might be able to do it more quickly and possibly provide an operating bonus by making small tweaks to improve efficiency during flight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyways, just a few thoughts I\u0027ve had.

The REP hit would increase dramatically with increased spending, so if you blow the bank on a single launch, you feel the consequences. Launching the craft and getting it into space, on the other hand, would net you a REP bonus, which would be dependent on how much payload you\u0027ve taken to orbit (how much of the rocket reaches a stable orbit), and the mass of the craft in the first place, or other factors. So if you build a massive launcher and it fails on the launchpad, you take a hit, but if it manages to get into space, it\u0027s worth it. Additionally, if you launch a small rocket that can get a large amount of mass into orbit, you win!

program, just enough for the last few technologies that they need and as such only achieved 70% of their reputation goals. \u00A0They set Jool as their next ambition.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe receive a budget ration of 7 (-30%) so still collect funds but less of them for the next cycle. \u00A0They\u0027re gambling on one big mission, if the Jool-5 mission pays off they might come back to a booming program with a ration in the 20s, if it fails they\u0027ll likely be broke and have to make do with a tourist service for a couple cycles to get back on their feet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExample 3:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe player has set a Mun program but flown nothing. \u00A0They\u0027ve changed their reputation by 0 or negative numbers (reputation decay). \u00A0No rockets were built, no kerbals were hired, the player simply warped through the entire period. \u00A0The funds ration is set to 0 for the next cycle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf this is done because the player is warping through their transit out to Plock then the lost funds won\u0027t matter because the successful Plock mission will bring in a whole lot when it\u0027s finished. \u00A0If this is done to try to \u0022game\u0022 the funds screen it becomes clear that it won\u0027t work but begins rewarding the player again when they start using them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThoughts?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"John
