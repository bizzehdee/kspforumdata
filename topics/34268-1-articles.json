KARL needs you to transport the finest of Kerbal racing vehicles to the most scenic landscapes in the system, where brave Kerbals will race for glory and a large cash prize, thanks to our sponsors. It\u0027s your job to transport the vehicles to your planet of choice, and set up the racing track. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERules: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) At least 4 cars must be present for a race, in close enough proximity to each other for a picture. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Cars must be manned by one Kerbal each, in an external chair\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) You must set up some manner of race course, either by placing objects to drive around, or however else seems logical to you. If you can justify it in the description, it\u0027s good enough. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) The race course must have some sort of defined start/finish line. This can be a flat object in the roadway, or two beacons placed side by side- whatever makes sense to you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Mods are allowed, but cheating is not. Kerbal challenges should be fun, not exercises in rules lawyering. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) Get some good shots of the race!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7) You can use whatever launch vehicles you want, or however many you want. Whatever works and makes you happy. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8) If there\u0027s not a rule against it, and it isn\u0027t douchey, you can do it. (I swear every time I make one of these, like 30 people ask for clarifications on little nuances of the rules, rather than just getting in there and having fun with it.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScoring:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1pt for each car transported safely, up to a max of 40 (as in still race-worthy after it lands)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1pt for each car safely returned to Kerbin after the race (score not modified)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1-10pts for racetrack setup, car coolness, and general epicness of the photoshoot, based purely on my subjective judgment. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2pts for having a comm sat in orbit around the planet you choose so the Kerbals back home can watch the race in HD. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModifiers:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ex0.1 for Kerbin\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ex1 for the Mun or Minmus\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ex2 for Duna, Ike, Eve, or Gilly\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ex3 for Moho, Laythe, Bop, or Pol\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ex4 for Dres or Eeloo\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ex5 for Vall\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ex6 for Tylo\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you hold the race on multiple planets with the same cars and equipment, you get to add your scores together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s my crappy proof of concept (there\u0027s a fourth car on the Mun, but I forgot to grab enough kerbals before I left like a moron, so I\u0027m going to have to send a second vessel). By happy accident I landed right next to the arch, which formed a delightful start/finish line. Track setup is still in-progress. I\u0027ll make a much sexier attempt when I have a little more time over the next week. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WIxLw69.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022WIxLw69.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ypFbdl7.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ypFbdl7.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/E0RwRyL.png\u0022 alt=\u0022E0RwRyL.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kamsko","CreatedById":59669,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-22T12:02:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENow THIS is a challenge I can get behind.
