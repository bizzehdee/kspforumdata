I have absolutely no clue. At its core, if CollisionFX caused sparks to fly when rolling over other non-static objects, then it\u0027s very likely that DustFX does as well. I am not completely sure of this, however, as I have done very little testing in non-planetary collisions. I have a feeling that it might not throw up dust on those objects though, since I seem to remember stripping some of the old CollisionFX code for detecting dynamic object collisions and such. I\u0027ll need to go dig through the old code vs. the new to know for sure without simply testing it. Dust really shouldn\u0027t be emitting from solid objects like those.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHey lo-fi, I have a question. The camera color grabber uses tiny little screenshots, and I noticed something in the code that pertains to saving an image somewhere. Does this mean that, technically, the game is taking tons of miniature screenshots and possibly saving them to disk? If so, are these screenshots then building up in the screenshot output folder and clogging the disk? I ask this without having actually tried it out myself, I\u0027m just curious.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-27T18:17:14Z\u0022 title=\u002206/27/2015 06:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Gaalidas\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
