Each piece is ejected at differing velocities in the prograde direction. Is there some setting that I\u0027m not using correctly? I\u0027ve got the main module on docking ship but no lazers. Any suggestions?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESet the loading distance in the LazorPowered menu to default. That should fix this issue. I might actually have it set to default, err, by default as it is only the missile systems that require more range.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bigmos","CreatedById":64963,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-13T23:11:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI cant get the vector angles to show up when trasfering to a diff planet ???\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Romfarer","CreatedById":20387,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-13T23:16:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022bigmos\u0022 data-cite=\u0022bigmos\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI cant get the vector angles to show up when trasfering to a diff planet ???\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethey will only show up when your orbit is more or less circular, beyond a certain point, they won\u0027t have any meaning anyways so they are removed then\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DoggyGuy","CreatedById":57292,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-14T21:57:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI cant download anything from the spaceport. any chance of a mirror?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Canopus","CreatedById":57774,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-16T07:07:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow do i turn the Kerbal laser on and off?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"brians200","CreatedById":26572,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-16T11:59:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Canopus\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Canopus\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHow do i turn the Kerbal laser on and off?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClick the circle next to Lazor in the top right corner.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mJD4KAY.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022mJD4KAY.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"iKon","CreatedById":66449,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-16T15:58:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve seriously problem with this plugin... I mean I installed this as manual says, the game is launching but I dont see any GUI, dont see any Lazors part, except some small and big white laser, but this part dont do anything... No other parts are inside game like sunbeam, laser guided missles, cams... All other mods like ship parts works perfect, but have also problem with MechJeb. I tried to reinstall game couple times and nothing. Also I tried to install KSP and this plugin on other computers and there was same problem.
