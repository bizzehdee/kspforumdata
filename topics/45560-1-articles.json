However, I now want to try making a youtube channel. I tried downloading FRAPS for free but it only records 30 seconds at a time. Which was enough for my shuttle to get to 5K meters? tops.... Does anyone know of a way to record it easily without spending the 40$ required by FRAPS to do long recordings. Thank you for your help. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS.
