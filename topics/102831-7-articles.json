I think I see it again though.\n\nSeparatrons have 8/8 fuel right? BUT Separatron with 1/8 fuel has a much higher TWR than a separatron with 8/8 fuel.\n\nIf you were to asparagus them, you would have all the fuel from the outside layer be transferred to the inside layer... but you could also just lower the fuel in the outside layer (idk, burn it off?) to increase the outside layer\u0027s TWR which increases the TWR of the system as a whole.\n\nBasically, asparagus without pumps. Instead of pumping fuel inwards, you just have smaller and smaller tanks outwards."}]}
