However, I have been to most game I want to play (Half Life 2, Portal 1 and 2, Counter Strike Source, Mirror\u0027s Edge), with some tweaking of the settings. As a matter of fact, my troubles were more akin to be linked to running them on a GNU/Linux system (Debian) than to performance issues. Then, despite my repeated and airy efforts to have Mirror\u0027s Edge running, I finally accepted to install an inferior Operating System (Windows Seven) alongside my true setup. This parenthesis explains that I am arguably a power user an that KSP is not the first game I have to deal with on my config.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is why I do know that, in this instance, most of the issues I have met must be due to incompatibility and performance limitations. Nonetheless, I shall a few of the ones I encountered (notice that this is not a bug report, but if developers or other players are interested, I would be glad to discuss or investigate them).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003Ethe game won\u0027t run soundly on Linux: the native version will run, but the renderer will become pitch black after loading some sounds right when the log file display that the game requested a resizing (for any configuration, LC_ALL=C won\u0027t help); \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Ethe Windows version ran through Wine will work (yay! just got it to) or have the renderer freeze depending on the configuration; \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EI experience regular bugs where the game becomes unplayable and need to be restarted entirely: switched to nothing, Kerbin texture glitching causing ship to completely explode even at low speed (after having manually deployed all chutes), high speed explosions virtually freezing the game (I don\u0027t have an indicator but probably around 0.05 FPS), quickload unusable before restart (in these situation going back to Space Center will display a blue circular figure (center of Kerbin I guess) instead and clicking on a building will either fail or get me to another blocked situation); \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Eunstable orbits (almost circular orbits will have their periapsis and apoapsis moving randomly, orbital period in Engineer Redux won\u0027t have stable least significant digits either); \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Ean asteroid I approached started warping around (usually going along its orbit, and at some point teleporting back to where it used to be); \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Ea very specific bug at the KSC: the light green area wobbles over the dark green area when I move the camera \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/Cilph/RemoteTech2/issues/189\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eduplication bug\u003C/a\u003E. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom what I understand, the launch problem is due to compatiblity issues from my video card and the unstable or warping stuff may be due to unsufficient float precision in the internal registers of my video card (depending how KSP internally works). Because the game is usually able to gracefully exit, I don\u0027t have much crash report or error logs to post. It turns out that some memory dumps have appeared in the KSP folder in the last few days, but I do not to which bug they are related (I have to restart fairly often and do not track their date and time).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, that was for the negative stuff. I had quite a lot of bugs but I know that the game is still in the development process. Moreover, the fact that I am still playing despite all this really shows how much interesting this game can be.
