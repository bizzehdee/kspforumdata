I don\u0027t really want to debate the merits or shortcomings of Curse but I think its telling that the community continually seeks ways to circumvent it. I understand Squad is primarily focused on the core game play, but it would be remiss to assume they receive no value from the modding community in general. Consider all of the product quality testing, game design and even talent acquisition they have gained from such a robust and active community.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat being said, i feel like modding support, especially the repository and mod managers (like CKAN) deserve a little more \u0022official\u0022 attention and support from Squad. The mods in the game really make it something special and many users, including myself, would not have devoted so much time and attention if it weren\u0027t for all the great mods. Having about 50 mods installed in my current career save, its vitally important that we have some way to manage all these add-ons. I hope that at some point in the not-so-distant future, Squad picks this up and helps to implement an official mod manager and repository, so both mod developers and mod users are able to focus more time on development/game-play and less on mod management and implementation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-17T21:53:46Z\u0022 title=\u002202/17/2016 09:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 17, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Dudicus\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eedit: a word.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Juanfro","CreatedById":61552,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-17T21:53:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCurse at this moment is not a mod repository, it is a bucket where mods are stored, meanwhile spacedock \u002B CKAN is better and similar to what Spaceport 2 could have been.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat happens when spacedock runs out of fuel and nobody wants to keep it alive in exchange of a handful of kudos?

Curseforge is not as open as KS was, so it wasn\u0027t able to integrate well with CKAN. I definitely got a boost from configuring my mod OPM for use with CKAN, so I think this will help SpaceDock adoption the most.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPersonally, as a mod dev, I think both any\u00A0KS replacement and Curseforge need to work most on mod discovery. It doesn\u0027t necessarily need to be about the amount of mods. It needs to be about being able to find any sort of mod. The best way to stay up-to-date on cool mods, large and small, is still the forum. It\u0027s a bit crazy that someone who checks the mod forums daily still can find small mods that did something super cool two months ago and have since been abandoned because two people downloaded it. This is in part I think because of two omissions:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nNot enough categories. At this point any mod repository needs to have categories for planet packs, realistic mods, etc. We shouldn\u0027t have to put anything that doesn\u0027t fit within the standard framework of KSP in Misc or Gameplay if it\u0027s become popular enough.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nNot enough time period selection. If you want to stay up-to-date with mods, you basically have to watch the forum because there\u0027s no popularity category for the last week, month, etc. All-time popularity categories are very much useless for keeping up to date, because no mods can get into that within a short period. So anything that\u0027s hot and heavy, people need to discover through Reddit or the forum, which are\u00A0above the level of KSP interest of many.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"godarklight","CreatedById":92588,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-17T22:10:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo make it clear, I personally don\u0027t oppose curse, nor are we trying to destroy it or anything silly like that\u00A0- that\u0027s not what spacedock is about to me and\u00A0others from the spacedock team.

The reason for this lies in the history of the website\u2019s creation: it was developed specifically to be an unofficial, independent alternative to the official mod repository. Curse provided, and still provides, a stable platform for uploading mods and other ingame content, and we have no reason to end our partnership with them. Because of those two arguments, we never explored the possibility of making KerbalStuff the \u2018official\u2019 mod repository. At this time similar arguments can be made for other community initiatives, such as KerbalX, CKAN or the KSP Subreddit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEventually I gave up, but I believe I made it very clear that Squad\u0027s choice to support Curse and continue supporting Curse over Kerbal Stuff was the wrong choice and that I wanted to seal the deal and make Kerbal Stuff official. I had also reached out to them in the past and offered things like admin positions on the site for KSP staff. Kerbal Stuff wasn\u0027t developed to be an \u0022unofficial, independent alternative\u0022, it was developed because Curse sucked and I wanted to make something better available.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-cite=\u0022\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly, but perhaps most importantly, was the accusation that we threatened the website with legal action. We would like to stress that no such thing happened. Back in 2014 when the website was being developed we were in the process of acquiring a trademark on the word Kerbal, and part of the obligations one has as a trademark holder is to investigate possible infringements of your trademark. Failure to do so may invalidate the trademark entirely at a later point. To this end we talked to the people behind Kerbalstuff to determine what the website was going to be, and several scenarios were discussed briefly including possibly renaming KerbalStuff. As it was to be a non-commercial community website it quickly became clear that no legal action was warranted against KerbalStuff, and we never pursued legal action against Kerbalstuff or any other community website for using the phrase Kerbal in its name. We\u2019re thankful that Sircmpwn has since retracted this part of the statement from the Kerbalstuff website, but we\u2019ve received a lot of questions about it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI misspoke when I originally used the words \u0022legal action\u0022 in my public letter, and have since edited it after KasperVld reached out and pointed out that it could be misread. I never saw letters from lawyers, but there was a discussion that I felt very threatened about. I was *told* to change the name - it wasn\u0027t an open dialogue. There were several weeks of arguing back and forth about this, followed by a long period of silence that was never properly resolved. I never heard the words \u0022you can use Kerbal in the name\u0022 from Squad, even after bringing the matter back up several times. The discussion was hostile.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- - -\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d still like to let this die. My feelings from the original letter still stand - maintaining Kerbal Stuff is a burden that went unnoticed and unappreciated from both Squad and the community. I will extend a warm \u0022thank you\u0022 to the hundreds of players who have emailed me words of late thanks and encouragement, and a cold \u0022love you\u0022 to the dozens of players who emailed me rude and spiteful comments, but the decision remains final. A lot of people have also suggested donations - none of this is because of money. I can afford to host Kerbal Stuff very easily. Thanks, though, honestly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpaceDock has my blessing. I have also given them a copy of the database (all personal info removed). Hopefully they can meet your modding needs in the future so no one has to deal with the awful mess that is Curse. Maybe in the future Squad will even reconsider their choice to support Curse and go with the superior alternative? Time will tell.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-17T22:23:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222415758\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022132343\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221455747454\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022112036\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SirCmpwn\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 minutes ago, SirCmpwn said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA bunch of good\u00A0stuff.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d just like to say thank you for dedicating so much time and money on it. \u00A0I will miss Kerbal Stuff, but I understand why you shut it down. \u00A0A lot of people don\u0027t understand the cost of running it. \u00A0Again, thank you for all of the time you put into it. \u00A0Many people are upset that it\u0027s gone, and I am, too, but I think it was the right decision. \u00A0We all support you here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jkortech","CreatedById":146934,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-17T22:27:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222415707\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022132343\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221455746162\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002240700\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KasperVld\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n26 minutes ago, KasperVld said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith all due respect, I\u0027m aware that a part of the community has opposed and still opposes Curse.

At the time, and still today, I did not feel that Curse would do right by the kommunity. I stepped up to build an alternative that would be much better than the mess Curse would provide. I built Kerbal Stuff to do right by the kommunity where Squad wouldn\u0027t.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI opened up a beta and got some modders on board, and Kerbal Stuff was very well received. It\u0027s fair to say that Kerbal Stuff decisively won the battle over Curse, providing hosting for nearly \u003Ci\u003Edouble\u003C/i\u003E the number of mods. It boils down to Kerbal Stuff simply being better at it. Kerbal Stuff had no ads for its entire lifetime, emailed users when their mods updated, and cared more about the modders and the players.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUndoubtedly Kerbal Stuff has had a direct impact on Squad\u0027s revenue - how many players must have hopped back into Kerbal Space Program after getting an email about their favorite mod receiving an update?
