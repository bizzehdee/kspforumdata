They ALREADY have a 1:4 Thrust scaling and a 1:4 TWR nerf (so, they have 1/4th the Thrust and 4 times the mass for the Thrust as in real life) with the stats I\u0027ve been aiming for, and are thus nigh-worthless as launch-engines (and only useful as upper stage and orbital engines).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENerfing the TWR again will further restrict their function to only acting as orbital engines. \u003Cstrong\u003EYou have to look at the function an engine\u0027s stats make it useful for when balancing parts, rather than simply looking at numbers.\u003C/strong\u003E In the case of the Particle Bed Reactors, they were already quite marginal as launch-stage engines in real life (real chemical rockets produce more than 4x the thrust for a comparable diameter, and have 4x the TWR) to begin with- and the nerfs I\u0027m already OK with (keeping the mass high and only imitating real-world Thrust) really limit them to only being useful as upper stages- where a stage TWR of 0.5 might be acceptable, for instance.

For myself, and most new or more passive/careful players (I mostly hang around in LEO and make an occasional Mun landing for a great deal of the game), just unlocking Nuclear Engines at all is a MAJOR achievement. The fact that in CTT it requires an *ADDITIONAL* tech-node after that is a MAJOR obstacle. It shouldn\u0027t be necessary to nerf the performance because of when the part becomes available- by the time players get to a Particle Bed Reactor (and in the case of a new player, figure out how to manage their WasteHeat) they will already be hungry for higher-performing engines than the stock NERVA- especially if they are playing with any realism mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd when the stock aero gets revised, radially-mounted NERVA engines will become *MUCH* more difficult to get to orbit than they are now- due to the destabilizing effects of having a lot of drag on the payload stage of your rocket... Players will be eager to replace a pair of radial NERVA engines with a single stack-mounted Particle Bed Reactor, which with my more *REALISTIC* stats (still 1/4th the TWR of real life, but not 1/8th like you seem to be considering) will only produce about 50% more thrust than a radially-mounted pair of NERVA\u0027s...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022FreeThinker\u0022 data-cite=\u0022FreeThinker\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ETrue, but I would like to see a logical technological progression, we I need a good answer to the question what the upgrade path should be.

So, none of this should be an issue. And the tech-progression of having Timberwind-like performance come 1 tech node after NERVA\u0027s *IS* logical. I don\u0027t think you get how long that tech node will really take most average players to unlock...

These nodes require me to pay funds to unlock some of the parts (which I didn\u0027t have to do prior to updating KSPI). After paying for them, they function ok. The only problem is that the game doesn\u0027t seem to understand that I\u0027ve already unlocked the upgraded graphene radiators and better generators, so I can only build ships with the pre-upgraded stuff and can\u0027t change to the new KTEC generators. As the nodes in question are already unlocked, I can\u0027t see how I\u0027m supposed to \u0022unlock\u0022 these again :/ This is currently the choice that is working the best out of all of them, but as it severely limits my usage of nuclear power, it\u0027s still far from correct. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/AZwVLoL.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/AZwVLoL.jpg\u003C/a\u003E \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat am I doing wrong?
