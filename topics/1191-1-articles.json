I tend to dislike mods and other addons that aren\u0027t vanilla and instead prefer to try being creative with what we\u0027re given from the get-go. Is there, say, a velocity competition?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan\u0027t wait for updates!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-29T14:10:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the KSP Forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are several posts where people have made up contests with rules like vanilla parts only.
