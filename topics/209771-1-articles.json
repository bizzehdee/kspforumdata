Whenever a part (such as the Mk1 Command Module) that contains the DangIt! resource \u0022Spare Parts\u0022 is in the scene, the framerate in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E (not in flight, as far as I\u0027ve observed) drops in linear fashion with the amount of the culprit parts. I checked the Github repository for the mod and it\u0027s apparently been an open issue since 2021. Any help on how to fix this would be greatly appreciated, as it could help others enjoy this great mod.
