First, there dont seem to be any connectors that can let me drop the rocket plane without the connector remaining attached to the X-15. I want my X-15 to be free of attached debris when it is released. How can I do this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, I put a person in the cockpit of the X15, but when i release it, his picture disappears. i can still control the plane but i cannot see him and cannot switch to interrior view. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-02T03:39:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo solve the debris issue you could invert the structural pylon (the one that separates from the wing) by using WASDQE in the SPH. This would cause the part that separates to be attached to your X-15 while the part that doesn\u0027t stays attached to the plane. As far as the other issue I really have no idea, possible bug?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
