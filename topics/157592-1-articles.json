Some of these mods are really hard to learn as it is, and I have found that non stock parts sometimes wont freeze their menu when right clicking, disabling my ability to scroll, making it impossible to look at the functions of that part. I hope they get something like that worked out, or a mod that will do the same thing. That would be amazing, as this is driving me crazy having to google mod parts functions every time I forget something. Thanks, let me know if anyone has ran into this problem, as I havent been able to find many complaining about this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-15T19:04:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E has something like that.
