The ship should start leaning forward, press S to slow it down until it hits the tower (or right before you hit it) then launch the first stage. The rocket will try and flip backwards, so hit W and be ready to spam Q and E because it will want to roll (more than likely to the right for some reason). One of the landing legs will probably break off; press space again to detach them even if they manage to stay on. If you can get into the air without losing anything other than the landing legs, congratulations. Now you just have to fight with it a little bit to get it where you want, then turn on SAS. Any time you need to make adjustments, try to do them in small increments or the ship will try to roll around and get out of control. I\\\u0027ve been trying to get it as stable as possible, but for now I\\\u0027m happy with it. If you have any suggestions to improve the ship, I would be ecstatic to get advice from rocket scientists like yourselves \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know a video would have been much easier, but I have dial up. :\\\u0027(\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProtip: Try to avoid letting the nose dip too far.
