I play on a re-sized system 3.7x SO orbital velocity is ~4500m/s. I want the flame FX to start as soon or with a 1-3km of entering the atmosphere. I don\u0027t know the variable relationship so I have no idea where to raise or lower it and what effect that will ave advice to greatly appreciated? Thanks!"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T22:56:45Z","Content":"The lower it is, the higher the flames will start.\n\nDensity is almost always less than 1 kg/m^2, so a \u003C1 exponent will increase it."},{"CreatedByName":"Svm420","CreatedById":136047,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T23:13:50Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The lower it is, the higher the flames will start.\n\u003E Density is almost always less than 1 kg/m^2, so a \u003C1 exponent will increase it.\n\nThank you!

I play at 4x scale so orbital velocity are roughly half RSS or about 4500m/s and I am trying to turn down the flames for mach 3-5 in the thinner atmosphere 40-70km. I assume the SR-71 was able to fly at mach 3.5 without being engulfed in a ball of plasma entirely right? ![:confused:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-31T01:51:24Z","Content":"Well, it did get fairly toasty, but you\u0027re right about it not being a ball of plasma.\n\nMy solution was to add the functionality to RealHeat, but you may not want totally real shockwave temperatures (or maybe you do, I don\u0027t know). If not for that, maybe somebody could take only the relevant code out of RealHeat?"}]}
