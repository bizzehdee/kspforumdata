It seems I have two options of what I could do. I could make it multiple parts and use connection nodes (that I don\u0027t know how to make), or I could make it one part and use no connection nodes.\u00A0 I am willing to do whatever is easier. All the things I want to have in the craft are, the essentials (fuel, oxidizer, engines, and wings with lift), a small cargo pay, and landing gear. Two of the big things I don\u0027t know how to do are how to make animations that actually change the bounding box of the part like landing gear (I use blender to model the parts), and how to make a cargo bay. I know I\u0027m asking for a lot, but answering even one of these questions is very helpful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"artwhaley","CreatedById":118388,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-28T06:22:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI USED to know the answers to all of your questions.\u00A0 I\u0027ll do what I can to answer some of them.\u00A0 But first I\u0027m going to give the answers to ones you didn\u0027t ask!\u00A0 \u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs the guy who spent months putting the SNC Dreamchaser into the game, I\u0027m going to point out that these sorts of parts that only go together one way to build one ship SORT OF miss the spirit of KSP.\u00A0 Most of the joy in the game comes from the lego approach - building a custom craft for a new mission.\u00A0 \u00A0After I built the dreamchaser...\u00A0 it was really fun to fly it... for a day or two.\u00A0 But then what?\u00A0 And I think most that downloaded it had the same reaction eventually.\u00A0 Oh cool!\u00A0 \u00A0Fun to launch it!\u00A0 \u00A0Takes a few tries to land it.\u00A0 \u00A0Now...\u00A0 nyah.\u00A0 Nothing left to do!\u00A0 \u00A0I know there were some people who do more role play in their KSP that used it as a crew service ship... but...\u00A0 not that many.\u00A0 \u00A0None of that is telling you not to build it.\u00A0 I had so much fun building the Dreamchaser.\u00A0 \u00A0But... if you build it, do it for the fun of making it.\u00A0 \u00A0Not because you want to churn out a popular mod.\u00A0 That\u0027s good advice for ANYTHING you mod though.\u00A0 Do it for you.\u00A0 Don\u0027t chase the forum\u0027s whims.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow, to actually answer some questions.\u00A0 \u00A0There are advantages to cutting it up into pieces.\u00A0 \u00A0Chief among those is the ability to distribute mass, lifting, and control surface numbers to make the thing actually fly in different configurations.\u00A0 Somewhere I\u0027ve got a TERRIBLE little hacky one part rescue shuttle I built...\u00A0 And the only way to make a single part shuttle controllable was to give it an absurdly powerful reaction wheel so I could just ignore silly things like \u0027aerodynamics.\u0027\u00A0 It wasn\u0027t very fun or realistic to fly.\u00A0There are also some things that are tough with a single part - making ailerons move in opposition for example.\u00A0 So I THINK you\u0027ll want it to be multiple parts.\u00A0 Putting attachment nodes between pieces isn\u0027t that hard, and you were going to have to learn to do it anyway to attach the plane to stuff or payloads to the cargo bay, right?\u00A0 \u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor the landing gear and the cargo bay - you just animate the pieces in blender.\u00A0 Then in Unity you name the animation.\u00A0 The collider bounding boxes and wheels are parented to the animated visible pieces, so they move appropriately.\u00A0 \u00A0When you get to the cargo bay...\u00A0 KSP colliders can\u0027t be concave.\u00A0 So instead of making a bowl shaped single collider for the bay, you have to build up the sides and bottoms and doors out of a bunch of simple colliders without hollow areas.\u00A0\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAll that you need to know exists in tutorials...\u00A0 but...\u00A0 we do need to do some tutorial curation.\u00A0 \u00A0At the moment if you google the wrong thing you could find someone doing a fantastic tutorial on how to import models into KSP 0.19, when things HAD to be an fbx, and there was only one way to configure attach nodes, and dinosaurs roamed the mun practically.\u00A0 \u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf you persist at it, feel free to shout with questions.\u00A0 I don\u0027t remember all of the answers but I can try to point you the right ways.\u00A0 Be prepared-\u00A0 between the outdated tutorials and the fact that some things you\u0027ll just have to learn by trial and error there will be frustrations and things you\u0027ll have to do over 4 times.\u00A0 It\u0027ll take a while.\u00A0 But it\u0027s really fun too!\u00A0\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI definitely advise that you START with a few simpler pieces before you get into a full space plane!\u00A0 Make sure you can get a fuel tank and an engine into the game... then tack something bigger!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpannerMonkey(smce)","CreatedById":50907,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-04T13:55:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223329587\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022172748\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221521599495\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022156868\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TheNarwhalArmy\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 3/21/2018 at 2:31 AM, TheNarwhalArmy said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am trying to make a spaceplane mod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223337074\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022172748\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221522218160\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022118388\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022artwhaley\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 3/28/2018 at 7:22 AM, artwhaley said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI definitely advise that you START with a few simpler pieces before you get into a full space plane!\u00A0 Make sure you can get a fuel tank and an engine into the game... then tack something bigger!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll second this , and most of the other related comments.\u00A0 Diving in at the deep end only leads to frustration, dissatisfaction and abandonment ,\u00A0 and trust me\u00A0 a space plane mod and all the bits that go with it , and the other bits you\u0027ll undoubtedly be asked to add, is not on the easy list of my first mod \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s plenty of us here who\u0027ve been exactly where you are now and are happy to help out with advice and examples, don\u0027t be afraid to ask.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd your threads not in the best place to seek such advice, modelling and texturing discussion seems a better venue, and the place you\u0027ll find the answers to a lot of the questions you\u0027ll have\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-04-04T13:56:27Z\u0022 title=\u002204/04/2018 01:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EApril 4, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by SpannerMonkey(smce)\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
