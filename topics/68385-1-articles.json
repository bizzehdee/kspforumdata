I was wondering, I\u0027m a bit new to this aspect of KSP, if there was a way to tweak the asteroid spawning rate and criteria through one of the save files, like the persistence file (not sure if that\u0027s it, just an example) so that say you could turn up the probability or rate of asteroid spawning within the solar system, or maybe tweak the chances of an asteroid being Class A, B or C upon spawning? I\u0027m not sure if any of this is possible, but it so, please tell how. Thanks in advance!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
