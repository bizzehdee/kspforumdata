I think it would be a great help to new players starting off. An option to select tutorial/hits on or off when starting a career mode game should keep this from annoying more advanced players.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also think some quick hints or a short how to science tutorial would be a good idea. I have a brother that also plays KSP that was unaware how to do science until I showed him how. He was not aware that he needed to right click on the pod and EVA Kerbals to bring up the menus to science, as it is not obvious to him he needed to right click these. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe was also unaware of the new hidden recovery button that becomes available after landing a ship. The recovery button is an excellent addition, however a quick tip bubble for that after landing the first time would have been very useful for him and other newer players to make them aware of this feature. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall I have been enjoying 0.22, keep up the great work!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-24T18:00:08Z\u0022 title=\u002210/24/2013 06:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 24, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by meyst\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Ecleaning up wordiness\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
