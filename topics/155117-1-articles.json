In 1.1, it could turn full power at sea level with a velocity of 340 m/s. I re-flew it in 1.2, and it\u0027s wings snap off if turning full power at anything above 170 m/s, even with additional struts to the wings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy question is: was there a change of some sort to aerodynamics between 1.1 and 1.2 that could make it easier for large wings to snap off?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Speeding Mullet","CreatedById":62635,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-17T06:01:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat version precisely are you on as there was a bug in the pre-release I believe and possibly in varying editions of 1.1 and 1.2.x\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/147768-aerodynamics-is-very-unforgiving-now/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Eas per this thread\u003C/a\u003E. \u00A0I couldn\u0027t find anything specific in the changelogs but I believe over all, assuming you are on 1.2.2:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt supersonic speeds a streamlined vessel is now more streamlined, and a non streamlined vessel is now less streamlined over all. \u00A0So either there were aero changes between 1.1 and 1.2.x, or you may have been running a bugged version of 1.1.
