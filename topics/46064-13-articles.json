Whether or not it appears to work with the 0.25 version doesn\u0027t matter to me. Too often in the past I\u0027ve left old DLL support in and it causes problems. The safest way is only support what has been released for current, then if there is a problem I can go to the author.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI might leave toolbar as an option and make the stock default. The problem with two display methods though is you have a fair bit of complexity to keep them from falling over each other and I don\u0027t want to allocate resource for something that isn\u0027t used. If it gets messy toolbar will have to go but I\u0027ll try and keep it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also found the F2 thing the guy from the last page was on about. All mods behave the same way. Go to an in flight vessel and press alt-F2, the entire interface disappears and the debug window pops up. This is a Unity thing (I read the key press documentation yesterday) - it will only tell you a specific key is pressed on the frame that the key went down (or up). So when you hit alt and F2, unless you manage to hit them both within say 20ms of each other the alt will register in one frame and the F2 in another. I wrote some code that tracks shift/alt/cnt modifiers and I can make Fusebox only disappear when F2 is pressed alone. But that makes it behave differently from everything else \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
