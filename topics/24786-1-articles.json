I am using the \u0022Ascent Guidance Launch to Rendezvous: option, and I found it inaccurate, it only puts me around 30km around it, and I don\u0027t know what to do after that. because the docking autopilot is only useful for around 200m\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan someone help me?

Assuming MechJeb got the velocity relative to your target to 0 m/s, all you have to do is select target mode on the navballl by clicking on the velocity indicator, then point at your target and burn slightly, around to 20m/s. This is how it\u0027s done once you get into visual range, no more faffing about with maneuver nodes. Use time acceleration to get there faster, don\u0027t go so fast you lose control. Use RCS translation (IJKL) to correct your course. When you get suitably close, maybe around 30 seconds out from your encounter, turn your ship around to retrograde and burn to kill your relative velocity (or use RCS forward reverse thrust H/N if you are going slow enough). Be sure to take into account how long it takes to decelerate, or else you\u0027ll end up flying past it even colliding with your station before you know it. MechJeb\u0027s Smart ASS in TGT mode can help you with these maneuvers. Once you get close enough, you can select the docking port as the target and do the docking automatically or manually.
