In the paper, the fusion engine that the Supernova is based upon has a thrust of 67kn and an isp of 35,000sec(!). It is heavier than the Supernova, requires more power to start, and the heat rejection is pretty similar. It was also designed for continuous thrust, which doesn\u0027t work well in KSP. So the Supernova is more in line with the NASA counterpart but accounts for KSP\u0027s game limitations. I\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s underpowered. Compared to stock it has better ISP than the stock ion engine and far more thrust, and that\u0027s in NTR mode. ISP is through the roof in pulsed plasma mode as well. I\u0027m building the mod with stock in mind (and yes, I know that many people install a ton of mods, myself included). So if the engine doesn\u0027t stand up to engines in other mods you use, then by all means please feel free to edit the config files. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the larger centrifuge, I\u0027ll have to think about how to make that work. Maybe I can keep the Spindle and create a larger hub that lets you attach 2.5m parts.
