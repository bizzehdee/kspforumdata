The rover got trashed, and the driver thrown out. The driver is standing next to the rover, helmet lights still on. I can Right-Click on him, but all that shows is his EVA propellant level. I can\u0027t move him at all, he\u0027s completely unresponsive. Picture...\n\n![GFBPTJT.png](http://i.imgur.com/GFBPTJT.png)\n\nI put another rover into action on Kerbin, with Jeb onboard, and then made Jeb get off and stand next to the rover. I then exited the program and went and edited the Persistent file, comparing \u0022Doodton\u0022 (stranded on the Mun) to Jeb\u0027s settings, and I changed a few (true/false) settings ... but to no avail. I still can\u0027t get Doodton to move or respond. The rover on Mun shows as \u0027debris\u0027, and Doodton a \u0027part\u0027 in the debris listing. I\u0027m quite sure if I terminate the debris, Doodton will disappear.\n\nHow do I restore him?... I want to send a recovery mission and bring him home. Any ideas?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-21T03:10:02Z\u0022 title=\u002202/21/2015 03:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by LordFerret**"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-21T02:12:23Z","Content":"Oh, yeah, this is a bug.
