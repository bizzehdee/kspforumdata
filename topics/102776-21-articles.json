Sonnah follows Jools atmospheric curve **EXACTLY,** try entering Jool\u0027s atmosphere at 14km/s you\u0027ll find the exact same thing, your ship will explode from the friction caused by the reentry\n2. Gas giants have an **incredibly** thick atmosphere, you need to slow yourself down to a reasonable speed to reenter anyway, complaining that you explode when reentering an atmosphere at such incredible speeds is like complaining that the sun is too bright, it\u0027s just physics - not a bug\n3. Rotation speed of Sonnah is **ALOT** slower than any other body near it, it\u0027s even less than half the rotation speed of Jool.\n\nIf you have any suggestions please feel free to let me know, however saying that you want to be able to enter a gas giants atmosphere at 14km/s and be completely fine is like asking me to let you land on the Sun - and is not going to happen\n\nIn the next update Sonnah\u0027s GeeASL has been reduced to help initial escape from the system to other bodies, and this will also lower the speeds at which you orbit the giant, but that is the only change happening to Sonnah any time soon.
