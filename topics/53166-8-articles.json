If you are especially conservative with EVA fuel, you can land a Kerbal on Pol and lesser worlds (Such as Bop, Minmus, and Gilly), take off, reach orbit, and rendezvous with your spacecraft all on EVA fuel (and/or the spaceship\u0027s fuel for the rendezvous part). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. If your lander runs out of fuel before reaching orbit and is still on a trajectory that will smash you into the moon or planet you are above, you can save the Kerbals and some of your scientific data by having everyone abandon ship and going into Orbit assuming that less than about 500 m/s of Delta-V are still required to do so. Keep in mind that if you want to rescue multiple Kerbals, you can only control 1 at a time, so you will have to send one into a high suborbital trajectory, quickly switch to one of the others and do the same, then burn, taking turns between Kerbals, until they reach orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5.

Putting lots of engines at the back of a plane can cause you to need to put wider wings near the back. This can result in a vicious cycle of needing more engines to take off, more weight near the front in fuel to give it range, and bigger wings near the back to make it work. Ever had a plane where it seemed like even with the wings at the very back, it was still unstable? This is probably why. The solution is to put the engines near the middle. This also help dramatically with maneuverability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9. Putting fuel tanks near the front may seem like a good idea to move your CoM forward, however, the plane can easily become unstable when low on fuel if you do this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10.
