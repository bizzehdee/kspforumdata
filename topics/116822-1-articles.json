I tried to install some mods on the 1.0.4 version of KSP, and when I went to the VAB to check out my new parts, it was broken.

N o parts would be shown, texts were written through each other and the flag menu was blurred.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The only thing you can then do is exit the VAB. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe sad thing is that deleting the mod does not help. Going with a complete vanilla game would still have this broken VAB thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would need to reinstall KSP to actually get it working again.
