Usually, though, it\u0027s not so, because it\u0027s difficult and expensive to build very large engines. So the benefits of making the ultimate engine is very often outweighed by the savings of using less perfect, but cheaper hardware. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ksp engines are mostly grouped with one \u0022launch-class\u0022 and one \u0022vacuum-class\u0022 engine in each diameter size.

You could make a small engine almost as efficient as large engines but then they would cost just as much or more then there larger counterpart. Tolerances are much easier to hit on large parts because a .0001% error on a rhino is 1 mm where as the same tolerance on a terrior is 1 nm. Also larger engines get more complexity (cost) that is just not worth it to put in small engines. From real life fan blades from the 787 cost 60k apiece vs a DC9 at 2k. The blade on the 787 is 7.5% more efficient but you could never justify that extra cost on an engine that puts out 1/10th the power. The DC9 blades while 1/4th the size would cost about the same to produce (55k) because the materials are cheap the manufacturing is what is expensive.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-26T21:46:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t underestimate engine mass itself.
