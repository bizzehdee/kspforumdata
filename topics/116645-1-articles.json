The response from the US government would likely be to push harder into using homegrown tech like SpaceX and the like, while only using the Soyuz in the near term when absolutely necessary (so a reduction in scheduled flights) until the other efforts are ready.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo other than the funerals and a reduction in flights, not a whole lot would really be different.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T14:21:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt would be a major blow to Roscosmos and NASA alike. If it was a launcher failure I expect the ISS\u0027s current crew would carry on as normal, but it\u0027s very possible they\u0027d end up leaving the station empty if there was no vehicle ready for replacement crew to fly up in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it was a failure with the capsule affecting the safety of re-entry things are trickier. It\u0027s quite possible the ISS\u0027s current crew would end up with an extended stay until either the Soyuz was deemed safe again or another capsule was available. Fortunately plenty of ships and rockets can handle cargo resupply. I wonder if NASA might not try and push the Orion development ahead, then launch an empty Orion to the station to take the crew down. That could be launched on a Delta IV Heavy again, since it wouldn\u0027t need to be human-rated for the ascent.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"heng","CreatedById":126869,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T14:41:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs this a What-If thread or are you looking for new targets after sawing through Space X\u0027s struts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mazon Del","CreatedById":32991,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T14:42:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENow now heng, we all know that the struts were cut using Lockheed\u0027s laser, powered of course by their jealousy of the SpaceX successes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
