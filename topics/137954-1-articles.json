You can enjoy doing every manually, doing math again and again, try again and again to see if the rocket you have designed is able to fly, but why don\u0027t allow tools for those who don\u0027t want to do math, for those who want to design with modern tools, for those prefer to fly with automation. It\u0027s not cheating, it\u0027s just more optional possibilities to design and fly as you like and make the game attractive to more people.
