Once in orbit, Osiris is designed to stay there for an extremely long time. She can be used either as an unmanned tug, or as a full interplanetary ship with a crew complement of 12. She\u0027s been to Duna and Laythe so far, both times delivering payloads between 70 and 140 tons (140 tons to Laythe). On each trip she has had more than enough fuel to return home, even off-window if necessary. Her design is also very part-count conscious. Her design philosophy follows the concept of form following function, and if your goal is to carry your awesome ground base with 2 SSTO planes and a Kethane miner, why create unnecessary lag by having a 400 part interplanetary ship to get it all there? Osiris has all of the features and amenities one would expect from a long distance starship.

To that end it has proven very useful in ferrying single kerbals to orbiting stations, and it\u0027s low-gravity VTOL capability enable it to land on bodies that lack atmosphere, like Minmus or the Mun.

To that end, Osiris II uses fewer parts and is lighter as a result. Osiris I is certified Duna capable with a relatively large payload. Osiris II is virtually the same ship with some small improvements to lower part count and reinforce potential weak spots observed during the Duna shakedown run. Osiris II has only been to Minmus so far, but that trip was uneventful and proved that the ship\u0027s structure and propulsion systems are sound. Dock up your own payloads, and send her on her way. No exact dV calculations as in this playthrough I\u0027m not using Engineer or Mechjeb, but if you read her Duna mission profile above you\u0027ll see she has plenty for most trips around the Kerbol system. Once I have Osiris II home and dock up her Moho mission package, we\u0027ll see if she can reach the closest planet to the sun. Like Osiris I, Osiris II can be separated into her two main components: the primary habitable spaces and the engineering section. This makes her capable of serving as a long range, unmanned tug if the need arises.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also updated the crew module\u0027s launcher to be compatible with the Ra I-V reusable booster system. All boosters are equipped with parachute systems that will provide a safe landing so boosters can be recovered and reused. The central rocket of the crew module launcher is not intended for reuse, but it does have a probe core and plenty of dV to deorbit itself for a clean operational area when time comes to dock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is one warning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI swapped out the Ra X booster rocket that propelled the Osiris I\u0027s engine section into orbit with a much larger, scarier launch system. Osiris II\u0027s engine section comes in at roughly 100 parts, but with her launcher she\u0027s more like 800. On my PC, it only slowed down a little. This new launch system, however, has the bonus of being able to deliver Osiris to orbit without having to tap into the ship\u0027s main fuel tanks. This means, once her launch cradle is ditched, Osiris II\u0027s engine section is in a stable orbit with 100% fuel ready for your missions to other worlds. The launch cradle also has a probe core and enough dV to deorbit itself. I tested it at 100km x 100km and didn\u0027t even need to drop the last set of boosters. If you planned things right, you could easily use the final booster stage and launch cradle engine to shoot Osiris off to the Mun, or Minmus, or maybe past Kerbin\u0027s SOI to some other destination?

Over the past few days playing KSP I\u0027ve been developing a reusable, constant ferry operation to support a permanent Kerbal habitat on Laythe. The results are promising. I went from never making a working KSP plane in my life to developing a few SSTO\u0027s JUST for this operation. I\u0027ve included one, SSTO-3, in the craft files below. Using Osiris II (And her older, less advanced sibling Osiris I) to ferry modules, cargo, and personnel to Laythe, you can easily build and expand a large ground operation. Deliver a few SSTO\u0027s, ground rovers, short-hop jet planes, and you\u0027ve got yourself a LAYTHE CITY.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou go from bare necessities as a frontier outpost to straight up colonists. This is serious stuff guys.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you build a base using 1 of each modified module I provide, you\u0027ll have habitat space for 8 kerbals just in the hab module alone. You\u0027ll have fuel storage for refueling ops. You\u0027ll have a communications center for talking to ships in orbit, and ultimately calling home to Kerbin. And most importantly, you\u0027ll have a Kethane mining setup that\u0027ll keep those fuel tanks full. Combine this base setup with KAS and you\u0027re golden.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI cannot stress enough. Rune is awesome, his base is awesome, and it\u0027s awesomeness got me on this Laythe mindset. Once I realized Osiris II could take his full base system to Laythe and return for another load, it opened the door.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave fun kids. I\u0027ll be creating more base modules and stuff for the Kerbin -\u0026gt; Laythe architecture soon. These modules also all have their own propulsion systems, so you don\u0027t HAVE to go to Laythe. You could just as easily drop these bad boys on Duna or Eve. (Getting back off Eve is the fun part.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only downside, is that with all of this payload, expect LONG burn times. We\u0027re talking 24 minutes of burn to get Osiris out of Kerbin\u0027s SOI and on her Jool intercept. I did it in 4 6 minute sections, to try and get some Oberthy help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E.Crafts!

As per standard Osiris procedure, make sure fuel crossfeed is enabled. It\u0027s easier on the docking arms if all the weight of that fuel isn\u0027t there, and if you really want to drop these modules full you can always top them off with Osiris\u0027s fuel tanks. But it\u0027s a fuel tank. Whats the point of dropping a full fuel tank if you\u0027ve got a full fledge fuel refinery/production system on the ground? I would however leave SOME fuel in these tanks, so the engine systems can assist in the final landing if necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHabitat Section: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/jeuttxuqkrn194b/Base%20Hab%20Osiris%20Ready.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/jeuttxuqkrn194b/Base%20Hab%20Osiris%20Ready.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESame as above.

Thank you, thank you. She\u0027s decently stable, and her one turbojet makes asymmetric flameouts a problem of the past. She also has low-grav VTOL capability by using action group 4. If you have a refueling station over Kerbin, this makes it possible to SSTO to orbit, dock, refuel, and land on the Mun. She can make it back from the Mun on the one refuel. AMHIK. Typical SSTO ascent profile. Get off the ground, pitch to 45-50. Hold until your vertical speed is right around 100. Slowly level out to pick up as much speed as possible. Right at about .07 intake air, engage the rocket engines and throttle back to the turbojet after the initial flameout to keep her running. Once you start throttling down too much, kill the jet and throttle up. Burn to orbit. Should have PLENTY of fuel left once you\u0027re in orbit for docking and such.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Also, Mechjeb may appear in some screenshots, but is NOT on any of the .crafts.
