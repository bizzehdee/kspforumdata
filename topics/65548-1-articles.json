If I dump a tank at an orbit of 100km by 20km, the part just keeps orbiting Kerbin without ever reentering atmosphere, slowing down and hitting the ground. Instead, I get junk that flies through Kerbin atmosphere that I intended for reentry burn up or recovery that does so forever and ever UNLESS I manually switch to it, then all of a sudden the game starts enabling drag on this object.. It\u0027s not very realistic and takes me out of my experience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd not just experiencing drag, but keep simulating these objects after I assign actions to them and they proceed towards kerbin again. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEx: I build a rocket, and eject an SRB from it at an Apoapsis of 75km. I also attached a parachute to the SRB because I want to recover it later. So after I jettison it, the chutes are activated but were told to deploy at a higher air density/pressure. After I circularize, the SRBS reenter atmo and do exactly what I assigned the parachutes to do and lands softly in the water for recovery without me ever leaving the ship I jettisoned the part off of in the 1st place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESIMULATE the parts after they\u0027ve DECOUPLED! It\u0027s like these parts disappear after they\u0027ve been jettisoned and the game forgets about them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-12T13:13:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe game always provides only one physics simulation and that is the currently selected craft.
