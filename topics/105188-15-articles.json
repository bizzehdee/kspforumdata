Really enjoy playing it even without most of my favorite mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut there is still one very big disappointment:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- \u003Cstrong\u003EI really hoped big planets would get new biomes.\u003C/strong\u003E That\u0027s such a downside that they don\u0027t have this exploring potential like Mun and Minmus do. I understand there are mods which add biomes, but they\u0027re not widely supported by other science mods. If Squad had added new biomes to other planets that would be such a wonder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESmall disappointment is that there\u0027s still no reason to use different antennas except for their looks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"anarkhon","CreatedById":22469,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T17:06:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eonly two thoughts about 1.0:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-I love you Valentina!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Give back my mouse cursor!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"delder92663","CreatedById":138576,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T17:17:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022anarkhon\u0022 data-cite=\u0022anarkhon\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eonly two thoughts about 1.0:\u003Cp\u003E-I love you Valentina!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Give back my mouse cursor!\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI still havr my cursor.
