I read through the FAQ about doing so but in my profile next to the download button there is no option to transfer to steam... Can anyone help?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers, Simmaster666\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-19T13:56:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs I understand it that option only exists if you purchased before a certain date (not 100% sure what that date was, though, I believe it was around the time it first became available on Steam).
