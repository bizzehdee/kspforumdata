Now in my early career I only have the HG-5 antenna to use as a relay, however it doesn\u0027t seem to work: I\u0027ve launched a set in keo-stationnary orbit at an angle from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E so it always has signal, yet it doesn\u0027t seem to be able to transmit anything.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen my other probes are behind Kerbin and do not receive signal from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E anymore, my relay doesn\u0027t do anything even when there\u0027s a direct link between the two sats.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s the way it\u0027s set up now : \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/evgu8l9.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethe sat\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/igiUPwb.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eits orbit\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WanderingKid","CreatedById":110855,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-27T20:54:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat antenna do you have on the probe you\u0027re hoping to talk to the probe with the HG-5, and what level have you upgraded the tracking station to (that\u0027s mostly curiosity)?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShort form: The range is not 5million meters from the HG-5, it\u0027s a combination of two antennas.\u00A0 Your Hermes satellite is at 2.7m range.\u00A0 The average combination of an HG-5 relay and a Comm-16 antenna is ~1.5m.\u00A0\u00A0Your antenna is way too high.\u00A0 You want 3 of them ~500-600km up in my experience for the early comm net.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jashin","CreatedById":108901,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-27T22:07:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAh got it!

I had definitely not understood the square root part properly, it makes a lot more sense now. I also have tweaked down the antenna power in the difficulty option, which made it slightly more difficult to grasp the whole thing. I\u0027ve been playing for years but I had never used RemoteTech or anything like it before, it raises some new questions and challenges.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve now set up a tripod as well so I can have a constant signal from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E in low Kerbin orbit. It looks very cool in the map view and functions properly. I think I\u0027ve grasped the basics thanks to you, I can\u0027t wait to go bigger once I\u0027ll have interplanetary goals.
