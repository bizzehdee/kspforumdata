For starters, the fastest any object can move through a Source map without some hacking is about 115MPH. There\u0027s a hard cap built in, never a problem in any of Valve\u0027s games but it very quickly became one in Gmod once we figured out how to get our cars moving that fast. A plugin mod exists to remove this cap, using that makes the game rather prone to crashing from time to time. There\u0027s also an angular velocity speed cap, which when met, will cause wheels to spaz out/do really bizarre crap. Ever see a car suddenly fly up and hard left because it crested 74MPH? I\u0027ve had it happen to mine before, hit angvel cap on the wheels and physics just broke down. Constraints behave in silly ways, the map system is of course wholly unsuitable for KSP...and modding it is not easy. Unity is most certainly more modder friendly than Source, no doubt, and honestly I\u0027d use it for KSP before I used Source.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-11T02:24:38Z\u0022 title=\u002205/11/2016 02:24  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 11, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Kenobi McCormick\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Virtualgenius","CreatedById":67644,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-11T05:10:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou always had the best stuff lo-fi\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lo-fi","CreatedById":111099,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-11T08:39:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222574558\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002275938\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221462943413\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002267644\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Virtualgenius\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, Virtualgenius said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou always had the best stuff lo-fi\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks, it was always fun making it \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E When this is done I\u0027ll have a go at finishing\u00A0\u003Cspan style=\u0022line-height:1.6;\u0022\u003Esome of the bits I never got around to before, like the magnetic handler/loader.
