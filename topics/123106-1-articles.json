Especially ones that have landed on something. Maybe that being a requirement. Although I bet some people would like to also do this for orbits. The idea is to turn the ship into a single solid 1 part object with the visuals from where it was upon hitting the button. This allows landing and even crashes to be turned into lesser parts but saved as a place to visit later. The requirements could be to have no kerbals in the vessel. So they either have to get out and walk or get rescued or be dead. afterwords instead of recovering you can memorialize it into a laggless body that can be seen later in space. A new tab could be put in the game with debri and asteroids etc in the one bar to toggle on and off memorials in space. Although being low lag it may not do much. But could be good for clutter. Memorializing gets no money or science. Unless you recover it first. But it could possibly give a different resource. Maybe it gets added to the game somehow like for visting or tourism mission if they ever exist. But either way, the ship is sacrificed but made possible to stay indefinitely without causing lag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be an alternative to flags. But with your spaceship being turned into the flag. Upon memorializing, a popup could appear like the flag and let you type something in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeck it could even be in motion going into space so you could reproduce something like the voyager for fun. then possibly watch it fly out over time. It could be used for testing purposes then also. Assuming it helps to memorialize it of course over having it active. Maybe after it runs out of fuel and is to far away for solar panels and dies or something.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-15T19:24:01Z\u0022 title=\u002210/15/2015 07:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pandaman","CreatedById":130621,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-15T21:32:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EInteresting idea. And I can see how it would be a nice option. It would come in handy for converting a probe into a simple \u0027beacon\u0027 too. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I think they would need to allow some kind of interaction, in the same way that flags can be knocked over by a clumsy pilot, or can be taken down, especially if they are to remain in orbit.
